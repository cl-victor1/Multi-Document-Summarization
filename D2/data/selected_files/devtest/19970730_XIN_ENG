<HEADLINE> US Wage Pressures Remain Moderate in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Wages and benefits paid to
American workers rose by a moderate 0.8 percent in the April-June
quarter, the latest signal that inflation in the U.S. labor market
remains moderate, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase followed a 0.6 percent rise in the first quarter
this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that second quarter increase in total
compensation costs included a 0.8 percent rise in wages and
salaries that compared with a 0.9 percent rise in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Benefit costs rose by 0.6 percent in the second quarter
following a barely perceptible 0.1 percent rise in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months ending June, overall compensation costs in
the U.S. rose by 2.8 percent, down slightly from the 2.9 percent
increase in the 12 months ending June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The wages portion of the compensation package rose by 3.2
percent in the past 12 months in the country while benefit costs
increased by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase was in line with analysts' expectations.
Economists have said that the absence of wage pressures while
unemployment dipped to 4.8 percent in the spring -- the lowest
level since 1973 -- was one of the most remarkable aspects of an
economic expansion that already is the third longest in history.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be
content to leave rates alone for some time to come.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Corrupt PNA Officials Demanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian legislative panel
today urged President Yasser Arafat to dismiss his cabinet and put
senior officials on trial for suspected corruption.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Shuabi, a legislator and a member of the panel, said
violations had been found in all 18 Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) ministries involving a large number of high-ranking
officials, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended charges be filed against specific
ministers, whose names have not to be released. But Shuabi said
that worst mismanagement was found in the Civil Affairs Ministry,
headed by Jamil Tarifi, and Planning Ministry, led by Nabil
Sha'ath.
</P>
<P>
Civil Affairs Ministry officials reportedly interfered with the
collection of customs duties and improperly influenced the
allocation of foreign donations, and the Planning Ministry
intervened in the distribution of foreign grants. The PNA has so
far received about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars from international
donors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Health Ministry officials were found to have
knowingly purchased medicines which had passed expiration dates.
</P>
<P>
In its report that has been turned over to Arafat, the panel
specifically accused the authority of failing to follow up on
reports of mismanagement by ministers and other officials.
</P>
<P>
It strongly requested Arafat to dismiss those high-ranking
officials suspected of corruption and put them on trial.
</P>
<P>
The investigating panel was formed in response to the audit
report published on May 24 by PNA's Auditing Office, which said
323 million dollars, or nearly half of PNA's 866-million-dollar
1997 budget, had been lost due to corruption or mismanagement by
ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Shuabi said the figure was exaggerated, and the State
Attorney's Office would give an accurate number after its own
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Pioneers New Postal System in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Post
Corporation (TPC) has launched the EMS Track and Trace System
which will facilitate communications between Tanzania and other
parts of the world, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first country is Africa and the sixth in the world
to use this system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony at the New Post Office
building here Monday, Benedict Kaperage, the Assistant
Postmaster, said the rapid growth of technology and communication
in the business sector has made it necessary for postal
administration to improve its services.
</P>
<P>
According to Kaperage, the Universal Postal Union Bureau, in
implementing the Washington General Action plan signed in
February 1993, established a global telecommunication network
(Post Net) to facilitate a tracking and tracing of international
mail and particularly EMS items.
</P>
<P>
Kaperage said that the track and trace system was designed
under the International Postal System (IPS '96) to facilitate the
international mail dispatch, documentation and receipt.
</P>
<P>
"Other value added services ordered include Post Star, a
communication software used to exchange track and trace
information with postal partners over Post Net," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The TPC future plans include the extension of the Post Net
facility to the all regional centers as well as to enable users
to track their own items via Internet on Worldwide Web Site," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Chris Harrison, the Manager of Applications, Development and
Support of Universal Post Union company based in Switzerland,
said that he believed in the new system of postal services which
the TPC was adopting through its EMS.
</P>
<P>
Harrison said that by using the system, items were recorded in
Tanzania and information was sent to their destinations via Post
Net when the items were received and dispatched from the exchange
office.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the World Bank is among the financiers
which facilitated the project while the Universal Postal Union
(UPU), through its EDI-Unit, has played a great advisory role.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of workplace deaths rose
sharply in Britain this year, which is causing serious concern to
the government funded Health and Safety Executive (HSE), Financial
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional figures, 302 workers were killed in
accidents in the year to March, compared with 258 in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number was particularly high among the
self-employed, which jumped to 83 from 49. Deaths in manufacturing
rose from 42 to 57.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths in agriculture was also high, rising from
45 in the previous year to 63. The injury rate for agricultural
workers rose from 8 percent per 100,000 to 11.1, mainly because of
deaths of self-employed people.
</P>
<P>
Angela Eagle, environment minister, said she shared the concern
at the figures and promised a higher profile for health and safety
as part of the government's commitment to worker protection.
</P>
<P>
HSE Director-General Jenny Bacon said that the HSE will improve
safety management in the industry and will be conducting blitzes
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> 36 S. Leonean Troops Killed in Clashes with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six Sierra Leonean soldiers
were killed in two separate clashes with the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) at Lungi International Airport in
the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports today, ten of the soldiers
were killed during the first clash on June 2, when Nigerian
gunships bombarded Freetown in a bid to restore President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah's civilian government toppled in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 were killed and several others injured during
the second incident which occurred between July 9 and 13, the
Vanguard said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 20 Sierra Leonean soldiers were held as war
prisoners during the skirmishes, a newspaper reported, quoting an
ECOMOG officer, Lt.-Col. Amnon Kwaskebe as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another ECOMOG officer at the airport, Col. Maxwell Khobe,
denied reports that ECOMOG troops were driven out of the airport
or about 100 troops died from both sides,
</P>
<P>
"We are here and you should tell Nigerians that we are
maintaining our positions and there is no cause for panic," Khobe
said.
</P>
<P>
The airport had been very quiet since the last clash on July
13, when soldiers loyal to the military junta attempted to locate
an anti-military government radio station alleged to be in the
airport.
</P>
<P>
On the casualties recorded by ECOMOG, Col. Khobe declined to
give any specific figure but stressed that "during the two
incidents, ECOMOG recorded the lowest casualties since its
operation in the area."
</P>
<P>
Under worldwide condemnation, the military junta has agreed to
open dialogue with its west African neighbors for peaceful
settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, made up of Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire, had a meeting with a Sierra
Leonean government delegation two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, held in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, a cease-fire
was reached between the two parties. A second meeting is expected
to open today in Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
West African countries have repeatedly made public their
stance that the ousted Kabbah government should be restored and
the military junta should practise an early hand-over.
</P>
<P>
Although ECOMOG has lifted its blockade of roads to Freetown,
but supply of drugs and foodstuffs have been cut off to the
seaports and airports.
</P>
<P>
Famine and epidemic of alarming proportions have been reported
in the troubled country.

BEIRUT, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese guerrillas today carried
out a series of attacks on Israeli occupation forces and its proxy
militia in south Lebanon, and no casualties have been reported by
security sources.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli army confirmed that two mines
planted by guerrillas exploded beside an Israeli patrol in
Western Beqaa, destroying an military vehicle, and denied that
any casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources in the area said that guerrillas of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired mortars and
Katyusha rockets at the Israeli position of Dabsheh at noon
today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces carried out an immediate revenge and bombarded
the guerrilla position in Western Beqaa from where the guerrilla
attack was launched.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes raided Hezbollah strongholds in Iglim
Al-Toffah Monday afternoon, the 47th air attack since beginning of
this year, in retaliation for attacks by Hezbollah militants in
the buffer zone set up by the Jewish state in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Beirut's As-Safir daily today, a top officer of the
fundamentalist Hezbollah vowed that having "proper channels" to
get more Katyusha rockets, his party will continuously use them
against Israeli forces occupying the 1,100-square-kilometer
border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Katyusha is the longest-range weapon Hezbollah has, but a
cease-fire understanding Lebanon and Israel reached in April, 1996
said that it should not be used to attack targets inside the
Israeli borders.

giant Sasol has taken part in joint ventures with two north
American firms for tapping oil in neighboring Mozambique, it was
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The Sasol Group said its international petroleum exploration
and production subsidiary, Sasol Petroleum International (SPI),
had formed an alliance with two north American oil groups, the
Los Angeles-based Arco International Oil and Gas Company, and the
Vancouver-listed Zarara Petroleum Resources, to undertake further
oil and gas exploration in Mozambique.

<P>
SPI would acquire a 47.62 percent interest in three proposed
projects in Mozambique which were jointly held under a technical
evaluation agreement between Arco and Zarara, maintaining
participation interests of 47.62 percent and 4.76 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, Arco would be the operator in all
the three projects, with SPI taking over three to six years after
the first sale of commercial gas or oil.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposed joint venture was still subject to the
approval of the government of Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government To Fund Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Ministry has
decided to allocate 16 million U.S. dollars for infrastructure
development of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories,
according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The treasury today submitted a request to the Knesset
(Parliament) Finance Committee for approval. This request followed
an approval Monday by the committee of 25.5 million dollars in the
settlement building in West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parliament members, Avraham Shohat and Haim Ramon,
sharply protested the move, saying that the money will be drawn
from the country's general reserve and funds earmarked for new
immigrant housing, handicap and Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
Science Minister Rafael Eitan responded that it would be
impossible to reach a permanent solution with the Palestinians
without a national consensus on the right for Jewish settlements
to develop.
</P>
<P>
Intensive construction has unfolded in West Bank, including
East Jerusalem, since the Likud-led rightwing government came to
power a year ago. A total of 1,082 housing units in six
settlements have been authorized for this year.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's decision came two days after the Housing
Ministry Sunday claimed that no government sponsored construction
had been authorized since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hagit Ya'ari, spokeswoman of Peace Now group, charged Sunday
that all construction, whether private or government sponsored,
drains money that could be put to use in development towns and
poor neighborhoods in Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Yechiel Leiter, spokesman for the Jewish settlement
organization, said that "it is a disgrace that the current
government, which placed construction in the territories at the
top of its agenda, hasn't allowed one government sponsored
building to be constructed since the beginning of the year."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today urged
the Russian military to back the on-going military reform, which he
said would greatly advance the country's defense.
</P>
<P>
"I believe you will support the reform and you will actively
take part in it," the president said in an address to the troops
released by his press office.
</P>
<P>
This is the second presidential address on the military reform
within a week.
</P>
<P>
In his Friday weekly radio address, Yeltsin expressed his
determination to implement the reform plan, which includes a cut
of more than one third of the troops to 1.2 million by 1999 and a
restructuring of units.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged in the address to improve the living of
soldiers and officers, reiterating that all arrears to the
military will be paid off by September 1.
</P>
<P>
"All issues concerning the armed forces will be at the center
of my attention every day," said Yeltsin in the capacity as both
president and commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had thought for a long time about pushing forward
reform to save the army from loose discipline, low efficiency. But
it was not until early this month that he formally initiated the
reform by signing four presidential decrees.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports All Efforts to Push Forward Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 29 (Xinhua) - King Hussein of Jordan here today
underlined the importance to spare no efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process, after holding talks with visiting
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The king affirmed the necessity to overcome the obstacles
facing the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations as well as the
policies and practices hindering the peace process, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
Levy briefed Hussein on his latest talks with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The close-door meeting was also attended by Jordanian Crown
Prince Hassan and other senior officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
During Levy's meeting with Jordanian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Fayez Tarawneh this morning, both sides decided to open a
direct channel between the two sides in addition to the normal
diplomatic channel to keep bilateral dialogue open on all issues
of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to local press reports, Levy came here to
persuade Jordan to establish a Jordanian-Palestinian united
kingdom with all the Palestinian territories included in the
map, but no details were given.
</P>
<P>
Levy came to Jordan after Israel and the Palestinians decided
to resume peace talks following a series of high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been deadlocked for more than
four months since Israel started to build Jewish settlements in
Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Jordan along with Egypt and the United states has been working
to salvage the stalled peace process by mediating between the
Palestinians and Israel, but they have failed to produce any
positive results as Israeli government stuck to its hardline
policy towards the peace march.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Makes Proposals on Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has made proposals to the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on resolving the issue of missing persons, left over from
Turkey's invasion of the island in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told reporters today
that the proposals were passed over during the two leaders'
meeting last Monday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing after Turkey landed more than 30,000 troops on this
eastern Mediterranean island and took over one third of it in the
north following a pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said Clerides and Denktash met on Monday without
presence of advisors at the residence of the U.N. special envoy
Gustave Feissel, in the U.N.-controlled Nicosia airport area.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders' concentrated on clearly humanitarian
issues and examined various aspects of the issue of missing
persons. "Some proposals were made which might lead to a solution
or progress of the problem."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side is obliged to response to the
proposals, he added.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between Clerides and Denktash since
their first round of face-to-face negotiation earlier this month
near New York under the U.N. sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
The Monday meeting was proposed by the president to deal with
humanitarian issues, which constitute an important aspect of the
protracted Cyprus problem. Another meeting on this subject is
scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether to exhume remains of those killed, the
spokesman said this issue is substantial and if solved, it will
provide the most convincing evidence on the fate and identity of
those missing.
</P>
<P>
Christofides stressed that this means the graves of both Greek
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will be opened.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides supports the view that graves should be
opened up to properly ascertain the fate of the missing, the
spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> US Offers 200 Million Dollars to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian private sector will
receive 200 million U.S. dollars in grant from the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) under an agreement signed here
today.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, U.S. Ambassador here Edward Walker
said at a press conference the U.S. aid to Egypt will continue and
cooperation between the two countries is in progress for the
interest of development and economic reform in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The grant, falling within the framework of the USAID Commodity
Program for the Assistance of Private Sector in Egypt, reflects
partnership between Egypt and the U.S. for the sake of economic
growth and development, said Walker.
</P>
<P>
"The program aims at assisting Egyptian private sector to get
what it needs of equipment, commodities necessary for promoting
its performance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Planning and International
Cooperation Zafir el-Bishri also said "Egyptian-U.S. relations are
a very good example of cooperation and friendship between
countries."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 years, the USAID program supplied to Egypt
equipment estimated at as much as 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of scrapping U.S. aid to Egypt heightened as the
U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee recommended in early June
to end allocations for Egypt totalling 2.1 billion dollars in 1998
while maintaining Israel's 3 billion dollars grant and creating a
250 million dollars fund for Jordan. The move was the first of its
kind since Egypt and Israel signed the U.S.-brokered Camp David
peace accords in 1978.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic assistance to Egypt amounted to 21 billion dollars
between 1975 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> UK to Suffer Huge loss From Housing Benefit Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The British government may be
losing nearly 1.6 billion US dollars a year because of the housing
benefit fraud, according to studies by the Audit Commission and
the National Audit Office (NAO) released here today.
</P>
<P>
Identified fraud losses have quadrupled in the 1990s to 88
million US dollars, but the studies suggest the true cost may be
about 1,448 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts argue that complexities in the benefit system
create many opportunities for fraud, which is easy to commit but
difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of fraud occurs when claimants fail to notify
the authorities of changed circumstances, but it is difficult to
distinguish deliberate fraud from genuine mistakes by vulnerable
claimants who do not understand the rules.
</P>
<P>
The Audit Commission says an effective defense against fraud
and error is sound administration of housing benefit. But few
councils have an effective anti-fraud culture and the national
framework encourages investigation after fraud has occurred rather
than promoting measures to prevent or deter it.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Social Security has implemented anti-fraud
measures, while the number of local authority staff tackling fraud
has increased significantly since an NAO report on housing benefit
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The NAO calls for a simpler system, more frequent reviews of
awards and better cooperation between the Benefits Agency and
local authorities.

<HEADLINE> Pound Slides Over Fears for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The pound slumped on the foreign
exchange markets today as concern grew that the British government
might intervene to stem the recent surge in sterling.
</P>
<P>
Hit by gloom over the UK's export prospects, sterling lost 3.1
cents against the US dollar and 4.5 pfennigs against the Deutsche
mark to close in London at 1.634 dollars and 3.014 marks
respectively.
</P>
<P>
City experts said the pound's fall reflected a real risk that
Chancellor Gordon Brown may try to talk down the pound after
weekend pleas from business and unions for the government to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, the pound has risen by 24 percent against a
trade-weighted basket of currencies, causing UK manufacturers
great losses.
</P>
<P>
Last week, in a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey,
manufacturers reported the sharpest deterioration in their export
prospects since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Another CBI survey showed new export orders for the UK's small
and medium-sized companies dropping at the fastest rate in six
years.
</P>
<P>
Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, said,
"It's hard to find evidence that sterling's recent rally is a
measure of some kind of UK economic renaissance. Therefore, at
some point, sterling had to fall."
</P>
<P>
Economists here have become increasingly nervous that the UK
might slide into recession next year as consumer spending
generates inflation and the trade balance deteriorates.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Population Getting Older </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Canada's working-age population is
greying, and there are more seniors than ever before, Statistics
Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The number of seniors has more than doubled in the past 25
years," the federal statistics agency said in releasing the second
of 11 analyses of the 1996 census data.
</P>
<P>
The census counted 3,527,800 people aged 65 and over, up 11.3
percent from 1991, and double the increase recorded for the
population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Canadians aged 65 and over grew to make up 12.2 percent of its
population in 1996, compared with 11.6 percent in 1991 and 8.1
percent in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Canada had a population of 28,846,761 people on May 14, 1996,
when the last census was conducted.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive five-year period, Canada had
slightly more children under 15. The census counted 5,901,300
children, up 3.7 percent from 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, children made up 20.5 percent of Canada's total
population, down from 29.6 percent in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The median age of Canadians, the age at which half the
population is older and half is younger, has also climbed almost
two years since 1991.
</P>
<P>
For the 14.67 million women, the median age in 1996 was 36.1.
For the 14.17 million men, the median age was 34.5.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Fisherman Found Guilty in Infecting Lover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Cypriot fisherman was
found guilty today after a three-month trial by a local court of
knowingly passing on AIDS virus to his British lover.
</P>
<P>
Pavlos Georgiou, 40, from the Ayia Napa southern coastal
resort, now faces a maximum two-year imprisonment and a fine of
1,500 Cyprus pounds (about 3,000 U.S. dollars) for knowingly
infecting his British lover Janette Pink with the AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome) virus during a two-year love
affair on the island.
</P>
<P>
The court said it will sentence Georgiou Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In rendering his decision, Famagusta District Court Judge
Antonis Liatsos said throughout the affair Georgiou did not tell
Pink he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
Pink, 45, a mother of two from Basildon, England, accused
Georgiou of failing to use condoms in their sexual contacts and of
keeping his illness a secret from her.
</P>
<P>
During her testimony, Pink told the court she fell in love
with Georgiou during a visit to Cyprus in 1994.
</P>
<P>
She said Georgiou told her his wife Martha died of Leukemia
despite that fact that Martha died of AIDS in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Pink returned to Britain in 1996 with HIV-positive where she
was soon admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Georgiou was the first person on the island to be charged with
knowingly passing on AIDS virus to another person. His trial is
seen here as a test case whether allegations that an HIV carrier
can be convicted on charges of transmitting the virus.
</P>
<P>
The fisherman was prosecuted under a 50-year-old British
colonial law designed to combat the spread of cholera and
typhoid. Cyprus gained independence from the British colonial
rule in 1960.

DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Cabinet endorsed today
an agreement signed with the World Bank on a new arrangement of
paying its debts to the financial institution.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulating a refunding timetable was reached
between the Syrian government and Kamal Darwish, vice president of
the World Bank for Middle East and North Africa affairs during his
four-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
Economic sources said Syria's outstanding debts to the Bank,
which amount to 415 million U.S. dollars, have been re-scheduled
and are to be settled in easy annual payments, in accordance with
the new timetable.
</P>
<P>
They said implementation of the agreement reflects Syria's
desire to resolve its overdue debts in order to obtain fresh loans
from the bank.
</P>
<P>
Syria failed over the past two years to honor its commitment to
pay a bi-monthly instalment of 6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> London to Get Elected Mayor at Turn of Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- London, the only European major
city without a governing body, will get an elected mayor, British
Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott announced today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Prescott said the government planned to
reintroduce an elected assembly which could coordinate policy
across London, the largest city in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We want the mayor to be a dynamic chief executive, a mover and
shaker," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prescott said that after a three-month consultation exercise,
the government will announce the final details of how the mayor
will be elected.
</P>
<P>
The final plans will have to be approved in a city-wide
referendum next May. The new mayor -- who would not have to be
British, only a long-term London resident -- will probably take up
his or her post in time for the turn of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished
the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1986 as part of her campaign
to break the political left and sold the GLC headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Critics say Thatcher's abolition of the GLC shifted control to
central government, leaving the capital's voters without a say in
how the city is run.
</P>
<P>
The small City of London financial district, based on the
original capital, has its own Lord Mayor.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Talks Start Amid Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A second round of talks between
A Sierra Leone junta delegation and the ECOWAS states Began today
in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with the former charging that Nigerian
troops im Freetown are committing acts of provocation.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Secretary-general Colonel Abdul Sesay in
a state radio broadcast in Freetown today. Sesay also accused
Nigeria of ''continuing a massive build-up of troops airlifted
from Liberia to Sierra Leone''.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian troops are arriving from Liberia to Sierra Leone in
their hundred every two days at the international airport to
reinforce their group already stationed there,'' Sesay Claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that last Saturday, Nigerian troops manning a
checkpoint 17 miles to the capital ''refused passage to a
contingent of Sierra Leone army troops heading to Freetown from
the interior''.
</P>
<P>
We had to instruct the group to use a round-about route to
come to the capital so as to "avoid a confrontation which would
have led to the losses of lives of both civilian and soldiers'',
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sesay, a strongly worded protest has been
dispatched to Nigerian leader Sani Abacha through Ivorian
President Konan Bedie urging him to ''restrain Nigeria from its
bloodthirsty intention of wanting only to kill our peaceful
citizens and destroying our beloved city of Freetown''.
</P>
<P>
''We register our protest about the landing of more troops by
Nigeria at our international airport but it was never broadcast.
We appeal to them to do justice to the image they have created
over the years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The military junta staged a coup in May to topple the
legitimate government led by President Tejan Kabbah. The Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held the coup illegal
and wants the junta to renounce power and re-install Kabbah in
the government.
</P>
<P>
Four ECOWAS foreign ministers are empowered to hold talks with
the junta and this was the second round of talks on that matter.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the growing tension between Nigerian
troops stationed in Sierra Leone and Sierra Leone forces is
gradually reaching a boiling point and will possibly lead to an
outbreak of fighting.

from 17 countries is ''the African Girl Child, Her Future
Employment Prospects and the Challenges Ahead''.
</P>
<P>
''The majority of micro-entrepreneurs in Africa are women,''
said Dear, adding, ''but these key economic agents have been
denied access to modern banking services.''
</P>
<P>
The women, she said, would benefit as the initiative was
targeted at those in the lowest income groups.
</P>
<P>
Dear said the initiative would allow women to increase their
income and accumulate capital through macro-loans and savings.
</P>
<P>
The bank, she said, would leverage its limited funds by
investing in the most promising micro-finance institutions
particularly those with the greatest potential to reach large
numbers of disadvantaged populations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dear urged governments, non-governmental
organizations and civil society to do more to ensure a bright
future for the African girl.

</P>
<P>
He made the statement after a 30-minute meeting with Cypriot

<HEADLINE> Arafat Dampen Expectations Over Renewal Of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today said that the planned renewal of the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel may lead no where.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
according to the state-run Israel Television, Arafat said that
the negotiating committee had been agreed upon months before and
the negotiations may not lead anywhere.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi also seemed
pessimistic about the prospect. She told reporters that the
negotiations lack credibility and legality and substance because
of continued Israeli violations of signed agreements between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
Particularly, Ashrawi emphasized that confidence has been eroded
by construction of Jewish settlements and illegal annexation of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in Jerusalem Monday afternoon, Palestinian
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath
and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy reached an agreement
that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks would resume within days
at the committee level, with a mandate to deal with practical
issues. The nine committees appointed by the two sides will
resume their work this week.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating teams have first of all to remove some major
outstanding stumbling blocks before any tangible progress is
made. The Palestinian side demands a halt of the construction of
Har Homa settlements in Arab East Jerusalem while the Israelis
want an increased security cooperation on the part of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed in January, the two sides
agreed on nine committees to be overseen by a central joint
steering committee. The nine committees deal with safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Airport, sea port, civil
affairs, bridges, legal affairs, security issues, economic issues
and people to people contacts.

<HEADLINE> African Young Entrepreneurs Academy to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The African Federation of Women
Entrepreneurs will launch a young entrepreneurs academy for its
45 member countries in October to create employment for youths,
Secretary General Lucia Quachey said today.
</P>
<P>
In her opening address at a four-day seminar on the girl child
in Harare, Quachey said self-employment and entrepreneurship were
the key to survival in the face of mass retrenchments and growing
poverty resulting from structural adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
''There can be no empowerment without income,'' she said,
adding, ''so there is need for an initiative that will ensure
that future generations not only inherit the wealth we create,
but also create employment.''
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Quachey said, 60 youths from member states
would be sent to the U.S. for a six-month trainers course after
which they would train others in their respective home countries
for three months.
</P>
<P>
The trainees would then be mentored by entrepreneurs in an
industrial estate for a year before they established their own
businesses.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appeals for Support for Military Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today urged
the Russian Armed Forces to back military reform, saying the task
of the army is "martial deeds only," according to the Itar-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing servicemen of the Armed Forces, Yeltsin said the
main directions of the military reform are heralded by a number of
his decrees, and Russia's future in the next century and the next
millennium to a great extent depends on the realization of the
military reform.
</P>
<P>
As the commander-in-chief, Yeltsin meanwhile assured the Armed
Forces that the transformations in the army are targeted at
qualitative improvement of defense might of this country.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover," he said, "unless this reform is carried through,
Russia's security cannot be reliably ensured in the future."
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out the importance of creating compact,
mobile Armed Forces provided with modern weapons in line with the
motto of Alexander Suvorov "to defeat by skills rather than
number."
</P>
<P>
The scope of a military might of a country should conform to
the existing and foreseeable military and political situation and
economic possibilities of a state, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming reduction of the army personnel,
Yeltsin said, "Before cuts in the army began, organizational and
financial conditions would be stipulated."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to qualitatively improve the life of
servicemen and restore the former prestige of the army and respect
to it in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Italy Fails in Somali Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu's political arena has
been shaky today after the mission of the Italian Special Envoy
to Somalia, Giuseppe Cassini, failed in its effort to end
disputes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Italy has been involved in a six months long political
maneuvers in drawing close the political views of Mogadishu's
opposing factions.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Under Secretary of State, Rino Serri, who has been
visiting Mogadishu today has not succeeded in meeting jointly
with Mogadishu's political faction leaders following a dispute
over the representation criteria of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu faction leader, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his
Sodare group said that the meeting should be discussed for
agreeing the convening of a national reconciliation conference
while his counterpart, Hussien Aidid's faction proposed that the
first thing to do is to solve the regional problems.
</P>
<P>
The high level delegation led by Serri has today been received
by officials from the faction led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed at Issaley
airstrip, 15 Km North of the capital, where the security has been
tightened with the collaboration of an Italian security team
supervised by General Luke Raiola that came prior to the visit of
Mr Serri.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Mogadishu Serri met with members from the
National Salvation Council established in Sodare of Ethiopia led
by Ali Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Mr Serri told the factions that the roots of Somalia's crisis
may also be traced back to the behavior of the international
community which gives the Somalis the right to demand for help
from the same International community. "To this end, Italy is
ready and willing to do her part," said Mr Serri.
</P>
<P>
Mr Serri has urged the Somali factions not to miss the
opportunity of accepting the task bestowed upon him by his
government for more than a year now in restoring its unitary
state at peace with itself and with its neighbors so as to
attract international recognition.
</P>
<P>
Serri said his government will work with the Somalis in
re-establishing its ties with the European Union and may become
party in the Lome convention for the quick rehabilitation and
development of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with the Italian delegation, Ali Mahdi has
accused Hussein Aidid for not implementing the Cairo
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi has emphasized that no regional authority could be
established for Benadir region (Mogadishu) unless a national
reconciliation conference is held for all the factions of
Somalia, an idea contrary to the position of his main rival,
Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Italian delegation has also met the civic society of
Mogadishu where about a hundred people were invited for a
lunch at Ramadan hotel.
</P>
<P>
Serri told the civic society representatives if the current
anarchy continues in Somalia, this country will be a center in
which terrorists will reside and all illegal drug trafficking,
weapons and ammunition will pass through to other parts of the
world.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Privatization in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today asked African politicians to sensitize people that
privatization is good and necessary for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a business luncheon in the capital, President
Chiluba said privatization is the best solution to the
continent's ailing economies.
</P>
<P>
"Our politicians have a role to convince the people that
privatization is good for economic growth. It does not mean
selling the country but instead leads to economic recovery and
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told the businessmen that the continent has tremendous
resources and enjoys a comparative advantage to other continents
but bad policies have plunged it into economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
"Since I took office in 1991, we have been preaching
privatization, liberalization and deregulation. I'm proud that I
have presided over successful privatization so far.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way to do away with dependence on outside
charity which is an embarrassment. We need to devise good
policies and phase out ailing parastatals which only subsidize
the lifestyles of managers who then live in extravagance," said
the Zambian president.
</P>
<P>
He said at independence, Zambia had a more sound economy than
Malaysia, but the situation is different now with the latter
being one of the Asian economic tigers.
</P>
<P>
"If in Asia they have moved that far, what is holding us back
in Africa? Certainly, it is wrong policies." he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also called on Tanzanian businessmen to come and
invest in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care where money comes from. Whether it is Ugandans,
Tanzanians, Americans or British, what I want is money and
creation of employment for my people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said what Africa needs now is to put things right,
providing the best framework within which investors could operate
and would automatically regain the investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was jointly organized by the Tanzania Chamber of
Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (TCCIA) and the
Confederation of Tanzanian Industrialists (CTI).
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba left for Zanzibar in the afternoon and will
wind up his three-day state visit tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Investment Plan Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Asia and Europe furthered their
economic cooperation when an investment promotion plan was
finalized today in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 25 Asian and European countries agreed on
the plan after two days of meetings and discussions. The plan will
be submitted for endorsement to the Asia-Europe Summit Meeting
(ASEM) Economic Ministers Meeting slated for September in Japan,
according to an ASEM Government and Private Sector Working Group
press release received here.
</P>
<P>
The investment promotion plan was proposed by Thailand when the
inaugural Asia-Europe Summit was held in Bangkok in March last
year. It is the result of 12 months of consultation among business
people and government officials of the ASEM countries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM partners believe that the plan is to be the first
tangible initiative arising from the strengthening process of
dialogue and cooperation between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of the plan is to increase two-way
investment flows between the two continents through enhancing the
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the investment promotion plan will start,
said the press release, from information exchange via the
Internet. High-level dialogues will then follow to deal with
investment policies and regulations.
</P>
<P>
At its initial meeting in Bangkok, the ASEM forged a new
comprehensive Asia-Europe Partnership for Greater Growth between
the 15 European Union nations and Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam in Asia.

<HEADLINE> African Farmers Urged to Take on Intensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agriculture Minister D.
Mbela today called on African farmers to take on intensive
production through irrigation, improved crop husbandry and high
yielding crop varieties to ensure food security in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking at the closing ceremony of the
international course on vegetable crop production and extension
held today at Kibwezi, about 170 kilometers south of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He noted that growing population and limited production area
in the continent had made it necessary to intensify production to
increase yields per unit area.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official pointed out that the African continent had
continued to seek food aid from the international community even
though it had enough land resources.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through improved farming methods that we shall
realize food self-sufficiency," the minister told the course
attended by 25 participants from Kenya, Eritrea, Seychelles,
Uganda, Botswana, Tanzania and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the training course sponsored by Israeli experts,
Mbela said that emphasis should be placed on staff training to
expose them to the most modern techniques of horticultural
production.
</P>
<P>
He urged the governments of neighboring countries in the
region to sponsor trainees to learn the dryland farming
techniques as a means to increase food production.
</P>
<P>
In Kibwezi, a demonstration farm which was set up in 1991 on
the basis of the cooperation between the governments of Kenya and
Israel has turned the semi-arid land of the region into lush
greenery owing to modern irrigation technologies.
</P>
<P>
The farm which is located in semi-arid area can now grow
vegetables, food crops and various kinds of fruits for local
consumption and export.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a local extension service was set up in order to
disseminate the knowledge which has been accumulated in the farm.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 600 farmers in the area have benefitted from the
professional support of this extension service.
</P>
<P>
In order to share this know-how with other African countries,
it was decided to conduct courses in vegetable crop production
and extension.

<P>
AMMAN, July 29 (Xinhua) - King Hussein of Jordan and visiting
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak here today underlined the
necessity to spare no efforts to push forward the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks after holding talks at Queen Ali
International Airport after Mubarak arrived from an official visit
in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on the latest developments of the peace
process and the means to overcome the obstacles hindering it,
according to Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The king briefed Mubarak on his meeting today with visiting
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who agreed with Jordan to
to open a direct channel between the two sides to keep bilateral
dialogue open on all issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak briefed Hussein on his meeting with Syrian President
Hafez Al-Assad earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Egyptian and Jordanian-Egyptian summits and the
visit by Israeli foreign minister to Jordan are seen here as
follow-ups of efforts to salvage the peace process which has been
stalled since March when Israeli government started to build the
Har Homa Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators agreed to resume
peace talks at the committee level this week. But the Palestinian
and Arab leaders have warned against optimism of the renewal of
the peace talks as they have seen no sign of concession from the
Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand a halt of of the construction of the
Har Homa project while the Israelis want an increased security
cooperation on the part of the Palestinians to check the violence
in some West Bank cities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Chadian Occupation of Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today denied that Chadian
rebels have occupied three Nigerian islands in northeast
Nigeria's Borno State bordering Chad.
</P>
<P>
The Borno administration's security apparatus, "Operation
Zaki", has always provided a check against incursions into
Nigerian territory by Chadian rebels, said defense spokesman Col.
Godwin Ugbo.
</P>
<P>
The acting director of defense information was speaking in
reaction to reports alleging the occupation of three Nigerian
islands by rebels loyal to ousted Chadian head of state Hussein
Habre.
</P>
<P>
The reports of the incursion probably stemmed from the unclear
delimitation of the country's border with Chad, Ugbo explained,
stating that "they are not occupying any of our villages."
</P>
<P>
He, however, admitted that the country had in the last few
years been faced with intermittent incursions by the Chadians
who, he said, had always been contained.
</P>
<P>
Director of Chadian security agency, Alhaji Youssouf Ahmat
Tyera, had recently alleged some rebels were occupying three
Nigerian islands, which were too tiny to be found in the map.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on Borno State Administrator Lt. Col.
Augustine Aniebo to stop the Chadian rebels' influx into Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Not Optimistic About Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad said
today that he is not optimistic about new initiatives for the
resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak following their talks here this afternoon, Assad said
"there is nothing to justify optimism that we are at the threshold
of peace."
</P>
<P>
He was believed to refer to possible optimism of peace
prospect after the agreement Monday between the Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators that the two sides would renew peace talks
this week.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that anyone who follows the development of
events can say there is a hope. Every day there is a new evidence
that there is no hope, though the advocates of peace in the world
and in the region are there," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Israeli government's practices do not
indicate or suggest any move towards peace.
</P>
<P>
Assad noted that he did not believe there would be any
substantive initiatives. "We certainly hope there will be
something substantive. But according to our accumulated
experience, we cannot foresee anything better."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to adhere to peace. We really want peace. It
is us who have opened the door to peace at a time when the
Israeli leadership did not subscribe to peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Golan Heights being occupied by Israel, Assad
stressed, "Golan will remain Syrian territory and will never be
otherwise. There is no single one in Syria who accepts to
surrender Golan, not even a tree in the Golan."
</P>
<P>
He praised the international community for its stand towards
the Golan, expressing hope that such an attitude will ever grow
"so that we may all achieve what is a must and just. There is no
fear for the Golan, as there is no people that relinquish their
territory for others."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Four-Party Talks' Representatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Tuesday announced the representatives of four countries that will
attend four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula peace issues.
</P>
<P>
They are Charles Kartman, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary
for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Song Young-shik, South Korea's
deputy foreign minister for political affairs; Kim Gye-gwan, vice
foreign minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK); and Chen Jian, Chinese assistant foreign minister, the
State Department said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, South Korea and the DPRK have met this year
for several times to set up the four-party negotiations. But for
China it is the first time to take part in, so the gathering,
scheduled on Aug. 5, has been seen as in effect the start of the
four-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The August 5 gathering is a preparatory session to fix a date,
venue and agenda for a later plenary meeting that will tackle the
substance of the issues, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
The gathering will be held at Columbia University's school of
international and public affairs.
</P>
<P>
The four-party peace talks was proposed by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam in April
1996.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Back Home From Visit to Syria, Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned home this evening from a visit to Syria and Jordan where
he held talks with Arab leaders on the latest Mideast peace
developments, reported the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made no statement upon his return from his
previously-unannounced visit to the two countries in an apparent
bid to shore up cooperation and coordination with the Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between the Egyptian president and his Syrian
counterpart Hafez el-Assad focused on the Mideast issue,
inter-Arab relations and the Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Assad warned at a joint press conference after their meeting
that the incumbent Israeli government's behavior "does not lead
one to believe it is headed for peace."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations came to a halt in
February 1996 following a series of terrorist attacks in
Israel. Damascus has since insisted on returning to the
negotiating table only if Israel proclaims readiness to hand back
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
There came, however, another setback last week when the Israeli
Knesset (parliament) adopted a bill blocking any future withdrawal
from the strategic land Israel seized in 1967 and annexed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Jordan's King Hussein briefed Mubarak on his talks
today with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, which came after
the Israelis and Palestinians agreed to resume negotiations, an
initial step toward ending the four-month-old crisis that
threatened to torpedo the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, both of which have peace treaties with
Israel, have been trying to mediate between the Palestinians and
Israelis to bring the peace march back on track.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been high during the crisis with the Arabs having
expressed growing frustration with the peace impasse.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Mubarak said he had sent messages to Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton
to warn them of the "explosive situation" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"These developments need logic approach. The danger of the
situation has to be made known to everyone," Mubarak told
reporters on his way to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was accompanied by a high-caliber delegation including
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and
ministers of electricity, information and oil, as well as his
advisor Osama el-Baz.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Warns of Dangerous Prospect of Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today that the alternative for peace after a period of
stalemate would be dangerous not only for a certain country but
also for all the countries concerned with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"If the necklace is dismantled, it will need tremendous effort
to mend and restore tranquillity and peace," he said in a joint
press conference with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad after
their meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The present situation is difficult and all the parties
concerned wait for a flexible Israeli stance, Mubarak said, adding
that "we have not seen Israeli flexibility so far but only its
stubbornness on the Syrian Golan issue."
</P>
<P>
"What we heard about the Golan Heights on July 23 dampens our
expectations. Some people say that those Israeli statements aimed
only at domestic consumption, but we deem them serious," the
Egyptian president noted.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the bill passed by the Israeli
Knesset (parliament) that to give up the Golan Heights would need
80 votes in the 120-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a reported U.S. initiative to revive the Middle
East peace process, Mubarak said the United States seeks to
restore the peace talks on the Palestinian and the Syrian tracks
but there are still many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the United States will boost its role in the
peace process and that the Israeli side will show a more
compromising position if it really seeks peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The inevitable consequence of injustice will be grave and I do
not like to elaborate on it," Mubarak warned.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived here this morning and left for Amman after
concluded a short visit.

<HEADLINE> Delegation of Greek Ministers to Visit Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Greek delegation of government
ministers led by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos would on
August 5 visit Albania in an effort to promote the cooperation
between the two neighboring countries, government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Reppas did not say how many ministers of Greece would
participate, but noted that Greek Public Order Minister George
Romeos would certainly go there.
</P>
<P>
The Greek move came following two separate meetings took place
on July 26 between Greek ambassador to Albania Konstandinos
Prevedourakis and newly-elected Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano
as well as between Prevekourakis and Albanian Foreign Minister
Pashalis Milios.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the talks, Greece and Albania had
agreed to hold a joint summit in Tirana in the near future for
ministers from each country to forge a policy of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Prevedourakis also told the Albanian officials that Athens
would offer Tirana every support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albanian Prime Minister Nano also expressed the hope
of increased cooperation between the two countries, saying that
both countries lived in the same corner of Europe and he hoped the
new era of reconstruction of Albania would help create "a new
climate of confidence" between Albanians and Greeks.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first of such joint summit between ministers of
the two countries since Albania's socialist-led leftist coalition
government took office recently.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Denies Military Cooperation with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has
denied that there is any kind of military cooperation between
Egypt and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"I can say Egypt has absolutely no kind of military ties with
Iran. It is the first time that I heard of such a thing," the
president said in an interview with a weekly talk show program
aired today on the Egyptian TV.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader made the statement to refute press reports
that Egypt has accepted an overture from its one-time foe on
conducting military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak suggested that such a decision is absolutely impossible
at a time when the two countries have yet to repair their
diplomatic ties which was cut off in 1979 after the Islamic
Revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the president revealed that Iran is seeking
military cooperation with Egypt in the face of growing military
ties between Turkey and Israel. The Turkish-Israeli cooperation has
worried regional countries, including Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the possibility (of military cooperation with Iran)
needed careful consideration before any decision could be made,
Mubarak said at the graduation ceremony of the military and police
academies.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take an immediate decision on this matter because we
do not rush into such decisions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Sunday also dismissed reports that it had called for
military cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to improve relations with Egypt, which has
repeatedly accused Tehran of backing underground Muslim militants
fighting to overthrow Mubarak's secular government.

<HEADLINE> Only 17 U.S. States Have Clear Learning Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Only 17 states now have
standards in math, science, social studies and English that
clearly call what children should know and when should they know
them, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) said today.
</P>
<P>
But the AFT said progress has been made in the past year as 29
states, up from 21 last year, have clear, specific standards in at
least three of the core subjects.
</P>
<P>
The 900,000-member AFT has been campaigning for tougher
standards to make public schools more challenging and attractive.
It holds that uniform standards ensure students in poor areas and
those who move get the same chance at learning as everyone else.
</P>
<P>
The report said few states have high school graduation exams
based on 10th grade standards and higher, only a few help
low-performing students meet standards, and even fewer are trying
to end promotions for students regardless of their performance.
</P>
<P>
The AFT supports President Bill Clinton's national standards
proposal, encouraging states supporting for voluntary national
tests of fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math was
widespread.

budget.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after holding talks with the prime

They also reviewed the issues in different sectors of
cooperation, including the programs already on course such as
hospitals, sports facilities, the Douala port, road networks and
the program of good governance, said the French senator.

<HEADLINE> Defense Motion Rejected in UNABOM Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has rejected a
motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California
trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has
killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years. He was
arrested April last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. says Kaczynski's
constitutional rights wouldn't be violated if his potentially
incriminating journals, notes and other private writing are used
against him.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old former mathematics instructor's defense team
argued that admitting the documents would infringe on his rights
of privacy and protection from self-incrimination. Burrell
rejected a motion on the same issue earlier.
</P>
<P>
In his latest ruling Monday, he said the defense argument
applies only "when the government compels an individual to
incriminate himself," which he says didn't happen in Kaczynski's
case, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The evidence includes journals that prosecutors say contain
admissions to all 16 bombings attributed to the UNABOMber during a
18-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of those bombings,
which killed two men and wounded others. He also is charged with a
third fatal bombing in New Jersey.

LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all

On the London market, Europe's largest one, Britain's leading
share index survived an afternoon dip to close higher amid
conflicting signals on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed 14 points higher at 4,876.6, having hit an
early high of just under 4,900 and an afternoon low of 4,856.7
when Wall Street opened.

Firmer-than-expected consumer credit data served only to

The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.79 to 1,572.32.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs More Import to Ease Fuel Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Fuel supply situation in Nigeria
may witness a chaos by the end of September unless the government
extends the deadline for fuel import while augmenting domestic
production, petroleum industry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The call for the extension is made after the breakdown of the
Kaduna Refinery in the north last Friday. The plant has a daily
refining capacity of 110,000 barrels of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Fuel scarcity has been lingering in the country since the
beginning of this year. At its peak in June, the head of state,
General Sani Abacha, ordered full supply of petrol at all filling
stations within 48 hours and importation of petroleum products
between then and September.
</P>
<P>
He also urged simultaneous turn-around maintenance of the
country's four refineries to boost production.
</P>
<P>
The government then approved importation of 24 cargoes of
petrol totaling 936 million liters at an average of 10 million
liters per day. Three of the refineries were working at that
time.
</P>
<P>
With the breakdown of the Kaduna Refinery, the 13 million
liters of petrol expected from the domestic refineries daily has
been further depleted to 6.1 million liters.
</P>
<P>
The combined volume of 10 million liters imported and the 6.1
million liters locally refined still leaves a shortfall of about
two million liters as the national demand stands at 18 million
liters a day.
</P>
<P>
The situation, according to the sources, is expected to
improve only with an anticipated extension of the September
deadline for the importation of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The turn-around maintenance of the refineries, which normally
takes 45 days, has not started now and it thus can hardly be
regarded as alternative to importation, they said.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Declares Flood Combat as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
interrupted his holiday to assure residents in the eastern German
flooded area of swift help from government, saying that combating
the disaster has become "a national task".
</P>
<P>
Kohl on Tuesday made his second visit to the crisis area since
the worst flooding in central Europe in 200 years started to
spread into Germany two weeks ago. He promised to mobilize funds
to help local residents who have suffered huge losses from the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also assured that the soldiers who had been led the rescue
operations along the Oder River on the German-Polish border would
remain there until the danger was over.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 soldiers and over 10,000 other helpers were working
round the clock to pile up sandbags on the 170-kilometer-long
dikes along the Oder which was swollen by recent rain in upstream
area of Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
After a dramatic overnight rescue operation in the Oderbruch
region in the north, thousands of rescue workers managed to repair
a serious damage in the sodden dikes which threatened to flood a
low-lying area of some 3,000 hectares, home to 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In the area south of the German border town of
Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, the situation had become relatively calm
over the past few days, but people were still standing on alert to
cope with another wave of high water expected for Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no acute epidemic danger so far in the
flooded area, officials of the Health Ministry of the German
Brandenburg state said Tuesday they were moving to take
precautious measures to immunize people against hepatitis A and
typhus.
</P>
<P>
A mass immunization campaign is due to start on Thursday which
could involve 20,000 people, health officials said.

PYONGYANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has conducted
about 150 aerial reconnaissance missions over the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) this month, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted military sources as

<P>
In addition, the United States used an E-3 early-warning plane
to fly over Teokjeok Island, Chun Chon City and Yang Yang City in
the DPRK for three days this month.
</P>
<P>
Among the reconnaissance fights this month, there were 30
times by the high-altitude strategic U-2 planes and more than 10
times by RC-135 strategic planes and E-3 early-warning spy planes
based in American overseas military bases, KCNA said.

<HEADLINE> France Aims to Adopt Liberal Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The French Socialist government is
aiming to adopt a liberal immigration law which will guarantee the
natural right of soil by children born in France of immigrant
families, and ease restriction on providing political asylum.
</P>
<P>
An 18-member team of law experts at the National Center of
Scientific Research (CNRP), headed by political scientist Patrick
Weil, will present Thursday two reports to Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin on re-writing France's immigration law and nationality law,
said local press reports.
</P>
<P>
France virtually closed its door to immigrants after adopting
two tough immigration laws drafted under two conservative interior
ministers, Charles Pasqua and Jean-Louis Debre, in 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since then, immigration has remained one of the most sensitive
political issues in France, dramatized by the crisis over
paperless immigrants occupying the Saint-Bernard Church in Paris
which ended in violent expulsion of hundreds of African immigrants
last summer.
</P>
<P>
The Weil reports suggest that all children born in France of
parents of foreign nationalities be given full French citizenship
by 18, according to the daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that unneeded visa and residence restrictions
be lifted from family members seeking family reunion in France,
easier residence status for persons seeking political asylum and
foreign students and researchers, and a stop of prejudiced
practices against mixed couples being exercised by French courts.
</P>
<P>
Tough legal sanctions should be imposed upon enterprises
employing illegal immigrants, and foreigners with crime records
should be rejected entry into France, suggested the experts.
</P>
<P>
France has about 3 million immigrants, most of them from North
Africa and black Africa.
</P>
<P>
The left and right parties of France have never ceased to
dispute over the policy of immigration, and used it on their
campaign agendas during the legislative elections in May and June.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the far-right National Front party of Jean-Marie Le
Pen is also taking advantage of the quarrel over immigration to
promote its racist and xenophobic propaganda.

<HEADLINE> Birth Rate Decreases to Record Low in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Birth rate in Sweden has
decreased to its record low this year, adding only 4,836 babies to
the country's more than 8-million population, Sweden's Statistics
Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said women with less education and lower incomes,
who began to bear children at an earlier age than others, now
refrain from becoming young mothers because most of them are out
of work.
</P>
<P>
Women with a better educational background, however, are having
children at the same rate as before.
</P>
<P>
A slight increase in Sweden's population is expected until
2030 when deaths are expected to outnumber births.
</P>
<P>
If the current trends continue, there will be a problematic

<HEADLINE> Premier Stresses Need For Unified Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China is in a period of transition
between planned and market economies, and it must set up a social
security system suited to the socialist market economy and the
country's true conditions, Chinese Premier Li Peng said at an
ongoing national conference on the unified pension system for
factory workers.
</P>
<P>
A multi-level social security system should be formed in China,
with the pension insurance set up by the government as the main
body, said Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some problems have appeared during the current transitional
period, such as poor management and operations in some state-owned
enterprises which have failed to pay salaries or pensions, and
even some cases of bankruptcy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council
are placing great emphasis on the issue. One of the measures that
has been taken by the central leadership is to ask localities to
set up a system to guarantee people's basic daily living needs.
</P>
<P>
This money must be paid directly to the poor families and no
one should pocket the pay, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier and member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee Politburo Zhu Rongji, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
and several other senior officials attended today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Japan Imposes Severe Penalties on DKB, Nomura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July (Xinhua) -- Japan's Ministry of Finance today
ordered Nomura Securities Co. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB) to
shut down key divisions from August 6 to the end of this year for
their illegal dealings with a "Sokaiya" corporate racketeer.
</P>
<P>
The penalties are the severest ever meted out by the country's
financial regulators, Kyodo news service reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the penalties, Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, will be
banned from own-account trading from August 6 to December 31, and
from stock-related operations at all of its outlets for seven days
until August 12.
</P>
<P>
Nomura's headquarters will also be closed for a month and the
company will be banned from all stock transactions for a week.
</P>
<P>
The DKB, the country's third-largest commercial bank, will be
barred from making any new loans to businesses for five
months. The bank is also banned from underwriting government bonds
and will be barred from setting up new branches or businesses
anywhere in the world starting next month.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that Nomura paid some 49.7 million yen, or
420,000 U.S. dollars, in 1995 to Sokaiya Ryuichi Koike, who was
indicted on charges of receiving such illicit financial favors.
</P>
<P>
The deal was made in violation of Japan's Security and Exchange
Laws to make up for part of Koike's investment losses. Nomura is
also said to have paid another 320 million yen, or 2.17 million
U.S. dollars, in cash in Koike in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DKB extended about 11.8 billion yen, or 100
million U.S. dollars, in loans to Koike through a nonbank
affiliate from 1994 to 1996, without appropriate screening, to buy
his silence at the bank's shareholders meeting.

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Being elderly and retired has not
stopped 77-year old Yang Wenxiang and two friends, all former
government employees in Binxian County, Shaanxi Province in the
northwest, from taking part in social and political activities.
</P>
<P>
The trio were recently sworn in as members of the Communist

<P>
According to local reports, since retiring, the three men have
been engaged in such good deeds as helping guard the community and
operating a children's library.
</P>
<P>
The men each applied for membership into the CPC at different
times over the years, but were not accepted. The death of Deng
Xiaoping on February 19 this year was an incentive for them to
send their applications once again.
</P>
<P>
"We are near the grave and are not applying for a CPC
membership for any personal interests," said 70-year old Shi
Chengyan, who said he will contribute the rest of his life to the

UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi

</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks following two explosions in a crowded

"I am shocked and horrified by the carnage in Jerusalem today.
It is abominable and unfortunate, particular at a time when all
efforts are being made to get the peace talks back on track,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I express my heartfelt condolence to the government and
people of Israel, and especially to the families of the victims.
And I condemn this act of terror unreservedly, as I condemn
terrorism from whatever quarter. Violence of this kind can never
advance the cause of peace," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a crucial time in the quest for peace in the Middle
East. I appeal to all concerned to reject violence and pursue

<HEADLINE> Canada's Homicide Rate Up in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Canada's homicide rate increased by
6 percent in 1996, following four straight annual declines,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, police reported 633 homicides in 1996, 45
more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Part of this increase was due to an increase in
multiple-victim homicides," the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
However, the 1996 rate of 2.11 homicides per 100,000 people was
still well below the peak of 3.02 in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Canada's homicide rate more than doubled between 1961 and 1975.
Since then, despite annual fluctuations, the rate has gradually
decreased.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, most Canadian provinces reported an increase in
homicides, notably Manitoba, Quebec and Saskatchewan. The only
decreases were in Alberta and New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
Among Canada's nine largest cities, Winnipeg reported the
highest rate of homicides, followed by Vancouver and Edmonton. The
lowest rates were in Calgary and Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
Canada's largest city of Toronto continued to report a homicide
rate well below the national average.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary 1996 data, the homicide rate in the
United States was almost four times higher than Canada's.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Canada's homicide rate is generally higher than that of
many European nations, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Canada's overall crime rate fell for the fifth consecutive year
in 1996, down 2.0 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Homicide and robbery were the only violent crimes to increase,
the agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A British family doctor at the
center of a euthanasia controversy was arrested early today and is
being held for questioning, according to a BBC television report
today.
</P>
<P>
Dr Dave Moor was arrested when he turned up voluntarily with a
lawyer today at a police station in Newcastle, in northeast
England, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moor has been involved in a debate about voluntary euthanasia
and admitted he had helped 150 people to die by giving them
potentially lethal dose of pain killers during his 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that detectives are interviewing him about the
death of an 85-year-old patient, a cancer victim who had been
treated by Moor. So far no charges have been brought against him.
</P>
<P>
At present, British law bans doctors from carrying out mercy
killings although there have been growing calls for the
legalization of euthanasia.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Buy Weapons From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will import 110 Army
Tactical Missile Systems (ATMS), 279 Multiple Launch Rocket
Systems (MLRS) and 29 launchers, worth 336 million U.S. dollars
from the U.S. next year, a defense ministry official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The weapon will counter 'North Korea's' artillery and MLRS,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The ATMS, a ground-launched missile system with a range of 165
kilometers, would be used to destroy the enemy's artillery, and
the command, control, and communications complexes, in case of a
surprise attack, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
And the MLRS, an artillery weapon with a range of 32
kilometers, would supplement cannon artillery fire by delivering a
large volume of firepower in a short time against critical,
sensitive targets, and would also be used to neutralize enemy
artillery, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea purchased nine sets of AN-TPQ anti-artillery radar
systems from the U.S. last year, and is considering buying more
this year, the ministry official added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank plans to provide
Vietnam with 617 million U.S. dollars in loans during the 1998
fiscal year, the State Bank of Vietnam announced today.
</P>
<P>
Since Vietnam resumed its relations with the U.N. credit
organization in October 1993, the World Bank has provided a total
of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in preferential interest loans for 14
projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
These projects have involved energy, infrastructural
construction, agriculture, education, public health, irrigation,
banking and structure readjustment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Bank has donated 30 million U.S. dollars
worth of aid to 50 technical projects in economic and social
fields.
</P>
<P>
Disbursement of World Bank loans has been accelerated since
last year due to improvement of administrative procedures, legal
documents, and project preparations and implementation.
</P>
<P>
Some 522 million U.S. dollars have been disbursed since 1993,
including 250 million U.S. dollars so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is now Vietnam's second largest donor after
Japan. Apart from helping Vietnam settle commercial debts through
the London club and set up capital markets, the World Bank has
also hosted four donors' conferences to help the country attract
capital from external sources.

<HEADLINE> EU Relaxes Admission of Non-EU Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today gave those who aspire to enter European Union (EU) a
piece of heartening news as it relaxed admission standards of
non-EU nationals.
</P>
<P>
The EC has adopted a proposal from Commissioner Anita Gradin on
rules concerning the admission of third-country citizens for
employment, study or family reunion.
</P>
<P>
"We have to create clear and common rules for the admission of
those who want to come and we must offer more favorable conditions
for those staying here for a long time," said the commissioner in
charge of immigration, who described migration as part of
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EC has played its part in this cooperation as 13 million
non-EU nationals are living in EU countries and more than a
million people cross EU borders each year, Gradin added.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed giving non-EU immigrants the same basic rights
of housing and schooling as those given to union citizens.
</P>
<P>
But, the relaxed admission does not cover those seeking
asylum. People seeking refuge in the EU will still be treated in
accordance with the Geneva Convention, an EU press release said
today.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: No Deadline for Cambodia's Entry into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's entry into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is still awaiting
the agreement of two conflicting parties in Cambodia, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The membership of ASEAN might be determined during Cambodia's
election in May 1998, or before or after the poll when the two
warring factions in that country reach an agreement. No deadline
has been set for Cambodia's entry," he said after having talks
with his Canadian counterpart Llyod Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Cambodia was
delayed to enter the grouping because of political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas along with Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn and
Philippine Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon plan to meet Cambodia's
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh late this week.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, ASEAN is interested in helping to end the crisis in
Cambodia, but this is not the right time for me to tell the
press," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas did not elaborate on the topics the three ministers will
discuss with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, an agreement between the two warring
factions, namely, the Cambodian People's Party (CCP) led by Hun
Sen and Puncinpec led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh,
plays a significant role in ending the Cambodian crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said a formation of a coalition cabinet and Cambodia's
election next year are two important factors to end the conflict.
"Whoever wins the election should be acknowledged by the Cambodian
people," he added.

<HEADLINE> China To Reform Household Registration In Towns, Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's existing household
register system, which has been in place since the founding of the
People's Republic in 1949, has played an important role in
protecting citizens' rights and social stability, State Councilor
Luo Gan said today in a teleconference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But it needs to be reformed, Luo pointed out, to keep up with
the rapid social and economic development that has occurred in the
country since the late 1970s, which has led to a surplus of
migrant workers moving into the service and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The phone conference was sponsored by the State Council General
Office to push forward the reform.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of fully understanding the reform
and of upgrading the household register system in small towns and
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The old system has caused inaccuracies in the population census
and has hampered social and economic development in the country,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He asked local governments to study the issue and carefully
experiment with reforms.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Security Tao Siju also participated in the
teleconference. He proposed that a police station be established
in each township or town.

<HEADLINE> Car Makers in Vietnam Hit Huge Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Vietnam have declined
during the first six months of this year due in part to the over
saturation of the market and a slowdown in the country's economy,
press here reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue, the Vietnam Investment Review said that
all of Vietnam's automobile manufacturers reported plunging sales
figures for the period with losses pegged at anything between 15
to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop was dramatic compared with last year, with nine
of the 14 licensed joint ventures selling just
2,545 units in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, a 20
percent down from last year.
</P>
<P>
The only company that has reported a profitable turnover for
the last three years, the Vietnam Motors Corporation (VMC) said
even it would find it hard to break even this year.
</P>
<P>
A VMC senior director said that the general economic slowdown
is affecting all areas of Vietnam including car sales.

JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- David Bar-Ilan, director for
policy planning and communication at the Israeli Prime Minister's
Office, pointed an accusing finger at the Palestinian Authority
for today's explosion in Jerusalem which killed 18 people and
injuried 151 others.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan told the Cable News Network (CNN) that "we don't know
exactly who the terrorist who perpetrated this horrible act
is. But we do know that the actions of the Palestinian Authority
have not been designed, to say the least, to discourage terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary," Bar-Ilan said, "(Yasser) Arafat himself has
given the green-light to the terrorist organizations and, lately,
we know by fact that police organizations have banded together to
perform terrorist acts against Israelis in the full knowledge of
the chief of police who is responsible directly to Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan said, "This is unacceptable. The peace process can not
continue to the accompaniment of terrorist acts." "This must stop
if the peace process is to continue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM: US to Lift Travel Ban to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has decided to
lift a 12 year-old travel ban to Lebanon, Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in his office, the prime minister said
that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright informed him that
"the U.S. government and she herself have taken the decision to
lift the ban on U.S. citizens' travel to Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Hariri described the decision as "excellent" and vowed that
the Lebanese government will do its best to safeguard security
of U.S. citizens in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in the Lebanese government said Albright
contacted earlier today with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Hariri, informing them of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's
administration in 1985 after the hijack of a jetliner of the
Trans World Airlines (TWA) to then civil war-torn Beirut, the
capital of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. navy officer was shot dead on board and dozens of other
U.S. passengers were held hostage for 17 days before they were
set free at a seaside Beirut hotel.
</P>
<P>
The hijack capped three years of suicide truck-bombings and
kidnapings in which 24 U.S. servicemen and 17 diplomats
were killed and more than a dozen abducted. The attacks were
claimed by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim fanatics allegedly operating
under Hezbollah's wing.
</P>
<P>
The United States has since been demanding a Lebanese
government crackdown on Hezbollah, or Party of God, as a
precondition for lifting the ban, which has been automatically
renewed every six months.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Terror Bombings, Sends Condolence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
telephoned Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to condemn the two bombings that killed 18
people in a Jerusalem market earlier this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Around 1:10 this afternoon, a pair of bombs exploded within
seconds in western Jerusalem's busiest Mahane Yehuda market,
claiming 18 lives and wounding 151 others. Initial reports said
the blasts were carried out by suspect suicidal bombers.
</P>
<P>
Calling the terror attack "a crime against the peace process,"
Arafat told Israeli leaders that much more needed to be done to
stop such kind of things from happening again.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also expressed his "deep sorrow and condolences" to the
victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, though
Israeli police suspected that they were carried out by
anti-Israeli Palestinian extremists. Israeli troops swiftly
imposed total closure on West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a strong reaction to the incident, Israeli government warned
the peace process should not proceed under such circumstances.
Netanyahu's advisor David Bar-Ilan said peace talks were unlikely
when terrorist attacks against Israel continued.
</P>
<P>
The blasts came two days after Israeli Prime Minister David
Levy and Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'ath agreed to resume
talks on outstanding issues this week, and barely one day before
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross arrives in the region to
start a new round of mediation.
</P>
<P>
However, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called for
sanity and reason on the part of Israel in accusing the
Palestinian National Authority of refusing to commit itself to
cracking down on terrorism and of even releasing extremists.
</P>
<P>
While expressing sympathy and sorrow for the victims, Erekat
said that both Israelis and Palestinians should send out a strong
message at this moment that they would not budge to terrorism and
would proceed with the peace process as "the only way to save
lives in future."
</P>
<P>
In response to Israeli accusations, Erekat said the PNA has
been, is and will continue making 100 percent efforts to crack
down on Palestinian terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Erekat's statement, PNA Minister of Higher Education
Hana Asrawi said that it was not time to trade blames for the
tragedy. She condemned the criminal act against civilians, adding
that the peace process was the only way to prevent further
violence.
</P>
<P>
The bombings cast a dark shadow over the newly-born optimism
over reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Only
two days ago, Levy and Sha'ath stood side by side to announce the
resumption of political talks to end the four-month-old deadlock.
</P>
<P>
During the Levy-Sha'ath meeting, the PNA promised to increase
security cooperation with Israel, while Israel agreed to discuss
the unresolved issues on opening safe passages between West Bank
and Gaza Strip, building the Gaza airport and sea port, and
releasing Palestinian prisoners.

ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Both the Afghan Taliban Islamic
militia and their rival forces today failed to gain any
significant ground in the fierce fighting north of Kabul,
according to sources in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The frontlines were still around 20 kilometers north of Kabul,
where they have been for the last week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, the two factions were keeping the pressure high by
raining rockets and artillery shells on each others' positions,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two weeks ago, the forces loyal to Afghanistan's former
military chief Ahmad Masood began a major offensive which has
brought them to within rocket range of Kabul.

LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The first Robot World Cup Soccer
Games will be held in Japan in late August.
</P>
<P>
Hiroaki Kitano, chairman of the International Committee of
Robot World Cup Soccer, made this announcement today when
attending a European conference on artificial life being held in
Brighton, southern England.
</P>
<P>
"The Robot World Cup Soccer is an attempt to foster artificial
intelligence and intelligent robotics research by providing a
standard problem where a wide range of technologies can be
integrated and examined," he said.
</P>
<P>
A senior researcher with Sony Corporation of Japan said "A
robot team must actually perform a soccer game, incorporating
various technologies, including design principles of autonomous
agents, multiagent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time
reasoning, robotics and sensor fusion."
</P>
<P>
After IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer defeated the world
chess champion, soccer has been becoming a new focus for
scientists, he added.
</P>
<P>
There will be more than 40 teams attending the robot soccer
games to be held from 25 to 28, August. The second soccer games
will be held in Paris next July.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Ross Tour Aims at Discussing U.S. Fresh Ideas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today U.S. Mideast Peace Envoy Dennis Ross takes some new
initiative on salvaging the peace process in his upcoming trip to
the region.
</P>
<P>
"Ross' visit to Israel and Gaza set for tomorrow aims at
discussing proposed American ideas to get the stalled Mideast
peace march, Palestinian-Israeli track, off the hook," Moussa was
quoted by the Middle East News Agency as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Ross is likely to visit Egypt although it is unknown whether or
not he would visit other countries of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The renewed U.S. mediation mission, which has slacked off in
the past few months, followed the agreement between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators on Monday to resume peace talks this week,
apparently encouraged by the fact that the two sides are going to
be talking.
</P>
<P>
However, just hours before Ross' arrival, two explosions rocked
a crowded Jewish vegetable market in Jerusalem today, killing
nearly 20 people and wounding about 150. The reason behind the
attacks is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said the U.S. was considering a formula in
which the Palestinian National Authority would keep a firmer hand
on violence while Israel would agree to refrain from building new
settlements but continue to expand existing ones.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, diplomatic sources pointed out that Ross' tour
of the region comes on the heels of the recent U.S.-Egyptian
contacts and the message sent by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the message sent to Washington Tuesday, Mubarak warned of
the dangers posed to the region should the Israeli new settlement
in Ras el-Amud in central Jerusalem goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
The PNA-Israeli talks came to a halt in March when Israel broke
ground for thousands of Jewish home in East Jerusalem, where the
Palestinians want as their future capital.

BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation show that China
approved 9,763 foreign-funded enterprises in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
China currently has a total of 293,556 foreign-funded

Scales of key projects approved by the State Council also

<HEADLINE> New Habitat For Giant Panda Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife experts believe that
about 30 giant pandas are living in a forest of about 100
sq. kilometers in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The giant pandas, one of the world's most-recognized endangered
species, are believed to be living in a forested area located in
Axia township, Diebu County, in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the Wildlife Protection Administration under the
Provincial Department of Forestry has received numerous giant
panda sightings in the area from local residents.
</P>
<P>
From June 13 to 20, a group organized by the WPA searched 22
sq. m of the area and found excrement of giant pandas, which shows
that at least four giant pandas, including one cub, are living
there.
</P>
<P>
According to the WPA, the forest is the second natural habitat
for giant pandas in the province, after the Baishuijiang National
Natural Reserve.
</P>
<P>
With only about 1,000 giant pandas remaining in China's
Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the animal has long been a
symbol of the world's wildlife protection cause.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan made by China's Ministry of Forestry, there
will be a total of 28 giant panda reserves by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Denounces U.S. Stance in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara today strongly criticized the U.S. stance in the Mideast
peace process, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"In its capacity as a main sponsor of the peace process, the
U.S. should have shouldered special responsibility," he told an
Egyptian TV program, demanding Washington to readjust its stance
and improve its mediation profile.
</P>
<P>
He termed as "very sad" the U.S. vote against two U.N. draft
resolutions condemning Israel's settlement policy, which he said
reflected its bias toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Shara called upon the Arab countries to be cautious against the
Israeli ambitions and keep striving for a comprehensive solution
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs should not give the Israeli government a chance to
cement its anti-peace policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beating a downbeat note, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad said
Tuesday Israeli government's practices do not indicate or suggest
any move toward peace.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak following their talks in Damascus Tuesday, Assad said
"there is nothing to justify optimism that we are at the threshold
of peace."
</P>
<P>
Optimism of possible peace progress reoccurs after the
agreement Monday between the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
that the two sides would renew peace talks this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is reportedly considering to send its Mideast peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the Mideast again with a new initiative to
salvage the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks which broke down in
March due to the construction of a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli talks came to a halt since February
1996. Damascus refused to return to the negotiating table unless
Israel is ready to fully return the Syrian Golan Heights which it
captured in 1967 and annexed in 1981.

<HEADLINE> Macao Should Learn from HK in Economic Expansion: Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Macao should learn from Hong Kong's
experience while expanding its economy, scholars concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
Macao should create an investment environment that allows
free, open and fair competition as well as rule of law, and should
 also introduce a high quality civil service and an operation
mechanism that attracts talented people, said Wang Jinxiang,
deputy director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, who is
also an economist, in a symposium today.
</P>
<P>
A dozen scholars and experts from Hong Kong and Macao attended
today's symposium to discuss the economic relationship between
Hong Kong and Macao after Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Macao and Hong Kong have close economic relations due to their
geographical and historical closeness, stressed several experts in
 the symposium, adding that Macao benefits a lot from Hong Kong's
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Edmundo Ho, chairman of Macao Bankers' Association, observed
that in many ways Macao is an extension of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong not only provides the dominant source of consumer
goods, it is also the market of Macao's monetary deals, the
largest source of tourists to Macao, and a leading investor in
Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
But to increase cooperation between the two places, Ho
concluded, Macao must become an attractive market where Hong Kong
businessmen are willing to invest more and make use of the
favorable conditions that only Macao has.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says No to U.S. Dictates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the arrival of U.S.
peace envoy Dennis Ross on a new round of mediation, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed today not to bow to
U.S. pressure to freeze settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on today's Hebrew daily Haaretz,
Netanyahu said that he would not accept any U.S. dictates to
freeze settlement activities in order to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, because Israel was not a
protector of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The hardline Israeli leader added that he did not think
political leaders should function according to "take it or leave
it" policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the right way to conduct the peace talks
should be reaching agreements through negotiations rather than
accepting dictates.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he did not rule out that the U.S. would take
another leave from mediating the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
due to Israel's policy of intransigence on expanding
settlements.
</P>
<P>
His tough statement on the eve of Ross' arrival was
apparently aimed at sending out a clear signal to Washington
that his government would not agree to make concessions on the
issue of settlements, which was said to dominate Ross' new
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Ross' arrival here Thursday for a new round of mediation
coincides with a new burst of momentum on resuming the
Israeli-Palestinian talks that have been frozen by Israel's
building of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem since
March.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath announced after a two-hour meeting that the two sides
agreed to resume peace negotiations this week.
</P>
<P>
Levy also visited Jordan Tuesday to brief Jordanian King
Hussein on his meetings with PNA President Yasser Arafat last
week in Brussels, Belgium and with Shaath.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Ross is expected to present a new set
of proposals to Israeli and PNA leaders, which could expedite
final status negotiations while accelerating the interim
agreement's prerequisites - a further Israeli troop redeployment
in the West Bank and opening of "safe passages" for Palestinians
between West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
As a confidence-building measure, Ross is to urge Netanyahu
and his inner cabinet to impose a six-month freeze on all
settlement construction, including the Har Homa project. But
Netanyahu is unlikely to make compromise on the issue because he
is facing strong pressure from rightist hardliners within his
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement to resume talks, the gap between Israel
and the PNA remains wide and both sides have played down optimism
about an immediate breakthrough in the near future. The PNA is
still demanding Israel halt all settlement activities, especially
the Har Homa construction.

<HEADLINE> Angolan President Rejects Mediation Between him, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- President Eduard Dos Santos today
refuses the good offices of others arranging talks between him
and Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
These efforts is "useless" and "untimely", said Aldmeiro da
Conceicao, spokesman of the Angolan Presidency, while commenting
on a question raised by pressmen that Savimbi asked foreign
leaders to help arrange his talks with Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leader went to Abidjan Monday to request Cote
d'Ivoire President Konan Bedie to arrange fresh talks between him
and Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos had earlier agreed to talk with Savimbi inside
Angola, on the condition that he would not discuss the problems
which had been ironed out in accordance with the Peace Accord
signed in Lusaka in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Conceicao said, as President Santos had agreed on the talks,
it's "meaningless" to ask the Cote d'Ivoire president for further
mediation, since any irrelevant figure involving into the matter
might create chaos in the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- David Bar-Ilan, director for
policy planning and communication at the Israeli Prime Minister's
Office, pointed an accusing finger at the Palestinian Authority
for today's explosion in Jerusalem which killed 18 people and
injuried 151 others.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan told the Cable News Network (CNN) that "we don't know
exactly who the terrorist who perpetrated this horrible act
is. But we do know that the actions of the Palestinian Authority
have not been designed, to say the least, to discourage terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary," Bar-Ilan said, "(Yasser) Arafat himself has
given the green-light to the terrorist organizations and, lately,
we know by fact that police organizations have banded together to
perform terrorist acts against Israelis in the full knowledge of
the chief of police who is responsible directly to Yasser Arafat."
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan said, "This is unacceptable. The peace process can not
continue to the accompaniment of terrorist acts." "This must stop
if the peace process is to continue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lucky Color Film Approaches World Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A recent sample survey has shown
that the quality of domestic-made Lucky color film is close to
that of world-renowned brands.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the State Technical Supervision
Bureau, has indicated that the quality of Chinese-made color film
has improved significantly, especially the Lucky Gold BR color
film produced by the China Lucky Film Corporation, with many of
its quality indexes reaching or approaching world standards.
</P>
<P>
The survey centered on the quality of the ISO 100/21 DIN color
film, which is one of the most popular choices of amateur
photographers.
</P>
<P>
The study covered nine brands and 49 groups of products, which
are sold or produced in five big cities in China such as Beijing,
Guangzhou, and Shanghai. The survey results revealed that all
products sampled are of satisfactory or better quality.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, of the 100 million rolls of film sold
in China in 1994, 25 million were domestic-made and 75 million
were imported. In 1995, 150 million rolls were sold, with 125
million imported.

MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos

stable, peaceful and progressive Southeast Asia by the founders of
the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of

<HEADLINE> Israel Clamps Closures on West Bank, Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops clamped closures
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip today following two suspected
suicide bombings in Jerusalem, which killed at least 18 people and
wounded 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that the army has reimposed closure on the
Palestinian territories for security reasons. Clamping closure on
Palestinian territories is a routine practice by Israel whenever
there is a terror attack launched by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midday today, two bomb exploded in the
Jerusalem's busiest Mahane Yehuda open market, killing at least
18 people and wounded dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility yet for the attacks, but
police suspected them to suicide bombings carried out by
Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
holding consultations with senior aides on the blasts. The Israeli
government is expected to react strongly to the attacks if they
were confirmed as suicide bombings launched by Palestinian
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, who visited the
bombing site a while ago, warned that Israel would not agree to
carry on the peace process while terrorism was not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The bombings are sure to damp the new optimism emerging
recently for the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
which have been deadlocked since Israel began in March building
the controversial Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
After intensive mediation efforts by the European Union, the
United States and Egypt, the two sides broke the ice by agreeing
on Monday to resume the peace negotiations within a week. It
remains to be seen now if Israel would change its mind.
</P>
<P>
Israel has long demanded the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) launch a long-term crackdown on terrorism as conditions for
making progress in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mahane Yehuda is the only open market in Jerusalem and one of
the busiest market in the city, where people buy vegetables,
fruits and other daily necessities. It is usually crowded after 1
O'clock in the afternoon because that is when many people take a
leave from their morning work to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
Bombings in Israel are usually carried out by anti-peace
Islamic extremist organizations such as the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, which launched a wave of
suicide bombing attacks on buses in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and
Ashkelon from late February to early March last year, killing
62 people.
</P>
<P>
The previous suicide bombing was on March 22, when a Hamas
terrorist detonated a bomb in a open cafe in central Tel Aviv,
killing three Israeli women and over a dozen others.

MADRID, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Barcelona club official said on
Wednesday that agreement over the Ronaldo transfer between
Barcelona and Inter Milan broke down because the Italian club did
not offer enough money.

Joan Gaspart, a Barcelona vice-president, said that Inter were
not prepared to pay more than four billion pesetas (26.6 million

The Catalan club are reported to want a further 2.2 billion
pesetas (14.6 million U.S. dollars) as a transfer fee while Inter
have apparently offered only 100 million pesetas (660,000).
</P>
<P>
FIFA are set to rule on the dispute on Thursday if the two

<HEADLINE> Kuwait National Assembly Approves State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti parliament approved
Tuesday a 4.378 billion Kuwait dinar (14.38 billion U.S. dollars)
annual budget for 1997/98 fiscal year after increasing the net
deficit to 1.274 billion dinars (4.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The net deficit was increased by rejecting plans to increase
revenues from higher charges, local medium reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Total revenues were cut to 3.105 billion dinars (10.24 billion
U.S. dollars) after the National Assembly rejected a government
assumption of earning some 203 million dinars (669.9 million
U.S. dollars) more from raising rates for some public services.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliamentary Finance and Economics Affairs Committee
told the government that the plan to boost non-oil revenuers by
over 200 million Kuwait dinars (660 million U.S. dollars) through
charges and taxation violated the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait 1997/98 fiscal year starts from July 1 and ends on June
30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oil revenues from Kuwait's 2 million barrels per day OPEC
(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil quota, the
main source of state income in the oil exporting Gulf state,
remain almost unchanged in the new budget at 2.555 billion dinars
(8.43 billion U.S. dollars), according to a conservative estimate
of 13 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government agreed to cut non-oil revenue by 95
million dinars (313.5 million U.S. dollars) to 550 million dinars
(1.815 billion U.S. dollars), the result of a strong rejection by
the parliamentary members to the government attempt to impose
charges on public services.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, following legal provisions, will continue to
inject fresh funds into Kuwait's foreign investment "basket" or
funds for future generations by depositing 10 percent of total
oil revenues in the portfolio, raising the gross deficit to more
than 1.5 billion dinars (4.95 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of Kuwait's global holdings is a state secret, but
independent sources estimate the current worth of the investment
portfolio at more than 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total state salaries are forecast at more than half of the
country's projected oil earnings for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The defense Ministry was allocated around 495 million dinars
(1.633 billion U.S. dollars), which political sources say did not
include the planned cost of rebuilding the military after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait launched a 12-billion-U.S.-dollar plan after the Gulf
War to rebuild the army and has concluded several deals with the
United States, Britain, France and Russia. Other contracts are in
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The allocations to education, health and other sectors were
marginally raised in the budget in comparison to the previous
year, according to released figures.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaitis enjoy a cradle-to-grave welfare system that offers
free education and health and heavily subsidized state services
such as electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti parliament called for reinvigorating the country's
non-oil gross domestic product and strengthening the private
sector performance to generate more incomes other than oil
revenues.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Head of Sino-Portuguese JLG on Key Tasks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- New Chinese chief representative of
the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) said here today that
the JLG should put its work on key issues relating to a stable
transition and a smooth handover of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, who arrived here Monday to succeed Guo Jiading
as the Chinese chief representative on the JLG, told reporters
today that the JLG should focus its efforts on the key issues as
Macao has entered a final and crucial stage in its transitional
period.
</P>
<P>
"The main task of the JLG, in the opinion of the Chinese side,
should be the three leading issues of transition -- the
localization of the civil service, the localization of law and the
use of Chinese as an official language -- and the transfer of
archives and government assets, which are all closely connected
with a stable transition and a smooth handover of power in Macao,"
he said during a meeting with Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua
News Agency Macao Branch.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the ambassador said, the localization of the
civil service must be carried out at a faster pace so that those
newly appointed can have time to make themselves familiar with
their work and gain working experience by the time of handover in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Han said that the Chinese government has three principles in
handling the transitional affairs of Macao. These principles are
based on the "one country, two systems" policy and on the
consideration of Macao's history and current situation.
</P>
<P>
The first principle is that China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao as of December 20, 1999; the second is to
maintain the stability and development of Macao; and the third is
to take into proper consideration the interests of the Portuguese
side, which came about in the past.
</P>
<P>
Han, the third chief of the Chinese side on the JLG, has been a
member of the JLG since 1988. He speaks Portuguese and once worked
as a counselor in the Chinese embassy in Portugal. He also
participated in the negotiations between China and Portugal on the
question of Macao.

BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union, today formally approved the
merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas without debate and vote.
</P>
<P>
But the merger was declared compatible with the common market
subject to full compliance by Boeing with the commitments it had
submitted to the commission earlier.
</P>
<P>
The commission is entitled, under the EU Merger Regulation, to take
appropriate measures should Boeing fails to comply with its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Top of the commitments is the cessation by Boeing of its existing
and future exclusive supply deals like those with major United States
airlines -- American, Continental and Delta.
</P>
<P>
The European approval of the merger, valued at around 14 billion
U.S. dollars, has averted a damaging trans-Atlantic trade war centered

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Security Measures in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said here
today that the Macao authorities should take effective measures to
combat organized crimes in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told reporters this morning following a shooting incident in a
hotel that it is the responsibility of the Macao authorities to
maintain good security in Macao before the handover in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration has it that the
Portuguese side is responsible for the administration of Macao
before December 20, 1999, and that the Chinese side provides help
and support," Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Chinese side has noticed that the Macao
authorities have taken some measures over the past months in
fighting against organized crimes, but further measures are
needed.
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese side should improve the quality of its police
force, and step up measures to crack down on crimes," he said,
adding that the Chinese side will give full support, as it has
done in the past, in the fight against cross-border crimes, if
any.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the director said that it is a long time effort to
maintain security.
</P>
<P>
One guard and two others were wounded in the shooting incident
at a hotel at about 2:00 (local time) in the morning. A police
spokesman said that three to four masked gunmen fired a dozen
shots with M16 or AK47 automatic rifles into the lounge of the
hotel in a surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
About two and half hours later, an incendiary gadget looking
like a firecracker was hurled into the garden of the Government
Palace, but caused no damage, the spokesman told a press
conference at noon.
</P>
<P>
The incidents are believed to be related to a latest wave of
organized crimes fighting for interests in Macao
casinos. Triad-related violence in the territory has killed a
dozen people since the beginning of this year.

<P>
Both Boeing and Airbus are the world's most politically sensitive
and technologically advanced aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation on the merger was said to have followed
high-level political interventions. United States President Bill
Clinton last week threatened trade retaliation against Europe if
the merger was blocked.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president made a phone call to Prime Minister Jean-Claude
Juncker which now holds the rotating European Union presidency while
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright lobbied on Boeing's behalf
in a phone call to German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the merger was reached and there was no debate and no
vote either, according to Van der Pas, chief spokesman of the European
Commission at the day's press briefing.
</P>
<P>
European Union officials had been mainly concerned about Boeing's
exclusive contracts with the world's major airlines.
</P>
<P>
Other Boeing concessions included ring-fencing of McDonnell
Douglas' commercial aircraft activities, licensing of patents to
other jet aircraft manufacturers, commitment not to abuse
relationship with customers and suppliers as well as commitment to
report annually to the European Commission on military and civil
aeronautics projects benefiting from government funding.
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, will strengthen Boeing's position as the
world's largest maker of commercial aircraft and America's biggest
single exporter.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's overall market share (in terms of current order backlog)
is expected to rise from 64 percent to 70 percent while the size of
its service fleet worldwide will grow from 60 percent to 84 percent.

<HEADLINE> UAE's GDP Up 10 Percent in 1996: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE)'s gross domestic product(GDP) rose to some 44.6 billion
dollars in 1996, a 10 percent growth compared with 40.2 billion
in 1995, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to a record surge in the oil
sector's revenues by 2.7 billion dollars to 15.5 billion
dollars, the Arabic daily Al Hayyat quoted a report by the UAE's
Central Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The surge came because of the world's higher crude prices
which soared by about three dollars per barrel to an averaged 20
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil sector's contribution increased to some 29.1
billion dollars from 27.4 billion dollars in 1995, the report

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will fund a
project of 2.6 million U.S dollars to help rid Mozambique of
landmines, local press the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The landmines would be removed by South African company Mechem
in terms of a contract it signed with the government in Pretoria
last week, the paper quoted spokesman for the Foreign Affairs
Department Pieter Swanepoel as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project was among several topics discussed by South African Foreign
Minister Alred Nzo and his visiting Mozambican counterpart
Leonardo Simao in Pretoria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The removal of landmines laid during decades of civil war,
said Nzo, would make a significant contribution to creating
freedom of movement in Mozambique, and would be in the interest
of the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the construction of the Maputo Development
Corridor, Nzo said, the big project would be to the benefit of
both South Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries had also agreed to set up special
committees to devise a strategic plan on the revitalization of

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The first Robot World Cup Soccer
Games will be held later August in Nagoya, Japan, Xinhua was told
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Robot World Cup Soccer is an attempt to foster artificial
intelligence and intelligent robotics research by providing a
standard problem where a wide range of technologies can be
integrated and examined," said Mr Hiroaki Kitano, chairman of the
International Committee of Robot World Cup Soccer, who is
attending the forth European Conference on Artificial Life in
Brighton, southern England.
</P>
<P>
"A robot team must actually perform a soccer game,
incorporating various technologies, including design principles of
autonomous agents, multiagent collaboration, strategy acquisition,
real-time reasoning, robotics and sensor fusion," said Mr Kitano,
also a senior researcher at Sony Corp of Japan.
</P>
<P>
After IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer defeated the world chess
champion, soccer is becoming a new focus for scientists, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tighten Bail Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet
will study a draft legislation to put bail beyond the reach of
suspects accused of murder, rape, car hijacking and other serious
crimes, said Justice Minister Dullah Omar.
</P>
<P>
Local daily, the Star, today quoted Omar as saying that the
recent rape and murder of seven-year-old Mamokgethi Malebane had
highlighted the need for him to intervene and tighten up bail
conditions outlined in the Criminal Procedure Act.
</P>
<P>
Mamokgethi was kidnapped and murdered, allegedly by the man
she accused of raping her, after the man was released on bail of 2,000
Rand (444 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The proposed changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the
Mamokgethi tragedy," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed bail amendment, courts can cancel bail if
it was discovered that the accused had been previously convicted
of a serious offence.
</P>
<P>
The amendment would also give courts the right to refuse bail
if it appeared that the release of a suspect would undermine
public peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The amendment would be tabled in parliament as soon
as it got the cabinet approval.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were killed
and 50 others wounded this afternoon in two suspected suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's bustling Mahane Yehuda market, Israeli
police said.
</P>
<P>
A Xinhua correspondent living near the market hear two
consecutive loud explosions at about 1:10 local time
(10:15GMT). Israeli televisions showed pictures of the bombing
site, which was scattered with debris. Police and resue workers
evacuating from the site the wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and soldiers have sealed off the area and
searched the area to prevent further attacks.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear who was responsible for the bombings,
but police suspected them to be two suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
holding consultations with senior aides on the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Mahane Yehuda is the only open market in Jerusalem and one of
the busiest market in the city, where people buy vegetables,
fruits and other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
It is usually crowded after 1:00 PM because that is when many
people take a leave from their morning work to go shopping.
</P>
<P>
Bombings in Israel are usually carried out by radical Islamic
extremist organizations such the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, which launched a wave of suicide
bombing attacks on buses in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon from
late February to early March last year, killing 62 people.

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Mogadishu faction leaders
met Tuesday for the first time to discuss the implementation
of the Sana agreeemnt after Italian Deputy Foreign Minister
failed to bring all of the Somali factions together.
</P>
<P>
Osman Hassan Ali Atto and Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who have been
arch rivals in the south of the capital, said they have agreed
upon the full implementation of the 12-points Sana accord during
their 90 minutes' meeting at Shamo Hotel near the front line
dividing their militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The two political leaders from the same Habasr Gidir clan also
agreed to continue meeting of military technical committees
unconditionally from today on.
</P>
<P>
Two military technical committees resumed their talks this
morning in south Mogadishu in an effort to reach a lasting
solution separating the militiamen and dismantling the remaining
road blocks in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the meeting, the two committees disagreed over
how far the forces of Hussein Aidid would distance themselves
from the main host base in the north of Medina neighborhood, with
Hussein Aidid's officials insisting that they will pull back only
60 meters from the base while those of Osman Atto saying that
each side should pull back 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
The problem seems to have been solved at the moment by the two
leaders, but the real terms is not yet disclosed.

the two faction leaders on May 12 has been held effectively and
both Osman Atto and Hussein have congratulated their forces for
honoring the cease-fire.

Residents in Mogadishu were disappointed with the failed
attempt of the Italian diplomacy Tuesday. However, many of them
were relieved by the meeting between Hussein Aidid and Osman
Atto.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan ambassador to the U.S.
is expected to defend Kenya's political and human rights record
before the U.S. Senate Wednesday, the local Daily Nation
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Ambassador to the U.S., Benjamin Kipkorir, will
appear before a special sub-committee on African Affairs
Wednesday, which will discuss "election crisis" in Kenya, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that after today's meeting, the committee
might send a protest note to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, or
activate legislation and economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has tremendous potential in the sub-region and it is
important that we support the entire reform process," a source in
the U.S. Senate was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration "must pressurize President Moi to
initiate not just economic reforms but also political reforms,
all of which are essential for a coutry's development," said the
source asking anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes in the wake of Moi's decision to move on
with constitutional reforms after much resistance from Kenyan
opposition parties and a recent visit to Washington by Kenyan
Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Sally Kosgei.
</P>
<P>
At the talks with Kosgei, U.S. Under-Secretary of State for
Political Affairs Thomas Pickering reportedly expressed "profound
concern regarding the violence in Kenya and reiterated the strong
U.S. support for rapid action to create the open electoral
process necessary for free and fair elections."
</P>
<P>
The United States on July 25 welcomed a plan by the Kenyan
government for talks with the opposition on political reforms
before the general elections, saying it is essential pre-election
rallies and other events remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were killed on July 7 around the country in
running battles between the riot police and pro-reform
demonstrators in kenya's worst civil unrest for seven years.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi said on July 16 that permits for
rallies would automatically be granted except in exceptional
cases.
</P>
<P>
From May to July, violence has been escalating when the
opposition repeated to try to hold rallies without governmental
permit in a bid to press for constitutional reforms before the
general elections. All the rallies were broken up by the police.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders urged to change the clause, demanding
the future president get more than 50 percent of the total votes
nationwide, otherwise form a coalition government with other
parties. This has always been refused by Moi.

forces, attributed ADF rebels' disturbances in western Bundibugyo
district since June 16 to poor deployment of the army in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Currently on a three-day tour to the west, the president will
include Bundibugyo and Fort Portal town in his visit.
</P>
<P>
Museveni urged local people to persuade their relatives in ADF
to surrender to the army. Captives will face a trial, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The president had visited the northern areas several times
earlier this year before making the decisive operations against
rebel groups of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) and the Lord
Resistance Army (LRA) in the north.
</P>
<P>
Museveni re-organised the army command in the north and then
launched a series of operations in which the Ugandan army crushed
WNBF and plunged LRA in a great loss later.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President-Elect Holds Talks with Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's President-elect Charles
Taylor Tuesday held extensive deliberations with Sani Abacha,
Nigerian head of state and chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place at the presidential villa in
Abjua, capital of Nigeria, lasted several hours behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
The discussions was believed to have centered on Taylor's
inauguration this Saturday and ECOWAS' role in consolidating the
peace process as well as the country's rehabilitation and
reconstruction ahead of the incoming government, according to
local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It cannot be confirmed whether Taylor's current trip to
Nigeria has anything to do with a thank-you visit, which is seen
to be more appropriate after the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Many observers, however, believe that the president-elect
regards this visit as mandatory because of the prominent role
Nigeria played in bringing peace to Liberia and in ensuring the
democratic election in Liberia taking place successfully on July
19.
</P>
<P>
Similar talks took place when Mrs. Jewel Taylor met Mrs.
Mariam Abacha while their husbands were conferring, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
She thanked Nigeria for "the new dawn in our country" and
specially thanked General Abacha "for ensuring that our election
was conducted without hitches".
</P>
<P>
The Liberian delegation led by Taylor is expected to leave for
Monrovia today.

SINGAPORE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on the
Singapore market after a one-day rise Tuesday, with the benchmark

</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 142.02 million units, valued

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank to Take Measures to Avoid Mark Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank Bundesbank is
ready to raise certain lending rates if the U.S. dollar continues
to rise against the Deutch mark, the financial newspaper
Handelsblatt reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank board at its meeting last Thursday decided to
adopt cautious measures in case of a continuing slide of mark to
avoid a steep jump in interest rates, Hans-Juergen Koebnick, head
of the provincial central bank of Rhineland Palatinate/Saarland,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Koebnick said that the bank would raise lending rates if costs
of imports continued to rise. The slide of mark boosts German
exports but meanwhile makes imports more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Bundesbank's discount and Lombard lending rates have remained
unchanged at 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent respectively since April
1996.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Calls for Creation of Ad Hoc Committee on APLs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has called for the
establishment of a negotiating committee on anti-personnel
landmines (APLs) within the Conference on Disarmament (CD).
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday at the first plenary meeting of the
conference's resumed 1997 session, Ukrainian Permanent
Representative Mykola Maimeskoul said that a committee was
absolutely necessary given that CD members not participating in
the parallel Ottawa process to ban those weapons possessed nearly
half the world's landmine stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
Maimeskoul also told the session about the importance for
Ukraine of the recently concluded partnership agreement with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation between Ukraine and NATO was not
directed against any third party and the partnership was based on
the recognition that the security of European countries was
indivisible.
</P>
<P>
British representative Michael Weston said CD's complementary
work was clearly necessary to bring in those who would not be in
the Canadian capital to finalize a landmine ban in December.
</P>
<P>
He felt deeply regretful that the conference had been unable to
start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Car Sales Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Vietnam have slumped
during the first six months of this year partly due to the over
saturation of the market and a slowdown in the country's economy,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review said in its latest issue that all
of the country's automobile manufacturers have reported plunging
sales for the first half of the year with losses between 15-35
percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales figures in the industry have fallen dramatically
compared to those of last year, with all 9 operating auto
manufacturing firms out of the 14 licensed car joint ventures only
selling 2,545 cars in the period.
</P>
<P>
This is a 20 percent drop, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Motors Corporation, the only company that has
reported a profitable turnover for the last three years, said it
would find it hard to go on this year.

<HEADLINE> France to Withdraw Troops From Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- France will withdraw its 1,400
troops deployed in the Central African Republic, the first step in
reducing by 40 percent its 8,000-strong military presence in
Africa, the daily Le Figaro reported here today.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard, who is now touring
Gabon, Chad and Central African Republic, will announce Thursday
in Bangui the closure of the Bouar military base, one of the six
permanent military bases of France in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The troop reduction does not mean an abandoning of France's
traditional strategic policy toward Africa, as it will keep the
key military bases in Senegal and Djibouti, which are located on
the two extremes of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of troops in Africa also came as part of the plan
by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to cut military
spending in a tightening of public expenditure to reduce the
country's public deficit.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro quoted a Defense Ministry expert as saying that
President Jacques Chirac has personally ordered the maintenance of
French military bases in Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal and the
strategic Red Sea nation of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
France will also keep its 600 troops in Chad, originally
deployed in the "Epervier" operation to fend off pressure from
neighboring Libya, because of the strategic position of Chad and
the perspective of oil development in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Gabon remains a country of strategic importance because of its
rich oil resources in the Guinea Gulf, while Cote d'Ivoire is one
of Africa's most economically prosperous countries.

<HEADLINE> Army Cooperation Between China and Nigeria Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, said here today that the
Chinese armed forces are ready to carry out comprehensive and
diversified co-operation with their Nigerian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and defense minister, made the
remarks in a meeting with Abdul-Salam Abubakar, Nigerian chief of
defense staff and member of Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's current visit shows the emphasis placed by Sani
Abacha, Nigeria's head of state and chairman of the Provisional
Ruling Council, on relationship between the two armed forces, Chi
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the present visit will surely
promote relations between the two countries and the two armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi highly praised the relationship between China and Nigeria,
saying that as developing countries, they have both suffered from
foreign aggression and oppression, and are now faced with the same
task of improving people's living standard and increasing the
national strength.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest developing country, and Nigeria, one
of African big countries, both pursue an independent foreign
policy of peace, and their friendly co-operations are of great
significance to the peace and stability in the world, Chi noted.
</P>
<P>
He also highly appreciated Nigerian government's consistent
adherence to the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that the Nigerian army is willing to draw on
China's experience in army building, which is one of the purposes
of their current visit.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the continuous growth of Sino-Nigerian
co-operation and their mutual support in international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Higher After Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar rebounded
strongly from an initial fall to close higher following the
Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) official cash rate easing to 5.0
percent today.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished in Sydney at 74.62 U.S. cents from
74.69 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The RBA caught some traders by surprise this morning when it
slashed the official cash rate from 5.5 percent to 5.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar lost more than half a U.S. cent
immediately after the rate cut announcement to find a low of 73.95
U.S. cents but rebounded to 74.58 U.S. cents by noon.
</P>
<P>
A Citibank economist said the fact that the Australian dollar
has been able to hold 74.50 U.S. cents after the rate cut suggests
the lows of 73.15 U.S. cents will not be revised in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 88.48 Japanese yen from 86.61, and
at 1.3719 German marks from 1.3543.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Australians were marrying less
but divorcing more, with 52,500 couples splitting up last year,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was the highest number granted since 1976, when
no-fault divorce was introduced and 63,230 marriages ended, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
One in three marriages were now likely to end in divorce within
20 years of marriage, with eight percent over within the first
five years.
</P>
<P>
Divorcees marrying again had the highest risk of divorce, with
a 20 percent risk of splitting up after 10 years, a 35 percent
chance after 20 years and a 42 percent chance after 30 years, the
ABS Marriage and Divorce Report said.
</P>
<P>
About 106,100 marriages were registered last year, a fall of
nearly eight percent over 10 years and the lowest since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Of the population aged over 15 years, 4.4 million, or 31
percent, never married, compared with 25 percent in 1976, and
942,000, or eight percent, were divorced, compared with two
percent in 1976.
</P>
<P>
People were also putting off marriage, with the median age of
first-time brides and grooms up 2.3 years since 1986 to 27.2 years
and 29.6 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the divorced population has
quadrupled, with the median age at divorce 40.2 years for men and
37.4 years for women.
</P>
<P>
More women divorced their husbands (46 percent) than the other
way round (32 percent), with joint applications increasing from

<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has
drafted a bill on the creation of 700,000 jobs for the youth,
which will be presented to parliament in August. The government
will create 350,000 jobs in public sectors for the youth under 26,
with contracts renewable on an annual basis for five years.
</P>
<P>
-- After four months of interruption, Israel and the
Palestinian authorities have decided to resume peace talks from
this week. This came after Israel suspended a permit to build a
new Jewish settlement at Ras el Amud in the Arab district of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Although France remains the most preferred place for
international tourists and international conference, most
foreigners visiting France find French people "self-important,
boastful and little hospitable." The year 1997 could be another
record year for French tourism, as the number of tourists who have
visited France so far this year has increased by 2-3 percent as
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
-- France has decided to withdraw its troops from the Central
African Republic, while keeping those in Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire,
Gabon and Djibouti. Chad could be the next on France's plan of
troop reduction in Africa, which will cut its 8,000-strong
troops in Africa by 40 percent.

NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- German Ambassador Michael Gerdts
said that his country is in full support of Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi's dialogue initiative with the opposition to
solve the constitutional reform problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
Michael Gerdts said that Moi's move of inviting those pressing
for constitutional changes for dialogue is a great opportunity
that must be used at this crucial moment to determine peacefully
the future path of the nation, according to a Kenyan Times report
today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed in a statement Tuesday that all the stakeholders
in Kenyan politics should act maturely now that the door to
dialogue has been opened to pave way for peaceful and meaningful
changes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "The way into the future should be determined in a
cooperative effort of all groupings of the Kenyan society," he
noted, adding that it is time for confidence-building and joining
of forces across tribal and political lines.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government softened its originally hard stance on
constitutional reforms and pledged to hold talks with the
opposition after 13 people were killed on July 7 around the
country in clashes between the police and pro-reform demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders urged to change the clause, demanding
the future president get more than 50 percent of the total votes
nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with other
parties.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Faces Worse Maize Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's maize shortage has been
worsened because of outflow of local maize, Zambian Minister for
Agriculture Edith Nawakwi said in Central Province Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted the minister as saying that the
government had warned local farmers not to sell their staple food
of maize in view of the shortage, but some farmers have already
sold their stocks at cheaper rates to those who managed to export
it to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
She said if the government has money, the Food Reserve Agency
(FRA) would have bought the local maize.
</P>
<P>
The minister could not rule out high prices for mealie meal
since the prices of maize will shoot up when supply runs out to
many milling firms.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said Zambia needs about five million bags of maize (90
kilo per bag) to cover the shortage and expressed fears that by
the time the Finance Ministry releases the money to FRA, the
local maize stocks would have been depleted already.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which had earlier pledged to sell Zambia 120,000
tons of maize, has reduced the allocation to 50,000 tons because
there would be a serious maize shortfall in Zimbabwe's southern
region.

<HEADLINE> North Jiangsu Draws More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The northern part of east China's
Jiangsu Province, formerly an underdeveloped part of this region,
has become a new destination for overseas investment as a result
of its abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, a number of Sino-overseas joint
ventures have located in the area, mainly in Xuzhou, Yancheng and
Lianyungang cities.
</P>
<P>
The financing has been centered on the food industry, since the
northern part of Jiangsu Province is an important producer of
grain, poultry and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Lianyungang, for instance, has spent 200 million yuan in
establishing vegetable processors with overseas companies. These
joint ventures have an annual processing capacity of 35,000
tons. The products are exported to more than 20 foreign countries
and regions, earning 3.6 million US dollars in sales annually.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic products have been another focal point for overseas
investors, mainly from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. The majority
of the processed sea products are aimed at overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The exports of processed lobsters by a large local
Sino-overseas joint venture, Baolong Co., registered 2,400 tons
annually, ranking first in the province.
</P>
<P>
Township and village-based Sino-foreign joint ventures have
been a driving force in drawing foreign investment. In Yancheng,
800 township joint ventures have attracted a total investment of
300 million US dollars. In the first quarter of this year, they
earned 1.54 billion yuan in exports, an increase of 18.2 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
While in Xuzhou, the largest city in the area, local township
and village-based Sino-overseas joint ventures exported 4.3
billion yuan-worth of industrial and farm products in 1996, up
20.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of these joint ventures has invigorated the
development of agricultural and aquatic production sectors in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Pledges to Revive Loss-Making State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The central government is
determined to fulfill its target of establishing a modern
enterprise system for state-owned firms, and to extricate most of
the firms from the loss-making cycle within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, issued the pledge during a July 18-24 fact-finding tour
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhu visited well over a dozen state enterprises and held
extensive discussions with local officials and factory
employees. He also praised local governments for their efforts and
achievements in assisting state firms facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that helping most state firms escape the current
difficult situations and equipping them with a modern enterprise
system is well within the realm of possibility if the nation
faithfully carries out the policies of the CPC Central Committee
and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called on state enterprises to further improve
their leadership by appointing qualified factory directors and
company managers, adopt a market strategy and introduce innovative
management mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called for "increased mergers, standardized
bankruptcies, improved efficiency, more reemployment programs and
laying off excess workers".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that various means, including direct financing,
can be used to help state companies raise capital and reduce
debts.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Disease Affects Uganda's 12 Districts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Twelve of Uganda's 27 coffee
growing districts have been affected by the coffee wilt disease,
reported the local daily "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
Specioza Kazibwe, Uganda's Vice-President and Agricultural
Minister, was quoted as saying that the disease, which only
affects robusta coffee in Uganda, has caused an average loss of 5
to 10 percent in Uganda's coffee production since it was first detected
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kabibwe warned that the loss is likely to continue unless
appropriate control measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda Coffee Development Authority, over 200,000
U.S. Dollars have been spent since 1993 on surveillance, staff
training and destruction of affected coffee trees.
</P>
<P>
A coffee research center has been established at Mukono in
eastern Uganda to make research more responsive to sector needs
and to enable stakeholders participate in the management and
financing of coffee research.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's annual coffee production is about 4.1 million bags
(60 kilogram per bag), making it the seventh largest coffee
producer in the world.

<HEADLINE> Prehistoric Mound Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A 5,000-square-meter prehistoric
mound dating back to the Stone Age has been discovered in Yongning
County in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time I have seen such a large-scale mound in
inland area instead of near the sea," said an archaeologist from
the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
A "shell mound," also called a "midden", is formed by all sorts
of waste disposed of by ancient people. Such mounds provide
valuable information about geography, prehistoric animals,
prehistoric man and many other aspects of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
The mound, which was unearthed in April, has been listed as one
of the ten archaeological projects to be explored by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) this year.
</P>
<P>
After three months' work, the mound has proved to be the
largest and best-preserved in Guangxi, according to Fu Xianguo
from the Archaeology Research Institute of CASS.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have learned that eastern section of the heap
was used as a living area for the prehistoric humans, while the
western part was the garbage area and graveyard.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the more than 180 complete human skeletons and
large quantities of animal bones found in the mound offer abundant
material for the study of the origin of the Zhuang ethnic minority
and its ecological environment. These items can also reveal the
cultural exchanges between prehistoric humans in south China and
southeast Asia, they said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Muslim Rebels Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today resumed their
low-level peace talks which have been stalled by recent fighting
between the two sides in southern Mindanao Island.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, which started late this morning in Cotabato
city, capital of Maguindanao province, is the sixth round between
the technical committees from both sides on the cessation of
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The government peace panel was led by Maj. Gen. Joselin
Nazareno while MILF's legal counsel Omar Ompar acted as chief
rebel negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda is to formalize ground rules and formulate
guidelines on the implementation of the Manila-MILF general
ceasefire agreement forged on July 18 to end weeks of renewed
clashes in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss the formation of a joint general
ceasefire committee that will monitor violations of the agreed
truce.
</P>
<P>
Also to be tackled during the meeting is the present situation
of the thousands of evacuees displaced by the recent fighting in
Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
The MILF postponed the sixth round of peace talks with Manila
late last month after the military overran its second biggest camp
in Cotabato province in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF agreed to return to the negotiating table after
the government troops withdrew from the camp as demanded by the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway group of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), which had already signed a peace deal
with the government last September.
</P>
<P>
The government also seeks to forge a similar peace agreement
with the MILF to end its decades of separatist movement in the
southern Philippines. The two sides began exploratory peace talks
this January.

<HEADLINE> Steady Growth for China's Exports in January-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China recorded steady growth in
exports during the first six months of the year, with a total
volume of 80.8 billion US dollars, up 26 percent over the same
1996 period, a senior government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign trade grew 13 percent to 143.8 billion US
dollars, with imports remaining at last year's level, and the
country recorded a trade surplus of 17.8 billion US dollars, Hu
Zhaoqing, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves ended the period at 120.9
billion US dollars, up 15.9 billion US dollars over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
"This year's foreign trade rapid growth was in comparison with
the small growth in the same 1996 period, hence it is a
restoration growth," Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, general trade exports soared 33 percent to 349
billion US dollars, with processing trade exports rising 20
percent to 43 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Meets Pro-Israeli SLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai met with Gen. Antoine Lahad, commander of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA), in Tel Aviv Tuesday night,
a move apparently aimed at assuring him of Israel's full support
at a time when the SLA morale has sunk to a new low.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told reporters before the meeting with Lahad that
he would be discussing with his guest ways of improving the
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as fighting was continuing in the
Israel-occupied south Lebanese "security zone," according to a
report of the state-run Israel Radio. Hezbollah (Party of God)
guerrilla gunmen launched attacks with mortars and machine guns
at four separate SLA positions in the eastern and western
sectors of the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has recently intensified its psychological war
against the SLA as a part of its ongoing efforts to disintegrate
the allied forces of Israel and bring about the collapse of the
"security zone."
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Beirut, Mohammed Ra'ad, a member
of parliament from Hezbollah, introduced a bill calling for an
amnesty to be granted to SLA officers and soldiers who desert.
</P>
<P>
He unveiled details of the bill at a press conference in
Beirut, saying that it would encourage SLA soldiers and officers
to "surrender themselves" to the Lebanese authorities, without
fear of being put on trial for collaborating with the "Zionist
enemy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lahad was quoted in Lebanese newspapers last week
as saying that he was "ready to negotiate with the Lebanese
authorities or any of its representatives to withdraw from
Jezzine and hand over the district." The Christian enclave is
controlled by troops loyal to the SLA commander.
</P>
<P>
However, Lahad has been tried in absentia by a military court
in Beirut and convicted of treason against the Lebanese state,
because of his ties to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese daily As-Safir quoted a unidentified government
official as saying that the authorities would have no dealings
with Lahad.

<HEADLINE> Umbilical Cord Vein Transplantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at Ruijin Hospital, an
affiliate of Shanghai No.2 Medical University, recently completed
the successful transplantation of an umbilical cord vein into the
leg of a woman suffering with a veno-occlusive leg.
</P>
<P>
The middle-aged rural woman from east China's Zhejiang Province
was unable to walk because of a severely swollen left leg. Doctors
attributed the swelling to a blocked vein running from the upper
thigh to the abdominal cavity.
</P>
<P>
The woman sought help at Ruijin Hospital after a year-long
treatment program in large hospitals in Hangzhou and Shanghai
failed to provide relief.
</P>
<P>
Professors Li Hongwei and Dai Kunyang with the Ruijin
hospital's Department of Vascular Surgery decided to bridge the
femoral vein with an umbilical cord vein rather than an artificial
vein.
</P>
<P>
The swelling gradually disappeared and the woman regained her
ability to walk, according to today's Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that artificial veins used for this particular
type of surgery are both expensive and sometimes fail to achieve
desired results. On the other hand, using umbilical cord veins
lowers medical costs and yields better results.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR to Repatriate 90,000 Congolese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Tanzania is working
round the clock to facilitate the repatriation of more than
90,000 Congolese refugees currently in the country.
</P>
<P>
This follows an agreement between the governments of Tanzania
and the Democratic Republic of Congo to effect the repatriation
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR external relations official, Vincent Kwesi Parker,
told reporters here Tuesday that following a join communique
issued by President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and his Congolese
counterpart Laurent Kabila on the need to repatriate Congolese
refugees at the end of the civil war in democratic Congo, UNHCR
was working with the two governments to ensure that the refugees
be safely repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Due to the complicated exercise involved in assembling
refugees from different parts of Tanzania, Parker said, it was
not easy to say exactly when the repatriation would start.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, funds for the repatriation of more than
90,000 refugees would be provided by the UNHCR repatriation
budget.
</P>
<P>
Judith Mtawali, Director of Immigration of Tanzania, said that
the repatriation work would start any time from now on after the
signing of a tripartite agreement between Tanzania,the Democratic
Republic of Congo and the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Basically all the necessary negotiations among the parties
concerned were over and that action would follow soon, she said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is sheltering 90,000 to 1000,000 Congolese refugees
who had fled former Zaire during the civil war between Laurent
Kabila's forces and army loyal to former President Mobutu Sese
Seko.

<P>
NANJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The city of Suzhou in east China's
Jiangsu Province, an ancient production center for Chinese silk
and satin, is striving to step up the economic development.
</P>
<P>
The old part of the city is 2,500 years old and is also known
as a favorite scenic spot of tourists. The local government has
drafted guidelines for the economic development which offer
protection for cultural relics and traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Suzhou began to readjust the industrial structures in
the old part of the city. The old, environmentally-friendly
handicraft mills have remained untouched, while factories of other
industries have been moved to a new industrial park east of the
old city area.
</P>
<P>
The city's renovation program has involved 37 projects with a
total investment of six billion yuan. So far, 30 of them are
operational, claiming three billion yuan of the total funds.
</P>

The industrial park has approved the establishment of 91
overseas-funded enterprises, of which 38 are already in
operation. They include businesses set up by 18 of the world's 500
largest international enterprises. The individual cost for each
project averages 30 million US dollars. Among them, seven projects
are worth over one billion US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new district has been set up in the west wing of
the city where a total of some 280 projects are located, including
101 overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded projects in the city have brought good returns
to Suzhou. Foreign investment has mainly been channeled into
hi-tech industries ranging from electronics and pharmaceutical
production to precision mechanics.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in the first half of this year, the
production value of industrial enterprises at or above
township-level in the city jumped up 21.4 percent over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech industries now stand as pillars of the city's economic
growth. Their share in the city's industrial sector increased to
the present 50 percent from 10 percent in 1991. The sales of each
of the 44 name-brand products in Suzhou amount to over 100 million
yuan annually.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) will spend 2.2 million U.S.Dollars and employ
satellite mapping technology in a broad campaign to clear
landmines throughout the subcontinent, an official said in
Gaborone yesterday.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said the 12-country
organisation would begin a ''systematic'' landmine clearing
campaign in several countries, including Mozambique and Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC would approach its problem in a ''systematic''
manner, unlike the U.N., which he accused of clearing landmines
on an ''ad hoc basis''.
</P>
<P>
''We want a regional approach to the issue,'' he said, adding,
''We tend to differ with the U.N.on various priority issues.''
</P>
<P>
The SADC expects to use satellite technology to map out
landmines laid during various conflicts, and determine ''a
precise figure of landmines in the region'', the executive
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Angola and Mozambique were among the most heavily landmine
infested countries in the world, with more buried mines than
citizens. An unclear number of landmines haved also been laid in
Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa among other countries.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China City Increases Pollution Control Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's city of Kunming
is increasing its pollution control efforts in Dianchi Lake to
welcome the World Gardening Exposition to be held here in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exposition is the first of its kind in the country, and is
also the only large-scale international activity to be held in
China at the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi Lake, near this capital city of Yunnan Province, is the
country's best-known freshwater lake. It is also the only lake in
the city that collects wastewater, taking in more than 200 million
tons of wastewater every year. As a result, the pollution problem
has been serious in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the city has spent 243 million yuan (about
30.4 million US dollars) to upgrade the lake's self-purification
capacity. Meanwhile, three sewage treatment plants capable of
handling over 200,000 tons of wastewater daily have been put into
operation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a project using 2.2 billion yuan of World Bank
loans has been started to set up waterworks, garbage disposal
plants and sewage treatment factories.
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to spend 200 million yuan in diverting 50
million cubic meters of water to guarantee a supply of drinking
water to 800,000 people in order to ease the pressure on Dianchi
Lake.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Areas Remains Hot for Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Coastal Areas of China keeps
their attraction to overseas investors, despite the decrease of
foreign investment in the first six months this year, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China has approved 9,763
overseas-invested enterprises, with a total contractual volume of
overseas capital reaching 22.9 billion US dollars. Both figures
were lower than those of the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said here today at a press conference that
the shrink of overseas investment for this period is "reasonable",
and it represents the matching of the current foreign trade
policies with the country's macro-economic control methods.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the investment from abroad is not in fact
slipping, since China adopts the measure which provides a
transitional period and an extension of time limit.
</P>
<P>
Bonded areas, where many overseas-invested enterprises are
located, saw a common increase in the use of overseas investment
this period while there was a fall nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Eight projects, which were approved in the first five months
this year, topped over 100 million US dollars each in investment,
lifting the number of its kind three times than the same period
of last year. The injected capital for those contracts totaled
1.7 billion US dollars, also up 3.7 times.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the number of overseas-invested enterprises
in China reached 293,556 with the contractual volume of overseas
capital amounting to 492.2 billion US dollars, and a total of
197.9 billion US dollars has been put into use.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly approved overseas-funded businesses, the
Sino-overseas equity joint ventures accounted for 43 percent,
Sino-overseas contractual joint venture, 11 percent, and wholly
overseas-funded businesses, 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hu introduced China's trial on joint trading companies. So far
two companies of this kind have received certificates from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation with another
two having passed the examination by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, a total of 13 countries and
some international financial institutions provided funding for 47
Chinese projects by way of loans.

<HEADLINE> Iran Likely to Have First Woman Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami is reportedly to appoint a woman as a vice-president in
his cabinet in fulfillment of his election promises, an official
daily disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Iran Daily reported that Ms. Zahra
Rahnavard is favored for the post of vice-president for women's
affairs.
</P>
<P>
If this comes true, it will be the first time for a woman to
hold such a high level post in the Islamic Republic since its
founding in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held shortly after his landslide victory
in the May 23 presidential election, Khatami said it is possible
for a woman to hold a post in his new government.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian women had played a big part in the presidential
election and the majority of them had turned out to vote for
Khatami in a bid to seek more freedom and equality in the Islamic
society.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Hassan Habibi is to be renominated as
first vice-president to ensure continuation of the development
programs of the outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoting the informed sources added that Vice-
President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi, who is brother
of Rafsanjani, will likely maintain his position and Mohammad Ali
Najafi, currently Minister of Education, could take over as head
of the Plan and Budget Organization.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Hashemi Taba, vice-president and head of Physical
Education Organization, will probably retain his post, though
others are also in the race.
</P>
<P>
They include Esmail Davoudi Shamsi, former Majlis deputy and
head of Physical Education Organization, and Nasrollah Sajadi,
former head of the national Olympics committee.
</P>
<P>
The daily disclosed Tuesday that Iran's Permanent
Representative at the United Nations Kamal Kharrazi will be the
next foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
According the report, Moussavi Khoeiniha will head the
Information Ministry, Admiral Ali Shamkhani will be the Defense
Ministry, Behzad Nabavi will take over Oil Ministry, Abdolvahed
Mousavi Lari for the Ministry of Culture, Mohammad Farhadi for
the Ministry of Education.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Sustains Sanctions Against Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian leaders Tuesday
reiterated that their country will not unilaterally lift the
regional sanctions against Burundi, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ethiopian President Negasso Ghidada and
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi as telling visiting Burundian
military leader Pierre Buyoya Tuesday that sanctions will remain
in place.
</P>
<P>
Regional African countries including Ethiopia have launched a
road, lake and air transport embargo ever since Buyoya, a former
army major, ousted a civilian government with the backing of the
Tutsi-dominated army a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was relaxed in April, with regional leaders still
pressing Buyoya to negotiate with the Hutu-led rebel National
Council for the Defense of Democracy (NCDD) to end political and
ethnic strife that has claimed more than 150,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides have been arranged for early
August in Arusha, north Tanzania, with both Buyoya and the Hutu
rebel NCDD having agreed to participate.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Firm on Hemispherical Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Brazilian official today called
for speedy pan-American integration and accused the United States
of "protectionism" in trade practices across the continent.
</P>
<P>
At a hemispherical meeting here on promoting trade ties, Jose
Botafogo, head of the Brazilian delegation, said his country will
examine U.S. protectionist practices "with care."
</P>
<P>
Officials from 34 countries began a three-day meeting today on
building the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, which
was proposed by the United States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and trade officials will study an agenda and a
timetable for talks on creating the FTAA, and pave the way for a
continental summit next April in Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
In an open row with the United States and Canada, Botafogo,
head of Brazil's delegation to FTAA talks, insisted that an
integration agreement should only be sealed after all aspects of
trade liberalization are examined, including agricultural issues,
the major concern of Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the U.S. and Canadian proposal to open up the
industrial market as soon as possible, he said the integration
process should take into account the uneven development of various
countries and the problems of smaller economies, such as the
Caribbean and Central American ones.
</P>
<P>
Botafogo, also representing his country at the South American
Common Market (Mercosur), said the Mercosur countries --
Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- worry that immediate
tariff reductions could jeopardize the industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
Calling the United States and Canada "pockets of
protectionism," Botafogo said their practices are contradictory to
the integration process, in which the equilibrium of advantages
and costs is fundamental.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Jose Manuel
Salazar said the biggest challenge now is to reach an agreement on
a document that will "define exactly what to negotiate and how to
negotiate it."
</P>
<P>
The lives of close to 800 million people will be affected in
one way or another with the formation of the free trade zone from
Canada to Argentina, Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial level meeting on FTAA talks is scheduled for
opening here next March.

<HEADLINE> India to Relax Import Restrictions on Fabrics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- India plans to relax import
restrictions on fabrics and made-ups from 1998 by putting their
import on the Open General License (OGL) as part of its phase-out
package on removal of quantitative restrictions, a Textile
Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the imports of textile products such as fabrics
and made-ups, are allowed against Special Import License (SIL),
which has been seen by developed countries as a quantitative
restriction.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union have been pressuring
India to allow imports of textile products, along with other
products, without linking them to any kind of import license.
Japan also told India that it did not consider the liberalization
of imports by means of SIL as an elimination of the restrictions
in the meaning of World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.
</P>

Though India has scrapped quantitative restrictions on 542
tariff lines in its new export import policy, the Commerce
Ministry intended to offer a schedule for phasing out quantitative
restrictions on imports to WTO during the dispute settlement
consultations, which are expected to be held in the first week of
August this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
India is one of the countries in the world to have quantitative
restrictions. The restricted import list mainly includes consumer
goods, agricultural products, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
WTO, the U.S. and European countries have been pressuring India
to open up its markets, particularly the consumer goods market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Industrial Workers on 24-hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's trade union alliance
today enforced a 24-hour strike across the country to press for
minimum salary.
</P>
<P>
The Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (SKOP), an apex body of 17
national trade unions including the labor fronts of the ruling and
opposition parties, called the strike to realize its eight-point
demand.
</P>
<P>
Mills factories, industrial establishments and all modes of
transport would come under the purview of the strike, said Wazedul
Islam Khan, the SKOP coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The eight-point demand includes minimum wage of 3,000 taka
(about 69 U.S. dollars) per month, stoppage of privatization of
mills and factories and retrenchment, reopening of closed mills
and factories and job guarantee in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The SKOP in a statement Tuesday night regretted that the body
was forced go ahead with the strike program despite talks with the
government, which they said lacked specific commitment.
</P>
<P>
Today's nationwide strike is the first labor strike since the
Awami (people's) League government came to power on June 24 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The three-day campus strike in Dhaka University was
called off Tuesday night following the signing of an agreement
between the university authorities and the opposition students
group.
</P>
<P>
Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the students front of the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, enforced the nonstop strike Sunday
protesting "capture" of Suryasen Hall by ruling party's students
wing last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Campus sources said that the university authorities have agreed
to vacate Suryasen Hall today and allow the genuine students to
enter the hall after checking their identity cards.

<HEADLINE> Prices of 500 Products to Rise in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- As many as 500 consumer products
are in line for price rises as a result of the floating of the
baht on July 2, a Thai Internal Trade Department source said
today.
</P>
<P>
The baht has since depreciated 24 percent against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of some consumer products have asked the
department for a price rise citing depleting stocks of existing
products and increased cost of imported raw materials.
</P>
<P>
They had earlier agreed to maintain old prices for one to two
months.
</P>
<P>
Price rises are to spread over 30 categories of consumer goods
and include wheat flour, coffee, plastic pellet, diesel, gasoline,
vehicles, fish meal, soybean meal and maize, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of rice have already been rising gradually, to avoid
abrupt pain to customers.
</P>
<P>
The price of fragrant rice in 5-kg bags has increased from 93
baht to 100 baht (2.9 - 3.12 U.S. dollars) since last week, an
increase of about 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rice prices are not controlled by the Committee of Price Fixing
and Anti-monopoly.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Missouri Senator John Ashcroft
is considering a race for the Republican presidential nomination
in 2000, Republican sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ashcroft's office had little to say about possible presidential
ambitions. "Sen. Ashcroft will have no comment on the issue until
he is in Missouri during the August recess at the earliest," a
spokesman was quoted as saying by new reports.
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the Ashcroft camp said the senator has
met in the last several months with conservative grass roots
leaders and Republican media consultants and strategists from past
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Ashcroft, 55, was elected to the Senate in 1994 after serving
two terms as Missouri's governor. He has since surfaced as a
forceful advocate of term limits on lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming August congressional recess, Ashcroft is
expected to make several trips, including possibly to early
primary and caucus states such as New Hampshire and Louisiana.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, a deputy
governor of the Bank of Thailand, has been appointed governor to
replace Rerngchai Marakanond, who resigned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat, 51, joined the central bank in 1973, and became a
deputy governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He was also director or executive director at several
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Monday, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
blamed the central bank for the country's present economic
problems. However, Rerngchai said he resigned under "political
pressure."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chatumongol Sonakul, permanent secretary for the
Finance Ministry, has also been moved to become a special adviser
to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
refused to discuss Chatumongol's transfer, saying only that it was
necessary to enhance "working unity" at the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The local press quotes cabinet members as saying that
Chatumongol was removed because he had refused to respond
positively to the government's policy and lacked respect for the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat's appointment and Chatumongol's removal were ordered
by the prime minister at a cabinet meeting held in Chiang Rai on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Coal Production On Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Coal production in Indonesia
increased to 47.3 million tons last year from 14.1 million tons in
1991, rising by an average of 28.5 percent annually due to
increasing demand in power generation for the material in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent edition of Data Consult's Indonesian
commercial News Letter, coal production in Indonesia in the first
three months of this year was 11.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Data Consult, the increase in production was
mainly due to rising demand for the commodity on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Production is expected to drastically increase if the
government implements its policy to use coal to replace fuel oil
as an energy source, it said.
</P>
<P>
Total domestic sales of coal in Indonesia stood at 10.5 million
tons in 1996, while coal exports reached 32.8 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Continue to Aid Albania After Withdrawal of MPF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today that Italy will continue to offer aid to Albania after
the pullout of the Italian-led Multinational Protection Force
(MPF) from the chaos-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a welcoming ceremony held in Brindisi, a port city
in southern Italy, for the return of some Italian soldiers from
Albania, Prodi said, "Italy will not abandon Albania."
</P>
<P>
"Italy will offer Albania a comprehensive, generous and timely
aid including the arrangement of a timely return of Albanian
refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said although some people had not been optimistic about
the success of the MPF mission in Albania, the MPF did help the
Albanian people reestablish confidence in the country's bright
future.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deployed a 7,000-strong multinational force in Albania
in April to help protect the supply of humanitarian aid and
maintain law and order in the country which was plunged into chaos
in February.
</P>
<P>
Albania's general elections held at the end of June were seen
as a key step to end months of violence, which had been triggered
by the collapse of popular pyramid savings schemes last December.
</P>
<P>
Italy, who contributed 2,500 soldiers to the MPF, announced
early this month that it would begin to withdraw its troops on
July 18 and planned to finish the withdrawal by August 10. Other
countries decided to pull out their troops on July 20.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Italian President Oscar Scalfaro
praised Prodi for making a firm decision at a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Italian Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta said on the
occasion that Italy will continue to offer military help to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian army will send military delegations to help
Albania reestablish its army," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Italian News Agency Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associatta
quoted a military source as saying today that the Italian army
would send 500 to 600 officers to Albania to act as advisers or
instructors after the two countries reach a common understanding
on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Six Runaways Multiplied to Deer Herd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A herd of about 150 wild deer,
found in the Weide Mountains in east China's Shandong Province,
have been proved to be descendents of six artificially bred deer,
which escaped in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Experts claimed all the deer in the forest were naturally bred
and are living well, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local environmental protection agency said
the herd originated from six deer that were artificially bred at
Dashankou Forestry Farm, at the foot of the Weide Mountains, in
the 1970s. The deer escaped and fled to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Since then there have been sporadic reports of deer in the
forest. Stretching hundreds of kilometers along the coast, the
Weide Mountains have dense forests that provide a favourable
natural environment for wildlife, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The local Rongcheng municipal government encircled the mountain
areas this month as a wild animal reserve to protect the deer.
</P>
<P>
Wild deer are under the first-class State protection.
</P>
<P>
Wild animal experts said research on the deer, artificially
bred and then returned to the wild, was significant.
</P>
<P>
The Rongcheng municipal government has organized experts to
investigate the deer.
</P>
<P>
No one believed there were wild deer in Shandong Province over
the past several decades.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Ban Hospital Overcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing hospitals are working
against an October deadline to end overcharges for medicines and
expensive, unnecessary physical examinations, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 600 hospitals involved are permitted to raise fees for
technical services such as clinical consultations and surgery, but
are prohibited to profit from prescribing and selling excessive
medicines and giving unnecessary examinations.
</P>
<P>
Charges for physical examinations with special, medical
facilities must drop by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents whose incomes fall below the lowest level set
by the municipal government and childless elderly residents are to
be given 20 to 50 percent discounts for physical examinations and
surgical operations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Further, 10 percent of hospital earnings from clinical
consultations are to be set aside to fund medical research.
</P>
<P>
The reform, which is to be completed by the end of October, is
a response to the call by the central government to limit the
rapid rise of medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's action follows the successful examples offered by
Shanghai, a pilot project municipality, and a few provinces that
have been participating in the pilot project.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health opened the campaign to end practices of
a number of hospitals that frequently over-prescribed medicines
and conducted expensive physical examinations using new,
sophisticated equipment in order to compensate for low prices and
fees charged for consultations and complicated treatments
requiring special equipment.

<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China will try to stop pollution
and other man-made damage to its environment by the year 2000,
according to one of the nation's top ecological protection
officials.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuqing, deputy-director of the National Environmental
Protection Agency (Nepa), yesterday told the second National
Conference on Nature Conservation that environmental officials
should be responsible for supervising the exploitation and use of
natural resources and help the government examine construction
projects, policy-making and planning of resource exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting opened in Dalian, a port city of Liaoning
Province in northeast China, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Plans for development and environmental protection should
include the construction of nature reserves and zones for
ecologically-friendly agriculture, today's "China Daily"
quoted Wang as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nepa has approved the establishment of 105 zones to experiment
in ecologically friendly agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation among different departments, including those in
charge of planning, finance, agriculture, forestry, water
resources, land and ocean, are also needed, while steady
investment in nature conservation and ecological construction
should be guaranteed and increased, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
But reducing ecological damage in the next three years will be
difficult because a great deal of the environment is being damaged
during the country's rapid economic development, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said governments should establish an effective supervision
and management system for ecology protection.
</P>
<P>
China still does not have enough laws to protect its
environment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Spends 1 Billion U.S. Dollars to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, spent as much as 1 billion U.S. dollars to intervene
in currency markets to support the rupiah in the past week, the
Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far released one billion U.S. dollars to help
stabilize the rupiah's value which was weakened by an attack by
money market speculators," central bank governor Soedradjad
Djiwandono said here Tuesday at a workshop on investment funds.
</P>
<P>
All the intervention had been carried out in forward markets,
and as a result, there would be no depletion to Bank Indonesia's
foreign reserves, provided the rupiah continued to strengthen, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia entered the market on July 22 when the rupiah
bottomed at 2,662.50 to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trading saw the U.S. dollar fall to 2,575.50 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also increased the spread band of the
rupiah exchange rate against the U.S. dollar from eight to 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of May, Bank Indonesia had about 21 billion U.S.
dollars in reserve.

JAKARTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia wants to buy 20 jet
fighters after the proposed purchase for nine F-16s from the U.S.
had been canceled, Air Force Chief of Staff Marshall Sutria
Tubagus said.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally we have to buy a squadron or 20 aircraft," Sutria said

</P>
<P>
But the purchase would depend on the government's finances, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has already purchased 40 Hawk-100/200 aircraft, of
which 24 have arrived.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia decided not to buy the nine F-16s from the U.S. after
Washington tried to tie the purchase with the human rights issue.

<P>
BEIJING, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The leading national newspaper frontpaged a report of a
series entitled "People's army loyal to the Party" to mark the the
70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
-- An editorial on the front page urged a comprehensive effort
to push forward the reform of the country's old-age insurance
system. It says a unified old-age insurance system is good for
deepening the reforms of enterprises and for establishing a modern
enterprise system as well as rational floating of workers.
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily" (overseas edition)
</P>
<P>
-- A Chinese carrier rocket Long March 3b (LM 3b) was recently
positioned in the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in southwest
China's Sichuan Province to launch two satellites.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the LM 3b has made an appearance since it
failed to send a communications satellite into orbit on February
15 last year.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China must accelerate its reform of the social insurance
and set up a unified old-age system, State Councillor Li
Tieying said yesterday at a national conference on the old-age
insurance of the workers.
</P>
<P>
All factory workers of the state-owned firms and other
enterprises should be covered by an old-age insurance plan, Li
said at the meeting sponsored by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The existing old-age insurance system only covers those working
in state firms, and the majority of the employees in
overseas-funded and private companies still are not covered,
according to Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
-- China's Defense Minister yesterday reiterated that the
country plans to build a powerful defense sector in line with the
theories of late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, as
well as the relevant directives of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Chi also stressed that the Chinese armed forces should be
substantially improved and follow a development road that reflects
China's unique characteristics, so as to strengthen its combat
effectiveness in the age of high technology.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Hong Kong's high court acknowledged yesterday the legality
of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), whose competence has
been questioned by several lawyers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy verdict, Chief Justice of the High Court Patrick
Chan said that the legality of PLC cannot be challenged in the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region because it was set up by
the Preparatory Committee, authorized by the National People's
Congress to make preparations for the handover of Hong Kong,
establishment of the SAR government, and the first Legislative
Council of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
an expanded Asean will be more closely connected with China and
Hong Kong will serve as a unique bridge for deepening friendship
and cooperation between the two.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great importance for us to hold dialogues once again
and exchange views on how to further consolidate and develop
Sino-Asean ties," said Qian at the two-day Post Ministerial
Conference of the 30th Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Ministerial Meeting ended yesterday in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Experts Meet on Drug Fighting in Americas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Experts from 34 countries in
North and South America began a four-day meeting here today to
seek efficient ways fighting against illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
The experts, summoned by the Organization of American States
(OAS), will discuss an anti-drug strategy for the continent and
new programs on reducing drug abuse and drug prevention.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, the first of the kind, Julio Araoz,
program secretary for the prevention of drug addiction and the war
against drugs in Argentina, said real and permanent success in the
anti-drug war requires profound changes in the modern culture.
</P>
<P>
The increase in drug consumption and drug-related crimes, Araoz
said, is not due to natural causes, but because of the human
culture that goes beyond a personal illness.
</P>
<P>
"They are grave symptoms of a severe social disease that stems
from the modern culture, in which individualism, the culture of
materialism and consumerism appears to be more important than the
culture of being," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine official called for greater respect for the
values of life, solidarity and social justice.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis to Shut Down 8,000 Schools in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government under
mounting financial pressures plans to shut down 8,000 middle
schools by the end of 1997, a spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Nikolaenko, of the National Education Committee, said
the 1997 budget allocates 4.1 billion hryvnas (about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars) to the education sector while the Education Ministry
needs at least 10 billion hryvnas (5.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, Nikolaenko told a news conference, 164 vocational
schools and 120 technical schools have already been closed.
</P>
<P>
This year, technical schools and universities will cut
recruitment by 10 percent and 20 percent respectively, leaving
70,000 high school graduates outside colleges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the government has not paid teachers for over
four months, high school and university teachers have protested
several times in front of the parliamentary building since early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Many of the teachers have to sell clothes or stockings at
subway stations to make ends meet, the spokesman said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Exports of the ten most
important Brazilian agricultural products totaled 6.55 billion
U.S. dollars during the first semester of this year, an increase
of 33.3 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Those products included soybeans, chicken, tobacco, coffee,
sugar and orange juice which accounted for 26.45 percent of the
24.787 billion dollars worth of goods shipped abroad by Brazil,
said the Ministry of industry, Commerce and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Overseas sales of soybeans and coffee reached 4.582 billion
dollars during the period, an increase of 60 percent over the
figure for the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in coffee bean export revenues was attributed by
the ministry to the 25 percent hike in international prices, which
rose from 148 to 185 dollars per 60-kilogram sack.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loss was reported in orange juice, which dropped
32.86 percent during the first semester of this year compared
with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Orange juice revenues totaled 431 million dollars.

ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian forward Nwankwo Kanu was
optimistic for his future in Inter Milan when he was interviewed
Tuesday by Corriere dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
"I think that in about a couple of weeks I'll be ready." Kanu
was quoted as saying, "In this season I have great goals. I want
to win the league title."
</P>
<P>
But Kanu was not too confident about his position in Inter.
Except Ronaldo, who is likely to take one of the two forward
positions, Inter Milan has three other star forwards -- Chilean
striker Ivan Zamorano, Italian forwards Maurizio Ganz and Marco
Branca. Kanu will have to fight for a starting position.
</P>
<P>
Almost a year ago, the former Ajax star was diagnosed with
congenital heart disease by the medical staff of Internazionale of
Milan. He passed a fitness test which allowed him to play only

MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Chile in 1997 will become the second largest
market for Argentine exports after Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Argentine sales to Chile which reached 1.765 billion dollars
in 1996, consisted mainly of petroleum and gas (46 percent)
followed by meat and soybean.
</P>
<P>
Argentina exported more goods to Chile because of the stronger
political and economic relations between Santiago and the Mercosur
(Southern Common Market).
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- The Colombian government will allocate 67
billion pesos (about 67 million dollars) to foster the building of
low-income housing units, announced Economic Development Minister
Orlando Cabrales Martinez.
</P>
<P>
The official informed that the government will spur the
building of low-income housing in the regions with the highest
unemployment levels as part of its program to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Ten percent of 890,000 tons of the annual
production of Mexican pork is exported to South Korea, Japan and
the United States, said Antonio Cannon Sasia, president of the
National Hog Growers Congress.
</P>

Mexican hog growers in those countries.

WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved
financing for school rehabilitation and health care development
projects in Romania and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is to provide a 70 million U.S. dollar loan to
help finance a school rehabilitation project in Romania that will
repair about 900 seriously damaged pre-university schools, mostly
in rural areas, in support of the government's education reform
program.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is about 130 million dollars. In
addition to the Bank's loan, the Government of Romania will
contribute some 46.2 million dollars and the Council of Europe
Social Development Fund will offer 13.8 million dollars
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
Since Romania joined the World Bank in 1972, Bank commitments
total 4.8 billion dollars for 51 projects in the country.
</P>
<P>

financing and primary health care development project with a 10
million dollar credit, which will be channeled through the

BONN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today called for the establishment of an international commission
to investigate alleged embezzlement of aid money by Bosnian
officials.
</P>
<P>
After meeting in Bonn on Tuesday, Kinkel and chief Bosnia aid

<P>
Kinkel also expressed his support for Westendorp's proposal to

corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks came after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
told Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic he had evidence that
large sums of the 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in international aid
money donated to Bosnia for rebuilding the country have been
embezzled.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic promised on Monday to set up a commission to
investigate the case and punish those who would be found guilty.

<HEADLINE> US President Says Budget Agreement "Historic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton Bill
said today that the agreement of cutting taxes and balancing the
budget was "an historic agreement that will benefit generations of
Americans."
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration and Republicans in the U.S. Congress
reached a tentative agreement Monday on how to balance the budget
by 2002, the first time in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.S. government would have to cut tax
of a net 85 billion dollars over five years to families with
children, to students and to investors regardless of their
personal wealth or income.
</P>
<P>
Spending would be cut by approximately 140 billion dollars over
five years, enough to balance the government's books for the first
time since 1969. While Medicare would account for the largest
share, additional savings also would come from Medicaid, student
loans and a variety of other benefit programs. Social Security
would remain untouched.
</P>
<P>
Tens of billions of dollars in additional savings would come
from the annual spending bills that Congress will vote on later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very good for our country," President Clinton said
today in a celebratory statement on the White House south lawn.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Republican leaders also hailed the agreement as their
victory today. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici said
the deal was "not everything Republicans wanted"... "but it does a
lot of good things for the American people."
</P>
<P>
The agreement stood in contrast to more than two years of
political combat between the White House and Republican
congressional leaders that led to two government shutdowns two
Winters ago.
</P>
<P>
In the end, both President Clinton and the Republican leaders
in the U.S. Congress were returned to office in last fall's
election. Back in power, they settled on a course of compromise
that led to the outlines of a grand budget deal in late Spring.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeking to Extend Aid to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
on Tuesday that it would work with Congress to try to extend, at
least temporarily, an expiring law so that the U.S. aid to the
Palestinians could be continued.
</P>
<P>
The law, called the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA),
expires on Aug. 12, which, if not renewed, would cut off U.S.
financial assistance to the Palestinians, end diplomatic contacts
and force the Palestine Liberation Organization to close its
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
But Congress leaves for its August recess at the end of this
week and no bills could be discussed during that time.
</P>
<P>
James Foley, State Department deputy spokesman, told reporters:
"We're going to be working with Congress now on seeing if we can
find ways to achieve at least a temporary extension of MEPFA."
</P>
<P>
Congress would not discuss the issue of extension of the law
before its recess as there is an anti-Palestinian sentiment making
lawmakers solely blame the Palestinians for the current suspension
of the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, which were broken
down in fast as a result of the Israeli government's decision to
build Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, who is
travelling with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Southeast
Asia, said aid to the Palestinians had been the basis of U.S.
policy since 1993 and should continue.
</P>
<P>
"We think in the interest of peace we need to continue
assistance to the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has provided $260 million out of a five-year
commitment of $500 million to the Palestinians.
