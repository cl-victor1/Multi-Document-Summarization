<HEADLINE> ILO: Port Employment Down in Recent Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations labour agency
Monday said that growing use of containers and new cargo-handling
techniques has led to 40-60 percent job losses in ports over
recent years in many countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
Substituting capital for labour, containerization and related
developments have "resulted in substantial reductions in port
employment, accompanied by substantial increases in labour
productivity", said a report of the International Labour Office
(ILO) in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Containerization has had "a decisive impact" on the design and
sizes of general cargo ship, equipment, operations and employment
in ports as well as other related issues.
</P>
<P>
Adaptations to the revolution in port industry has led to a 44
percent drop in port jobs between 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Increased private sector involvement is also being encouraged
by governments because of the need of huge investments in adapting
ports to modern requirements, it added.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the Asian and Pacific region alone will have
to invest an estimated 1,500 billion U.S. dollars to build
additional capacity in infrastructure, of which the transport and
communication sectors make up an important part, said ILO.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Open Bond Issue Market to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is to allow foreign
governments, public organizations, financial institutions and
corporations to issue won-denominated bonds in July as part of its
plan to open up the market, the Finance and Economy Ministry
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Under the bond issue market liberalization plan, those wanting
to issue Korean won-denominated bonds will first have to obtain a
credit rating of triple B or higher from any of the nine Korean
and foreign bond rating service companies designated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms applying for approval must also be listed on
stock markets in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investors will not be allowed to buy
won-denominated bonds issued by foreign institutions in South
Korea, because this would be tantamount to opening the bond
trading market to foreigners, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
International financial organizations were first allowed to
issue won-denominated bonds last year. The Asian development
Bank raised 100 million U.S. dollars in South Korea last
September.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is planning to issue won-denominated bonds
worth 100 million U.S. dollars in July.

<HEADLINE> New Int'l Situation Requires Pakistan, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The new international situation
requires Pakistan and China to cooperate more closely to jointly
counter some foreign pressure, said Pakistan's Senate Chairman
Wasim Sajjad here this evening.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a high-level Chinese delegation led by Sun
Fuling, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Sajjad said
Pakistan and China share common or similar views on various
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Some western countries have been trying to make trouble to
China on the issues of human rights, Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and China have no conflict on basic issues, he
stressed, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting China in
the regional and international arena.
</P>
<P>
"Pak-China friendly ties will help sustain and develop the
world peace," he said. "It is the cornerstone of Pakistan's
foreign policy to develop friendly ties with China."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out two prominent features of the development of
Pak-China friendship, one of which is the successful cooperation
in the industrial field.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries will further
develop their economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The other feature, he said, is the frequent exchange of visit
by the leaders of older and present generations of Pakistan and
China, which has been conducive to the development of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Sun Fuling said that during the past 45 years, Sino-Pak
relations have been developed very smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"The friendly relations of cooperation between China and
Pakistan have become a model for countries with different social
systems to develop their relations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the world situation is moving towards
peace, he said, adding that peace and development are still the
two main themes in the world today.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some countries pursuing hegemonism, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"China upholds peace and believes that to strengthen and
develop relations with the neighboring countries will be conducive
to the stability and development in the region and the world as a
whole," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir issue, Sun expressed the hope that Pakistan and
India will solve the Kashmir problem in accordance with the
relevant UN resolutions as well as the Simla agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sajjad hosted a dinner in honor of Sun
Fuling.

<TEXT>
<P>
WINDHOEK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Prime Minister Hage
Geingob said here today that the current visit of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Namibia is a historic one.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Jiang this morning, Geingob said Namibia
attaches importance to South-South cooperation. He added that a
focus of Namibia's economic constructions is to strengthen
cooperation with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Namibia particularly wants to develop
economic cooperation and trade ties with China in various spheres.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that China has rich experiences
in fighting drought which Namibia can learn and benefit from.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who met Geingob in Beijing in 1991, said he was happy to
meet Geingob here again. He said he is looking forward to an
in-depth exchange of views with President Sam Nujoma on issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the hospitality he receives in this country
embodies the friendly and brotherly ties between the peoples of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader praised the Namibian government for having
made big efforts and achievements in safeguarding the country's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, realizing reconciliation
and unity among different ethnic groups, as well as in developing
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang briefed Geingob on the irrigational projects in China and
he welcomes Namibia's technicians to have on-the-spot inspections
on China's irrigation works.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Agrees to Non-Violence Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, MAY 20 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams
indicated today that his party was prepared to accept the
proposals on decommissioning IRA weapons and preventing the use of
violence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio in Belfast, Adams said that if
every other party involved in negotiations on the future of
Northern Ireland scheduled for June 10 signed up to the principles
stipulated by the international commission to overseeing arms
decommissioning, so would Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Adams had publicly committed Sinn
Fein to the principles of non-violence, which were raised by the
international panel chaired by former US senator George Mitchell
on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The international panel proposed six principles, demanding all
parties involved in the Northern Ireland conflict renounce the use
or the threat of use of force.
</P>
<P>
However the British government dismissed the concession made by
Adams as a bid to take part in the planned all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Northern Ireland Office said Adams'
concession was not enough. "There has to be a cease-fire" to be
renewed by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP), warned that any bid by Sinn Fein to distance itself from
the IRA so it could enter all-party talks would be false.

<HEADLINE> Dialogues Crucial to End Party Conflicts in Cambodia: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's acting head of state,
Chea Sim, today called on the nation's two ruling parties to end
their conflicts and create a stable political situation through
dialogues, state television reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, also head of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), said
that the two ruling parties, the CPP and the FUNCINPEC, should
iron out their differences through sincere talks, rather than
being engaged in conflicts, which he said will not benefit either
side.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim suggested that the two parties hold talks as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all parties and all the people in Cambodia
should unite as one under the leadership of King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cambodia reportedly saw a tense atmosphere in its
politics, which is caused by "conflicts" and "split" between the
two ruling parties, the CPP and the National United Front for an
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Unificative Cambodia
(FUNCINPEC).

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Glimpses of Friendship" in 45 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Forty-five photographs in the
exhibition of "Glimpses of Friendship" here record the 45-year
history of friendship between China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition which was opened here today is co-organized by
the Chinese Embassy to Pakistan, Pakistan's Ministry of Culture
and the Pakistan National Council of Arts.
</P>
<P>
As Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali and
Chinese Ambassador Zhang Chengli pointed out at the opening
ceremony, the Sino-Pak relationship is an example for countries
with different social systems to establish close ties.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize the
People's Republic of China as it did on January 4, 1950.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan established their diplomatic relations on
May 21, 1951.
</P>
<P>
The 45 years since have witnessed a frequent exchange of visits
by high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
The photos record cordial meetings between Chinese and
Pakistani leaders, from the older generation to the present
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Many Pakistanis and Chinese have visited a park in the
Pakistani capital where many Chinese leaders planted trees of
friendship during their visits to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Photos showing Chinese leaders on those occasions bring to mind
vivid memories for many visitors to the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
This friendship is deeply rooted among the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Pakistanis are very fond to call Chinese "brothers" or
"sisters", terms used only for close friends, even if they meet
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Chinese visiting the country are often heard saying, "We are
touched by the friendliness shown us by our Pakistani friends."
</P>
<P>
The photos in the exhibition also bear witness to the fruitful
cultural exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Aseff Ahmed Ali viewed with great interest the
exhibits along with Sun Fuling, visiting vice chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Aseff was very happy to find a picture of himself at the
signing ceremony of five accords on Sino-Pak economic and
technical cooperation on December 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his impression of the exhibition, the foreign
minister told Xinhua that it was a very good exhibition which
traced the history of friendly relations between Pakistan and
China.
</P>
<P>
"I once visited China by myself and held talks with Premier Li
Peng," he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
It seems that every Pakistani attending the exhibition has
something to tell about their experiences in and memories about
China.
</P>
<P>
President of the All Pakistan-China Friendship Association
Iqbal Shafi, who speaks fluent Chinese after spending six years in
Beijing, told Xinhua his memories of China and his numerous trips
there.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Culture Ministry Ashad Sami Khan also talked
about his feelings about Sino-Pak friendship.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan could not find a better friend than China," he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
When asked his opinions of the exhibition, he said: "Two words
are enough to describe it -- very great!"
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who visited China on many occasions, said his
impression of China was still very vivid.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Cultural Attach Yi Rucheng said the exhibition is very
much worth seeing as it has many precious pictures recording
historic moments.
</P>
<P>
Many senior diplomats posted in Islamabad also came to view the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The photo exhibition is just part of the many functions held
these days by government and non-government organizations to
celebrate the 45th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between
China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese government and non-government delegations have
arrived here for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Just as the secretary of the Culture Ministry said, "The saga
of Sino-Pak friendship is not a phenomenon of merely half a
century, but an epic from times immemorial."

<HEADLINE> Current Population Growth Rate Lowest since World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
said on Monday that the global population is currently
experiencing the lowest annual growth rate since the World War
II: 1.6 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 World Health Report released by the WHO
on Monday, the growth rate of the global population is expected to
decline further to 1.3 percent a year by 2010, and 0.5 percent by
2050.
</P>
<P>
With a total of about 5.7 billion people in mid-1995, the
global population is projected to reach 7.9 billion in 2020, and
9.8 billion in 2050.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, the 48 least developed countries in the world will
have a population of about 1.7 billion, or 17 percent of the total
population, compared to about 589 million, or about 10 percent of
the global population today.
</P>
<P>
The developing world as a whole will have a population of 8.5
billion in 2050, representing 86 percent of the global population.
</P>
<P>

percent of the global population, were living in urban areas. The
proportion is expected to reach 60 percent by the year 2025.
Thirty three of the world's biggest cities will have a combined
population of more than 500 million people.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Party Secures Majority of Parliament Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea Party
(NKP) has secured a majority in the National Assembly after
independent lawmaker-elect Lim Jin-chul joined the party here
today.
</P>
<P>
Lim, elected from North Kyongsang Province, has given the NKP
its 150th out of the 299 seats in the new parliament which opens
early next month.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139 seats,
11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP)
led by Kim Dae-jung secured 79 seats, the conservative opposition
United Liberal Democrats (ULD) headed by Kim Jong-pil got 50 seats
and the minor Democratic Party (DP) obtained 15 seats. The
remaining 16 seats went to independents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the three opposition parties have decided to launch
a combined political offensive to protest the ruling NKP's move to
recruit independent and opposition lawmakers-elect to gain a
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The offensive will include a public display of information on
election campaign irregularities allegedly committed by the ruling
NKP and political rallies denouncing those lawmakers-elect who
have joined the NKP.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said that they will boycott the new
parliament if the government fails to meet their demand for a
thorough investigation of all alleged election frauds.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Import Rice for Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will import rice for food
and not for industrial purposes during the second half of this
year for the first time in 13 years, the Finance and Economy
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the Minimum Market Access (MMA) stipulations of the
Uruguay- round multilateral trade agreement reached in 1993, South
Korea imported 50,400 tons of rice for industrial use last year
and will import 66,360 tons for food use this year, according to
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The exclusive import of food rice will be the first ever since
the 1981-1983 period, when 2.73 million tons of such rice was
imported due to a poor harvest in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is considering importing rice for
food from Australia, China or the United States as the rice
produced in these countries is on par with the one produced
domestically, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
A tentative agreement has been reached with related government
agencies on the need to import food rice in preparation for a poor
crop this autumn or additional rice aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), the official said, adding that Seoul
will make a final decision on the matter next month.
</P>
<P>
If the government decides to import food rice next month, it
will be immediately open to international bidding, the official
added.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Session of Former South Korean Presidents Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court held here
today a new session to try former South Korean Presidents Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo as well as a number of Chun's former
aides on charges of mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from the defense, Chun testified that
the investigation in late 1979 of then acting President Choi
Kyu-hah in connection with President Park Chung-hee's
assassination had been conducted on the orders of then Martial Law
Commander Chung Seung-hwa.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as Chun's
11 close aides, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army corps
commander.
</P>
<P>
Chun claimed that the investigation of Choi had nothing to do
with him and his joint investigation office since it was conducted
by an army prosecutor following Chung's orders.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chung ordered army prosecutors to investigate
whether Choi was involved in Park's assassination and that the
military prosecutor in charge of the assassination case met him at
his joint investigation office and asked him to cooperate in the
investigation of Choi.
</P>
<P>
Chun explained that he reported it to Choi and obtained his
consent to be investigated, and army prosecutor Chun Chang-yol
questioned Choi on December 1, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president also testified that he ordered his senior
investigator Lee Hak-bong and others to question Martial Law
Commander Chung in connection with Park's assassination on October
29, 1979.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo have been indicted for mutiny and
treason. The mutiny and treason charges respectively stem from
their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the
bloody crackdown of the civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju,
capital of South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun Doo-whan, who loomed large as the army strongman after the
1979 military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled
the country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo
who stepped down in February 1993.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sanitation Services Reach Only One Percent Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 20 (xinhua) -- Ethiopia provides sanitation
services to only one percent of its population, the Ethiopian
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency quoted Assefa Gemeda, head of the Hygiene and
Environmental Health Department of the Ministry of Health, as
saying that the country's provision of sanitation services is one
of the poorest performance in the world.
</P>
<P>
Opening a six-day workshop at Nazret, 90 kms south-east of
Addis Ababa today, Assefa said the country with an estimated 55
million population that grows by three percent every year,
provides sanitation services to about 550,000 citizens.
</P>
<P>
The severity of the problem is high in rural localities when
compared to urban facilities whose poor performance still caused
repeated complaints on the part of the public, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the provision of pure water stood at seven percent in
rural Ethiopia while it has reached about 60 percent in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of the contagious diseases prevalent in the
country could be contained by promoting sanitation and
environmental health services across the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The absence of environmental health policy and the shortage of
sufficient trained manpower in the sector have also aggravated
the problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to revise the outdated sanitation law and
regulation which does not fit for the current situation.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Hails Conclusion of Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali welcomed on Monday the signing of a
memorandum of understanding on the oil-for-food plan between the
U.N. Secretariat and the Iraqi delegation.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which was signed by the two sides this morning,
would enable Iraq to sell oil of up to 2 billion U.S. dollars in
60 days for humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters before the Security Council Chamber,
Boutros-Ghali hailed the conclusion of the deal was a success of
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The signature of the memorandum of understanding between the
Secretariat and the Iraqi delegation this morning is a success for
the Security Council, because it is a resolution adopted by the
Security Council in 1995, which has finally been adopted and will
be implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the council resolution was adopted to mitigate the
suffering of the Iraq people under the harsh economic sanctions
since its invasion of Kuwait, he stressed that the resolution is a
humanitarian one and is serving one of the U.N. objectives of
helping the poor and those people suffering from shortage food and
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that the memorandum of understanding has
taken into consideration two concepts, one is the sovereignty of
Iraq and the second is the very strict control of U.N. on the
distribution of food and oil.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations secretariat and Iraq started talks on
implementing Security Council resolution 986 from early February.
According to the resolution, Iraq is allowed to export oil worth 2
billion dollars in six months for import of food, medicine and
other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reiterates Call for Turkish Troops Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has reiterated its demand for
an immediate pullout of Turkish forces which launched a
cross-border attack against the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK)
separatists in the north of Iraq, according to the Iraqi News
Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a statement by his Turkish counterpart, an Iraqi
foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement to INA on Sunday
that the Turkish military action, which started on May 6 in the
north of Iraq, is one of the persistent violation of Iraq's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and airspace.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Turkish artillery and air attacks
on Iraqi villages and towns have continued to inflict losses among
the Iraqi Kurdish population in the area in flagrant violation of
principles of international law, relations of good neighborliness
and the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish spokesman said that Turkey has security concerns
over terrorism of the PKK and that it is his country's right to
push into northern Iraq to counter this terrorism in the area
where PKK separatists are concentrated.

ANKARA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police are continuing their
investigation into the failed assassination attempt on President
Suleyman Demirel last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But no link has been detected so far between the gunman and any
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Gumrukcuoglu, a 48-year-old drugstore owner with some
psychological problems, attempted to fire at the president who
was visiting the industrial city of Izmit, some 100 kilometers
east of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Gumrukcuoglu told police that he wanted to protest against the
Turco-Israeli military agreement which permits Israeli unarmed
warplanes to use Turkish airspace for training purpose.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that he had the intention to assassinate Demirel
but to just shoot in the air to show his anger over the accord.
</P>
<P>
Demirel was unhurt in the incident but the chief of his
bodyguards and a local journalist were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia news agency quoted Izmit police as saying that they
had found no relationship between the gunman and any
organizations so far.
</P>
<P>
Reports say questions still remain on how Gumrukcuoglu, a man
also with two previous crime records, was able to obtain the
license for his handgun.

CAIRO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Supreme Military Court will
pass its verdict on the country's latest spy case involving Israel
on May 26, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Malak Ali Hamed, a former volunteer navy sergeant, has
been accused of offering Israel information about Egypt's vital
military installations for money.
</P>
<P>
At today's court hearing, the military prosecutor demanded
capital punishment for Hamed, saying that the defendant "had
betrayed his homeland and offered Israel security information
about Egypt," according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
But Hamed's defense lawyer called for acquitting his client on
the ground that there is no sufficient evidence, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hamed, 48, had earlier confessed to espionage charges against
him, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Hamed's case was the second espionage trial involving Israel in
two months.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, an Egyptian court sentenced Amer Salman to life
imprisonment at hard labor for spying for Israel for 12 years.

evening about the signing of an agreement between Iraq and the
United nations on an oil-for-food deal brought cheerful Iraqis
into streets in the capital to celebrate their government's

Iraq today said that it has approved the signing of the
long-awaited memorandum of understanding with the U.N. which
allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars of oil in a six-month period
to buy essential foodstuffs and medicine under strict
U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
This will be Iraq's first oil export in six years since the

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Minister Stresses Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Tourism and Natural Resources Juma Ngasongwa sees a significant
role of marine and freshwater resources in the economy of the
east African region.
</P>
<P>
Opening a five-day regional workshop here today on cooperative
use of research and training vessels, Ngasongwa said fish is the
single most important resource supplied by several water bodies
including the Indian Ocean, lakes and many river systems in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the marine and aquatic environments are very
fragile and slight disturbances can easily affect the marine and
aquatic life adversely, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Ngasongwa listed oil spilage by ships, tankers and other
motorised water vessels and the unchecked growth of water
hyacinth in east African lakes as examples of the adverse
affection caused by economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He urged for monitoring and research of the situation of
marine and aquatic resources, proposing the accumulation of
imformation on marine and aquatic life in the region and the
establishment of extended zones of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The workshop attracts over 30 participants from Kenya,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and observers from Canada, India and
the Gambia.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Drops Two Thirds in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's giant trade surplus plunged
65 percent in April and the politically sensitive surplus with the
United States also slumped by more than half due to a continued
rise in imports, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The customs-cleared trade surplus nosedived to 320.66 billion
yen (about 3.21 billion U.S. dollars) in April from the 928.78
billion yen (about 9.29 billion dollars) surplus a year earlier,
the 17th consecutive month of decline, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 5.1 percent to 3,644.47 billion yen (some 36.44
billion dollars), increasing for the ninth straight month, while
imports soared 30.9 percent to 3,323.82 billion yen (some 33.24
billion dollars), up for the 24th month in a row.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Japan's trade surplus with the United States
fell to 172.1 billion yen (1.72 billion dollars) from 387.82
billion yen (3.88 billion dollars), a 55.6 percent drop, propelled
by a 39.5 percent surge in imports from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The steep fall confirmed that the trade gap between Japan and
the rest of the world is being whittled away as Japan's exporters
shift production overseas and the economy becomes more
import-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Japan, an export-led economy, has habitually run a big trade
surplus, to the dismay of major trading partners such as the
United States. But the surplus has steadily been coming down as
the nation has developed a taste for cheaper imported goods and
Japanese exporters have shifted their production bases overseas to
cut costs and "re-imported" Japanese brand goods made abroad into
the country.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Continues Talks in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
continued his second day of contacts here today by holding
separate talks with Greek parliament Speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis
and ruling Pasok Party founder and former Premier Andreas
Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis told Arafat that the Greek parliament would offer
all possible assistance for the technological infrastructure of
the newly-established Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that members of the Palestinian parliament be
hosted by the Greek parliament so as to receive on-the-spot
experience in the parliamentary work. The proposal was accepted.
</P>
<P>
After the 30-minute meeting with Papandreou, Arafat described
the former premier as a world leader, adding that he had found him
in good health.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also attended a meeting with approximately 90 Greek
businessmen representing the sectors of industry, construction,
commerce and insurance.
</P>
<P>
The discussion focused on the needs of the Palestinian
administration and the ways in which Greek businessmen could
contribute to the reconstruction and modernization of Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said his country "needs Greek business
experience since, among other things, Greece is a country at the
crossroad between Europe and the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"Let Greeks and Palestinians constitute the connecting link
between the Mediterranean countries," Arafat said, noting that
programs had already been prepared for the mass construction of
housing complexes, hospitals, schools, airports and ports "in
which Greek participation would be welcome."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Monday for a two-day official visit,
had already met with Greek President Kostis Stephanopoulos, Prime
Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
after his arrival.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls on Oil-Exporting Countries to Stabilize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi
today called on oil-exporting countries to shoulder their
responsibilities to stabilize the world oil market and avert any
drop in oil prices after Iraq's partial return to the market.
</P>
<P>
Banbi urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to hold an emergency meeting in the face of an oil-for-food
deal reached between Iraq and the United Nations Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deal would allow Baghdad back into international oil
markets for the first time in nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Iraq would sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies to alleviate the effects of sanctions on ordinary
Iraqis. Iraq has been under sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security
Council since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has fixed its oil production at 900,000 barrels per day
despite new oil finds in the past five years, Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Egypt would not reduce its oil production,
about half of which is exported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is not an OPEC member but coordinates policies with it.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Speeding Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese cities has
risen to 640, according to the executive director of China's
Association of Mayors, Hou Jie, here today.
</P>
<P>
Hou, also minister of construction, told a national conference
of the association that city groupings, the proliferation
of small cities and towns, and the steady perfection of city
functions are speeding up the State's process of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 32 cities have a population greater than
one million each, 43 have a population of from 500,000 to one
million each, 192 medium-sized cities have between 200,000 and
500,000 in population each, and 373 small cities have less than
200,000 people each.
</P>
<P>
The vigorous local economic growth has caused the emergence of
city groups nationwide. Most are concentrated in the delta areas of
the Yangtze and Zhujiang Rivers, the Liaoning Peninsula, and the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area.
</P>
<P>
About 200 medium-sized cities in these city groups developed
from small towns.
</P>
<P>
Many other groupings came into being because they were close to
key communications and border trade cities.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, the rapid urbanization also
improved to some degree the uneven distribution of cities between
the eastern and western parts of the country, which now account
for 44 and 19 percent, respectively, of the total number of
cities.
</P>
<P>
But he added that more cities are being built in the vast
western regions, improving economic development nationwide.
</P>
<P>
With the steady expansion of urbanization, the public
facilities of the country's urban areas have also shown strong
growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the gas utilization rate for urban
residents has risen to 60 percent. The afforestation coverage rate
in cities reaches 22.4 percent. The average per capita living
space for urban residents has risen to 7.9 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Hou Jie forecasts that by the year 2000 the number of cities in
China will be around 800, and the number of small towns will
increase to over 60,000, which will raise the country's
urbanization to an even more rational level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
meeting with visiting British Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine here this afternoon, said that the issue of Hong Kong is
the most important issue in Sino-British ties.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great importance to the smooth transfer of power and
a smooth transition in Hong Kong," Li said, adding that China and
Britain have increased their co-operation and made some progress
on the Hong Kong issue over the past year.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the British side would adopt
positive measures to strengthen the co-operation with China on the
issue of Hong Kong, to solve the remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine agreed to Li's remarks, saying that a proper
settlement of the issue of Hong Kong would serve the interests of
both Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
The British side is willing to resolve the current problems in
a co-operative manner together with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Heseltine on his second China tour since
last year, Li noted that China and Britain have conducted a series
of important meetings and exchanges of visits, which increased
mutual understanding and improved bilateral relations since the
deputy prime minister's China visit last May.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine said that Britain-China ties have improved a lot
through joint efforts by both sides. He told Li that his entourage
includes about 270 British entrepreneurs, among whom there are
leaders of the strongest enterprises in Britain as well as of many
medium-sized and small enterprises, which showed that British
business circles are very interested in and positive toward
co-operating with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs hope to get better acquainted with China
through their present China visit so as to open up new areas of
collaboration with the country, Heseltine added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the key problem in boosting economic and trade
co-operation is to get the entrepreneurs from the two sides
understand each other. Enterprises are the mainstay of bilateral
economic co-operation and governments have the responsibility for
creating favorable conditions for co-operation between
enterprises.

<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, accompanied by visiting British Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, delivered a brief speech to
about 270 British entrepreneurs here this afternoon at the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Li said the fact that so many British businessmen have come to
China demonstrated that British business circles are keen to
promote their ties with China. China attaches great importance to
Sino-British relations and takes the same positive attitude toward
enhancing bilateral economic co-operation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reaching an agreement or signing a contract should be done on a
basis of mutual understanding, the premier continued, noting that
the two sides should go through serious negotiations on the
principles of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
A process is needed in negotiations and one cannot expect to
reach a lot of agreements just through one visit, Li told the
entrepreneurs. But visits can promote mutual understanding, like
sowing a seed, and it will bring about a good outcome in the
future, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of Sino-British ties and the strengthening
of bilateral co-operation on the issue of Hong Kong, as well as
efforts made by entrepreneurs from the two countries, China and
Britain will see great progress in their relations, especially
their economic and trade ties, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The British entrepreneurs warmly applauded what the Chinese
premier said.

President Iqbal Shafi and former Pakistani Ambassador to China
Mahmood Bhatti also participated in the reception.
</P>
<P>
"One main reason for the long-term friendship between China and

Principles of Peaceful Coexistence during our 45 year-long history
of relations," Sun said in his speech at the function.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated: "To further consolidate and develop our
friendship and cooperation with Pakistan is also the unshakable

<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Planes Bomb Taliban Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government Planes bombed
Taliban's positions near Kabul today, destroying three tanks, said
a report from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman as
saying that the air strike was a revenge for Taliban's rocket
attacks on Kabul, which killed four people and injured 32 others
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three Su-22 jet fighters of the government bombed Taliban's
positions near the strategic Charasyab, about 20 kilometers south
of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The government troops targeted the Taliban barracks and damaged
them extensively, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which vows to topple the Kabul regime led
by President Burhanuddin Rabbani, has stationed heavy troops
outside Kabul since last October.
</P>
<P>
Charasyab is the temporary headquarters of Taliban forces on
the Kabul frontline.
</P>
<P>
The government's air strike came on the heels of a meeting
between Rabbani and former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, whose Hezb-i-Islami faction had reportedly sent 1,000
soldiers to Kabul to help the city's defense.
</P>
<P>
Officials who attended the meeting said Rabbani was considering
the possibility of bringing Hekmatyar back into his government as
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if Hekmatyar fully cooperated with Rabbani,
Taliban would face a much stronger opponent.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Expresses Concern over Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed deep
concern over the Israeli decision to keep the closure of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip until after the national elections, scheduled
for May 29, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by the Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdel-Aziz while
he was making comments on the decision at a weekly cabinet
meeting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the decision was unjustified and
would only harm efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly warned that the decision harms the Palestinian
people and efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace,
especially on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip after
a wave of suicide bombing attacks that killed 59 Israelis in late
February and early March.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities had eased the ban slightly until
recently, and later they retightened it, fearing possible Islamic
militant attacks would affect Israel's May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd expressed his hope that the new Palestinian cabinet,
which was formed Saturday, would achieve the aspirations of the
Palestinian people, reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's northwest Shaanxi
Province will hold a large trade fair in Hong Kong from May 22 to
26.
</P>
<P>
The fair will present more than 400 projects involving
machinery, electronics, communications, energy,
telecommunications, agriculture, chemicals and pharmaceuticals,
textile and light industry, metallurgy and real estate.
</P>
<P>
At a forum sponsored by the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber
of Commerce today, Shaanxi Governor Cheng Andong said that the
investment in these projects will amount to 7.628 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that under the guidance of China's strategy to
accelerate the opening up of China's central and western regions,
Shaanxi has formulated a series of favorable policies toward
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
He said the fair is aimed to help Shaanxi implement China's
strategy and promote Shaanxi's opening up to the world.
</P>
<P>
Rich in natural resources, Shaanxi has 28 kinds of mineral
resources whose reserves rank first among Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
Known for its cultural traditions and tourist attractions,
Shaanxi is becoming closer to the outside world through the rapid
development of air routes, railway lines and highways as well as
telecommunications in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that in the next five years, his province will
invest 100 million yuan (about 12 million US dollars) in
communications and telecommunications projects to improve its
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped the fair would enhance his province's
ties with overseas businesses and attract more investors to
Shaanxi.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Encourage Turkey to Change Positions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government believes
that U.S. efforts to break the current deadlock in the Cyprus
problem must be directed toward Turkey, a government spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At his daily press briefing, spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides
said "President Glafcos Clerides will stress to U.S. President
Bill Clinton that the U.S. must encourage Turkey to change the
positions it holds now and allow a breakthrough in the Cyprus
problem."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president is scheduled to meet Clinton in
Washington in mid-June to review developments on the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides will inform Clinton that he is willing to
meet Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for direct talks
provided that the Turkish side gives proof that its positions are
changing and Clinton's representatives prepare the ground for
negotiations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the speed with which U.N., U.S.,
British, European and Russian efforts to break the deadlock will
depend on developments toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of one third of the island's areas following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
communities on the island went into deadlock since the two sides
could not find common ground on the fundamental aspects of the
Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> EU Rejects Easing of Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's standing
veterinary committee on Monday failed to give the green light to a
plan to relax the world-wide ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
European Agricultural Commissioner Franz Fischler told a press
conference today that seven countries -- Spain, Germany, Austria,
Portugal, Greece, Belgium and the Netherlands -- voted against the
European Commission's proposal to lift the worldwide ban on
the British beef by-products of tallow, gelatine and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
The other eight countries in the 15-member organization voted
in favour of partially relaxing the ban at the end of a two-day
meeting of EC agricultural ministers. But the seven votes were
enough to block the plan.
</P>
<P>
"I very much regret that no qualified majority has been reached
at the Veterinary Committee in favour of the EC's proposal," he
said. The Commission's proposal was based on scientific advice
from the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a world-wide ban on British beef and beef
products on March 27 because of fears that "mad cow" disease,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a fatal brain disease
affecting cows, could be transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said he will ask the Commission's approval on
Wednesday to present a similar proposal to a special meeting of EU
farm ministers in Luxembourg in June.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Council of Ministers has taken a series of
market related measures to solve the mad cow crisis and another
inspection mission will be set up in Britain by May 27, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also noted that EU agricultural ministers have
agreed to adopt additional measures "rapidly" to help farmers
suffering losses due to the mad cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
A maximum of 650 million ECU (about 845 million U.S. dollars)
will be paid to farmers by the EU as compensation for losses
caused by the mad cow crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under a new proposal to restore consumer confidence in beef
products, Britain will slaughter nearly 80,000 cattle, almost
double the previously quoted figure of 42,000.
</P>
<P>
But European experts said that to completely reduce the danger
of the deadly disease, 500,000 to one million head of cattle
should be killed.

<P>
TUNIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian Foreign Ministry today
expressed satisfaction with the oil-for-food agreement signed
Monday between the Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by the ministry said that the Tunisian
government has received with satisfaction the news of the
agreement between Iraq and the United Nations on the
implementation of U.N. resolution 986 on the partial lifting of
the embargo imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, which has relentlessly called for respect for
international legitimacy, considers this agreement a positive move
toward the alleviation of the suffering of the Iraq people, said
the communique.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved resolution 986 in 1995,
permitting Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
petroleum over a six-month period for the purchase of food,
medicine and other daily needs to ease the suffering of the Iraqi
people due to the sanction, though the export will take place
under strict supervision of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had rejected the resolution at the beginning on the
grounds that the U.N. supervision would constitute a violation of
Iraq's national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the U.N. and Iraq on the implementation of the
resolution were initiated last February.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Professor Criticized for "Two Chinas" Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian professor was
criticized in a signed article published here today for his
remarks advocating "Two Chinas".
</P>
<P>
Peter Fischer, a professor of international law at Vienna
University, recently published an article advocating "two Chinas"
by saying that "Taiwan is fully qualified to be a country," and
"Surely Taiwan is not a province belonging to the People's
Republic of China."
</P>
<P>
"Fischer is either ignorant of Chinese history or deliberately
sidestepping the rules of international law," the signed article
says.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has been part of China since time immemorial," the
article notes. "Although the Japanese imperialists took over
Taiwan by force at the end of the last century, the Cairo
Declaration signed by the leaders of China, the United States and
Britain in 1943 made it clear that Japan must return Manchuria,
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the Second World War, Japan formally returned
Taiwan to China, and the Chinese government resumed its
sovereignty over Taiwan province," the article notes.

<P>
In 1949, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, overthrew the "Government of the
Republic of China" and founded the People's Republic of
China. Since then the Government of the People's Republic of China
has inherited all the sovereignty of the former "Government of the
Republic of China", including the sovereignty over Taiwan, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
The present Taiwan authorities are in fact only the
continuation of the remnants of the Kuomintang authorities who
fled to Taiwan after the victory of the Chinese revolution in
1949, the article stresses, therefore they can by no means claim
to have "sovereignty" or to be a "country."
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of China is an internal affair of the
Chinese people," the article says. "We are grateful to the foreign
friends who have shown their concern and support for this.
</P>
<P>
"But the Chinese people are very disappointed by such a
so-called 'professor of international law' as Peter Fischer, who
has made blatant, offensive remarks about China's internal
affairs," the article stresses.

<HEADLINE> British Deputy Premier Expects More Exchanges with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Deputy Prime
Minister Michael Heseltine said here today that China and Britain
should enhance exchanges as both are permanent members of the UN
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a ceremony to mark the setting up of a
new Sino-British joint venture. So far, China and Britain have set
up 1,400 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is working hard to enable China to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote friendly relations with Asian countries,
including China, the deputy prime minister came together with a
group of people from Britain's industrial and commercial circles.
</P>
<P>
The venture established today was organized by Britain's Zeneca
Agrochemicals and three businesses in east China's Jiangsu
Province, with a total investment of 80 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to turn out 6,000 tons of herbicide each year,
according to Michael Pragnell, chief executive of Zeneca
Agrochemicals. He said he estimated that China's demand for
herbicide would grow by 25 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
Zeneca is one of the world's five-largest pesticide producers
and has invested 100 million US dollars in China.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian, Chinese minister of chemical industry, was present
at the contract signing ceremony today and called on business
people from both sides to go in for more co-operation in

<HEADLINE> Albania Sees Intensified Poll Campaigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALBANIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Campaigning for Albania's general
election is intensifying with only one week left for the 24
competing parties to woo more voters in the country's third
multi-party parliamentary elections since 1991.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,180 party candidates and nine independents are
contesting 115 constituencies across the country. A further 25
seats for the one-chamber People's Assembly will be decided by
proportional representation among the 12 parties with the highest
number of votes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the election will be dominated by the ruling
Democratic Party, which won a landslide victory in the 1992
election, capturing 92 seats in parliament, and its largest
opposition force, the Socialist Party, with 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, set up in 1991 as the first opposition
group after Albania turned to political pluralization, has been
preparing for the ballot since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
The party, headed by President Sali Berisha, has reorganized
its grass-roots organization, strengthened its leadership and
revised the country's election law.
</P>
<P>
The government has also stepped up efforts to weaken the
Socialist Party, the former communist party, by arresting a number
of its leaders and declaring others unqualified to run for office,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
As early as late 1993, the government, alarmed by the growing
influence of the Socialist Party after its victory in the July
1992 local elections, arrested and jailed its Chairman Fatos Nano
on charges of alleged economic crimes. He still has three years
left to serve in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party formally kicked off its nationwide
election campaign on April 27 with the help of a campaign fund of
300,000 U.S. dollars allocated by the government. The party
leaders, including Berisha, are busy conducting canvass trips and
publicizing the party platform through the state-run mass media.
</P>
<P>
They have promised to eradicate poverty and strengthen welfare,
employment and security.
</P>
<P>
But the Socialist Party, which has been determined to make a
comeback since Nano was jailed for alleged economic crimes in
1993, is girding itself for the election despite what it described
as political oppression and a lack of campaign funds, transport
and independent media support.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists are campaigning on a platform of opposition to
government corruption, political reprisal and social upheaval
coming on the heel of its so-called "shock-therapy" economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
They promised to uproot corruption, vary ownership instead of
pursuing only private ownership, rescue industries which have been
hard hit by reforms and improve urban employment.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the Socialists stand a chance of winning the
quadrennial parliamentary polls because their election platform
sounds more appealing to voters than that of the Democrats and
they have the support of other leftist parties and some lesser
centrist groups including the Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
About 2.3 million eligible voters will take part in the vote
which will be monitored by 400 foreign observers.

<TEXT>
<P>

enterprises and organizations who owe tax to the government,
President Boris Yeltsin's press service said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a tax reform plan put forward by the
president designed to ease the tax burden on businesses.
</P>
<P>
In future, businesses owing tax will not be fined by tax
authorities and previous fines will not be incur interest
charges. The size of fines for delaying tax payments will be
cut. From the beginning of next year, advance payment of tax by

and tax will be paid monthly.
</P>

From July this year, exporters will get refunds of value-added
tax only after depositing money into a taxpaying account in a
Russian bank. The move is designed to stop capital outflows from
the country.
</P>
<P>
The president's press service said that the tax reform is
designed to create firm foundations for a tax system, to
strengthen tax collection and cut the tax burden of producers.
</P>
<P>
The government has been instructed to submit a bill on tax
amnesty to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decree and the tax reform, Russian First
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Kadannikov said: "The most pressing
task now (for Russia) is to get down to the business of
production."

<HEADLINE> Fighting Breaks Out at Huddor, Somalia, Killing 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and 13
others wounded in fierce fighting between militiamen of General
Mohamed Farah Aidid and the opposing RRA in Huddor district of
southwestern Somalia early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The fighting took place after the forces of General Aidid
attacked a meeting held by officials of the Rahanwein Resistance
Army (RRA) in the suburbs of Huddor, RRA spokesman Colonel Ali
Aden Issak said today.
</P>
<P>
The RRA lost four men during the assault while seven
militiamen of General Aidid were also killed in the exchange,
said Issak, but an independent source confirmed the death of only
one men from General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Backed by three battle wagons, General Aidid's forces drove
away one technical car of the RRA deployed there to protect the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to discuss a plan to lay ambushes on
the road linking Baidoa with Huddor to cut off the logistical
support for Aidid's forces in Huddor.
</P>
<P>
Issak said during the meeting, Rahanwein officials discussed
how RRA could recapture the territories they had lost last
September and the tactics they planned to fight against Aidid's
troops.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between forces of General Aidid and the RRA is now
renewed as the rainy season set in because the former's technical
cars cannot go beyond the streets.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Punish Violators of Environmental Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government warned
today that it will not hesitate to take drastic action against any
erring company found violating the country's environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued by President Fidel Ramos during a
multisectoral dialogue in Boac, Maringduque, some 200 km south of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the government will punish any corporation found
violating the country's environment laws.
</P>
<P>
Ramos flew to the mountainous area in Boac, where he talked to
local residents affected by the recent mine tailing incident of
the MARCOPPER Mining Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts at industrialization should benefit the majority
of our people and not destroy the sources of livelihood or the
environment," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the MARCOPPER to clean up the polluted Boac and
Mogpog rivers of mine tailings disgorged by the mining firm.
</P>
<P>
Pollution has crept into the Boac River since March when a mine
disaster hit the MARCOPPER.
</P>
<P>
Millions of tons of mine tailings in the Boac River have caused
massive pollution to the environment in Marinduque.
</P>
<P>
Marinduque residents have petitioned the president to close the
MARCOPPER permanently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos said he was awaiting the results of a study
and investigation conducted by the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources, as well as the report of a special team of the
United Nations, which came here to investigate the MARCOPPER mine
tragedy.

<TEXT>

MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Western Mindanao of the Philippines
has been on red alert following an abortive plot of a Muslim
extremist group to set off a 50-kilogram time-bomb at a local
gasoline station last Friday night, police said today.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, complete with a timing device, was left on a motor
tricycle parked at the gasoline station in Zamboaga city, some 850
kilometers south of the capital city of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier that night, two men carrying a big water container shot
and wounded the driver of the tricycle before taking the vehicle
away, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The driver reported the incident to the police who later
discovered the bomb at the gasoline station. The bomb was then
defused by bomb disposal experts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police confirmed they received reports that the
extremist Abu Sayyaf group was recruiting in the city and
preparing to launch terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that considering the series of bomb
attacks in Zamboanga city two months ago, Friday's unexploded bomb
was "no joke."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bombs used in those attacks were smaller ones
and no one was killed.

<P>
SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors today
demanded a seven-year prison term for a former top aide to
President Kim Young-sam for taking bribes of 702 million won
(900,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors accused Chang Hak-ro of receiving the bribes from
executives of 17 local companies in return for favors and
demanded a fine of the same amount in addition to the jail term.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecutors told the Seoul criminal court they were
demanding a tough punishment as Chang had disrupted Kim
Young-sam's anti-graft drive.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, calling graft "the worst disease" in the
country, embarked on an anti-corruption crusade on his
presidential inauguration in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was in charge of Kim's protocol and private affairs,
was arrested in March this year after the opposition National
Congress for New Politics unveiled bribery allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
The president, who apologized to the nation after Chang was
arrested, has called for a heavy penalty in accordance with the
law.

Extending a warm welcome to the prince, Liu said he appreciated

China and Saudi Arabia have much in common and they have no

co-operation between the two countries not only accord with the

</P>
<P>
Khaled said Saudi Arabian King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and other
leaders all give much heed to consolidating and strengthening
Saudi Arabia's friendship and relations of co-operation with
China. The maintaining of a good relationship between the two
countries and the two armies benefits both countries, and the
peace in Asia and even the world. Both Saudi Arabia and China
develop bilateral relations on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence and both wish to close economic ties, he

JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The former adviser to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat, Ahmed Tibi, now head of the Arab Movement
for Change, decides to withdraw from the Israeli election race a
week before the May 29 general election, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Tibi said he had decided to withdraw because he does not want
to split the Arab vote or to be responsible for the waste of
40,000 votes in the Arab sector.
</P>
<P>
Although it is possible for his party to win a seat in the
Knesset (parliament), the peace process is more important, Tibi
said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 45,000 votes are needed for one of the 120 seats
in parliament. Ballots for parties that don't meet the threshold
are lost.
</P>
<P>
Tibi, a Palestinian and an Israeli citizen, called on all Arab
voters to support candidacy of Shimon Peres for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Tibi's party is the first of the 21 parties that have decided
to drop out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leaders have stepped up their efforts to persuade
Israel' Arab parties to publicly call on their constituencies to
vote Peres for the next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Peres, architect of Israel-PLO autonomy accords,
is running a tight race against opposition leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, who has said he would grant the Palestinians limited
autonomy, but never statehood.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and
Equality are expected to declare their support for Peres today.

of the National Congress, in a 30-minute meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Gowda reportedly gave Rao a panel of names finalized by the
Third Front for the candidature of the Lok Sabha speaker.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Third Front has left the final selection
from the list for a joint candidate to the National Congress,
without whose support the Third Front cannot form a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the speaker should be filed by noon Wednesday
as the election is slated for Thursday evening after completion of
oath taking by members of the 11th Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had earlier
nominated Shivraj Patil, speaker of the dissolved 10th Lok Sabha,
as a consensus candidate, is not expected to field any candidate
of its own as it has no chance of having its nominee elected.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies have won only 195 seats in the Lok Sabha
elections, 74 seats short of the simple majority of 269 seats
needed for effective governance.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Pakistan Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), met here
this afternoon with a delegation from the Pakistan-China
Friendship Group of the National Assembly of Pakistan led by its
chairman, Ghulam Farid Khathia.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China and Pakistan enjoy long-term friendship
and co-operation, and bilateral relations have been developing
smoothly whatever the situation.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Sino-Pakistani friendship sets an example for
Asia and the Third-World countries, and the two sides can
understand, trust and support each other.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Pakistan pay attention to mutual
assistance and co-operation on the basis of self-reliance, Qiao
pointed out that, upon the 45th anniversary of the establishment
of the Sino-Pakistani diplomatic relations, both sides should look
forward and further expand two-way co-operation, so as to make
bilateral friendship pass from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Khathia said that great changes in both countries during the
past 45 years have not affected the bilateral existing and
time-tested friendship. He said that he hoped that Pakistan-China
friendship can be continuously developed and passed on from
generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation for Pakistan's support for China on
issues such as Taiwan and human rights, Qiao noted that the world
should not be directed by a certain country, and it is up to each
country to solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
Khathia said that all countries in the world should concentrate
on their own development. He added that he hoped that countries
could co-exist peacefully, and respect human rights and the
economic modes of each other, while not interfering in others'
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan very much appreciates the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-Existence adopted by China.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir issue, Qiao said he hoped that Pakistan and
India could have the patience to deal with and solve the issue by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member delegation arrived here Sunday at the NPC's
invitation. They are scheduled to visit Xiamen and Xi'an.

<HEADLINE> Macao Starts Course to Promote Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A special course to promote the basic
law of Macao Special Administrative Region among civil servants
and other personages in Macao was started here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people, most of whom are civil servants and teachers,
are attending the month-long seminar. It was the fourth such
course since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The course, with the Macao Association for the Promotion of the
Basic Law of Macao Special Administration Region as the main
organizer, aims to help attendants to know more about the law and
related affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lee Shing Chun, former member of the drafting committee for the
law, delivered the first lecture. Others to give lecture at the
course include those who participated in the drafting or the
consultation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Organizers say that the promotion of the law is very important
since the law serves as a constitutional one and covers politics,
economy, culture, people's life and many other aspects of the
future Macao Special Administrative Region after China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
More than 270 people have joined in the course since it was
first started in 1994. Many participants say after the month-long
study that they have become more confident in the future of Macao
since they know more about the law.

HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market surged
 today with Hang Seng Index (HSI) rising 101.18 points to close at
11,088.

<P>
Since April 10, HSI, a key indicator for blue chips at the

<P>
They noted that the good performance of the blue chips,
especially shares of finance, contributed to the higher index at

JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 million people have
been registered to vote in the 1997 general elections in
Indonesia, Antara news agency quoted an official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Secretary general of the National Electoral Institute (LPU)
Suryana Subrata said the National Voters Registration Committee
registered the electorate across the country starting May 1.
</P>
<P>
"The official results are not yet known, but it can be expected
that the final figure will not be far from the 119.93 million
voters projected by LPU," he said.
</P>
<P>
The final figure was still being compiled from every region in
the country, which has a population of around 195 million, and
would be made public after June 21, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's upcoming polls in 1997 will elect 425 of the
country's 500 elected parliamentary seats. The remaining 75 are
appointed by the president from among the Indonesian armed forces
(ABRI) who do not have the right to vote in elections.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, the ruling Golkar won 282 of the 400
elected parliamentary seats. The Moslem-based United Development
Party (PPP) and the Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI)
bagged 62 and 56 seats respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe today that China is ready to
strengthen political consultations and economic cooperation with
countries in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang considered that southern Africa has become the most
promising region in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Mugabe briefed Jiang on the situation in
Africa, especially southern Africa. He said the situation in the
region is moving toward peace thanks to the joint efforts of
relevant countries, creating important conditions for its
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said China is becoming a partner of cooperation with
Africa and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe welcomes China to strengthen cooperation with the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and other
organizations in the region, and it also welcomes more
cooperation between China and the Organization of African Unity,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Africa, Jiang said the development of
African economy is affected by the unreasonable old economic
order in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the international community, particularly the
developed countries, are responsible for "doing more practical
things" for the development of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Zimbabwe for pursuing an independent,
good-neighborly and non-aligned foreign policy and for upholding
African unity and mediating regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state also hailed Sino-Zimbabwean relations.
Mugabe said he believes that the first ever visit by a Chinese
head of state to his country will promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to make efforts to further expand the trade ties
and existing economic cooperation between the two countries.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bulgarian Premier Jean
Videnov said here today that his China trip has so far been a
success.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Chinese and Bulgarian correspondents, the
Premier said, as the first Bulgarian premier to visit China in the past
40 years, he thanked the Chinese government for the invitation and
for the Chinese government's considerate arrangements to ensure the
success of his official trip.
</P>
<P>
Both Bulgaria and China are facing the same tasks and
objectives of developing their economies through reforms and
improving their people's living standards. At the same time, the
two countries share extensive views or have similar views on many
major international issues. "It is indeed valuable that the two
countries can understand each other, and support and co-operate
with each other, despite the fact that they are far apart,"
Videnov said.
</P>
<P>
The Premier said Bulgaria and China have had traditionally
friendly ties with each other. The successful visit plus the
agreements and documents signed between the two countries during
the visit have laid a legal base for advancing the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will take practical measures to embody the Bulgarian
government's policy of giving priority to China. These include the
offering of preferential treatment and expand economic links and
two-way trade.

<HEADLINE> APEC Members to Submit Action Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from 18 members of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will meet in Cebu of
the Philippines Wednesday to tackle the difficult process of
translating a blueprint on free trade into action.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss preparations for the informal APEC
leaders' meeting to be hosted by the Philippines in November.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, not all the 18 members are
expected to submit their action plans during this meeting for two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Big economies, such as Japan and the United States, would like
to hold their cards for as long as the rules would allow lest they
make promises that are far more liberal than those of other
economies," a senior Philippine envoy said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, members like Hong Kong and Singapore that
have long loosened reins on their markets are expected to come
ready with their individual action plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the sheer bulk of the required documents
would also take some time to complete.
</P>
<P>
Each member is expected to submit action plans on 28 specific
areas relating to trade and investment and economic and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since separate plans are required for the individual,
collective and multilateral fora, each member would have to submit
a total of 84 plans.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, as host of this year's summit, is asked to
accept and review the action plans of the 18 member-economies,
numbering 1,512.
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1989 in Canberra as an informal dialogue group, the
APEC has since become the primary regional vehicle for promoting
free trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have a combined gross national product of 13.2
trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 55 percent of the
world's annual output, and account for about 46 percent of the
world's total merchandise trade.

PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Funcinpec, the largest in the

"Funinpec exhibits clear weakness," said one observer, and
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, president of the party
since its founding in 1992, is aware of it.

Ahmad Yahya, a Funinpec delegate in the National Assembly, on

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), met here
this afternoon with visiting Bulgarian Prime Minister Jean Videnov
at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting both expressed their satisfaction with the
smooth development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his congratulations on Videnov's successful visit to
China, Qiao said that both China and Bulgaria are facing the task
of developing the economy and improving the people's life, and the
strengthening of bilateral reciprocal co-operation is in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that China attaches importance to Videnov's visit
here, hoping the visit can raise bilateral co-operation in various
fields to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to Bulgaria, Qiao said that the Bulgarian
people's friendship for the Chinese people left him with a deep
impression.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the exchanges between the two parliaments is an
important part of Sino-Bulgarian relations, Qiao noted that
China's NPC attaches importance to its relations with the
Bulgarian National Assembly, and the NPC is willing to make
efforts for exchanges and co-operation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Videnov said that Bulgaria pays much attention to its relations
with China, and appreciates China's fair and rational policy on
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Bulgaria's "one China" policy, Videnov said that
Bulgaria recognizes the government of the People's Republic of
China as China's sole legitimate government and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Bulgaria holds that any official
contacts with Taiwan are dangerous and the Taiwan question should
not be internationalized, adding that there should be no foreign
involvement in the question.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said he appreciated Videnov's views on this point.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Fight West Over-control of ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to champion an
African campaign against the west over control of the African
Development Bank (ADB) as the 32nd annual meeting of the bank
takes off tomorrow in Abidjan, Cote D'ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported here today that the non-regional members
of the bank, mainly from the west, are trying to limit Nigeria's
access to the soft loans of ADB and to ''take full control of the
Africn bank.''
</P>
<P>
The African Development Bank is now largely funded by the 26
non-regional member countries, whose say in the bank's managment,
therefore, is becoming increasingly bigger.
</P>
<P>
A recent report produced by the non-regional members advocated
a total restructuring of the bank to bring about competence and
effective management.
</P>
<P>
As a result, fears are arising that the move ''by outsiders",
pendinding its success, would put the African bank "at the mercy
of the non-regional members.''
</P>
<P>
The report also advocated an increase in the shares of the
non-regional members from the current 34.5 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the non-regional members have the veto
power in the affairs of the bank.
</P>
<P>
And whatsmore, the non-regional members demanded that the
bank's auditors, made up of African firms such as Akintola
Williams, be changed for ''improper conduct.''
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Finance Minister antony ani who led the nigerian
delegation to Abidjan, said Nigeria will not accept any
restructuring that gives away Africa's heritage.
</P>
<P>
''We cannot accept a situation where we will give up the right
of african property,'' said Ani, adding that accepting the
report's proposal is not in the interest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
''Although the non-regional members provided money for the
bank, it is not necssary for them to take over the control of the
bank,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, he said, should provide succour for African countries
who cannot secure loans from multilateral financial institutions
like the IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Observers say Nigeria, which is curretly sanctioned by the
west feared that if the west take control of the ADB, its
prospect of loans from the ADB would be dimmed.
</P>
<P>
''The non-regional members do not need majority share of the
bank to assst Africa,'' said Ani.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Finance Ministr also criticised the ADB
president, Omar Kabaj who is a Moroccan, in handling the
situation, saying that the ADB president should have consultations
with African leaders first before taking any decision on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
"The African Development Bank was formed by the OAU, and if
any fundamental decision concerning its structures has to be
made, it has to be referred back to the OAU," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is made up of 52 OAU member countries and 26
non-regional members including 16 European countries, four from
America, four from Asia and two from the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Arab States for Not Using Persian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has criticized Arab countries
for using the Arab Gulf and the Gulf instead of the Persian
Gulf, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Ataullah Mohajerani, vice-president for Legal and Parliament
Affairs, said that "the Persian Gulf is a historical name which
can not be changed for political consideration."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a Seminar on Persian Gulf in the
Persian Culture and Literature, which opened Monday and will close
today on Kish Island.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani said the name "Persian" was put on the southern
Iranian waterway since the Iranians are the oldest residents of
the area in and surrounding the gulf and possess "the most
ancient civilization" in the region.
</P>
<P>
The "Persian" part of the phrase Persian Gulf came under
question and controversy when foreign countries and western news
agencies began to "meddle in the affairs of the region for selfish
political purposes," he noted in a report carried by the Persian
daily Jomhuri Islami.
</P>
<P>
He said the term "Arab" used by some Arab circles to refer the
waterway is a misnomer and a "fraud."
</P>
<P>
The name Persian Gulf is used in all historical documents and
reference books, and it was used even by the Arabs themselves in
all their documents until a few decades ago with no problems, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said in conclusion that Iran does not claim to be
the owner of the waterway and the Persian Gulf belongs to all its
littoral states and others can not meddle in its
administrations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the argument between Iran and some other Arab
countries in the name of the Persian Gulf, Iran and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) have a territorial dispute over the three
islands -- the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran has declared that it wants more dialogue with Arab
countries in a bid to ease the tensions and foster an environment
of openness.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Maleki, deputy foreign minister for training and
research, said that both Iran and Arab countries need to better
understand each other.
</P>
<P>
He said that official delegations have been exchanged between
Iran and Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Philippine Major Industries Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Net sales of 21 major Philippine
industries reached 371.163 billion pesos (14.846 billion US
dollars) in 1995, 15 percent up from the previous year's 322.508
billion pesos (12.9 billion US dollars), the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a DTI survey over 893 firms, the sales increase
was pulled up by the huge increase in the electronics,
plastic-based, agro-based, iron and steel, and metallic mining
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Top losers for the period are textile, wood-based, furniture
and sugar industries.
</P>
<P>
Among the gainers, the electronics sector topped the list with
a whopping 35 percent increase in volume or a total value of
42.144 billion pesos (1.686 billion US dollars) from 32 billion
pesos (1.28 billion dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The DTI attributed the strong electronics performance to the
increasing global demand for locally-manufactured semi-conductor
products following expansion in world production for
telecommunications equipment and related products.
</P>
<P>
Among the losers, the textile sector posted a 10 percent
decrease in sales volume and a corresponding increase of five
percent in value from 1994 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was due to poor demand situation following increases in
the prices of prime commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A local television station has
completed China's first TV documentary on the reincarnation of
living buddhas.
</P>
<P>
The five-part program charts the history of the traditional
rites, as well as its characteristics, which only exist in Tibetan
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan buddhists believe that the souls of their religious
leaders transfer to the bodies of new born children after they
have died, thus their lives can recycle eternally in the universe.
</P>
<P>
The most valuable content of the documentary is the filming of
the recent choosing of the soul boy of the 11th Panchen Lama. The
process was entirely in accordance with historical and religious
norms.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Provincial TV Station, the program maker, says the
documentary was written by Zhao Puchu, president of the China
Buddist Association.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan Buddhism is popular in Qinghai, the northwest China
province which adjoins Tibet.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Esso China Upstream Limited (Esso),
and its two cooperators in Tarim Basin today announced the
initiation of a three million dollar social assistance program in
Qiemo County, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the donation, 1.6 million US dollars, was
presented by Esso, Sumisho Oil &AMP; Gas Exploration and Inpex
Southeast Tarim today.
</P>
<P>
Decisions about phase two funding of 1.4 million US dollars
will be made at a later date, based on Phase one project results,
according to Esso.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Petroleum Exploration and Development Bureau, the
United Nations Children's Fund and the Foundation for
Underdeveloped Regions in China will be responsible for the
implementation of the initial phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to establish highway maintenance stations
along the Qiemo-Ruoquing highway, improve access to clean water in
rural areas, provide sanitation and hygiene education, enhance
educational planning and teacher training, and expand the Qiemo
County Central Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Qiemo is China's second largest county, with a population of
more than 46,000. Its remote location and difficult access to
transportation have held back the economic development of the
county.
</P>
<P>
US-based Exxon Corporation is one of the largest and oldest of
the world's industrial enterprises, operating in more than 100
countries under the Exxon and the Esso names. The company is
undertaking opportunities in many aspects of the energy sector in

MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The gross international reserves
(GIR) of the Philippines reached 9.838 billion US dollars as of
May 20, the central bank said today.
</P>
<P>
This level exceeded the programmed GIR level of 9.48 billion
dollars for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The build-up in reserves is partly due to the central bank's
aggressive dollar buying.
</P>
<P>
As of May 20, total dollar purchase by the central bank reached
2.75 billion while it sold only 165 million.
</P>
<P>
Government officials noted that the central bank's dollar
buying has kept the pesos stable at around 26.17 pesos to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they added, the peso would strengthen to a level
which could make Philippine exports uncompetitive.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The prize for the best actress was awarded to Brenda Blethyn,

<HEADLINE> Highway To Move To Protect Buddhist Grottoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DATONG, SHANXI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A highway in China is to be
moved at a cost of 100 million yuan - to help protect 1,500
year-old Buddhist statues.
</P>
<P>
North China's Shanxi Province plans to relocate the highway,
which now runs in front of Yungang Grottoes, to ensure a cleaner
environment for the ancient statues.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress of Datong City, where the grottoes are
located, will map out specific regulations this year, sources
said. Once the regulations are passed, a 30-km-long section of the
109 state-level highway will be relocated to the back of the
grottoes.
</P>
<P>
Total investments are estimated at some 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, 18,000 coal trucks run on the highway in front of
the grottoes. Many Buddhist statues are shrouded in dust and dirt.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes, located about 16 km west of Datong in Shanxi
Province, were carved out of a hill in the fifth century. They run
some one km from east to west, and consist of 45 major grottoes,
more than 1,100 minor grottoes and over 51,000 statues. They are
among the first batch of cultural relics under state-level key
protection.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the grottoes reflect Buddhist thoughts and the
course of the development of Buddhism and are distinct for the
combination of cultures and arts of various ethnic groups,
according to Wang Heng, an expert in the research of the grottoes.
</P>
<P>
"They are of extremely high artistic value," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the grottoes are located in a sea of coal,
being situated upon a thick layer of coal themselves. There are
several dozen coal mines around the grottoes, which produce more
than a 12 million tons of coal annually.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress proposed
the relocation of the highway, according to Xie Tingfan, assistant
dean of the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute. However, the
proposals failed to be put into effect owing to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of the highway will put an end to the pollution
of the grottoes brought about by the vehicles, alleviate the damage
to the grottoes caused by the shock when vehicles enter the
grottoes protection zone, and improve local tourist environment,
Xie said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Zhiguo, head of the Datong City's Cultural
Bureau and dean of the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute, the
Chinese Government set up a special organ to protect the grottoes
in the 1950s. During the Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period,
ten million yuan was spent on the protection of the grottoes.

<HEADLINE> US Renewing MFN Status to China Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Cui Tiankai said here today that China welcomes President
Clinton's announcement to unconditionally renew the Most Favorite
Nation (MFN) trading status to China.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press conference here this afternoon
in response to a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton has made a wise decision," Cui said, adding
that the Chinese government has always believed that the mutual
granting by China and the US of the MFN status to each other
constitutes the basis for Sino-US economic and trade relations,
facilitates the bilateral cooperation and exchanges in the
economic and trade area and serves the fundamental interests of
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
However, the FM spokesman pointed out that the annual review of
the MFN status by the US side is not conducive to the
establishment of a long-term, stable and normal economic and trade
relationships between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
China hopes, Cui said, that the US side will reverse this
erroneous practice which has long been antiquated.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Accuses Israel of Violating Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz accused here this morning Israel of violating the
cease-fire understanding reached between the two countries on
April 26 which bans any attack at or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure for a European tour, Boueiz said the recent
Israeli military escalation in south Lebanon "constituted
basically a violation of the April understanding, which came to
contribute in keeping civilians away from aggressions."
</P>
<P>
At the Beirut International Airport, he described the Israeli
bombardments at southern Lebanese villages on the weekend in
which a woman was wounded as an "unjustified aggression
especially targeting civilians."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz believed that the aggression was aimed at "exerting
pressure probably upon the negotiators in Washington in order to
impose the Israeli conditions on the formation of the (cease-fire
monitoring) committee which is being discussed there."
</P>
<P>
On a complaint which Lebanon could file against Israel, the
Lebanese foreign minister said that "we have been studying this
issue until this moment."
</P>
<P>
"Of course it is not easy to file the complaint to the
(monitoring) committee which has not been set up, but we are
studying whether it is useful to lodge the complaint to the
U.N. Security Council," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister Left here this morning for a
three-day official visit to Bonn at the invitation of German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon
and Syria have been holding meetings in Washington since May 10
to iron out their differences on the formation of the five-state
monitoring committee in south Lebanon, but no agreement has been
reached yet.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Protecting Gibbons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from across China today
called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black
gibbons in southern China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 experts and professors from 25 research
institutes and colleges across the country have launched the
nationwide appeal. They called on government departments to
participate in and mobilize social forces to enhance the
construction and management of a natural protection zone on
Bawangling Mountain, where black gibbons live.
</P>
<P>
Located in the western part of Hainan province, Bawangling
Mountain boasts more than 1,000 varieties of wild animals, with
over 40 kinds belonging to rare animals.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the
forest area of the province's 10 counties. Living space for
gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population,
deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of
tropical rain forests.
</P>
<P>
Now there are only 15 to 20 gibbons remaining in the mountain
area.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical
rain forest. They have the same skeletal structure as humans --
four limbs, facial features, internal organs, and similar blood as
human beings; and they are physiologically, psychologically and
mentally similar to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons are of high research value, regarded by many as
precious as giant pandas in China, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Many international and foreign organizations have paid close
attention to the protection of gibbons. They sent teams to conduct
on-the-spot studies, established research centers, provide funds
and publish information to generate world wide attention to their
plight.
</P>
<P>
Hainan provincial government department has vowed to set up a
foundation for the protection of gibbons, and to prevent and crack
down on activities which threaten the life of gibbons.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Meet with King Hussein in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak will meet King Hussein of Jordan in London today, in an bid
to resolve the strains in relations with Jordan and restart the
high-level dialogue interrupted by Operation Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
The meeting follows Prime Minister Shimon Peres' consultation
with top aides Sunday night in an effort to explore ways to ease
the current difficulties in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials hope that the resumption of high-level talks
will reduce the negative public opinion in Jordan against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to brief King Hussein on political
developments in dealings with the Palestinians and Lebanon in the
aftermath of the Operation Grapes of Wrath in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for London, Barak told the Jerusalem Post that
he thought Israel "has a first-rate strategic interest in a
strong, sovereign Hashemite Kingdom, confident in itself."
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which did not wait for Syria to make peace with
Israel, has made a tremendous contribution to the peace process,
said Barak, adding that "Jordan plays a central role in any final
status agreement with the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli media reported that King Hussein, who is upset with
Peres, has declined an invitation to meet with Peres and
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, while Peres wanted to visit Amman last week as a
pre-election illustration of the bilateral friendship, Jordan
withheld the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted senior Israeli officials as saying that King
Hussein declined to appear with Peres both times to maintain
neutrality between the two rival parties of Labor and Likud,
particularly before the May 29 Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
They said that in addition to its anger at Operation Grape of
Wrath, during which more than 300 Lebanese civilians were killed,
Jordan has been disappointed at the lack of Israeli investment
and low level of trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said that apart from the
initiation of the dialogue itself, there are specific issues
Jordan would like discussed.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would like to clarify, and hopefully increase, its
export quotas to the West Bank, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordan complained about the low levels of its exports to the
West Bank agreed on by Israel and the Palestinians in May 1994,
and of its exports permitted under Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The officials said a delegation of Israeli businessmen is
expected to arrive in Amman, capital of Jordan, early next week.
</P>
<P>
On the water issue, Israeli officials say their country is
committed to transferring a minimum of 50 million cubic meters of
water from the north to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher told reporters
in Amman Monday that the water agreement also calls on Israel to
provide Jordan with some extra 50 million cubic meters one year
after the conclusion of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Muasher insisted that Israel is to provide Jordan with 100
million cubic meters after Jordan builds several dams on the
Jordan and Yarmouk rivers, which are expected to cost up to 500
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli officials denied that they are expected to
provide Jordan with this extra water.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Bulgarian Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
today met Bulgarian Premier Jean Videnov at Beijing's Great Hall
of the People. He expressed the hope of developing a long-term,
stable and healthy bilateral relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the premier on his first China trip,
Rong said the Chinese government and the people have always
treasured the friendly and cooperative relations with Bulgaria,
based on the traditional friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Rong said, there have been increasing
exchanges between the two countries in political, economic ties
and trade and cultural fields and the channels for cooperation
kept expanding. This has promised a greater potential for
advancing the cooperation, Rong said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China wishes, through joint efforts, to advance
the "long-term, stable and healthy" relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, both China and Bulgaria are engaged in
economic reforms and the two countries have much in common.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two countries enhance mutual understanding,
expand cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and
further promote bilateral relations," Rong said.
</P>
<P>
Videnov described Bulgarian-Chinese relations as developing
smoothly, and the prospects for developing the relations were
bright.
</P>
<P>
He believed his ongoing visit to China would exert a
stimulating role to the advancement of the relations. At present
political relations between Bulgaria and China are good, and the
agreements between the two sides concluded during the current
visit have laid a legal basis for developing bilateral
relations. For economic ties and trade, Videnov said the two sides
should probe new ways and channels.

<P>
LISBON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has commissioned
the Portuguese government to hold an international conference on
prevention of global desertification next month.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that the meeting, to be
sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), is
scheduled for June 24 and 28 in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up to the U.N. Conference on Environment and
Development in 1992, the upcoming meeting will discuss measures to
protect forest resources and restore forest ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Focus will be given to the drought-hit Africa, where
desertification has grown worse.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is a major global environmental problem.
U.N. statistics showed 30 percent of the world's land areas and 5
percent of the population have been affected by desertification.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Portuguese government indicated that Portugal,
with one-third of its land areas eroded by deserts, is the country
that has suffered most from desertification in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Most College Graduates Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 866,000 college
students who will graduate this Summer have already found jobs,
the State Education Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Beijing-based SEC showed that about
95 percent of all post graduates and 90 percent of the 400,000
four-year college students, were ready to work immediately after
graduation, which usually happens in July each year in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of all two-year college students have found
jobs. The SEC asked local governments, relevant departments,
colleges and universities to spare no efforts to help the
remainder find jobs, with the graduation date looming in less than
two months.
</P>
<P>
As the idea of a market economy became acceptable to more
people in China in recent years, college students expected more
out of their future jobs. Government assigned jobs once made
parents and students feel comforted that work was guaranteed. But
that ethos is losing its glamour.
</P>
<P>
College education used to be paid totally by the government in
China. It began to change in Autumn, 1994 when 30 universities
were allowed to charge freshmen for part of their tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, is still the main financial supporter
of college education. The money charged only makes up 10 to 20
percent of the actual costs needed for higher education.
</P>
<P>
Today's college students are more willing to look for jobs
themselves, rather than being assigned one, for they believe that
they might be more suited and satisfied by jobs they find.
</P>
<P>
The SEC called for coordination between the country's demand
and the individual's will, and encouraged students to work in
grassroots units which most badly need them.
</P>
<P>
A total of 895,000 college students graduated last year, more
than any other year after the founding of New China in 1949. Most
of them have found jobs by June 1995, one month before
graduation.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian officials
discussed today with their Cambodian hosts about the feasibility
of building a Trans-Asia rail link.
</P>
<P>
The officials, led by Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong
Sik, arrived here yesterday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Trans-Asia rail link, proposed for the first time in the

Thailand and the three-nation Indochina.
</P>
<P>
The initiative regained momentum recently as countries in the
region, including Malaysia and Cambodia, have determined to push
forward their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks, according to a senior Cambodian official, was a
follow-up to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
summit meeting in Bangkok on December 14-15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, seven ASEAN nations decided to cooperate on
developing the Mekong Basin in order to expedite the economic
development of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting this morning, Malaysian and Cambodian
officials also discussed how to enhance bilateral cooperation,

<HEADLINE> Cement Plant Moving out of Ancient Ruins in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A cement plant is moving out of the
Karub ruins in eastern Tibet, a site where human beings are
believed to have lived some 4,600 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Karub lies in Karub Village, 12 km southeast of the Qamdo
County Seat in the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous
Region. The Qamdo Cement Plant was built on the ruins in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists agree that the ruins are of tremendous
significance for the study of the origin of mankind on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
They have been listed by the Tibet regional government as a
site under special protection.
</P>
<P>
The Qamdo Prefectural Commissioner's Office maintained that
no industrial facility can replace the value of ancient
culture. It thus decided to move the cement plant.
</P>
<P>
The plant is now moving out with a loan from the State
Development Bank to a place far from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
A leading official of the Qamdo Prefectural Culture Bureau said
that after the move is completed, a number of protective
facilities will be built at the ruins.

<HEADLINE> Over 170,000 Sri Lankans Secure Foreign Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 21 (Xinhua)-- Over 170,000 Sri Lankans have
secured foreign employment last year, according to Central Bank
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources today said that according to latest statistics, a
total of 170,131 persons got jobs overseas last year, reflecting
an increase of 5.2 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The main demand was for unskilled workers, 66 percent of them
being females as a result of the increased demand for housemaids
in non-Middle Eastern countries such as Singapore, the Maldives
and Italy, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that the Middle East accounted for the
largest share of about 92 percent of the total departures despite
the fact that salaries and wages in those countries have stagnated
over a long period.
</P>
<P>
New employment opportunities were found in some of the fast
developing Asian countries such South Korea and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the government is continuing to improve
and expand facilities for people leaving for foreign employment as
they have become a major source of foreign exchange earnings and
have reduced the domestic unemployment burden.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Power Situation Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's electricity situation
is now critical and the current daily power cut will be expanded
from six hours to eight hours starting from next week following
the delay in the South West monsoon rains, the country's
Electricity Board announced today.
</P>
<P>
The hydro catchment areas of the country receives about 2,000
millimeters of rain during the South West monsoon which usually
begins in early May.
</P>
<P>
This year however the monsoon has not come so far with the
catchment areas hardly receiving rain, triggering an unprecedented
power crisis.
About 84 percent of the country's total power generated is
hydro-based.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Department, a massive
atmospheric high pressure belt over South India has been pushing
the monsoon back towards the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
This belt has to weaken for the rains to come to Sri Lanka.
Consequently rains could be expected only in June, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the water levels in hydro reservoirs are fast
dropping and the crisis is expected to worsen although there is a
small capacity of thermal back-up.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has called on local
representatives of foreign energy companies to propose alternative
means of power generation to find a quick solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Power Anurudha Ratwatte has called on business
houses to switch off neon lights and advertising sign boards
operated with electricity.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn China of Inadequate Fixed Asset Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's investments in fixed assets
since the start of the year have been inadequate, a leading
economist warned in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the trend to continue will likely mean the country
suffering a substantial slowdown this year, warned Zheng Jingping,
deputy director of intergrated department of the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zheng told Xinhua that China needs to strengthen investments on
fixed assets by way of improving the investment structure and
injecting more capital into technical upgrading and renovation
projects, as well as on communications and energy.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economic growth for the past two years was
pulled by a three-horse cart, that is, by strong growth in foreign
trade surplus, fixed assets investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"This year, however, the economy has to proceed on a bicycle,
with the two wheels being consumption and fixed asset investment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The economist said that China has to go without the horse of
foreign trade surplus because the net export figure is estimated
to be on a downward spiral this year, and its favorable influence
on the economy will be obviously curbed.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China suffered a net foreign trade deficit
of 1.16 billion US dollars during the first quarter of this year,
reversing the trend of exports surpassing imports last year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng estimated that China's net exports will decrease by a
range of 29.3 percent to 90.4 percent this year to 1.6 billion US
dollars and 11.8 billion US dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
"With the effects of import and export prices and exchange
rate-changes considered, China's net export for the whole year
will descend actually by 20 percent to 70 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, of the two wheels carrying the Chinese economy, the
wheel of consumption is almost big enough while the wheel of fixed
asset investment is too small, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's retail sales volume hit 572 billion yuan during the
first quarter this year, 23.6 percent higher than the same period
last year. The actual growth rate is 14.8 percent after inflation
is discounted and it is about twice the average level of the same
period of the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
For the same period, however, China's fixed asset investments
grew only 16.2 percent on a yearly basis, 18 percentage points off
from the growth rate of the same period last year. The real growth
rate was around ten percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that China saw a sharp reduction in the number of
projects started in the areas of capital construction and
technical upgrading and renovation during the first quarter this
year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter, China started 4,000 projects in those
areas, 605 less from the same quarter last year, a drop of 13.1
percent. The total amount of investment involved dipped 9.9
percent to 38.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He warns that assuming China's net export value is slashed by
more than 50 percent from last year and China's fixed assets
investment persists at the speed of the first quarter, China's
economy can grow only by seven percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"For a huge developing country, the motivating power behind the
economic growth should come mainly from fixed assets investments,
rather than consumption," he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China take appropriate measures to strengthen
investment on fixed assets to prevent a drastic slowdown in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The fixed assets investment should grow by around 12 percent
this year in order to guarantee the attainment of an economic
growth rate of around nine percent," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's State-Owned Businesses to Be listed Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to make use of
domestic and foreign resources and markets by encouraging its
state-owned businesses to be listed on foreign stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made today by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
at the seminar to discuss the possibility of Chinese businesses
being listed on the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine also attended
the Beijing seminar, which was sponsored by the London Stock
Exchange and China International Trust and Investment Company
(CITIC).
</P>
<P>
Introducing funds from the international stock markets into
China is an important way for Chinese businesses to use foreign
capital, Li said. He added that the practice will not only extend
the channels of absorbing foreign capital, but also play a
positive role in upgrading Chinese business management systems,
and spurring the process of internationalization.
</P>
<P>
He continued that China's state-owned enterprises had gained
valuable experiences from their experiments of being listed on
foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
So far 24 state-owned enterprises in China have been listed on
foreign stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine spoke highly of the economic achievement China had
made in recent years, adding that China needs a modern financial
service sector to support its economic development, and the City
of London, as a major international center of finance and
commerce, would like to help China in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the London Stock Exchange and its
Shanghai counterpart would cement their cooperation, and a
memorandum of understanding on financial cooperation between the
two countries would be signed as early as possible, thus enabling
Chinese companies to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Sir Alf Ramsey, who masterminded
England's 1966 World Cup triumph, said he had been snubbed by the
organisers of next month's European soccer championship finals
and has left for the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I have not been invited to Euro 96. I would like to have
been involved but it would seem I have been overlooked and
forgotten," the former England manager told the Daily Mirror
before flying off on Monday.
</P>
<P>
His wife Vicki told the newspaper: "Alfred just wanted to get
away from it all. He is bitter about things. It is sad that we
never treat our heroes well."
</P>

Ramsey, now 76, said he had wanted the Football Association
to parade the 1966 winning team at London's Wembley Stadium
before the inaugural Euro 96 match on June 8.
</P>
<P>
"To have been together with them at Wembley and been
officially presented to the crowd would have been a tribute to
them as much as me," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Mirror promptly launched a "Bring Back Our Sir Alf"
campaign, urging readers to phone in and fax their support for the
manager who led England to their greatest soccer triumph.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Work on the massive Three Gorges
Project is slightly ahead of schedule and the damming of the
Yangtze River in next year is now a foregone conclusion, said a
senior company official.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Guolin, vice-president of the Yangtze River Three Gorges
Development Corporation, the major undertaker of the
hydro-electrical project, said that the quality of its
sub-projects, funding, resettlement and construction order have
been "fine".
</P>
<P>
Yuan spoke during a recent visit to Shanghai at the invitation
of the Shanghai municipal government to discuss progress of the
project, the world's largest water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of March, a total investment of 12.3
billion yuan (about 1.48 billion US dollars) had gone into the
project. At the same time, 114 million cubic meters of earth and
stone had been removed, and 2.1 million cu m of concrete had been
put in place.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to this February, 1,763 contracts for the project
have been signed, with a contractual value totalling 8.9 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official went on to say that all of the major sub-projects
are going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase of a water diversion channel on the river's
right bank, 43 percent of the concrete placement has been
finished. The entire placement is scheduled to be completed next
April. Navigation in the new channel in September 1997 will pose
no problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the left bank, a temporary shiplock is estimated to be
completed in 1997 and put into navigational use in April 1998, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The bidding work for the permanent shiplock has been
completed. At the end of March work teams entered the construction
site, and the lock is expected to be completed and opened for
navigation in 2003, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The construction speed of the auxiliary projects is fast, Yuan
said. Three Gorges Airport will be opened to traffic this October,
an expressway will be opened before October 1, National Day. The
Xiling Yangtze River Bridge will be opened to traffic this June.
</P>
<P>
Water supply, power supply, telecommunications, transportation,
harbors, sands and concrete will also meet the demands of
construction work.
</P>
<P>
At the dam site pace of resettlement can basically keep up with
the project's construction speed, Yuan said. So far about 2,000
hectares of land have been requisitioned and almost 15,000 people
have been resettled in the area, accounting for 98 percent and 95
percent of the overall plan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China has given top priority to the construction quality, Yuan
said, noting that a complete check and acceptance system for
design, building and supervision has been set up.
</P>
<P>
The projects finished before 1995 have met the requirements of
design. The cofferdam's first phase, completed in 1994, has stood
tests of two flood seasons, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project will take 17 years to complete. By the
time the reservoir is full of water in 2009, 21 counties and
cities will be under water and over one million people will have
been resettled.

<HEADLINE> HK Chambers of Commerce Criticize Patten in Open Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven chambers of commerce in
Hong Kong issued an open letter to British Prime Minister John
Major Monday night, criticizing Governor Chris Patten's attacks on
Hong Kong's business community.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Patten's criticisms in his remarks made
during his tour of North America two weeks ago were inappropriate
and divisive.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Federation of
Hong Kong Industries, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of
Hong Kong, Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, the
Hong Kong Exporters' Association and New Territories Commercial
and Industrial General Association Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to express our profound disappointment at some
of the public statements reportedly made by Governor Christopher
Patten during his recent visit to North America, specifically his
remarks in an interview with Newsweek magazine," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It stated that "whatever the precise words the Governor may or
may not have used, we very much regret that he has given the
impression that business people in Hong Kong do not have the
Territory's best interests at heart. In doing so, he has cast
doubt on the integrity of the business community, and undermined
the tremendous contribution business has made to the development
of Hong Kong and to the livelihood of the Hong Kong people."
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Patten sees fit to criticize the very people who have
helped make Hong Kong the economic success story it is today. The
attack on them and the reference to having foreign passports in
their back pockets were both inappropriate and divisive."
</P>
<P>
It said that what Hong Kong needs today is for its political
and business leaders to inspire confidence in Hong Kong in the
international arena. Patten has, through his inappropriate and
unjustified attacks on the business community, ended up doing Hong
Kong a great disservice.
</P>
<P>
The letter stated that in spite of all this, the business
community continues to stand steadfastly behind Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim, our interest, is to help ensure continued stability
and prosperity for Hong Kong, and a high standard of living for
its people. The business community has faith in the Basic Law and
the One Country, Two Systems principle; and we have every
confidence in the future of Hong Kong after 1997. We believe that
all parties must work together to create and project a positive
environment and image of Hong Kong," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Hong Kong-based newspapers carried the open letter
today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Uncollected rubbish is stinking in
Chiang Mai, a popular tourist city in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
More than 750 tons of rubbish has been left uncollected on
pavements and street corners over the weekend, giving foul odor.
</P>
<P>
With nowhere to go, some rubbish trucks are parked at various
street sides with their foul-smelling cargo.
</P>
<P>
The situation was caused by villagers, who, unable to bear the
stench, would not allow rubbish trucks to enter the landfill near
their homes.
</P>
<P>
Villagers accuse the municipality of mismanaging the landfill,
which is recently flooded and emits a foul stench that has made
life miserable for residents for months.
</P>
<P>
The city, producing around 250 tons of rubbish daily, has only
one landfill, about 25 kilometers from town.
</P>
<P>
The six-meter deep landfill has been flooded by waste and
rainwater. chemicals have been sprayed on to kill flies and
alleviate the stench.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Sakol Kanthakasuwan and other officials visited the
landfill site on Monday and met villager representatives.
</P>
<P>
The villages gave officials seven days to solve the problem and
will allow rubbish trucks to enter the landfill today.
</P>
<P>
The villagers also demand that the municipality speed up
construction of a tapwater system and a road for the village, as
promised last year.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Unsure of Winning Trust Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee on Monday could not definitely say whether he would win a
crucial vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha (house of the people)
scheduled to be held by the end of this month, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) leader formed a minority
government last week at the invitation of President Shankar Dayal
Sharma because the BJP emerged as the single largest party in the
general elections held between April 27 and May 7.
</P>
<P>
But the new government must win the vote of confidence in the
new Lok Sabha by May 31.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview to local newspapers since becoming prime
minister, Vajpayee said "whatever the decision of the house (of
the people), I shall take it in my stride."
</P>
<P>
He said the BJP was trying to enlist the support of regional
parties.
</P>
<P>
"How far these efforts have succeeded would be known only from
the attitude of the new members of parliament who will be
assembling shortly in the capital for the parliamentary session
due to begin on Wednesday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 537 Lok Sabha seats so far elected, the BJP and its
allies won 195, 74 seats short of the needed 269-seat simple
majority.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Proud Siberian tiger Jisheng is
living up to her name as she nurtures her four latest offspring,
born at Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials thought of the name Jisheng because it means "to
continue to give birth".
</P>
<P>
Jisheng is a daughter of Lida, the zoo's famous "Heroic Mother"
who has 20 children at a dozen zoos across the country.
</P>
<P>
Jisheng was the only offspring of old Lida to stay with her
mother, and zoo workers gave the name, hoping she can have many
children like her mother.
</P>
<P>
Jisheng has not disappointed her keepers. Seven years old,
she has already had 14 cubs from four births.
</P>
<P>
The four latest cubs -- described as happy and very lively --
were born on April 30 and next month Jisheng and her youngsters
will make their public debut at the zoo, likely to become a major
attraction for visitors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Sell Off F-5E Jet Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said here today that his ministry is considering
selling its US-made F-5E jet fighters as the cost of upgrading
them is prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Syed Hamid said a
study by his ministry found that it would be better to buy new
aircraft rather than spend about 500 million Malaysian ringgit
(about 200 million US dollars) in upgrading the F-5Es.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia has decided to phase out the F-5Es, adding
there would be no problem selling the aircraft as the ministry
already has interested buyers.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 F-5E jet fighters are still being flown by the
Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) which began using them in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an RMAF F-5E jet fighter crashed at the end of the
runway at an RMAF base in Kuantan when it caught fire. However,
the pilot managed to escape unhurt.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Union to Step into Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading British insurer Commercial
Union has received approval from the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, to open a representative office in Shanghai, China's
largest city.
</P>
<P>
"The representative office, which aims to create conditions for
CU to develop business in China in the future, will be launched in
about one month," said Peter Ward, CU's executive director and a
member of a large British delegation currently visiting China.
</P>
<P>
CU has two representative offices in Beijing and Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"We will apply to launch general insurance in Guangzhou in the
near future," said Ward.
</P>
<P>
"We selected Guangzhou because we know Guangzhou better, and our
successful affiliates in Hong Kong can help our new branch in
Guangzhou with personnel training, management and expertise.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our international clients have a presence in China," he
said, "once we inaugurate operations in China, we'll first provide
services to them."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that CU wants to get involved in life insurance
when consolidating its general insurance services in China.
</P>
<P>
Ward has exchanged views with some senior officials with the
State Planning Commission and the People's Bank of China on
opening China's insurance market.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that China needs to be cautious in opening the
market, with its development and maturity needing high
professional trust and standards.
</P>
<P>
"It is beneficial for opening the insurance market that the
Chinese government sets up a sound regulatory system and fosters
insurance companies suitable for the market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
CU's interest in China has gone beyond the insurance market.
"We're collecting facts and making investigations to select proper
investment projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a senior CU official responsible for
investment, visited China making extensive contacts on investing
the country.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Economy Benefits From Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Family Planning programs in east
China's Shandong province, one of the densely-populated provinces
in the country, has helped the area realize a steady increase in
per capita grain consumption.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the province produced 42 billion
kilograms of grain, with the per capita quota reaching 480
kilograms, 80 kilograms more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The province now has a population of 87 million, the third
largest in the country following provinces of Sichuan and Henan.
</P>
<P>
The province's farmland is one-15th of the country's total and
the province's population is one-14th of the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chuanlin, director of the provincial family planning
committee, said that the annual birth rate of the province was
controlled within three to five per thousand in the past five
years. The number of newly-born children was three million less
than the planned target.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau carried out a survey focusing on
environment, population, distribution of income, health, science
and education, culture and sports, in the country's 29 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions in 1995. It found that
Shandong ranked the 10th in comprehensive development index, 10.5
percentage points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
There are also noticeable changes in the province's rural areas
where the population increase was rapidest in the past and most
women there are tied up with their children.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year, 24.15 million
rural women in the province entered agricultural correspondence
colleges and agricultural broadcasting institutes, 10 million of
them have mastered one or two technical skills and more than
50,000 women obtained agricultural technical titles.

Samaranch was present here Saturday when Vice President Al Gore

He said that Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, "our oldest sponsor" had
been a "big help" to the Olympic movement.

But Samaranch also pointed out that true to Olympic tradition,
the Olympic sites would be "free from all advertisements even if
losing such publicity costs us millions and millions of dollars."

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today welcomed the decision by US President Bill Clinton
to extend Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for China.
</P>
<P>
But he added a warning that it is harmful to long-term Sino-US
economic cooperation and trade for the two countries to argue
about the problem each year. He said it could create psychological
instability among business people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li told a seminar in Beijing that China is not willing to see
the breakout of bilateral or multi-lateral trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
The differences on trade between the two countries could be
discussed on the basis of principles of equality and
mutual-benefits, Li noted, adding that it is useless to solve
differences by imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
China has reached great achievements in protecting intellectual
property rights by completing in a dozen years the tasks which
western countries had done in scores of years, even more than one
hundred years, he stressed.

TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish diplomat allegedly killed
two Iranian women in a car accident here and has run away from
the scene, the local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jomhuri Islami said that the accident took
place in a street of northern Tehran, claiming lives of a mother
and her daughter, who were out making preparations for the
daughter's marriage.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no specific time of the accident nor
names of the two Iranians and the Turkish diplomat or the plate
number of the car.
</P>
<P>
A diplomat in the Turkish Embassy here who was contacted by
Xinhua in a telephone call said that he knew nothing about the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the automobile
with a diplomatic plate number ran away in an extremely harsh way
from the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The high speed of the car and the driver's reckless driving was
the primary cause of the accident, it said.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that pertinent government agencies are pursuing
the matter which has been also brought to the attention of the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Hails Power Project in Pakistan as Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the successful conclusion of a 630 million U.S. dollars financing
package for the Uch Power Project in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the World Bank has provided a
partial risk guarantee of this kind for a project since the
streamlining of the World Bank's Guarantee Operation, and the
first guarantee operation to be undertaken in collaboration with
the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's guarantee helped to mobilize a 75 million
dollars syndicated commercial bank loan carrying a 15-year term,
the longest maturity to date for a commercial financing package
for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the guarantee, a 10 million dollars World
Bank loan will be provided through the Private Sector Energy
Development Fund (PSEDF), which was set up in Pakistan with
initial financing provided by the Bank and other donors in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, a member of the World Bank group in charge of lending
for private sector projects in developing countries, will provide
115 million dollars in financing and five private sector companies
will contribute 160 million dollars in equity.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the syndicated loan, the IFC is also providing a
loan of 40 million dollars for its regular account. U.S. Eximbank
is offering political risk cover for a 153 million dollars
construction period commercial loan and a loan of 97 million
dollars to be channeled through the PSEDF.
</P>
<P>
The Uch project will consist of a gas-fired, conventional
combined-cycle plant with an installed capacity of 586 megawatts
to be located in Pakistan's Balochistan Province.

<HEADLINE> Duma Speaker Raps CIS Leaders for Supporting Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Communist chairman of Russia's
State Duma, or the lower house of parliament, today accused CIS
leaders of intervening in Russia's internal affairs by openly
backing Russian President Boris Yeltsin in his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov of the Communist Party said the choice for
the next Russian president is up to Russian voters in the June
presidential elections and not the presidents of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), which comprises 12 former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
At their annual summit meeting held in Moscow Friday, Yeltsin's
11 CIS counterparts expressed the hope that Yeltsin, to whom
Communist candidate Gennady Zyuganov has been seen as the main
rival, would be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
They also adopted during the one-day meeting a political
statement backing Russia's reforms being carried out under the
leadership of Yeltsin and supporting Yeltsin in running for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the club of the CIS press attaches in Moscow,
Seleznyov said such all-out support to Yeltsin was tantamount to
"information violence with regard to society" and warned that this
could produce an opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov was elected Duma speaker soon after parliamentary
elections last December, which gave the Communist Party and its
allies a majority in the Duma.

<HEADLINE> Educators Appeal for Backing of Yeltsin in Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-one Russian college presidents
today called for the so-called "third force" to withdraw from the
presidential race and instead give their backing to President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter, they urged three third force contenders --
economist Grigory Yavlinsky, retired General Alexander Lebed and
former Finance Minister Svyatoslav Fyodorov -- to support Yeltsin
in the June presidential polls in order to "guarantee Russia's
reforms."
</P>
<P>
The letter said that despite many difficulties having popped up
in the transition period, the ongoing political and economic
reforms have "paved the way for national democratization and
economic prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has tried desperately to win support from the third
force in order to edge out his main opponent, Communist leader
Gennady Zyuganov, who had led Yeltsin in all opinion polls until
April.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky conditions his alliance with Yeltsin on drastic
changes in economic and political policies, a major reshuffle of
the government and an end of the prolonged Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
During his campaign trip in Siberia on Sunday, Yeltsin said he
had accepted Yavlinsky's conditions in principle.
</P>
<P>
In another development today, an opinion poll conducted by
Russia's Independent Television showed Yeltsin well ahead of all
the other 10 presidential candidates. The poll gave Yeltsin 33
percent of support, seven percentage points higher than Zyuganov
in second place.

the Austrian government introduced measures to boost employment at

Efforts by many European governments to cut budget deficits to
meet the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria have aroused

<HEADLINE> OECD Cuts European Growth Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest forecasts by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) put
growth in the OECD overall at 2.1 percent this year, its
Secretary-General Jean-Claude Paye said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is half a point below the OECD's forecasts last December,
which predicted 2.6 percent growth in 1996, rising to 2.8 percent
in 1997. The OECD now puts overall growth for 1997 at 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The downward revision of its projections result from the low
economic growth of OECD Europe since the second half of last
year. The average growth rate in OECD Europe in 1996 will be only
1.6 percent, in Germany a poor 0.5 percent, the OECD said.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the downward adjustment include rising
long-term and short-term interest rates and the excessive
appreciation of the German mark against the US dollar last year,
which significantly hindered Germany's exports.
</P>
<P>
Experts said interest rate cuts in the second half of this year
may push up the OECD's projected growth from 2.5 percent to 2.7
percent in 1997, if it is not affected by the plans of some
European countries to cut public spending.
</P>
<P>
The OECD forecasts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3 percent
in 1996 and 2 percent in 1997. For Japan, it predicts 2.2 percent
growth in 1996 and 2.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Its projection of the jobless rate for the OECD overall remains
unchanged at 7.7 percent this year and 7.6 percent in 1997, while
OECD Europe's unemployment rate is forecast at 10.5 percent this
year and 10.4 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Roars Over 5,700 Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- New York stock prices roared ahead
Monday as investors, buoyed by the prospect of cheaper oil, pushed
the Dow Jones industrial average to a record close for the first
time in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
Monday's word that Iraq had accepted a United Nations offer to
resume limited oil sales sent oil company shares higher. That
helped drive the Dow average up 61.32 points to close at 5,748.82,
finishing above the 5,700 mark for the first time. The market's
previous high was 5,689.74, set on April 3.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraq agreement drove up the oil stock of Dow
components and also helped limit fears about roaring inflation,
since oil prices are expected to eventually decline with the
return of Iraqi production in a month or so.

<HEADLINE> East-West Power Balance Key to NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Minister Eric Derycke
said here today that a balance of power between the East and the
West is crucial to the NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister told reporters that the NATO is trying
very hard to reach a new balance of power with Russia and will not
deploy nuclear weapons in areas close to its borders.
</P>
<P>
In return, he said, Russia should understand that the NATO's
enlargement is not directed against it and thus drop its
opposition to the expansion after its presidential elections in
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Derycke said the expansion will also put Ukraine, which is in
the buffer zone between the East and the West, in a complicated
situation. Therefore, the NATO and Ukraine should carefully deal
with all the questions related to the expansion, he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Belgium's hope that the NATO will promote peace
and stability in Europe by admitting well-qualified countries as
its new members.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $195 Million Credit for Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) --The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a three-year credit under the extended fund
facility (EFF) for the Republic of Moldova, equivalent to about
195 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided in support of the Government's
economic program for the period of 1996-1998.
</P>
<P>
Moldova's medium-term policy is aimed to maintain financial
stability and establish the institutions and mechanisms of a
market economy by the end of the program period, in a bid to lay
the foundation for sustainable growth and a viable balance of
payments. The major macroeconomic objectives for 1996-98 are to
achieve an average real GDP growth of 4-5 percent over the three
years, lowering inflation to 6 percent by 1998 and reduce the
external current account deficit to 2 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the program for 1996 are to achieve real GDP
growth of about 4 percent, reduce inflation to 15 percent and
contain the external current account deficit to 7 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Moldova joined the IMF in August 1992. Its quota in the IMF is
about 130 million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of
IMF credit currently totals about 223 million dollars.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A millennium ago it was known as
east China's most important port. Now the old Citong Port in
Quanzhou City in Fujian Province is aiming to start
the next millennium by winning back its once famous glory.
</P>
<P>
Quanzhou is planning to invest two billion yuan in the coming
five years to build ports, today's overseas edition of
the "People's Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The spending spree aims to help Citong Port regain its status
of "East China's Number One Port", widely known during the Song
Dynasty (960-1279), officials said.
</P>
<P>
Currently it is only a medium-sized port in China, with an
annual handling capacity of around 12 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to officials, Quanzhou has planned 11 projects,
including a 50,000-tonnage coal terminal, a 10,000-tonnage
multi-function wharf and a 50,000-tonnage container wharf, for the
five-year period, with eight of them surpassing 100 million yuan
each in investment.
</P>
<P>
The port will eventually be able to handle 18.5 million tons of
cargo and 180,000 TEUs of containers by the year 2000. The
capacities are expected to reach 34.4 million tons of goods and
900,000 TEUs of containers by 2020.

DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Some contingents of troops loyal to
the forced retired chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim are marching
towards the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, reliable sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the authorities have asked the troops who
had moved out from their cantonments in Bogra and Mymensingh in
the north late last night to return to their respective barracks.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that ferry services between Nagarbari and Aricha
have been suspended following the convergence of troops loyal to
Nasim from the northern districts and troops loyal to the
president from Dhaka. The two areas are about 300 kilometers to
the west of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension of ferry service, the road
communication has been disrupted and several night coaches were
stranded at the two ghats, the sources said, adding that no
untoward incident has been reported yet.
</P>
<P>
The chief of army staff was given the forced retirement Monday
by the Defense Ministry under President Abdur Rahman Biswas for
"disobeying the government order and acting in a blatantly
insolent manner which is tantamount to rebellion against the
government".
</P>
<P>
The president also denounced Nasim for issuing directives to
the members of the armed forces loyal to him to march towards
Dhaka.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Hopes Spy Scandal Will Not Harm Ties With London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Moscow hopes the recent tit-for-tat
expulsion of diplomats by Russia and Britain for espionage will
not affect bilateral relations and cooperation between their
secret services, a high-ranking Russian secret service officer
said today.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Yuri Kobaladze, chief of the press office of
Russia's foreign intelligence service, confirmed that Britain
expelled four Russian diplomats from London Friday following
Moscow's decision to deport four British diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Kobaladze described London's move as a return to the Cold War
practice of "tit-for-tat" expulsions of diplomats for alleged
spying.
</P>
<P>
But he said he hoped the incident "will not affect current
progress on problems that are the subject of interaction between
the Russian and foreign secret services -- the effort to check the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to combat the
smuggling of fissionable materials, weapons and narcotics, and
international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The expulsions had been expected since May 6, when Russia's
Federal Security Service (FSB) first announced the arrest of a
Russian national suspected of passing state secrets to the British
Embassy. The following day, the FSB said that it intended to expel
nine British diplomats whom it believed had obtained military and
political secrets through the alleged agent.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind immediately countered
that any expulsions by Russia would be met with an "appropriate
response" by Britain.
</P>
<P>
For days after that, however, there was no indication on either
side of when the expulsions were to take place or if they were to
take place at all. The delay led to speculation that the affair
would be forgotten or resolved through negotiations, until the
expulsions went ahead late last week.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of diplomats expelled was reduced from nine
to four, the affair still amounts to the worst East-West espionage
incident since 1989, when Russia and Britain expelled a total of
11 diplomats and journalists for spying.
</P>
<P>
London said that the four expelled Russians were believed to be
working for Russia's intelligence services, and that they were
involved in gathering scientific and technological as well as
political and economic intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here have said the FSB's move against Britain was
calculated to boost President Boris Yeltsin's tough image and
chances of re-election. Russia's presidential polls are scheduled
for June 16.

<P>
MANAGUA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Central American political parties
opened a meeting here today to discuss the proposal for the
establishment of single nationality in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Vice President Julia Mena, Central American
Parliament (Parlacen) Vice President Rodolfo Dougherty Liekens and
former Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio attended the
meeting which will end Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Parlacen vice president said that Central America faces a
challenge of paving the way to the Central American nationality
proposed by the Parlacen three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It is, without a doubt, a very important step in intensifying
the Central American integration," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He said that by focusing strictly on the citizenship, the
proposal adds new characteristics to the integration process.
</P>
<P>
"We must take this proposal seriously and if we are convinced
of its necessity, we will fight so that it will be accepted,
signed and ratified," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Vice President Mena said that the rebuilding of
Central America as one unit and one nationality occupies an
outstanding place in the contemporary history of the region.
</P>
<P>
She said that this proposal is not a servile copy of the
European one. Quite the contrary, she added, "it constitutes a
re-elaboration that combines elements of our own history with that
of other countries to empower those reconstructions on new bases."

The Beijing Municipal government will formulate Provisional
Regulations governing the Spreading of Scientific Knowledge and
other laws and regulations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Asks for 36 million dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- After winning his fourth
National Basketball Association (NBA) 'Most Valuable Player'
award, Michael Jordan raised his salary demands for a new contract
-- at least 36 million dollars for two years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also captured MVP honors in 1988, 1991 and 1992 but
called this year's award the best because it comes following the
end of his 18-month retirement in March of 1995. It signifies
Jordan is back atop the NBA.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's more meaningful, with me being out of the league
for a couple of years," Jordan said. "I came back and learned a
lesson. I learned that no matter how long you're away from the
game, you can't come back thinking you can turn it right back on
and pick up where you left off."
</P>
<P>
Jordan struggled last season after returning with little
preparation. He worked out with determination during the
off-season and sparked Chicago to the best record in NBA history,
72-10.
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago I would never have dreamed of being in this
position again," Jordan said. "This has been a dream-like year."
</P>
<P>
Jordan told a Chicago newspaper he wants a minimum of 18
million dollars a year for a two-year deal. He becomes a free
agent after the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay here, and I feel like its 70-30 that I will,
maybe 80-20," Jordan said. "But I'm prepared to go, and so is my
family, if it doesn't happen."
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 33, said he plans to wait until August before making a
decision.
</P>
<P>
"To this point, I haven't discussed any contract negotiations
about where I'm going to be," Jordan said. "That's all
meaningless right now. I may, however, after the season. I don't
want to be a part of a rebuilding, if that's what they want to
do. Those things will be evaluated when the season is over."

JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's electronic exports in
1995 reached 2.9 billion US dollars, an increase of 13.5 percent
compared with the figure in 1994, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Trade Minister Tungky Aribowo said on Monday in
Bogor, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta, that the increase was due

</P>
<P>
In order to attain the projection, the government would help
increase the competitive edge of the national electronic industry
through various incentives and concessions, he added.

BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is tightening up checks on
foreign visitors from Malaysia to prevent the spread of cholera.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials in southern provinces bordering Malaysia have
been asked to closely monitor visitors coming from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Cholera was first reported last Friday in Penang and has spread
to four other northern Malaysian states by Monday. Over 400 people
had already been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
A Thai health official said that the government is taking no
chances and passengers suffering from diarrhea or similar symptoms

<HEADLINE> Urban Students Experience Country Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Becoming more and more aware of the problem, many schools have
introduced new teaching programs to let students experience more
hardship and suffer more setbacks. Special favor has been given to
the countryside, which stands for the other extreme to the
comfortable and luxurious urban life.
</P>
<P>
They did not have much difficulty in getting the support of the
students' parents, especially those who used to be the
"intellectual youth".
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said that in big cities such as Beijing,
former "intellectual youth" even voluntarily sponsored summer
camps to take their children back to the villages where they had
lived.
</P>
<P>
The city of Dalian last year announced an ambitious plan to
have all its middle school students sent to villages, army
barracks, or factories for a short period for more social
experiences.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the city is to send some 30,000 more
middle school students to the countryside in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
This meant that the city's "small suns", a nickname for
China's spoiled urban children, would have to spend at least a
week in the peasants' houses and help them to do farm work, such
as ploughing and fertilizing land, reaping crops, and watering
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
So far the project has covered some 10,000 students, including
Chen Dan and her schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we just want to give them a taste of the rural life
instead of turning them into real peasants," a local teacher
noted, acknowledging that the hardships for the students are no
match to those for the "intellectual youth".
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that most students regard their short stay
in the countryside as a pleasant excursion or some spice added
to the dull school life, rather than a serious matter.
</P>
<P>
But the project has worked in some ways, he said, as many
parents told the schools that their children had become more

next season.
</P>

Collins, who has played for Celtic for six years, is expected

<HEADLINE> Libraries, Collections on Increase in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A survey showed that more spacious
and convenient environments in public libraries have been provided
to library-goers in Beijing in recent years, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yang Suying, an official from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of
Culture, said that with the help of the municipal and district
governments, some 20 public libraries had been scattered over 18
districts and suburbs by the end of last year, twice as many as in
1980.
</P>
<P>
Once poorly managed, with outdated equipment and very small
collections, she said, most of the public libraries have gradually
introduced the use of computers and have improved their
collections both in number and in quality as local governments
have injected an increasing amount of money since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that public libraries cannot store many books
because of limited funds and space. However, they can collect more
books related to a specific field so as to meet the demands of
different readers.
</P>
<P>
"market surveys have encouraged us to concentrate on collecting
fashion materials," said Bao Jingguo from the Dongcheng district
library. He added that more then one-fourth of the working
population in the district are working in the clothing field.
</P>
<P>
Following Dongcheng's example, public libraries in seven other
districts have focused their attention on developing specialized
collections of books in accordance with local conditions such as
in packing design, tourism and interior decoration, said Yang.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A survey found that 85 percent of
children in central China's Henan Province have been inoculated
against measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus and diphtheria.
</P>
<P>
The survey sampled 870 children living in 30 townships and
found that only one child did not have some of the inoculations
as required.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that no poliomyelitis cases have been
reported in the past three years, thanks to a province-wide
inoculation drive among babies and children.
</P>
<P>
The drive has helped cut the incidence of such diseases for
children by 90 percent, according to a report released by
the Provincial Sanitation and Anti-Epidemic Station.
</P>
<P>
Now children run little risk of deformity and early death
from poliomyelitis and other infectious diseases because of
this, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin Leads in Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- With less than a month before the
June 16 presidential polls, President Boris Yeltsin has overtaken
his main rival, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, in the
race and consolidated the lead among all the 11 candidates, some
opinion polls here showed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin overtook Zyuganov in April when his popularity
increased from 21 to 27 percent, while that of Zyuganov remained
at the 25 percent level, the weekly polls of the Public Opinion
Fund said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, 28 percent of those polled said they would vote for
the incumbent president while 24 percent backed Zyuganov, the fund
noted.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls gave Yeltsin even a bigger chance for victory in
a possible second round of election, in which he and Zyuganov are
most likely to compete.
</P>
<P>
In one month the number of respondents who said they would vote
for Yeltsin in the second round went up from 38 to 45 percent,
while that of Zyuganov supporters shrank from 41 to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
In May the number of people, who were convinced that Yeltsin
would win the elections, rose to 46 percent from 35 percent in
April, while conviction in Zyuganov's victory dropped from 32 to
23 percent.
</P>
<P>
The polls were conducted among 1,500 urban and rural residents
across the country and has a margin of error of 3 percent, the
fund said.
</P>
<P>
Several newspapers and public opinion polls centers have issued
similar opinions in days, although some experts here say it is
hard to predict the final results of the upcoming elections
because of the changeable campaign situation.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's election law, if no candidate gains more than 50
percent of the vote in the June 16 ballot, the top two contenders
will meet in a runoff on July 7. Yeltsin and Zyuganov are the two
most hopeful to enter the second round.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's election campaign is promoted partly by his desperate
efforts to unite the badly-divided so-called democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
This can be seen from Yeltsin's statements last weekend during
his canvass trip in Siberia, about his readiness to continue
consultations with the so-called "Third Force" -- presidential
candidates Grigory Yavlinsky, Alexander Lebed and Svyatoslav
Fyodorov.
</P>
<P>
Revealing the contents of one-to-one talks with the leaders of
the "Third Force," Yeltsin managed to score points with voters,
showing them his ability for a political maneuver for the sake of
the reforms now under way in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some polls put Yavlinsky at a distant third place, with 9
percent of supporters, followed by Lebed, with 5 percent, and
Fyodorov, 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
During his two meetings with Yeltsin, Yavlinsky appeared to
have spelled out his terms for a deal with the president --
dismissal of the cabinet headed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, radical
changes in the economic policy and an immediate end to the Chechen
war.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky, however, has tried to deny having engaged in
"political bargaining" for the post of prime minister as the press
here asserted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said last weekend that he did not "completely agree"
with Yavlinsky's terms, but "another meeting is still possible."
Nevertheless, he believed that he and Yavlinsky might still come
to a deal.
</P>
<P>
The president has publicly announced that he is looking for an
alliance with Yavlinsky ahead of the June elections as a tactic to
help him edge out his leading rival, Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
By avoiding alienating any of the three "Third Force" rivals in
the election struggle, Yeltsin is very likely to gain their
support in a possible run-off, experts here said.

PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- France hailed the "oil-for-food" deal
signed by the United Nations Secretariat and Iraq Monday, which
will allow Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over
six months.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette said in a speech today that
the memorandum signed by Iraq and the U.N. Secretariat, which set
out detailed procedures for the implementation of Security Council
Resolution 986, was a very positive step as it will help alleviate

</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 986 in 1995, which
stipulates that Iraq can export 2 billion dollars worth of oil
over six months to buy food and other daily necessities but
the export should be put under strict U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refused to accept the resolution at first, saying
U.N. supervision violates its national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the U.N. Secretariat and Iraq on implementing the
resolution began in February.

WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan, who led the
Chicago Bulls to the best regular-season record in National
Basketball Association history, won the league's Most Valuable
Player award for the fourth time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the NBA's top scorer (30.4 average) for a record eighth
season, received 96.5 percent of the first-place votes - the
highest percentage since the media began selecting the winner in
1980-81.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio's David Robinson finished second, and Orlando's
Penny Hardaway was third.
</P>
<P>
Jordan joins Wilt Chamberlain as a four-time MVP. Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar won the most MVPs with six, while Bill Russell won
five.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his scoring, Jordan averaged 6.6 rebounds, 4.3
assists and 2.2 steals in leading Chicago to a 72-10
regular-season record. The Bulls then beat Miami and New York in
the playoffs to reach the Eastern Conference finals, where they
routed Orlando by 38 points in Sunday's series opener.
</P>
<P>
Jordan received 109 of 113 first-place votes. Hardaway got two
first-place votes, while Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon and Utah's Karl
Malone each received one.
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon finished fourth overall. Rounding out the Top 10 were
Chicago's Scottie Pippen, Seattle's Gary Payton, Malone, Seattle's
Shawn Kemp, Detroit's Grant Hill and Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
Each voter picks five MVP candidates in order of preference.
Points are awarded on a 10-7-5-3-1 basis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also was the MVP in 1987-88, 1990-91, and 1991-92. He
announced his retirement from basketball on Oct. 6, 1993 and then
pursued a baseball career before returning to the Bulls on March
19, 1995.

<HEADLINE> De Boer to Miss European Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Ajax's defender Frank De Boer will
miss the showdown and striker Patrick Kluivert will stay on the
bench in the European Cup final against Juventus, the Dutch team's
coach Louis Van Gaal said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Van Gaal, speaking on arrival at Rome's Ciampino airport for
Wednesday's final, said: "Frank De Boer won't play, and Kluivert
is only at 50 percent of his form. He will be on the substitutes'
bench, but might come on in the second half."
</P>
<P>
Kluivert came on as a substitute in last year's final in
Vienna, scoring the goal which gave Ajax a 1-0 victory over AC
Milan.
</P>
<P>
"Physically, I feel fine but I'm not going to argue with the
coach, because he is someone I have a lot of respect for," said
the 19-year-old prodigy. "I hope to play my part during the
match, and my dream would be to repeat what I did against Milan."
</P>
<P>
Van Gaal paid tribute to his Italian opponents but
insisted: "We are ready for this final. Juventus are a very good
team, technically at a very high level, and they have one of
Europe's leading coaches in Marcello Lippi.
</P>
<P>
"Up front, they have skilful players like Gianluca Vialli,
Fabrizio Ravanelli and Alessandro Del Piero, who could decide the
match at any moment. Tactically, however, we think we have
something extra," said the coach.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reaffirms Extension of MFN for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Monday that he had decided to extend unconditionally
Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trading status for China for another year.
</P>
<P>
Describing the renewal of MFN as "a vote for America's
interests," and "not a referendum on all China's policies," he
said that he would work with the Republican-controlled Congress in
the weeks ahead to secure its approval.
</P>
<P>
"Revoking MFN and, in effect, severing our economic ties to
China, would drive us back into a period of mutual isolation and
recrimination that would harm America's interests, not advance
them," he told the Pacific Basin Economic Council which began its
29th International General Meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his decision on China's MFN, he noted that China is
the fastest growing market for American exports and American
interests "are directly at stake in promoting a secure, stable,
open and prosperous China."
</P>
<P>
"Our engagement policy means using the best tools we have,
incentives and disincentives alike, to advance core American
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the differences between the two countries, Clinton
stated that "when we disagree with China, we will continue to
defend our interests and to assert our values. But by engaging
China, we have achieved important benefits for our people and the
rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement followed on the heels of an earlier one
last week in which the Clinton administration threatened China
with the largest trade sanctions package in U.S. history. Some
calls this an attempt by Clinton to steer "a balanced course" in
his China policy. Others contend that Clinton's action was a
response to Senator Bob Dole, his leading presidential challenger
this year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech earlier this month, Dole, while declaring his
support for MFN renewal, attacked the administration for sending
conflicting messages and criticized Clinton's "conspicuous
absence" from the debate on this issue.
</P>
<P>
After Clinton formally notifies Congress, lawmakers in both
houses have 60 days to vote on MFN extension. If they choose to
reject it, the president can veto their rejection. A tough fight
is expected on the Capitol Hill, but opponents are unlikely to muster
enough votes to revoke MFN.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Research-Oriented Companies Prospering in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More spending on research and
development has enabled non-state-owned research-oriented
companies in Shanghai to score an annual increase of 30 percent in
sales since 1993, according to "Wenhui Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Shanghai, the largest manufacturing and
business center in China, now has 6,700 such companies, which had
a total sales of 17.69 billion yuan last year. The figure
represented a nearly 40 percent increase from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The private Jiashide-Huahai Company reported sales of more than
two billion yuan, and exported 150 million US dollars-worth of
goods in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Non-state-owned research-oriented companies spent a total of
1.67 billion yuan on research and development last year, double
the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
The paper said, "As a result, per-capita productivity of
non-state-run research-oriented companies has been growing
rapidly."
</P>
<P>
For instance, in 1995, for the first time per-capita
productivity topped 100,000 yuan-worth to 134,600 yuan-worth, up
nearly 38 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now 21 such companies each have fixed assets worth at least 100
million yuan, and 36 others each have assets worth 50 million
yuan.

BRASILIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Venezuela signed two
cooperation accords here today to increase cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements, "Declaration of Brasilia" and the "Act of
Planalto," focus on intensifying cooperation and integration
between the two countries, the advances made in the bilateral
relations in the past few years and the importance of cooperation
in multilateral forums.
</P>
<P>
They were signed by Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso and his Venezuelan counterpart, Rafael Caldera,
</P>
<P>
The two governments are trying to carry out joint projects
that include a cable for transmitting electrical power between
Guri, Venezuela, and Manaus, Brazil, and the association of oil
companies in both countries.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their intention to promote the development of
their common border regions, to respect indigenous communities and
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Brazilian imports from Venezuela
rose from 370 million U.S. dollars in 1993 to 823 million dollars
in 1995 while exports jumped from 330 million dollars to 480
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Peru Refuses Carter's Request for Retrial of US Citizen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Peru turned down today former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter's appeal for a new trial for a
U.S. citizen sentenced to life in prison for her involvement in a
Peruvian guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian lawyer and politician Javier Valle Riestra said that
Carter's initiative implies "interference in the internal affairs"
of Peru.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. citizen, Lory Berenson, was sentenced to life
imprisonment in 1995 after she was convicted in a Peruvian
military court of involvement in a plan by the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to mount an assault on the Peruvian
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Valle Riestra said that Berenson had admitted her role as a
militant in the MRTA and was tried according to Peruvian laws.
</P>
<P>
A new trial would be granted if there was new evidence, which
had not occurred in this case, he added.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Carlos Ferrero said that Carter's request indicated
total ignorance of the reality of subversion in Latin America and
Peruvian legislation to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Independent lawyer Alfonso Orrego also said that Carter's
intervention on Berenson's behalf would be an act of interference
in Peru's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
All members of the United Nations, including Peru and the
United States, have committed themselves to respect the internal
jurisdiction of other member states and are obliged to stand by
this commitment, he added.

<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Marc Rosset upset Boris Becker in
straight sets to pace Switzerland over Germany in the opening
round of the World Team Cup tennis in Mduesseldorf, Germany,
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In another match, Spain beat Sweden 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Marc Rosset beat Boris Becker 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 and Jakob Hlasek
sealed the victory by defeating David Prinosil 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 as
Switzerland took a measure of revenge for its Davis Cup defeat
against Germany earlier this year by winning 3-0.
</P>
<P>
``It was a match I really wanted to win. I am really angry at
myself,'' said Becker, who had trouble dealing with Rosset's big
serve and accurate passing shots.
</P>
<P>
Becker has never won a tournament on clay and is using the
World Team Cup to prepare for the French Open, the only Grand Slam
event he has never won. The French Open begins next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jakob Hlasek gave Switzerland an unassailable lead when he beat
Prinosil, the hero of Germany's Davis Cup victory when the team
was without Becker. Hlasek then teamed with Rosset for a 3-6, 6-1,
6-3 win in the doubles over Becker and Prinosil for a Swiss sweep.
</P>
<P>
Sergi Bruguera, a two-time French Open champion, overcame a
dismal start to beat Thomas Enqvist and send Spain on its way to
victory over Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera rallied for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 win and Alberto Costa made
sure of Spain's victory by beating Magnus Larsson 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles, Jonas Bjoerkman and Peter Nyborg beat Francisco
Rois and Tomas Carbonell 6-3, 6-3 to earn a consolation point for
Sweden in a 2-1 defeat.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Individual purchases of cars have
maintained a year-on-year growth rate of 51 percent in China since
1992, making this nation of 1.2 billion people the auto market
with the biggest potential in the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of private cars in China had reached 2.5 million by
the end of last year, accounting for 23.8 percent of the whole of
the country, according to the "Business News".
</P>
<P>
The paper said that every year about 80 percent of medium-sized
automobiles and 50 percent to 80 percent of small cars
manufactured in China are bought for personal use. Most private
automobiles are used for goods and passenger transport services.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said that the country's auto market will
largely depend on the swelling demand for private automobiles.
</P>
<P>
They said that the domestic industry should produce more
"economy cars" with lower petroleum consumption and more
functions, aimed at fully meeting the demand from all walks of
life.

<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis is prepared to take on
Riddick Bowe despite accepting 6 million dollars compensation for
not fighting Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
The fight between Lewis and his former Olympic rival Bowe could
take place in September.
</P>
<P>
"I favour Bowe. It's time we got it on. The fight has been
stagnating for far too long," said Lewis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"World titles are important, but so are the big fights, and
this would be one of them. If I can't beat Bowe I shouldn't
really be going after Tyson. The question is does Bowe want it?
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is sure in this business. You can map out a route, but
whether it comes off is another matter."
</P>
<P>
Only Bruce Seldon's WBA title will be at stake when he meets
fellow American Tyson on July 13th.
</P>
<P>
Tyson theoretically has until September 1 to defend his WBC
title against Lewis, or face being stripped of that championship.
</P>
<P>
"It's all very complicated, but what is clear to us is that
Tyson does not want to fight Lennox. He is hedging. So, Lennox
holds Tyson's belt in his hands," said the Briton's financial
backer, Pannos Eliades.

<HEADLINE> Forced Retirement of Bangladeshi Army Chief Described as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The forced retirement of Bangladesh's
 chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim and other two senior officers
was described as a "fallen" ruling party's conspiracy to foil the
efforts of holding free and fair general elections on June 12.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry under the country's President Abdur Rahman
Biswas Monday announced the "retirement" of Nasim for "disobeying
the government order and acting in a blatantly insolent manner
which is tantamount to rebellion against the government." Earlier,
two other senior army officers were also ordered to retire.
</P>
<P>
In its reaction to the move after an emergency meeting last
night, the Awami League, the former largest opposition party, said
that the "fallen" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is now trying
to foil the June 12 election under a blueprint with its
"conspiracy" being hatched "through its party president Biswas" so
that the "results of the mass movement" -- the non-party caretaker
government -- are made cripple and inactive.
</P>
<P>
The sudden forced retirement of the senior army officers by the
president "on various pretexts" 22 days ahead of the election is
the continuation of BNP's on-going conspiracy, the Awami League
said.
</P>
<P>
The former opposition party called upon the people to unitedly
face the current situation with courage and resist the BNP
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Dhaka has remained tense following the forced
retirement of the army officers as army troops and tanks have been
deployed in various places of the capital city. Reliable sources
said that troops loyal to Nasim are marching towards Dhaka to face
resistance of the troops loyal to President Biswas.

<HEADLINE> Britain Disappointed Over EU Decision to Keep Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government has expressed
great disappointment over the European Union (EU) Veterinary
Commtittee's decision to maintain the global ban on British beef
product exports.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary experts from the 15 EU member states rejected
earlier today the EU Commission's proposal to lift the ban on
exports of British gelatine, tallow and other beef by-products.
</P>
<P>
Seven EU countries -- Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal,
Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg -- constituted a blocking
minority at the meeting held in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
A British Agriculture Ministry spokesman was quoted by the BBC
television saying that it is disappointed at the EU decision to
keep the ban on British beef exports, but the British government
"will continue to fight the unjust ban."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Downing Street sources strongly indicated that the
move to take legal action against the eight-week-old ban "was well
advanced."
</P>
<P>
Although the issue of taking action against the European
Commission was complicated, the attorney general's office was not
far away from making progress, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef exports on
March 27 after the British government admitted that there was a
possible link between the BSE or mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> UN, Iraq Sign "Oil-for-Food" Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretariat and the Iraqi delegation signed today an
"oil-for-food" deal that will allow Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil over six months.
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, U.N. Chief Spokesman Sylvana Foa
said a memorandum was signed by U.N. legal counsel Hans Correl and
Iraqi negotiator Abdul Amir al-Anbari in the office of U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, which set out detailed procedures for the
implementation of Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq can begin
selling oil on the world market for the first time since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The signature of the Memorandum of Understanding between the
U.N. Secretariat and the Iraqi delegation this morning is a
success for the Security Council," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the Security Council which first recognized the
suffering of ordinary Iraqi people under the U.N.-imposed
sanctions and then adopted a resolution to the effect of
alleviating the suffering of "the poorest of the poor."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council passed Resolution 986 in 1995, which
stipulated that Iraq can export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months to exchange food and other daily necessities,
but the export should be under strict U.N. restriction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq refused at first to cite violations of its national
sovereignty and territorial integrity. Talks between the U.N.
Secretariat and Iraq on implementing the council decision began
only in February.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana said the United Nation will spare no efforts in helping
Iraq to export oil because 4 million people in the country are "at
nutrition risk".
</P>
<P>
But she added that since a lot of preparations have to be done,
two or three months are needed before the export. First, the U.N.
Secretariat has to select a bank to hold the escrow accounts and
appoint independent oil inspection agents to assist monitoring the
export.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, the Security Council expressed
warm welcome to this development.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council wish to thank the
secretary-general and all participating officials and staff for
their efforts in the concluding of the Memorandum of
Understanding," said the statement read by Council President Qin
Huasun, who is also the permanent representative of China to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Members hope that the conclusion of the memorandum will help
alleviate the humanitarian sufferings of the Iraqi people," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Worst Drought Since 1930s Hits US Great Plains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A worst drought since the 1930s
hit the Great Plains region of the United States, pushing
thousands of farmers to the edge of financial ruin and spurred
panic selling of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma is experiencing the second driest period, after the
1935 drought, since the Oklahoma Climatological Survey started
keeping records 101 years ago. An average of 2.32 inches of rain
has fallen on the wheat fields and cattle ranches since last
October, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma Agriculture Commissioner, Dennis Howard, was
quoted as saying that 5,000 to 10,000 of the state's 70,000
farming families would go bankrupt this year because of the
drought and record low cattle prices.
</P>
<P>
In parts of Oklahoma, many farms that normally yield 55 bushels
an acre are instead yielding one or two bushels that will not be
economical for the farmers to harvest. The Oklahoma Wheat
Commission's most optimistic prediction of the state's yield this
year is 70 million to 80 million bushels, less than half the
normal total.
</P>
<P>
In Texas, some regions are also suffering from lower rainfall.
In San Antonio and some other areas, there was only 3.7 inches of
rain from October through April, compared to a normal rate of 15.8
inches.
</P>
<P>
The state's 130 counties, where at least 40 percent of all
pasture land is too arid for grazing, have applied for emergency
Federal subsidies for ranchers to buy feed, according to the
Federal Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The state's 6 million dollar cattle industry is the largest of
any state in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The starkest image of the Dust Bowl -- huge clouds of fine
soil blowing across the land, turning day into dusk and rendering
crops suddenly worthless -- is unlikely to come to pass," The New
York Times said.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Insists Karadzic Not Interfere in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- International High Representative
for Bosnia Carl Bildt has agreed to cooperate with Bosnian Serb
officials on condition that Serb President Radovan Karadzic no
longer interferes in the enforcement of peace.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's spokesman Colum Murphy said in Sarajevo today that firm
promises had been received from the Serb leadership that Karadzic
would no longer interfere in the peace process and would step down
from the political stage.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, twice indicted by the international war crimes
tribunal as a war criminal, has openly confronted the
international community by sacking his Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic, a moderate Serb leader who has close cooperation with
Carl Bildt and NATO-led peace Implementation Force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb hardliners' move has prompted more pressure from the
world community to force Karadzic out of office as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Bildt had formally requested the Serb leadership to
state in writing whether Karadzic was stepping down or not but he
had received no reply so far. But he added the Serb leadership did
agree to let Karadzic stay out of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
International mediators would cooperate with new Serb Prime
Minister Gojko Klickovic, elected by the Serb parliament last
Saturday, and see how far he was ready to go in the implementation
of the Dayton peace agreement, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
After the power struggle was ended by appointing a new premier,
Karadzic has placed Vice-President Biljana Plavsic in charge of
cooperation with international mediators in the implementation of
the Dayton peace accords. He also presented much of his duties to
his deputy Plavsic, also a hardliner.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, who is in Athens for a session of the NATO assembly, has
told the press that there could be no compromise concerning
Karadzic's indictment by the Hague-based war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said it was up to the Bosnian Serbs to decide whether
they wanted to implement the Dayton agreement, under which all war
crime suspects must be handed over to the U.N.-founded tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Karadzic as the greatest obstacle to the peace
process in Bosnia, Bildt has conditioned the ouster of Karadzic
with international economic aid to the Serb state of Republika
Srpska.

<HEADLINE> Uneasy Calm Reurns to Liberian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Uneasy calm returned to the Liberian
capital of Monrovia today with only sporadic gunfire breakig the
silence while civilians were still waiting for the ceaefire to be
implemented in the wartorn country.
</P>
<P>
Radio Nigeria said today that the west African peacekeeping
forces, mainly contributed by Nigerian soldiers, still had to be
deployed in downtown areas of Monrovia while other key points
of the capital were controlled by malitia gunmen of the warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
The radio also said the African peacepeepers, known as the
Ecomog, were today in control of the city's two bridges and of the
area around Monrovia's free port, but there was little sign of
the Ecomog soldiers in the down areas.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire measures, announced last week by Liberia's Interim
Council of State, were based loosely on recommendations by regional
foreign ministers in the Ghanian capital Accra earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The interim government of Liberia, which had been established
according to the peace accord signed in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
last August, has mainly been controlled by Taylor and Kromah who
in turn called their soldiers the ''government troops.''
</P>
<P>
The interim cabinet was run by three warlords which also
include another faction leader George Boley and three civilian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
On April 6 this year, the latest round of armed clash broke
out when the ''government troops'' were trying to arrest Johnson
on murder charges. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Leader Calls for Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief Adviser to the Bangladeshi
caretaker government M. Habibur Rahman today called on the people
to remain calm and be patient following the forced retirement of
Chief of Army Staff A.S.M. Nasim.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry under President Abdur Rahman Biswas
announced earlier today that Nasim has retired from services with
immediate effect "for disobeying the government order and acting
in a blatantly insolent manner which is tantamount to rebellion
against the government."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over radio and television tonight, the
chief adviser said: "This is a test for the nation and we have to
pass this test."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that troops and tanks have been deployed at
various places of the capital Dhaka to maintain law and order
while many people have expressed concern that a situation might
have been created where law and order may be disrupted in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He made a fervent call to the members of the army to maintain
their glorious heritage, saying that the members of the army will
live like brothers and stand beside each other and cooperate.
</P>
<P>
They will not be involved in face-to-face clashes so that the
soil of the unfortunate Bangladesh would be tarnished by the blood
of brothers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The chief adviser reaffirmed his continued tireless efforts to
maintain a peaceful atmosphere and extend cooperation to the
Election Commission for free and fair elections on June 12 under a
peaceful environment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Power Struggle for Army Control Creates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka citizens were surprised last
night to see troops deployed and tanks rumbling on the capital
city's streets, as political parties have been in full swing to
campaign for the June 12 general elections.
</P>
<P>
What has happened? The troop movement followed the forced
retirements of three top army officials, including the chief of
the army staff. Observers here believe that there may have been a
power struggle for control of the army.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, two senior army officers, Bogra Area Command Maj.
Gen. G. H. Morshed Khan and deputy Director General of the
Bangladesh Rifles Brigadier Miran Hamidur Rahman, were ordered to
retire by the
Defense Ministry under Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
In an address over radio and television last night, Biswas
explained that the two army officers were given forced retirement
under the army act and relevant rules, because clear evidence of
violation of the army rule, moral deviation, communications with
different political parties and activities to create feud and
faction among the members of the army were found against them.
</P>
<P>
But the chief of the Army Staff, Lt. Gen. A.S.M. Nasim showed
arrogance instead of obeying the order, which is tantamount to
rebellion against the government, Biswas said, adding that Nasim
later mobilized a section of the members of the armed forces loyal
to him against the order in different parts of the country and
ordered them to march towards Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Nasim himself was forced to retire yesterday.
</P>
<P>
There has been no reaction yet from Nasim, but reliable sources
said troops loyal to him mainly in Bogra and Mymensingh districts
in the north have been marching towards Dhaka. Some of the troops
have already reached places near the capital and stood facing each
other with the troops loyal to the president.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Dhaka has been tense since the announcement of
the forced retirement. There were about 20 tanks and a large
number of troops and policemen around the Presidential Palace,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The former largest opposition party -- The Awami (people's)
League (AL) charged that Biswas' move against the army officers
was part of the on-going "conspiracy" of the former ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to foil the efforts for free
and fair elections, as the president himself is a BNP member.
</P>
<P>
But observers here believe that there may have been a power
struggle between the president and the military for control of the
army since the formation of the caretaker government in early
April.
</P>
<P>
The president has been an honorable post without real power
although he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces under
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the job of the chief of army staff is powerful as he is
in charge of military affairs.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of the caretaker government led by
Chief Adviser M. Habibur Rahman, the president took over the
duties of the Defense Ministry and the armed forces division of
the cabinet and is running military affairs sometimes even without
prior consultations with the military.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility of the Defense Ministry and the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces has been entrusted with the
president to remove any misgivings among the people, Biswas
argued.
</P>
<P>
Whoever is justified, people are worried that law and order may
be disrupted again and the hard-earned congenial atmosphere for
the coming national polls could be impaired, the observers said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a test for the nation and we have to pass this test,"
the chief adviser to the caretaker government said, urging the
people and the army to remain calm and patient in the interest of
a free and fair election in a peaceful environment.
