<HEADLINE> Japan Leader: Economy Set To Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's prime minister reiterated a vow Tuesday to  
put the economy back on track in the coming fiscal year, suggesting 
that it may already have bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been negative growth, but next fiscal year will be  
positive,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Dow Jones 
Newswires as saying in an interview to be broadcast later Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the government set an economic growth target of 0.5  
percent for the fiscal year starting April 1 based on previously 
announced stimulus measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The official growth forecast for the current fiscal year, which  
ends this month, has been revised down to minus 2.2 percent. The 
economy shrank 0.4 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recently, there have been signs that the downward trend is  
slowing down. I can almost say there are signs that the economy has 
hit bottom,'' Obuchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged in January to make 1999 a year of economic  
renaissance. Last summer, at the outset of his administration, he 
promised to engineer a recovery within two years.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Exchange's Main Index Tumbles / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index tumbled today  
on profit taking, losing more than half of Friday's gains. The 
dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 359.68 points,  
or 2.20 percent, closing at 16,019.10 points. On Friday, the 
average soared 660.86 points, or 4.20 percent, to an eight month 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 118.53 yen, up 1.01 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
118.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices started slightly higher on buying by foreign  
brokerages but quickly fell on profit taking in reaction to 
Friday's sharp gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's correction was natural given the recent gains and the  
New York market's loss over the past two sessions,'' said Kunihiro 
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 827  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 867 million shares. 
Declining issues outnumbered advances 727 to 502, with 97 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 6.05 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,263.71. 
The TOPIX gained 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 13.04 points  
to close at 9,890.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar's advance against the yen came in line  
with the Nikkei stock average's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we can continue to buy yen mostly depends on Japanese  
stock prices these days,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant manager 
of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was a warning against a rise in the  
Japanese currency from Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Finance 
Ministry's international bureau, and a similar remark by another 
senior ministry official, Eisuke Sakakibara, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, who had recently called for stability in the foreign  
exchange market, told reporters today that ``excessive yen strength 
is not very welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Sakakibara said the Finance Ministry will take  
decisive steps against excessive yen strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.25 yen and 118.79 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.96 yen, up from  
128.36 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.700 percent from Friday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.79 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Minn. Tutor: Haskins Knew Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former Minnesota tutor said Tuesday she  
thinks men's basketball coach Clem Haskins knew she was doing 
course work for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking during a news conference Tuesday, Jan Gangelhoff said  
no one ever explicitly asked her to do players' papers and she 
never told Haskins that she wrote papers for students. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she's confident Haskins knew what she was doing.  
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said Haskins called her to say a player who got a D  
in one class would need to get a B in another class. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff interpreted Haskins' comments to mean she should do  
whatever she could to get the player a higher grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a statement Monday through the university, with  
the approval of his lawyer, Ron Zamansky, saying Gangelhoff was not 
telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deny the allegations of former player Russ Archambault. I  
again deny the allegations of Jan Gangelhoff. They are not true,'' 
Haskins' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending Tuesday's news conference were Jeanne Payer,  
Gangelhoff's sister who said she also tutored some players; their 
lawyer, Jim Lord; and Archambault. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff and Archambault both said Haskins was lying when he  
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff previously said she wrote about 400 papers for 20  
players over a six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff told reporters that Haskins told her, ``Just  
remember, Jan, these papers can't be too good now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Archambault said he and Gophers assistant coaches joked about  
his work when he told the coaches he wrote two or three papers in 
one night. 
</P>
<P>
	A former office manager in the men's athletic department  
academic counseling office, Gangelhoff said she didn't intend to 
participate in a cheating scam with players. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she initially was a university-approved tutor, and the  
relationship evolved to where it was quicker to do players' work 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Players called her, she said, and she became overwhelmed by  
tutoring as many as nine or 10 students at a time, each of whom was 
taking several classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about it. It was an evolvement that happened,''  
she said. ``Helping the students was always my primary goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she helped the players because she ``was a member of  
the family'' and she ``took care of these kids,'' with whom she had 
a ``special kind of relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, whose allegations set off an investigation, spoke  
calmly during the 1 1/2-hour news conference, her first on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions with a Saint Paul Pioneer Press reporter over 2 1/2  
months persuaded Gangelhoff she should make the allegations public 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not easy choices, but (the players will) be better  
people for it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff also said she received $3,000 from Haskins for her  
work when she continued to tutor after the university took her off 
the approved tutor list. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer said she gave Gangelhoff the cash in an unmarked envelope  
Payer received from academic counselor Alonzo Newby. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer said she didn't know she was doing anything wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	Archambault has also said he received cash from Haskins. The  
former player, who was kicked off the team in February 1998 for 
leaving his hotel after curfew the night before a game at Illinois, 
said Tuesday that Haskins gave him between $40 and $200 on as many 
as 10 occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash payments could bring severe NCAA penalties for Haskins as  
well as the basketball program. The university began its 
investigation Monday, and university president Mark Yudof said it 
could take up to six months to complete. Yudof said Monday he 
believes Haskins' denial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord also issued a challenge to Yudof to have testimony be taken  
under oath during the investigation, instead of privately by an 
Overland Park, Kan., law firm the university has hired.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Academy of Poets Diversifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All it took to shake up the Academy of American  
Poets were a few harsh words. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after it was criticized by two of its own as a bastion of  
white male elitism, the academy's board of chancellors is adding 
nine new members -- five of them female, two of them black and 
several of them known for their experimental styles. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we've set out to accomplish is to make this group more  
representative of the breadth and spectrum of poetry in America 
today,'' executive director Bill Wadsworth said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The creaky rusty sound you're hearing now -- that's the gates  
of the academy of the future slowly opening,'' said Bob Holman, 
co-producer of the PBS series ``The United States of Poetry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, chancellors Carolyn Kizer and Maxine Kumin resigned  
to protest the board's lack of diversity. Wadsworth said their 
resignations and other criticisms prompted the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The new members are Lucille Clifton, Robert Creeley, Louise  
Gluck, Yusef Komunyakaa, Heather McHugh, Michael Palmer, Adrienne 
Rich, Rosanna Warren and Charles Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clifton and Komunyakaa are black. Creeley and Palmer write  
in experimental styles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Clifton was pleased at the diversity of the new board.  
``It's lots of patches in a quilt -- all of them part of the 
American quilt,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chancellors join John Ashbery, Jorie Graham, John  
Hollander, Richard Howard, Donald Justice, J.D. McClatchy, W.S. 
Merwin, Mark Strand and David Wagoner. All of them are white; Ms. 
Graham is the only woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted at the reorganization and I think it was worth  
all we went through in resigning, which was rather painful, 
although we had dozens of letters in support from all over the 
country, which was gratifying,'' said Ms. Kizer, who lives in 
Sonoma, Calif. ``The new group includes a couple of 
African-Americans who are distinguished poets, and that's a big 
step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Parisi, editor of Poetry magazine in Chicago, said:  
``These are all people of great accomplishment. ... The 
reconstituted chancellorship is more representative of what's going 
on now.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A judge has ruled that the expulsion of three  
Americans and several other foreigners from the southern state of 
Chiapas was unconstitutional, Mexico City media reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Olga Sanchez Contreras ruled in favor of the three U.S.  
citizens, two Canadians, four Spaniards, two Belgians and one 
German, who were expelled from Mexico by immigration authorities 
because they allegedly were interfering with Mexico's internal 
politics, the daily Reforma reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The visitors were ejected in April after a raid by authorities  
against a town council organized by sympathizers of the Zapatista 
rebels based in Chiapas state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican law prohibits foreigners getting involved in domestic  
politics. Since a rebel uprising in 1994, authorities have broadly 
interpreted that ban to include foreigners who attend 
rebel-sponsored events or who state opinions about local politics.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil has resumed a 120-day  
moratorium on Amazon rainforest logging intended to redirect its 
priorities in the region, the environment minister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium began Feb. 25, was suspended by a court order  
Thursday, then resumed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sarney Filho said the moratorium would allow discussions  
with loggers, settlers, farmers and the Landless Rural Workers 
movement to develop a model for sustainable development in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarney Filho said he hoped to hire about 1,500 new forest  
inspectors and that the government would spend $540,000 to look at 
the economic and social causes of deforestation in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,500 square miles of forest -- an area larger than  
Connecticut -- were destroyed in 1998, up from 5,100 square miles in 
1997.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexicans gathered Tuesday to honor the memory  
of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio on the fifth 
anniversary of the assassination that shook the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Mexicans believe disputes within Mexico's ruling party led  
to his death, and there is widespread disappointment in the four 
prosecutors who have failed to reach a satisfying conclusion, 
although one man has been jailed for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Colosio, a candidate for the longtime ruling Institutional  
Revolutionary Party and front-runner for the presidency, was shot 
to death at a campaign rally March 23, 1994, in the northern border 
city of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling-party presidential candidates have been routinely  
protected by the presidential secret service, and the weak security 
around Colosio aroused suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	A confessed assassin, Mario Aburto, is serving a 45-year  
sentence. Prosecutors said last week they did not know whether he 
had received help from anyone.

following the Monday ruling by the court in Zacapa, 70 miles 
northeast of Guatemala City.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Explosions destroyed two buildings where  
fireworks were being illegally manufactured, killing four people 
Tuesday, the government news agency Notimex reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The buildings, about 160 feet apart, were near the village of  
San Juan Tehuixtitlan, 40 miles southeast of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Police commander Tomas Balderas Amaro said the explosions were  
apparently caused by the mishandling of explosives, Notimex said.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Again Surrounded by Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The women's favorite in a meet  
dominated by Russian stars, Michelle Kwan is in a familiar position 
in the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean she's comfortable. Fighting a head cold, the  
American skater had good reason to be concerned as she prepared for 
her title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming down with something,'' she admitted Monday during a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she sounded congested, Kwan was in top form -- hitting  
jump after jump -- during practice Sunday and Monday. She hopes to 
recover without taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take it until it gets really bad,'' she said.  
``I always think medication will make my reactions a little slower. 
I want to be there when I skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's qualifications begin Wednesday, with 20 percent of  
the total score at stake, followed by the short program Friday and 
the long program Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's singles opened Monday, with Russians taking both  
sections of the qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Plushenko won one group and defending world champion  
Alexei Yagudin won the other, despite a sore left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was second behind Plushenko. In  
the other group, former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, another 
Russian, was second to Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's qualifying featured a record number of quadruple  
jumps, with six skaters -- including two Americans -- executing the 
difficult maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss completed his first clean quad in competition, and Tim  
Goebel landed the first quad salchow in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, three skaters completed quad salchows in the 1997  
Grand Prix final and the 1997 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finally nailed a clean quad toe loop. He thought he had  
one in 1997, but a video replay hours later showed he slightly 
two-footed it. There was no doubt about it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I initially wasn't planning on trying it, but as soon as I saw  
two of them hit theirs out there, I knew if I wanted to be up there 
in first or second I had to go for it,'' he said. ``It worked 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished second ahead of three-time world champion Elvis  
Stojko of Canada, who hit a quad, but fell on another. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko started strong, with his quad, but had slight errors  
on a number of his other jumps. American Trifun Zivanovic landed 
seven triple jumps to place fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who has been consistent throughout the season won his  
group easily without even attempting one. His marks were nearly all 
5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze off  
Russia won the pairs short program, with China's Shen Xue and Zhao 
Hongbo close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With a huge delayed double twist lift, the Chinese might have  
beaten the Russians if Shen had not touched down on a throw triple 
loop.

<HEADLINE> Xavier Out To Prove Point in NIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nobody was more disappointed than Xavier coach  
Skip Prosser when the Musketeers, despite 21 victories, were not 
invited to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	His immediate reaction after he first saw the 64-team field on  
television earlier this month was: ``I'm baffled a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three NIT victories later, Xavier (24-10) plays Clemson (19-14)  
tonight in the semifinals at Madison Square Garden. By beating 
Toledo, Wake Forest and Princeton on the road to the NIT's final 
four, Prosser and his players are feeling a lot better about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot say enough how grateful we are to be here,'' Prosser  
said Monday. ``I've never been through this before. But I talked to 
coaches who have been in a situation where they should have gone to 
the NCAAs and didn't. And to a man, they said the NIT was a great 
experience, especially if you get to New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal, California (20-11) plays Oregon (19-11)  
in a matchup of Pac-10 foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Musketeers are here, they hope to become the second  
Xavier team to win the NIT. The 1958 version also won the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But first comes Clemson, trying to build for next season with a  
strong showing in the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coming to New York will be a springboard for the  
future,'' Tigers coach Larry Shyatt said. ``It was also important 
for them to get another road win before coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, which will have a slight height advantage up front, is  
looking for its first postseason championship of any kind since 
winning the Southern Conference 60 years ago. The Tigers earned 
their trip to New York by beating Georgia, Rutgers on the road, and 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are led by guard Terrell McIntyre, who averages 17.9  
points, and boast a front line of 6-foot-8 Harold Jamison, 6-9 
Andrius Jurkunas and 6-10 Tom Wideman. Jamison averages 12.6 points 
and 9.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier, though, might have the best player on the court in 6-8  
senior James Posey, the A-10's defensive player of the year who 
also averages 17 points and 9.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Musketeers' comeback 65-58 win over Princeton on March  
17, Posey had 19 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really powerful and we don't have guys that size,''  
Prosser said. ``They have a nice blend of power, speed and 
quickness. We've played teams that are big but not as quick. 
Sometimes we have success with our pressure, but this will be 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cal-Oregon matchup marks the third meeting between the teams  
this season. The Ducks won the first two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throw out the first two,'' said Bears coach Ben Braun, whose  
team reached the semis with wins over Fresno State, DePaul and 
Colorado State. ``Pride is on the line. Now we have a chance to 
play for an NIT championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon coach Ernie Kent says the Bears may have the emotional  
edge, but the previous games were far from blowouts. Oregon won 
71-69 in overtime in Berkeley on Jan. 2, and then won 93-82 in the 
regular-season finale in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in tough, hard battles with them,'' said Kent,  
whose Ducks beat Georgia Tech, Wyoming and Texas Christian to make 
it to New York. ``We know each other very well, so we don't have to 
go overboard on preparation. But we will have to combat that energy 
burst they'll bring, having lost to us a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks, bidding for their first 20-win season in 23 years,  
are led by forwards A.D. Smith (13.1 points) and Alex Scales (14.5 
points), with guard Terik Brown (12.1 points) running the show. The 
Bears, making their first appearance at the Garden since 1946, 
counter with guards Geno Carlisle (15.6 points) and Thomas Kilgore 
(14.9 points). 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight's winners play for the NIT title on Thursday night,  
preceded by a consolation game.

<HEADLINE> Bill Will Help Y2K-Hit Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses trying to cope with the Year  
2000 computer problem will have access to a new loan program under 
legislation passed by the House Tuesday and sent to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed by voice vote, authorizes the Small Business  
Administration to set up a program guaranteeing loans for small 
businesses trying to either fix their computers or deal with the 
economic losses resulting from its own or supplier computer 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate this month voted 99-0 in favor of the measure  
sponsored by Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the SBA is expected to guarantee about $500  
million in loans through the end of the program on Dec. 31, 2000. 
Studies have concluded that up to 750,000 small businesses could be 
severely hurt or be forced to shut down because of the glitch in 
many computers that keeps them from differentiating between the 
year 2000 and the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Talent, R-Mo., chairman of the Small Business  
Committee, said many smaller businesses that have done little to 
prepare for the so-called Y2K problem depend on a wide range of 
suppliers and customers who use automated and computerized systems 
for production, inventory, shipping and billing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one of these links in a small business' supply-and-demand  
chain is broken due to a computer system that is not Y2K compliant, 
it would lead to irreparable damage to a business that lacks a 
large capital pool,'' Talent said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill allows the SBA to guarantee loans of up to $1 million  
for Y2K readiness. Current law for other SBA loans limits loan 
guarantees to $750,000. The loans will be provided by more than 
6,000 private financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has said it has no objections to the small  
business bill, but has voiced strong reservations about other Y2K 
bills now working their way through Congress that would limit what 
could be a deluge of lawsuits arising out of computer failures 
after Jan. 1, 2000. At issue is how to stop frivolous suits without 
restricting the legal rights of businesses and consumers damaged by 
the failure of companies to fix their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 314.

<HEADLINE> Can Silver Charm Repeat in Dubai? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Gary Stevens, who rode Silver  
Charm to victory in the Dubai World Cup last year, believes they 
can do it again on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Silver Charm is as good as he was last year,'' said  
Stevens, as he and trainer Bob Baffert watched the 1997 Kentucky 
Derby winner work out Tuesday at the Nad Al Sheba track. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year, knowing Silver Charm, I don't feel any pressure.  
Although a lot of people have written him off, Silver Charm is 
still the horse to beat this time,'' said Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's reputation, built on more than $6 1/2 million in  
earnings, lost some of its glitter because of a defeat at Santa 
Anita this year when he finished third in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said that was his fault.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take the blame if anyone is to be blamed for the  
Santa Anita defeat,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked Silver Charm too fast in the week before the race and  
did not leave any fuel in his tank,'' Stevens said. ``The criticism 
against Silver Charm is unfair because he does not need anyone to 
defend him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert isn't staying to watch Silver Charm run in Dubai.  
</P>
<P>
	``This has nothing to do with overconfidence. I have to get back  
and get ready for the Kentucky Derby,'' said Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert has a shot at saddling a third straight Kentucky Derby  
winner on May 1, something no one has ever done. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, Straight Man and General Challenge are Baffert's  
Derby possibilities this time. 
</P>
<P>
	After Silver Charm, Baffert won last year with Real Quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried (about not being here), because I have a good  
team and they know what to do,'' Baffert said of his decision to 
leave Dubai before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, Malek and Victory Gallop bring a strong U.S.  
challenge to the Dubai race which has a $3 million prize for the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the three U.S. challengers, the only other overseas  
contender is Britain's Running Stag, trained by Philip Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen are entered in the 1 1/4-mile race on the sand track.

<HEADLINE> 'Virtual Casinos' Ban Gains Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of the three-year effort to ban  
``virtual casinos'' on the Internet contended Tuesday that online 
gambling, if left unchecked, is headed for explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, sponsor of a ban that passed the Senate  
but not the House last year, is proposing a modified version that 
would eliminate one of the more controversial provisions of last 
year's bill -- criminal penalties for individuals who place bets via 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised bill would also clarify that federal law will not  
criminalize sports ``fantasy'' leagues that are already legal in 
states and would address concerns of Internet providers, who may be 
called upon to block access to gambling sites. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Tuesday convened by Kyl, the Republican chairman of  
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on technology, the revised bill 
was endorsed by attorneys general from Ohio and Wisconsin, a casino 
regulator from New Jersey and representatives of sports 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet gambling is still in its infancy,'' said Bill Saum,  
director of agent and gambling activities for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association. ``As the number of online sports 
betting sites continues to grow abroad, it is essential that the 
United States send a clear message that ... it will be a violation 
of federal law to accept bets over the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Internet casinos criticized Kyl for not  
inviting any witnesses who oppose the bill. Sue Schneider, chairman 
of the Interactive Gaming Council, called the hearing a ``sham.'' 
Her group wants to see Internet gambling regulated rather than 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl said the witness list was limited because of time  
constraints.

<HEADLINE> Langdon Shakes Off Shooting Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- While the pressure is on Duke as the  
overwhelming favorite to win the NCAA men's basketball title, Blue 
Devils sharpshooter Trajan Langdon has been able to lighten up a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon has been Duke's money player the past three seasons, the  
guy the Blue Devils go to for clutch 3-pointers and smooth baseline 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was until the postseason rolled around, where Langdon was a  
flop in 1997 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a combined 19-for-68 from the field (28 percent),  
including 11-for-38 on 3-pointers as the Blue Devils were ousted 
from the NCAA tournament by Providence and eventual national 
champion Kentucky the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Langdon's shooting problems in those years can be traced  
to Duke's lack of offense -- he was not only the major option in the 
team's attack, but sometimes its only option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have put too much pressure on myself,'' Langdon said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a host of talented teammates on this year's squad helping  
take the pressure off, the 6-foot-3 senior has rectified his 
tournament shooting woes the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the first tournament game against Florida A&AMP;M with  
a foot injury, Langdon has gone 19-for-30 from 3-point range in his 
last three games, including 11-for-18 in winning the East Regional 
MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole team can contribute offensively so it does take some  
pressure off my shoulders and I can relax shooting the ball,'' 
Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Duke (36-1) now heads to the national semifinals  
against Michigan State with a sizzling shooter as part of its 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan is not one who would ever succumb to pressure, but he  
is a human being and he can get worn down,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski 
said. ``He got worn down because he carried us -- further probably 
than we should have advanced a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, one of the best free-throw shooters in Atlantic Coast  
Conference history and a 44 percent 3-point shooter this season, 
said he didn't give his prior postseason shooting woes a thought. 
That is, until the media brought it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys put it in my mind. That's all you guys talked  
about,'' Langdon told reporters Monday. ``I wasn't concerned about 
it. I wanted to do well, and then I came down with the foot injury, 
all I was thinking about was getting back on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he admits there is less pressure on his shooting this year  
with a host of other offensive options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a different mindset. I put too much pressure on myself  
in the postseason these last couple of years. We have such a 
talented team they really don't need my shot, or if I don't shoot 
well we can win. We've even won big when I haven't shot well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he feels a special bond with Langdon, who helped  
bridge the gap between Duke's disastrous 13-18 season of 1994-95 
and this year's dominating Final Four squad that has won 31 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan doesn't lead for show, he leads when he needs to  
lead,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Trajan is extremely vocal in our own 
private setting. Being vocal does not mean being loud. That is a 
misconception out there. Loud just means loud. Trajan is not loud, 
but he is amazingly effective.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Beck Hoping To Be `Back' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Rod Beck came to the clubhouse and went  
through his workouts like every other spring. When it came time for 
the game, though, he headed for home while his teammates went out 
to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	A protruding disc in his back was making his left foot numb, but  
the real pain came from not being able to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just can't stand sitting around watching other people play  
knowing I can't,'' the Chicago Cubs closer said. ``It's tough. I've 
been on the DL one time in my life and that's probably the worst 
six weeks of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tough days are coming to an end, though. Beck, who hasn't  
played since the opening game of the spring March 5, is scheduled 
to pitch again Friday. He threw to live batting practice Monday and 
pitched in a simulated game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt great,'' he said with a smile. ``It felt nice to see  
some hitters up at the plate who didn't know what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the back felt fine. Actually, it has for days, but the Cubs  
didn't want to take any chances with Beck, who converted 51-of-58 
save opportunities and led the NL with 81 appearances last year. 
Who can blame them? With Kerry Wood lost for the season, the last 
thing Chicago needs is a lame Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	He's only the fifth reliever to reach 50 saves in a season, and  
he got his 250th last year. The Cubs rewarded him in the offseason 
with a $9.5 million, two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck's back started hurting just before exhibition games began.  
He brushed it off, thinking it was no big deal, and the pain went 
away after a few days. But then his left leg started going numb, 
and his toes tingled. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was really the only reason I said anything,'' he said.  
``I could deal with the pain, but when your feet start going numb, 
there's something else wrong and I figured I better tell somebody. 
And ultimately they found the herniated disc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was hard not playing, Beck was also relieved. When  
his leg went numb, he couldn't help but imagine the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a pitcher, or player in general, I think we've all had  
sleepless nights where we've got some pain somewhere and we're 
thinking it could be all over. Thoughts like that, it's hard not to 
have them cross your mind,'' he said. ``It was good to just know 
what it was, knowing I'm not going to be paralyzed form the waist 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's just trying to get ready for opening day. Manager Jim  
Riggleman said he'll use Beck every other day, getting him between 
six and eight innings before spring training ends. Beck would 
prefer a couple more innings, wanting as much time as he can to 
fine-tune his pitching, but this will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I'm 100 percent ready to go,'' he said. ``It's  
really the back-to-back-to-back days that I'm probably not going to 
get a chance to do here that I'll have to do during the season. So 
we'll just have to play that by ear by how I feel in the early 
going. But if they want to put me out there five in a row, I'd 
probably be all right.''

<HEADLINE> Alford Bids Farewell to SW Mo. St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Alford liked to bump chests with  
Southwest Missouri State players when they did something exciting. 
That won't change now that he is the new coach of the Iowa 
Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess, being a young coach, I'm a little naive. I just  
thought the chest bump was something that all coaches did,'' said 
Alford, 34. ``I just think that's my passion for the game coming 
out, my excitement and enthusiasm for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who guided Southwest Missouri to the NCAA tournament's  
round of 16, was hired to replace Tom Davis. Davis is Iowa's 
winningest coach, whose contract was not renewed after 13 years in 
Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford held a farewell news conference today at Southwest  
Missouri State and said he hopes the move will be the last of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no interest in the NBA. I'm in the league now that I've  
dreamed of being in. And making lateral moves within the league 
makes no sense,'' said Alford, who sometimes has been mentioned as 
an eventual successor to the Big 10 coach he played for, Indiana's 
Bob Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa was one of only a handful of schools he would have left SMS  
for, he said, declining to name the others. 
</P>
<P>
	``There just seems to be something in my gut that says this is  
the right time and this is the right opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said he wouldn't discuss what it was like to leave  
players, staff and friends behind in Springfield because if he did, 
he wouldn't be able to finish the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	As it was, he got emotional when he mentioned that his baby  
daughter, Kayla, youngest of his three children, was born in 
Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not any regrets at all,'' he said, his voice thick  
with emotion. ``It's just been a tremendous time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated his remarks of Monday when he said, ``I am a Big Ten  
person. Now I am in the Big Ten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, a two-time All-American led Indiana to the NCAA title in  
1987 and was the school's No. 2 career scorer with 2,438 points. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Sam, who will join him at Iowa as an assistant, said  
that was his take on his son's new job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this could be a long-term project,'' Sam Alford said.  
``He would like it to be the final move in coaching for him. Money 
was not the top priority. I think being in the Big Ten is the big 
priority in this job. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford accepted a five-year contract that calls for a base  
salary of about $350,000 annually. He made about $188,000 at 
Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	With camps, shoe-and-clothing contracts and broadcasting  
contracts, that could swell to about $600,000, Iowa athletic 
director Bob Bowlsby said. Additional, incremental incentives will 
be negotiated that would put Alford ``in the $900,000 range,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who led the Bears to a 22-11 mark this season, was 78-48  
at Southwest Missouri State. He began his coaching career at 
Manchester College in 1992 and took the team to the NCAA Division 
III title game in 1995 before moving on to SMS. 
</P>
<P>
	His career coaching record is 156-77 in eight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who earned a total of $419,561, was 269-140 at Iowa, but  
fell out of favor because he never won a conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes finished 20-10 this season -- their fifth straight  
20-win season -- after NCAA tourney wins over Alabama-Birmingham and 
Arkansas. Their season, and Davis' Iowa career, ended Thursday 
night when they lost 78-68 to Connecticut in the West Regional 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears beat Wisconsin and Tennessee in the first two rounds  
of tournament play before falling 78-61 to top-ranked Duke in the 
NCAA East Regional semifinal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like match play -- Iowa advanced and I knew we  
needed to advance,'' said Alford.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Tuesday, with the key indexes slumping both in Tokyo and Hong Kong 
on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost  
359.68 points, or 2.20 percent, closing at 16,019.10 points. On 
Friday, the average soared 660.86 points, or 4.20 percent, to an 
eight-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices opened slightly higher on buying by foreign  
brokerages but quickly fell on profit-taking in reaction to 
Friday's sharp gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's correction was natural given the recent gains and the  
New York market's loss over the past two sessions,'' said Kunihiro 
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 13.04 points  
to close at 9,890.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.53 yen, up 1.01 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
118.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed lower as investors took profits  
following two consecutive sessions of advances.

<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 66.23 points, or 0.6 percent, closing at 
11,041.01. On Monday, the index had gained 24.32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors took profits after the index gained more  
than 4 percent in the past two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong market was also dragged down by Tuesday's sharp  
fall on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Recently, Hong Kong investors 
have been using the Nikkei Stock Average as a major trading 
indicator.

<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed as blue chip stocks

<P>
	The Chargers said Harbaugh had told them before his trade from

<HEADLINE> Trial in Wyo. Gay Slaying To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- In the weeks after the beating death of gay  
student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed 
as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence 
and small-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first of Shepard's alleged attackers set to go on trial  
for his life Wednesday, those images of Laramie could work to 
prosecutors' advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said the  
jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 
26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever  
happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to 
portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to 
think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  
aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. 
The crime shocked the nation and drew condemnation from President 
Clinton and Congress and calls for stronger bias crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set  
to go on trial in August. Both could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and  
lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, 
pistol-whipped him and stole $20. He was left for dead, tied to a 
fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. The 
political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days 
later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the  
university setting will probably help the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The academic community is generally perceived as one that is  
less in favor of the death penalty and more inclined to seek out 
the emotionalism as to what has happened and why,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San  
Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case 
and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man 
was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man 
to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	America, he said, has ``moved further along on the issue of race  
and people tend to know what the `right' answer is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more  
difficult to measure,'' Rice said. ``It's a question less people 
have considered in their own minds.''

<HEADLINE> House Condemns Cuba, Backs Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, in a broad sweep of the globe  
Tuesday, went on record condemning human rights violations in Cuba, 
anti-Semitic remarks in the Russian parliament and China's military 
threats against Taiwan. It also repeated that all international 
family planning programs should be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuba resolution, passed by voice vote, urges the  
administration to seek international condemnation of the Castro 
government at an upcoming meeting of the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva. It denounces recent suppression of political 
dissidents and demands that the Cuban government release all 
political prisoners, legalize political parties and schedule free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Congress cannot be silent on this issue and will not  
tolerate the abuses inflicted by the Castro regime on its own 
citizens,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 421-0 vote, the House also criticized the anti-Semitic  
statements made in recent months by Communist Party members and 
nationalists in Russia's Duma, or parliament. It praised Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian government officials who 
have condemned such statements. 
</P>
<P>
	And the House, by a 429-1 vote, marked the 20th anniversary of  
the Taiwan Relations Act, the benchmark of U.S. non-governmental 
relations with Taiwan after U.S.-China relations were formed in 
1979, by warning China not to make military threats against Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for all to know, especially for Beijing to  
know when making its foreign policy calculations, that when it 
comes to U.S. relations with Taiwan there has been no weakening in 
our resolve to help the Taiwanese,'' said Rep. Doug Bereuter, 
R-Neb., chairman of the House International Relations subcommittee 
on Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The family planning resolution, passed by voice vote, expresses  
the sense of Congress that international family planning programs 
should be completely voluntary and avoid numerical targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor, Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., said it would send a  
strong message before a United Nations conference on population 
this June that the United States will support only those programs 
that are ``truly voluntary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the resolutions are non-binding.

<HEADLINE> Court Expands Expert Witness Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rules for judging the reliability of  
scientific expert testimony in court also apply to non-scientific 
experts, a unanimous Supreme Court said today in a decision of 
enormous importance to American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the scope of a 1993 decision that established rules  
for considering whether scientific evidence should be allowed, the 
court said the same rules may be used by judges in determining 
whether other types of expert testimony are let in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that (the 1993 ruling's) general holding ...  
applies not only to testimony based on 'scientific' knowledge, but 
also to testimony based on 'technical' and 'other specialized' 
knowledge,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	By a separate 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that a federal judge  
in Alabama correctly barred an engineer from testifying as an 
expert witness in the trial of a lawsuit over a 1993 traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer was prepared to testify that he believed a  
manufacturer's or design defect had caused a tire blowout that led 
to the Baldwin County, Ala., accident in which one person was 
killed and seven others injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge rightly doubted whether the engineer's  
methodology could reliably determine the cause of the tire's 
failure, Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court in 1993 told judges deciding on the  
admissibility of expert evidence to consider whether the theory or 
technique had been tested, whether it was reviewed by other 
experts, its possible rate of error, and whether it was generally 
accepted by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines were aimed at allowing trial judges to act as  
gatekeepers and keep unreliable ``junk science'' out of the 
courtroom in product-liability disputes and other legal 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that  
those rules do not apply to non-scientific testimony. Its ruling 
gave the Patrick Carmichael family another chance to show that 
engineer David Carlson's testimony should have been allowed in 
their lawsuit against the Kumho Tire Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's ruling said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	Breyer said the trial judge's ``decision in this case -- not to  
admit certain expert testimony -- was within its discretion and 
therefore lawful.'' He said appeals courts cannot second-guess 
trial judge's rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony 
unless an ``abuse of discretion'' is found -- a very difficult legal 
standard to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	One Carmichael family member was killed and seven were injured  
when one of a minivan's tires blew failed, the driver lost control 
and the van overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision continued to give trial judges broad discretion  
in their gatekeeper role. Breyer's opinion said a trial judge has 
``the discretionary authority, reviewable for its abuse, to 
determine reliability in light of the particular facts and 
circumstances of the particular case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens agreed that the rules for scientific  
testimony apply to non-scientific testimony as well, but dissented 
from that part of the court's ruling that upheld the trial judge's 
decision in the Alabama case. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said that issue should be returned to the 11th Circuit  
court for a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had been closely watched. Among the ``friends of the  
court'' supporting Kumho Tire's appeal were the National 
Association of Manufacturers, American Insurance Association and 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	The Carmichael family had been supported in briefs submitted by,  
among others, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and 
Center for Auto Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 97-1709.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Selling / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as recent rallies prompted 
increased selling by farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell only modestly, however, as market participants noted  
a seasonal trend toward higher prices usually occurs as farmers 
turn their attention to getting new crops into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains also were supported by continued talk the U.S.  
Agriculture Department would approve new donations to cash-starved 
Russia and amid expectations a report due next week would show 
farmers intend to plant fewer acres of corn and wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.84 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.29 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 1 1/2 cents to 
$1.16 a bushel, and May soybeans fell 4 1/4 cents to $4.95 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Feeder cattle and pork bellies futures were higher on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle was mixed and pork 
bellies were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle was unchanged at 67 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .48 cent to 71.90 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .55 cent to 43.90 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .80

<HEADLINE> Bob Simon Brings a Global View </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't ask Bob Simon about the Washington press  
corps. After all, this is the bunch that seemed to spend the past 
year jostling Betty Currie, watching Kenneth Starr climb into his 
car, and wearing bare spots on the White House lawn for standups 
that forecast President Clinton's imminent downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	So don't even ask. Simon might propose that his D.C.  
counterparts be reassigned, en masse, to war-torn Kosovo for a 
reality check. ``In the winter,'' he adds with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Which, come to think of it, is the sort of duty Simon thrives  
on. For most of his three decades at CBS News, much of it on ``The 
CBS Evening News,'' he has flourished reporting from around the 
globe. As such, he has contentedly stayed an ocean or three from 
Beltway shenanigans and, equally important, from his bosses on 
Manhattan's West 57th Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any profession,'' he reasons, ``there are some  
personalities that thrive better in far-flung locations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the Bronx-born Simon is in Manhattan for a couple of  
weeks to ``crash'' (finish quickly) one story and prepare another. 
</P>
<P>
	But usually Simon operates out of Tel Aviv, where he lives with  
his wife, Francoise. From that post he is largely cushioned from 
Nielsen ratings, Q Scores and other ephemera he good-naturedly sums 
up with a synonym for ``cattle poop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fine. But there would seem to be a major downside: bullets and  
viruses and capture (he and three CBS News colleagues spent 40 days 
in Iraqi prisons during the Gulf War in January 1991). 
</P>
<P>
	``Risking your life?'' says Simon. ``It's a question of doing  
stories. I started out in Northern Ireland (in 1969), and from 
there I went to Vietnam, which was a pretty intense place, too. 
After a while, whenever there's anything really intense going on, 
I'm just sort of attracted to it. I want to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once there, his mission is to unsnarl complex, distant events in  
a way that makes his viewers, otherwise fixated on scandal and 
celebrity, care. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it doesn't seem to work.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bosnia was the most frustrating story I've ever covered,'' he  
says. ``That's because when we first started covering it'' -- by 
``we'' he means all the journalists there -- ``the people of 
Sarajevo knew, as I knew, that as soon as the world understood what 
was going on there, the world would make it stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we went on telling the story, and nothing happened,'' he  
says ruefully. ``There we were, week after week, saying, `Look at 
this slaughter, in the name of nothing!' And nobody made it stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon, 58, has never stopped or even slowed down, and his  
labors have earned him two Emmy awards, a Peabody and a passel of 
other honors. 
</P>
<P>
	These days he also has won a larger canvas for his reporting.  
His silver head and craggy face are regularly found on ``60 
Minutes.'' And since its premiere in January, ``60 Minutes II'' 
showcases him as a regular correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers of Wednesday's ``II'' (at 9 p.m. EST) will be riveted by  
a two-part, half-hour Simon report titled ``The Lost Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After World War II,'' he explains, ``families and single  
mothers in Britain had kids they couldn't afford to take care of, 
so they dropped them off in various institutions for a while. The 
children's homes were overflowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What to do? In what must have seemed a win-win scheme, Britain  
shipped these hapless youngsters to Australia, which, terrified 
that Asia posed a threat, was desperate to augment its ``white 
stock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promised loving adoptive parents, these British children --  
10,000 of them over a 20-year period -- were instead banished to 
penal-like Christian schools in the Australian outback, where 
priests subjected their wards to manual labor, floggings and 
sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the children had truly been an orphan, Simon  
reports, yet all were told that their parents were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, back in Britain, whenever parents came to reclaim a  
son or daughter, they were told the child had been placed with a 
well-to-do London family and was happily resettled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine the surprise of those who learned 50 years later that  
their kids had been sent to Australia,'' Simon says with a knowing 
smile and bitterly affirming nod. ``The story just goes layer upon 
layer of horror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heartbreaking. But Simon doesn't mind lighthearted reports, and  
for ``60 Minutes'' I and II, he also gets to do those. He has 
profiled Roberto Benigni, the Oscar-winning Italian 
writer-director-star of ``Life is Beautiful,'' and 
pianist-conductor Daniel Barenboim (``I'm an opera buff,'' says 
Simon). 
</P>
<P>
	And ``living a child's fantasy,'' as he puts it, last year he  
traveled around Spain with a matador. Which proves that Simon, a 
journalist happy in his work, doesn't mind a little bull after all.

<HEADLINE> 'Teletubbies' Maker Sues Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A maker of the popular British television series  
``Teletubbies'' filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores on Monday, 
alleging the world's largest retail chain infringed on its 
trademark for dolls based on the series' characters. 
</P>
<P>
	England-based Ragdoll Productions Ltd and its North American  
licensing agent itsy bitsy Entertainment Co. brought the lawsuit in 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleging that Wal-Mart's small 
figurine characters known as ``Bubbly Chubbies'' copied its popular 
``Teletubbies'' characters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teletubbies characters, ``Tinky Winky,'' ``Laa-Laa,''  
``Po,'' and ``Dipsy'' have been featured on BBC since 1997, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series now airs or will soon air in about 120 countries and  
in 21 languages and dialects. Since last April, it has been 
broadcast on 323 Public Broadcasting System stations, reaching 97 
percent of U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	Ragdoll alleged in the lawsuit that Bentonville, Ark.-based  
Wal-Mart has capitalized on the fame and widespread recognition of 
the ``Telebubbies'' characters with its own line of similar dolls 
right down to their name, ``Bubbly Chubbies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit called the dolls ``obvious, studied knockoffs of the  
famous 'Teletubbies' characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought unspecified damages, including the withdrawal  
and destruction of the Wall-Mart dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been served with the lawsuit,'' said a Wal-Mart  
spokeswoman, Laura Pope. She added, ``Wal-Mart would never 
knowingly infringe upon copyright or trademark laws.''

<HEADLINE> Commerce Finds Steel Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has sided with U.S.  
stainless steel producers in their complaints of illegal trade 
practices by producers in six countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack W. Shilling, president of Allegheny Ludlum Corp., called  
the rulings Monday from the Commerce Department a vindication for 
the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know from the marketplace that our allegations ... are  
true, and these decisions will help to correct the problems we have 
faced,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department concluded that Belgium, Canada, Italy,  
South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan have illegally dumped 
stainless steel in the United States at prices below production 
costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce found that Belgium, Italy and South Africa also gave  
producers unfair subsidies that effectively lowered prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Those countries face tariffs of up to 60 percent on stainless  
steel if the independent U.S. International Trade Commission 
determines the practice has injured or threatens to hurt U.S. steel 
makers. The commission is to rule by May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department finding applies only to a specialized  
steel product known as stainless steel plate in coils. It comes 
rolled up like carpet and is used in specialized tasks such as 
chemical processing, pollution control and petroleum refining. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the product makes up a small part of overall steel  
consumption, it is among the first of the dumping complaints to 
wind its way through the administration since steel imports began 
to rise dramatically in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	A much larger case involving hot-rolled carbon steel is pending  
before the department, with a final ruling due next month. Commerce 
already has issued preliminary rulings finding evidence that Japan, 
Russia and Brazil engaged in illegal dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. steel industry contends that low-priced imports have  
resulted in thousands of layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
The House defied a presidential veto threat last week and passed 
legislation establishing quotas on foreign steel, although aides 
say stainless steel would not be covered. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Commerce Department, imports of the stainless  
steel product from the six countries combined more than doubled 
from 1997 to 1998. U.S. steel makers contend they cannot compete 
when foreign governments offer subsidies or adjust their pricing to 
undercut the U.S. producers in their own market. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy faces the largest tariffs -- up to 60 percent. Producers in  
other countries face tariffs of at least 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Any tariffs levied would effectively raise prices of foreign  
steel, theoretically making them closer to the price of a similar 
product made domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Mullaney, a lawyer for the main South African producer, said  
South Africa was an ``innocent bystander'' blamed for import surges 
caused by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for other producers either had no comment or did not  
return telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint was filed by Allegheny Ludlum, Armco Inc. and J&AMP;L  
Specialty Steel Inc., all based in Pittsburgh, Lukens Inc. of 
Coatesville, Pa., and North American Stainless of Ghent, Ky., as 
well as by unions representing workers at those companies.

<HEADLINE> Seats Separated From Capsized Raft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The seating unit of an amusement park  
raft carrying a dozen people separated from its inner-tube base as 
it overturned and killed an Arkansas woman, park operators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How the tubing came off, we don't know,'' said Nancy St.  
Pierre, spokeswoman for Six Flags Over Texas. ``Hopefully, we'll 
find that out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amusement park's investigation has not yet determined what  
role, if any, the separation played in the accident Sunday 
afternoon on the park's Roaring Rapids. It was the first fatality 
involving a visitor in the park's 38-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Most aboard the overturned raft were able to unbuckle their seat  
belts and get out of the waist-deep water, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Valeria Cartwright, 28, of West Helena, Ark., drowned after  
being trapped upside down when the raft capsized, the Tarrant 
County medical examiner's office said Monday. Three other people 
remained hospitalized today. At least one rider suffered a broken 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was under investigation by the ride's manufacturer  
and an independent ride-safety consulting company.

<HEADLINE> Freed Inmate Charged With Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The former death row inmate who was freed through  
the efforts of a college journalism class has been jailed again on 
charges of domestic battery. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, who spent nearly 17 years on death row, struck  
his daughter and her mother at a party on Monday night, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the women was struck in the face and the other was hit  
several times and kicked, authorities said. Porter allegedly fled 
the scene before police arrived. The cause of the outburst was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter turned himself in at the courthouse Tuesday, where Judge  
Gregory O'Brien set bond at $20,000 on each of the two domestic 
battery charges. Porter was held in the Cook County Jail in lieu of 
bond. O'Brien set a court date of April 1 for Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's attorney, Daniel Sanders, did not return a call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Gov. George Ryan pardoned Porter, who came within  
days of being executed for two 1982 murders. He was freed in 
February as a result of an investigation by a Northwestern 
University journalism class and a private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation found that another man, 48-year-old Alstory  
Simon, made a tape recorded statement in which he said he was 
responsible for the two fatal shootings.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Oil Cuts' Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From giant automakers to tiny  
bed-and-breakfasts, businesses of all kinds could be pinched if 
OPEC's plan to cut oil production sends prices sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists are optimistic that any future energy price  
increases won't be big enough to dramatically hurt American 
companies' profits, and that low inflation will continue even with 
prices at the gasoline pump moving higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still will be a positive climate for energy users, just not  
as positive as before,'' said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Bank 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	American oil companies are hoping that rising energy prices will  
reverse their slumping profits, which have forced them to lay off 
thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are generally optimistic that OPEC will stick to its  
plan to cut daily oil production by 2.1 million barrels over the 
next year. But for prices to rise steadily, members of the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries must prove they 
will not revert to the cheating that has undercut past promises to 
slash production. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, automakers, airlines, truckers, plastics makers  
and other businesses that have benefited from the long slump in oil 
prices are cautiously preparing for higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the stock market -- you never know. I don't know if  
you can count on the OPEC guys to ever stick to their word,'' said 
Rick Todd, president of the 900-member South Carolina Trucking 
Association. ``Most folks are expecting prices to rise, but to what 
extent is just guesswork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil is trading in the  
$15 range, up from around $12 a month ago and a 12-year low of 
$10.72 in December. Analysts expect OPEC cuts could boost the price 
to about $17 per barrel by year's end, which they consider a modest 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	At the pump, the national average gasoline price shot up almost  
8 1/2 cents a gallon to $1.09 in the past two weeks, but it still 
remains near historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts expect pump prices to rise another 10 cents per  
gallon this year, but economists believe that would still have 
limited impact on consumers' spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to be a severe hardship, but at the  
margin it's probably going to slow their spending a bit for other 
items,'' said Gary Thayer, an economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	One industry in particular that could suffer from higher energy  
prices is tourism, as airline prices could pass on higher fuel 
prices to consumers and weekend driving trips that have become more 
frequent recently could be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Frohman, proprietor of the Grunberg Haus Bed &AMP;  
Breakfast in Waterbury, Vt., said he doesn't see low gas prices as 
a major factor in his business. Frohman said this ski season has 
been his best, but he attributed that more to favorable weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my guests driving up my driveway in larger and larger  
vehicles, so whatever savings they have in the price per gallon 
they seem to be using up in the poor mileage of the vehicles 
they're driving,'' Frohman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Woodward, a partner at Deloitte Consulting, said that  
other businesses could actually thrive amid rising energy prices if 
they translate into more hiring in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those individuals will be spending their dollars on goods and  
services produced by other industries,'' Woodward said. ``The 
overall impact will be positive on the U.S. economy.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admiral Relieved Over Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Navy admiral based in Naples, Italy,  
has been relieved of his duties and given a punitive letter of 
reprimand for having an alleged extramarital affair and lying about 
it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The action was taken Monday against Rear Adm. Paul ``Scott''  
Semko, commander of U.S. land-based naval air forces in the 
Mediterranean region. 
</P>
<P>
	The punishment was decided by Adm. James O. Ellis Jr., commander  
in chief of allied forces in Southern Europe, at an ``admiral's 
mast,'' a nonjudicial proceeding, at Ellis' headquarters in Naples, 
according to U.S. Naval Forces Europe spokesman Capt. Stephen 
Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Semko was relieved of his command but kept on Ellis' staff  
pending reassignment by the Navy Personnel Command. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy officer familiar with the case said the punishment is  
virtually certain to end Semko's career. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda said Ellis found that Semko had violated Article 133 of  
the Uniform Code of Military Justice by committing ``conduct 
unbecoming an officer.'' Honda said Semko had an extramarital 
affair with a civilian not in his command and had made a false 
official statement during the Navy's investigation. He declined to 
provide other details. 
</P>
<P>
	Semko is married and has two children.  
</P>
<P>
	The matter was investigated by the Navy Inspector General's  
office in Washington after it received an anonymous letter in 
January alleging misconduct by Semko. A Navy official in Washington 
familiar with the investigation said the letter was submitted by 
the woman Semko was involved with. The official, speaking on 
condition he not be identified, said the affair ended early in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis conducted his own investigation and concluded that ``the  
allegation was substantiated,'' Honda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Semko's is the latest in a string of cases of senior military  
officers receiving punishment for sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Rear Adm. John T. Scudi was found guilty of  
adultery, obstructing justice and improperly steering defense 
contracts to a woman with whom he was having an affair. Scudi was 
found to have committed seven violations of three different 
articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He was punished 
with a 30-day arrest in his quarters and ordered to forfeit one 
half of his pay for the next two months, plus he received a 
punitive letter of reprimand for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, retired Army Maj. Gen. David Hale was ordered to pay  
a $10,000 fine and forfeit $12,000 of his pension after he admitted 
on the opening day of his court martial to adulterous affairs with 
the wives of four subordinates. He had the affairs while serving in 
Turkey from 1996 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Semko, the Navy admiral, began his career in 1970 and had been  
commander of Fleet Air Mediterranean, based at Naples, since May 
1998. In that post he was commander of all U.S. land-based naval 
air forces; six Navy shore bases reported to him. He also was 
commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet's maritime surveillance and 
reconnaissance forces and commander of NATO's maritime air forces 
in the Mediterranean.

	NATO OKs Air Strikes on Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana  
ordered airstrikes against Yugoslavia today, saying all efforts to 
achieve a negotiated settlement had failed, but it was not known 
when the operations would begin. More than 400 aircraft from allied 
nations stood ready for bombings that officials indicated were 
likely within days or hours. Half a dozen U.S. Navy ships were 
ready to launch cruise missiles. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
declared peace talks with Yugoslavia's president on Kosovo a 
failure, and Yugolav officials declared a state of emergency -- one 
step below a state of war. 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Is Wary on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today  
that Russia would step up its combat readiness if NATO attacked 
Yugoslavia, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the Russian 
military, short of everything from weapons to food, is thought to 
be close to collapse. After years of decline, Russia's economy is 
in tatters, unable to sustain any kind of meaningful military 
operation. The air force, once one of the most powerful in the 
world, now has few planes and would not pose any major threat to 
NATO even if Moscow wanted to intervene. Russian pilots only fly 
for a few hours each year, far below the level necessary to 
maintain the most basic flying skills and many of their planes are 
old and dilapidated. 

</P>
<P>
	Sources: Strikes on Serbs Coming  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today rallied senior members  
of Congress to support a NATO attack on the Serbs over Kosovo. 
Lawmakers sources said the strikes could come as early as tonight. 
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in a dramatic gesture of 
opposition, canceled plans to visit here as the crisis intensified. 
Primakov was over the Atlantic, en route to Washington for a 
meeting with Vice President Al Gore designed to strengthen U.S. 
economic and scientific cooperation with Russia, when his jetliner 
was turned around and headed back to Moscow. 

</P>
<P>
	American Missiles Would Lead Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first phase of a NATO bombing campaign  
against Yugoslavia would bring a barrage of U.S. cruise missiles 
from Navy ships and submarines and Air Force bombers, officials 
said today. The initial bombing would try to blind Yugoslavia's 
extensive network of air defense radars and missiles. Once the air 
defenses had been damaged, a variety of manned aircraft, including 
U.S. and allied F-16s and American F-15s, would have a less risky 
opportunity to target weapon depots and Serb troop concentrations.

	Jackson Unlikely To Join 2000 Race

he was ``not very motivated to at this point'' to challenge Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. Former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced candidate for the 
Democratic nomination.

	McDougal Takes Witness Stand  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Clinton business partner Susan  
McDougal, facing obstruction of justice and contempt charges for 
refusing to answer questions about Whitewater, today agreed to 
answer queries from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors. Mrs. McDougal said 
Clinton's testimony in her 1996 fraud trial was truthful. She also 
said she never discussed with Clinton a fraudulent $300,000 loan in 
her name. Another Whitewater witness, David Hale, has testified 
that Clinton had pressured him to make that loan. Mrs. McDougal has 
already served 18 months in prison for refusing to answer questions 
about the Whitewater land deal.

	Dow Ends Down 218.68 Points  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, with the Dow tumbling  
toward 9,600 just days after rising above 10,000, as investors grew 
uneasy about technology company earnings and the outlook for 
interest rates. The Dow fell 218.68 points to close at 9,671.83. It 
was the 11th biggest point drop ever for the Dow, but wasn't close 
to a record in terms of a percentage decline. On the NYSE, losers 
led gainers 2,341-688. The Nasdaq was down 73.18 at 2,322.76.

	US Says Little Progress in Yugo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. envoy says little progress was made in  
talks with Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic on reaching a 
peace deal, increasing the possibility of imminent airstrikes on 
Serbian targets. Milosevic rejected a key element of the 
U.S.-backed peace plan which called for the deployment of NATO 
troops in Yugoslavia. U.S. officials said Richard Holbrooke had had 
several meetings in Belgrade with the Yugoslav leader, but no 
further meetings were planned. The Serbian parliament is expected 
to meet later today. However, a noticeable decline in fighting in 
the Serbs' military offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is 
seen as a possible glimmer of hope in avoiding a military 
confrontation.

	Trains Collide Near Amtrak Crash Site  
</P>
<P>
	MOMENCE, Ill. (AP) -- Two freight trains collided today outside  
Chicago, just a few miles from the site of a deadly Amtrak crash 
last week. Authorities say three people were injured in today's 
crash. A spokesman for Conrail said one of the company's eastbound 
freight trains hit a southbound Union Pacific train on a track 
about 50 miles south of Chicago. Eleven people died last week when 
the Amtrak train plowed into a truck stuck on the tracks and 
derailed.

	HAVANA (AP) -- A Salvadoran man who confessed to a string of  
hotel bombings has been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 
death by a Cuban tribunal. Under Cuban law, the death sentence of 
Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon will be immediately appealed to the Supreme 
Court. The blasts killed an Italian man and injured 11 people, 
including seven foreigners. The verdict in the trial of a second 
Salvadoran charged with terrorism, Otto Rene Rodriguez Llerena, is 
pending. Prosecutors sought to show that leaders of the Miami-based 
Cuban-American National Foundation recruited and paid Cruz Leon to 
plant bombs at six tourist locales.

	BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) -- Azerbaijan has detained a Russian cargo  
plane carrying six MiG jet fighters that may have been heading to 
Yugoslavia, news reports said today. The Russian AN-124 cargo plane 
arrived in Azerbaijan's capital on Thursday for refueling. But 
customs agents prevented the plane from leaving after finding the 
fighters and other military equipment aboard along with 30 pilots 
and technicians, the Turan news agency reported. Russian officials 
said the plane was taking the MiG fighters to the Slovak capital, 
Bratislava.

Luis Maria Argana was entering his office when he was fired on by

	OPEC Agrees To Cut Oil Production

<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today to cut crude  
oil production by 2.1 million barrels a day and maintain lower 
levels of output for a full year starting April 1, oil ministers 
said. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, will slash output by 
585,000 barrels a day. Oil prices had already reflected the impact 
of the expected cuts by rising sharply, and industry analysts say 
refiners of gasoline have wasted no time passing on the steeper 
prices to consumers. The OPEC move likely will cause gas prices to 
rise further.

Rodman took a leave of absence from the Los Angeles Lakers and 
missed four games before returning Sunday. He has played only 11 
games this season.

<HEADLINE> Man Points Gun at Baseball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Little League players scrambled to  
safety when a man pulled a gun on their coach during an argument 
over a batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	John Skrandel, 28, was being held without bond Tuesday in Palm  
Beach County Jail, pending the results of a court-ordered 
psychiatric evaluation. He was charged with aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The argument began Sunday when coach Mike Adams asked Skrandel  
if he and his 6-year-old son would move to a different cage. Adams 
wanted to use the only cage that could accommodate the Little 
League pitching machine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skrandel refused. When Adams insisted, Skrandel attacked him  
with an aluminum baseball bat, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fight escalated, Skrandel went to a gym bag and pulled  
out a .40-caliber Glock pistol, police said. About 15 players fled 
when they saw the gun. Adams' two children, ages 9 and 11, saw 
Skrandel pull the weapon on their father.

<HEADLINE> Duke Has Two Teams in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke athletic director Joe Alleva spent most  
of Tuesday trying to solve a wonderful dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to figure out how to get from the NCAA women's semifinals  
in California on Friday, in which Duke plays Georgia, to the men's 
semifinals in Florida the next day, when Duke plays Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Most universities consider themselves lucky to make the NCAA  
tournament at all. Now, Duke has two teams in the Final Four! 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women stunned top-ranked Tennessee 69-63 on Monday  
night to earn their first Final Four berth. A day earlier, the 
top-ranked Duke men's team beat Temple 85-64 to reach its fifth 
Final Four this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	How rare is it? So rare that Georgia is the only other school to  
have both a men's and women's basketball team reach their 
respective NCAA Final Fours in the same season, accomplishing the 
feat in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Indiana did it in 1973, when the NCAA ran the men's  
tournament and the AIAW oversaw the women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Alleva, it created a coast-to-coast conundrum because he was  
unable to make connections between San Jose, Calif., and St. 
Petersburg, Fla., using commercial airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, he finally secured a private charter to take  
him, university president Nan Keohane and faculty representative 
Kathleen Smith on the ambitious journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm going to have to do a lot of sleeping on planes  
and get some books,'' Alleva said. ``But there was no doubt we were 
going to do this. You don't get this unique an opportunity very 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's double the frenzy.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday morning, the Blue Devils' ticket office opened 15  
phone lines and still was unable to field every call, assistant 
ticket manager Bobby Sorrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school received 3,500 tickets for the men's event and 700  
for the women's event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mission impossible around here because we have about the  
smallest athletic department in the country and here we are, with 
two teams in the Final Four,'' Sorrell said. ``That's OK. I'd take 
this problem every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's notoriously rowdy student body remained subdued, however.  
Neither victory ignited the traditionally raucous celebrations that 
feature towering bonfires at the center of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a very practical reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're saving our energy and conserving wood,'' said Charles  
Ellis, a senior from River Vale, N.J. ``The best is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students say the women's trip through the NCAA tournament  
has been more exciting than the men's because expectations were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like the women are David and the men are  
Goliath,'' said Michael Dobbyn, a senior from Canton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone follows the men and going to men's games is  
amazing,'' Ellis said. ``It adds so much to the semester. The women 
have almost kind of sneaked up on us. All of a sudden, it's like 
`Wow! They beat Tennessee and now they're in the Final Four, 
too.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women have never been to a Final Four before. But coach  
Gail Goestenkors won't have to go far to find out what it's like. 
Coach Mike Krzyzewski's office is just two doors down a 
blue-carpeted hallway in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, whose top-ranked men cruised to their fifth Final  
Four of the decade with a 85-64 win over Temple on Sunday, was one 
of the first to congratulate Goestenkors when she showed up for 
work Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He watched the game last night and you could see the joy on  
his face. It was genuine,'' said Goestenkors, who's completing her 
seventh season at Duke. ``We're going to talk more later. I want 
his advice because he's been there and this is new to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers flooded Goestenkors' office on Tuesday but by 8 a.m.,  
she was breaking down film of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm already in that mode where you've got to get ready for the  
next game,'' Goestenkors said. ``He (Krzyzewski) came in and said, 
`Take at least this morning and this afternoon and just enjoy this. 
Appreciate this and then go ahead and prepare. But you need to 
enjoy and allow your team to enjoy this moment.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski and Goestenkors have forged a strong working  
relationship that goes back to her hiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said when I first came here, `I don't want Duke men's  
basketball to be the only winner here, I want people to think about 
Duke basketball as a winner,''' Goestenkors said. ``I wanted to 
know that's what they wanted. I felt that if the men's program 
could do it here, the women's program could do it here. That's what 
we're on the verge of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But wait a minute. What if the women win and the men lose?  
</P>
<P>
	``People here get emotionally involved with the men's team,  
whereas the women's team is just starting to peak everyone's 
interest,'' Dobbyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the men don't win it and the women do, it would be pretty  
somber around here and that's too bad,'' he said. ``But the 
prevailing attitude would be disappointment for the men not winning 
it rather than excitement for the women winning it.''

<HEADLINE> War Comes to Kosovo Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Some cradle their crusted head  
wounds and broken limbs, while others display destroyed cars and 
furniture. Still others are fleeing, often with no declared goal 
and clutching no more than a hastily packed shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
	For ethnic Albanians in Pristina, the fighting they heard about  
in the countryside for more than a year has suddenly become 
up-close reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the weekend, three ethnic Albanians have been killed in  
bomb and shooting attacks on cafes. The violence culminated Monday 
night in police beatings and detentions that sent hundreds fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs in Pristina are also terrified -- and angry. They accuse  
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army of killing four policemen Sunday 
in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the weekend, the fighting between the KLA and Yugoslav  
and Serbian forces was something that happened elsewhere, even if a 
burning village was only a 10-minute drive away. Pristina, the 
capital of the Serbian province with an ethnic Albanian majority, 
kept up a semblance of normality. 
</P>
<P>
	No more. The rash of bombings and shootings, and the tensions  
generated by the likelihood of NATO attack, have changed the lives 
of the 280,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian cafes and restaurants close at dark; so do a rising  
number of Serb establishments. More and more stores are locked 
during the day. Buses are full of Serbs leaving Kosovo for central 
Serbia or Albanians hoping to cross into Macedonia or Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	``In case any (NATO) bombs fall on Pristina, the situation may  
get out of control,'' said Miki Mihajlovic, head of the Serb Media 
Center. ``People could start killing each other, everybody is 
armed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A taste of what could lie ahead was evident Tuesday in  
Pristina's Hospital Suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Houses along rutted dirt roads in the ethnic Albanian  
neighborhood were deserted. Women clutched small children and bags 
as they walked away from their homes, often with no clear 
destination, traumatized by a night of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Valbona Bajromi, a local official of the ethnic Albanian LDK  
party, estimated that a thousand people had fled since Serbian riot 
police descended Monday night. She showed a list of 20 men she said 
were beaten by police, and said that was only a partial count. 
</P>
<P>
	``They broke down the door and butted me with their helmets,''  
said Fadil Berisha, his forehead covered with bloody bruises. 
``Then they kicked me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Arsim, displayed a grossly swollen and bruised  
forearm that he said was broken by a policeman wielding a piece of 
firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Another relative, Milaim Berisha, said police -- 50 or 60 of them  
-- dumped two elderly men in the family yard after beating them, 
leaving their faces ``covered with blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Above, two Yugoslav army helicopters flew low. The sound of  
distant cannon fire reflected the ongoing war in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	In a house up a hill, 82-year-old Mustafa Pacoli lay on his  
fold-out couch, unable to flee. ``I can't even make it to the 
car,'' he said. The ugly purple welts down his back, he said, were 
caused by a police beating with a footstool. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nearby home, Halid Fazliu, 62, displayed bruises and cuts  
on his face and head. He said police lined him up with other men 
and then walked by, punching them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fazliu living room was a mess of ripped curtains and broken  
furniture. Cars outside were dented, their windows smashed. Stereo 
sets and other household goods lay in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
	On a hilltop north of Pristina, Serbs buried 25-year-old  
Aleksander Jilojkovic, one of the policemen killed Sunday. And in 
the capital, relatives buried Arianit Kelmendi, an ethnic Albanian 
killed Monday by a grenade thrown into a cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, Beshar Dushi, worried about the possible barrage of  
revenge killings in Pristina that a NATO bombing could unleash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, we have lost a lot,'' he said. ``If NATO bombs, at  
least the Serbs will lose too.''

<HEADLINE> Greatest Y2K Danger May Be Panic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Preparation, not panic, is the way to respond  
to the Year 2000 computer problems and the relatively minor 
inconveniences they will cause, emergency experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so much disinformation and hype about Y2K,'' Mike  
Walker of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said at a House 
hearing Monday. ``But there's no need to head for the hills. The 
national structures are in good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and other emergency planning experts said that while many  
local emergency networks, such as 911 telephone emergency services 
and fire departments, need some upgrading, the more serious threat 
on Jan. 1, 2000, is that people will overreact to fears of social 
chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a vast publicity machine out there, including the  
Internet, being fed by alarmists,'' said Phyllis Mann, 
president-elect of the International Association of Emergency 
Managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Her group is recommending that people prepare just as they would  
for a storm, with food and water for about seven days. It said 
people should have a 30-day supply of medication, make copies of 
car, rent and credit card statements, have alternate lighting and 
keep a full tank of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those who will panic,'' said Rep. Jim Turner of  
Texas, the top Democrat on the Government Reform subcommittee on 
government management. He said his own father was talking about 
spending more than $2,000 for an electric generator. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., has  
been monitoring efforts by federal agencies and others to fix 
computers that, because they only read two digits for dates, might 
mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' for 1900. That could cause 
serious breakdowns in computer systems if not repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government and large industries are spending  
billions of dollars on the problem, and there is general confidence 
that on a national level, communication and power systems will be 
intact, air travel will be safe and food supplies will not be 
interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	There are more concerns about disruptions at the local level  
where communities may not have the money or expertise to deal with 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	FEMA has published a manual to help local emergency managers  
avoid Y2K problems and handle any problems that do occur. Among the 
many areas of concern cited: 911 services could go down, street 
lights and railroad crossing signals might fail, and jails or 
prisons might have problems that lead to escapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the heads of the Senate's special panel on the Y2K  
problem, Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
wrote to Vice President Al Gore asking him to take up Russia's 
serious Y2K issues when he meets this week with Russian Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian failure to address Y2K will only worsen its economic  
woes, further degrade its aging defense systems and possibly lead 
to humanitarian and environmental problems for its citizens and 
neighbors,'' they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Exchange's Main Index Tumbles / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index tumbled today  
on profit taking, losing more than half of Friday's gains. The 
dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 359.68 points,  
or 2.20 percent, closing at 16,019.10 points. On Friday, the 
average soared 660.86 points, or 4.20 percent, to an eight month 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 118.53 yen, up 1.01 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
118.11 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for a national  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices started slightly higher on buying by foreign  
brokerages but quickly fell on profit taking in reaction to 
Friday's sharp gains, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's correction was natural given the recent gains and the  
New York market's loss over the past two sessions,'' said Kunihiro 
Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 827  
million shares, down from Friday's turnover of 867 million shares. 
Declining issues outnumbered advances 727 to 502, with 97 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 6.05 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,263.71. 
The TOPIX gained 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 13.04 points  
to close at 9,890.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar's advance against the yen came in line  
with the Nikkei stock average's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we can continue to buy yen mostly depends on Japanese  
stock prices these days,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant manager 
of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the dollar was a warning against a rise in the  
Japanese currency from Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Finance 
Ministry's international bureau, and a similar remark by another 
senior ministry official, Eisuke Sakakibara, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, who had recently called for stability in the foreign  
exchange market, told reporters today that ``excessive yen strength 
is not very welcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Sakakibara said the Finance Ministry will take  
decisive steps against excessive yen strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.25 yen and 118.79 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.96 yen, up from  
128.36 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.700 percent from Friday's finish of 1.670 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.79 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Jones Industrials Fall 220 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, with the Dow  
industrials tumbling below 9,700 just days after rising above 
10,000, as investors grew uneasy about technology company earnings 
and the outlook for interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 2.2 percent, or by  
221.45, at 9,669.06 in active trading late in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose above 10,000  
several times, getting as high as 10,085.31 on Friday, only to back 
off. It never closed in five digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were falling even faster than the Dow  
on Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.6 percent 
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 2.7 percent 
in late trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates as  
AT&AMP;T Corp. launched a record $8 billion sale of corporate bonds and 
the government prepared for the sale Wednesday of $15 billion in 
two-year notes.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Sentences Salvadoran to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- A Salvadoran man who confessed to a string of  
hotel bombings has been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 
death by a Cuban tribunal, the government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Cuban law, the death sentence of Raul Ernesto Cruz Leon  
will be immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, the Communist 
Party daily Granma said in a three-paragraph story in today's 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict in the trial of a second Salvadoran charged with  
terrorism, Otto Rene Rodriguez Llerena, is pending. The prosecution 
has also recommended the death penalty in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cruz Leon's trial, prosecutors sought to show that  
leaders of the Miami-based Cuban-American National Foundation 
recruited and paid Cruz Leon to plant bombs at six tourist locales. 
The blasts killed an Italian man and injured 11 people, including 
seven foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Before closing arguments, prosecutors showed a video from a  
television interview in which a member of the Cuban exile group, 
Luis Posada Carriles, admitted Cruz Leon was contracted by members 
of the exile organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Posada Carriles originally told journalists the group  
backed Cruz Leon, he later said he had lied about the involvement 
of the foundation. He did not deny his own alleged role, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation repeatedly has denied it funded the bombings, a  
charge the Cuban government has made since it arrested Cruz Leon 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz Leon was accused of -- and admitted to -- planting bombs in  
five hotels and a restaurant in a plot to scare away tourists and 
hurt a prime source of income for the communist island. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, the prosecution showed a videotape made by the  
Interior Ministry shortly after Cruz Leon's arrest, with the 
defendant touring all the sites he bombed, showing exactly how he 
armed and planted the explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz Leon told the tribunal that his motivation had been  
financial, not political. He allegedly was paid $4,500 for each 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	If his appeal is rejected by the Supreme Court, Cruz Leon faces  
execution by firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
	In El Salvador, six Italian senators touring Latin America said  
today they will ask Cuban authorities to spare Cruz Leon's life 
when they visit Havana on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the name of the state, the government and the Senate of  
Italy, we will ask that they absolutely not apply the death 
penalty, even though an Italian died,'' Sen. Cesare Salvi told 
reporters in San Salvador. It was not known if the senators would 
meet with Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The trials of Cruz Leon and Rodriguez Llerena come amid a  
toughening stance against opponents by the Cuban government, which 
sees itself under increasing attack by the U.S. government and the 
Miami-based exile community. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 1, four Cuban dissidents were tried by a closed court  
on charges of furthering U.S. policies against the communist 
country. They were convicted and received sentences from 3 1/2 to five 
years.

<HEADLINE> Grant Hackett Breaks Swim Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISBANE, Australia (AP) -- Grant Hackett of Australia broke  
swimming's oldest men's world record on Tuesday when he bettered 
the 200-meter freestyle mark set 10 years ago by Giorgio Lamberti 
of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett was timed in 1 minute, 46.67 seconds in the first leg of  
a 4 x 200-meter relay team at Australia's national championships. 
Lamberti set his record at 1:46.69 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``My plan was just to go out as hard as I could, as long as I  
could,'' said Hackett, the world 1,500-meter champion. ``During the 
race, I said: ``I can do this. Let's just go. I know I can do 
it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hackett earlier won the individual 200-meter title.  
</P>
<P>
	He still has his 1,500-meter event on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``The 1,500 is the one I want to win,'' Hackett said. ``If I had  
to choose which one I would break a world record in, I would choose 
that one by a long way.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Expecting Big Netscape Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc. is expected to announce  
plans Wednesday to cut roughly 20 percent of Netscape's staff, or 
about 500 workers, as it absorbs the pioneering software maker 
following its $10 billion acquisition, a source close to the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen from both companies declined to comment on the  
reductions, which were at the high end of Wall Street predictions 
but in line with recent media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts in Netscape's 2,500-person work force, mainly in its  
Mountain View, Calif. headquarters, should hit such back-office 
operations as accounting but largely leave alone Netscape's coveted 
group of 550 software developers and managers, financial analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said details of  
the announcement were still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts underscore the risks in one of the software industry's  
biggest marriages, which creates a new Internet behemoth with two 
of the leading Web destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, based in Dulles, Va., is the largest online service and  
Internet access provider while Netscape's founders created the 
first widely used software for finding and retrieving information 
off the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's challenge is to cut jobs without hurting morale and  
spurring defections of the Netscape software designers it hopes to 
enlist to enhance its Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood at Netscape was uncertain but hardly dismal late  
Tuesday. Several workers, contacted by telephone, expressed 
optimism they could easily get other jobs in Silicon Valley, a 
booming engine of U.S. economic growth. Many will be able to 
exercise options to buy stock that could yield handsome profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said they might find jobs in one of the acquiring  
companies. In addition to AOL, Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of 
business computers and software, is a partner in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are three different companies involved here, and there  
is quite a good chance that one layoff at Netscape could mean a new 
job at AOL or Sun. In that case, it's not exactly a layoff,'' said 
Pierre Theveny, Netscape's information system manager in Paris. 
Theveny said he had not heard yet whether he would be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry some people have lost their jobs but I suspect these  
people will be well taken care of -- they also have stocks,'' said 
one employee who works in Netscape's electronic-commerce unit, who 
like other workers requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point is we don't need two CFOs or two general counsels or  
two heads of (human resources),'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullas Naik, an analyst with First Albany Corp., said he expected  
the companies to spare departments such as marketing because they 
target such different customers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Netscape created the tool for people to surf the Net and  
makes software for corporate computer networks, AOL supplies neatly 
organized channels of information for Internet beginners who 
otherwise might be groping their way through.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Has Two Teams in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke athletic director Joe Alleva spent most  
of Tuesday trying to solve a wonderful dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to figure out how to get from the NCAA women's semifinals  
in California on Friday, in which Duke plays Georgia, to the men's 
semifinals in Florida the next day, when Duke plays Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Most universities consider themselves lucky to make the NCAA  
tournament at all. Now, Duke has two teams in the Final Four! 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women stunned top-ranked Tennessee 69-63 on Monday  
night to earn their first Final Four berth. A day earlier, the 
top-ranked Duke men's team beat Temple 85-64 to reach its fifth 
Final Four this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	How rare is it? So rare that Georgia is the only other school to  
have both a men's and women's basketball team reach their 
respective NCAA Final Fours in the same season, accomplishing the 
feat in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Indiana did it in 1973, when the NCAA ran the men's  
tournament and the AIAW oversaw the women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Alleva, it created a coast-to-coast conundrum because he was  
unable to make connections between San Jose, Calif., and St. 
Petersburg, Fla., using commercial airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, he finally secured a private charter to take  
him, university president Nan Keohane and faculty representative 
Kathleen Smith on the ambitious journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm going to have to do a lot of sleeping on planes  
and get some books,'' Alleva said. ``But there was no doubt we were 
going to do this. You don't get this unique an opportunity very 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's double the frenzy.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday morning, the Blue Devils' ticket office opened 15  
phone lines and still was unable to field every call, assistant 
ticket manager Bobby Sorrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school received 3,500 tickets for the men's event and 700  
for the women's event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mission impossible around here because we have about the  
smallest athletic department in the country and here we are, with 
two teams in the Final Four,'' Sorrell said. ``That's OK. I'd take 
this problem every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's notoriously rowdy student body remained subdued, however.  
Neither victory ignited the traditionally raucous celebrations that 
feature towering bonfires at the center of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a very practical reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're saving our energy and conserving wood,'' said Charles  
Ellis, a senior from River Vale, N.J. ``The best is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students say the women's trip through the NCAA tournament  
has been more exciting than the men's because expectations were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like the women are David and the men are  
Goliath,'' said Michael Dobbyn, a senior from Canton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone follows the men and going to men's games is  
amazing,'' Ellis said. ``It adds so much to the semester. The women 
have almost kind of sneaked up on us. All of a sudden, it's like 
`Wow! They beat Tennessee and now they're in the Final Four, 
too.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women have never been to a Final Four before. But coach  
Gail Goestenkors won't have to go far to find out what it's like. 
Coach Mike Krzyzewski's office is just two doors down a 
blue-carpeted hallway in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, whose top-ranked men cruised to their fifth Final  
Four of the decade with a 85-64 win over Temple on Sunday, was one 
of the first to congratulate Goestenkors when she showed up for 
work Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He watched the game last night and you could see the joy on  
his face. It was genuine,'' said Goestenkors, who's completing her 
seventh season at Duke. ``We're going to talk more later. I want 
his advice because he's been there and this is new to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers flooded Goestenkors' office on Tuesday but by 8 a.m.,  
she was breaking down film of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm already in that mode where you've got to get ready for the  
next game,'' Goestenkors said. ``He (Krzyzewski) came in and said, 
`Take at least this morning and this afternoon and just enjoy this. 
Appreciate this and then go ahead and prepare. But you need to 
enjoy and allow your team to enjoy this moment.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski and Goestenkors have forged a strong working  
relationship that goes back to her hiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said when I first came here, `I don't want Duke men's  
basketball to be the only winner here, I want people to think about 
Duke basketball as a winner,''' Goestenkors said. ``I wanted to 
know that's what they wanted. I felt that if the men's program 
could do it here, the women's program could do it here. That's what 
we're on the verge of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But wait a minute. What if the women win and the men lose?  
</P>
<P>
	``People here get emotionally involved with the men's team,  
whereas the women's team is just starting to peak everyone's 
interest,'' Dobbyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the men don't win it and the women do, it would be pretty  
somber around here and that's too bad,'' he said. ``But the 
prevailing attitude would be disappointment for the men not winning 
it rather than excitement for the women winning it.''

<HEADLINE> Plastic Lumber Made in Oregon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- In the shadow of the last sawmill still  
operating in this depressed timber town, Werner Zink grinds up old 
mop buckets and shampoo bottles to produce what's known as plastic 
lumber. 
</P>
<P>
	With the decline of an economy long built on forests and fishing  
along the southern Oregon coast, the former machine shop operator 
decided not to bail out like so many others, but to try something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're slowly creeping up on the wood guys,'' Zink said,  
showing off the machinery he designed to wash, grind and mix 
recycled plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink's company, Resco Plastics, stands as a symbol of what can  
rise from the rubble of a dying industry. In fact, the factory is 
built on the site of a former shingle mill. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an outstanding example of what the rest of us have to  
do, and that is diversify,'' said Loran Wiese, director of economic 
development for Coos County. 
</P>
<P>
	For as long as anyone can remember, timber and fishing were the  
lifeblood of the southern Oregon coast. Anyone graduating from high 
school could expect to find a job in the many lumber and plywood 
mills. Those of a more independent mind could buy a one-man boat 
and troll for salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	But the timber boom times came to an end in the late 1980s as  
biologists began to understand that treating forests like tree 
farms destroyed habitat for the threatened northern spotted owl and 
salmon. Increased Canadian imports and growing competition from 
southeastern pine filled the gap, keeping prices low. 
</P>
<P>
	The mills that everyone took for granted closed down. Salmon  
seasons were steadily shortened, until most trollers gave up trying 
to make a living. About 6,000 people left Coos County in search of 
jobs. Their places were taken by retirees attracted by the mild 
weather, scenic beaches and nearby forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment has settled in around 10 percent, the highest in  
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Coos Bay is working hard to bring in a natural gas line and more  
electrical capacity to woo a steel mill, but innovative operations 
like Resco Plastics are seen as an important part of the economic 
mix for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Munich, Germany, who studied music in college and  
plays blues guitar, Zink and his wife, Sabine, fell in love with 
the West Coast while on vacation. They had started a machine shop 
that produced specialty parts for loggers and fishermen. When the 
bottom fell out of those industries, they had to find something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	Zink's first steps toward producing plastic lumber came 10 years  
ago with his invention of machinery to clean off glue and labels on 
recycled plastic, such as milk jugs, plastic barrels and shampoo 
bottles. He produced raw material for other manufacturers who made 
pipe and other materials. 
</P>
<P>
	As timber prices rose, plastic lumber producers have been  
springing up around the country. Plastics News lists 40 
manufacturers from Hawaii to Florida, and U.S. Plastics Lumber in 
Boca Raton, Fla., claims to be the biggest, with 16 subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Zink decided to give it a try.  
</P>
<P>
	He makes dimension lumber from 2-by-4s to 12-by-12s, as well as  
specialty pieces, such as mailbox posts, bench frames, and posts 
with a pipe inside that campgrounds use for water spigots. Zink has 
been experimenting with milling the finished lumber to make 
tongue-and-groove decking. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed out of a 150-horsepower extruder at 10,000 pounds  
pressure into a steel mold, the lumber comes in such colors as 
brown, gray and blue, with a wood-like grain. 
</P>
<P>
	Though plastic lumber has good compression strength, it is too  
floppy on a span to frame a house, and expands and contracts too 
much with temperature changes to be used for railroad ties. But it 
is finding growing acceptance for decking. 
</P>
<P>

	Dow Closes Down 218.68 Points  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, with the Dow Jones  
industrials tumbling toward 9,600 just days after rising above 
10,000, as investors grew uneasy about technology company profits 
and the outlook for interest rates. The Dow average fell 2.2 
percent, or by 218.68 points, to close at 9,671.83. It was the 11th 
biggest point drop ever for the Dow, but was not close to a record 
in terms of a percentage decline. At one point in the final 
half-hour of trading, the Dow was down 257.80 at 9,632.71. Just 
last week, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose above 10,000 
several times, getting as high as 10,085.31 on Friday, only to back 
off. It never closed in five digits. Broader stock indicators fell 
even faster than the Dow today. The Nasdaq composite index with its 
many technology stocks was off 73.10 at 2,322.68.

	Anti-Money Laundering Rules Dropped  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banking regulators, responding to a public  
outcry over privacy concerns, today scrapped proposed anti-money 
laundering rules that would have tracked the transaction patterns 
of bank customers. The ``Know Your Customer'' rules were put out 
for public comment in December by four federal banking agencies. 
Since then, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alone has received 
some 225,000 e-mail messages and letters, nearly all opposing the 
rules. Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and 
the nation's bankers have complained that the rules would turn 
every bank teller into a spy for Big Brother and that were 
unconstitutional.

	FCC Sets 'Dialing Parity' Deadline

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators set deadlines today for  
implementing rules that would let local telephone customers dial 
the same number of digits for toll calls no matter who their phone 
company is. The Federal Communications Commission said local 
telephone companies with plans to provide ``dialing parity'' that 
have been approved by the states they serve must provide that 
parity by May 7. Companies that haven't filed dialing parity plans 
with state regulators must do so by April 22, the FCC said, adding 
that states will have until June 22 to act on the plans and 
companies will have 30 days after that to implement them.

	Bill Will Help Y2K-Hit Businesses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Small businesses trying to cope with the Year  
2000 computer problem will have access to a new loan program under 
legislation passed by the House today and sent to the White House. 
The bill, passed by voice vote, authorizes the Small Business 
Administration to set up a program guaranteeing loans for small 
businesses trying to either fix their computers or deal with the 
economic losses resulting from their own or supplier computer 
breakdowns. The Senate this month voted 99-0 in favor of the 
measure.

	NJ Seeks To Recover From Y2K Glitch  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Y2K computer glitch gave New Jersey  
welfare recipients millions of dollars in food assistance nearly 
two weeks early. It's the so-called millennium bug's most 
widespread effect on the public so far, one expert said. The error 
affecting 194,000 recipients was introduced Sunday during a test to 
determine whether a state welfare computer was protected from the 
problem involving how some computers read dates, said Ed Rogan, a 
spokesman for the state Department of Human Services. The error 
``made the benefits available as of April 1, 1990, instead of April 
1, 1999,'' making next month's benefits available immediately, 
Rogan said.

	'Virtual Casinos' Ban Is Supported

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of the effort to ban ``virtual  
casinos'' on the Internet contended today that online gambling, if 
left unchecked, is headed for explosive growth. Arizona Sen. Jon 
Kyl, sponsor of a ban that passed the Senate but not the House last 
year, is proposing a modified version that would eliminate one of 
the more controversial provisions of last year's bill -- criminal 
penalties for individuals who place bets via computer. The revised 
bill would also clarify that federal law will not criminalize 
sports ``fantasy'' leagues that are already legal in states and it 
would address concerns of Internet providers, who may be called 
upon to block access to gambling sites.

	OPEC Agrees on Oil Production Cuts  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today on a plan to  
cut crude oil production by 2.104 million barrels a day and to 
maintain the lower levels of output for a full year beginning April 
1. The group of 11 petroleum exporting countries detailed the plan 
in a communique. Non-OPEC producers will also take part in the plan 
aimed at ending a global oil glut and strengthening prices that 
languished at a 12-year low as recently as December. If the 
participating nations fully comply with the agreement, the supply 
of oil on world markets would be reduced by about 2.6 percent.

	Rudder Panel Studied in USAir Crash  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Government investigators used computer  
simulations and dry investigative analysis today to argue that 
unexpected reversals in the rudders on three Boeing 737s caused a 
pair of airline crashes and nearly caused a third. The findings 
were presented during a National Transportation Safety Board 
hearing into the cause of the September 1994 crash of USAir Flight 
427 outside Pittsburgh that killed all 132 on board. Not only may 
they explain that crash, but also the 1991 crash of United Airlines 
Flight 585 outside Colorado Springs, Colo., that killed all 25 
aboard, and a 1996 incident in which the pilots of an Eastwind 
Airlines 737 briefly lost control of their aircraft as they 
approached Richmond, Va.

	NTSB Wants Better 'Black Boxes'  
</P>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Amid questions about what caused USAir  
Flight 427 to crash in 1994, there was one certainty among members 
of the National Transportation Safety Board as they discussed the 
accident today. Again and again they said the accident should have 
spurred the Federal Aviation Administration to order an immediate 
upgrade in the flight-data recorders used on commercial airplanes. 
The Boeing 737, which spiraled into a ravine outside Pittsburgh, 
killing all 132 people aboard, had a primitive recorder that 
documented only 11 pieces of flight information.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department today took the  
first step toward suspending the operating certificate of Kiwi 
International Air Lines because of the deepening financial 
difficulties of the small, discount carrier. The department said it 
was no longer confident Kiwi's management could effectively direct 
the carrier's operations. A final decision on whether to ground the 
airline could come after three weeks. Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater said a primary concern is to prevent potential harm 
and inconvenience to consumers.

	Bowater To Cut Some Paper Output

	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Bowater Inc., the world's second-largest  
newsprint producer, plans to cut production at paper mills in Maine 
and New Brunswick, Canada, next month by about 25,000 metric tons. 
The production cut was made to correct an order imbalance, a 
company spokeswoman said. Most of the cutbacks will be in 
newsprint, although some other papers also will be affected, the 
company said. Bowater previously announced a reduction of about 
35,000 metric tons at its Quebec plant.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Y2K computer glitch gave New Jersey  
welfare recipients millions of dollars in food assistance nearly 
two weeks early. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the so-called millennium bug's most widespread effect on  
the public so far, one expert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The error affecting 194,000 recipients was introduced Sunday  
during a test to determine whether a state welfare computer was 
protected from the problem involving how some computers read dates, 
said Ed Rogan, a spokesman for the state Department of Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The error ``made the benefits available as of April 1, 1990,  
instead of April 1, 1999,'' making next month's benefits available 
immediately, Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most New Jersey welfare recipients carry benefits cards that  
work like bank debit cards, so they quickly learned when making 
purchases that their accounts had grown unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
	Some called the state to report the error, but others crowded  
grocery stores to take advantage of the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
	All accounts were fixed by Monday afternoon, Rogan said.  
</P>
<P>
	The error was introduced when the computer was adjusted two  
weeks ago to cope with the change to the year 2000. On Sunday, the 
computer didn't fill in the year when new information was entered. 
State officials said a worker then tried to fix the omission by 
typing in ``1999'' but left off the final ``9'' -- and the computer 
assumed the blank should be a zero. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was somebody who was well-intentioned, trying to help  
things flow,'' said David C. Heins, director of the state's 
Division of Family Development. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as $58 million may have been involved.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard Rubin, a Hunter College professor familiar with Y2K  
problems, called it the ``biggest visible occurrence of Y2K impact 
on the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State officials still must decide what to do about welfare  
recipients who cashed in and used their benefits 1 1/2 weeks early. 
</P>
<P>
	Heins warned that recipients might have to make the early  
benefits last to the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee there is going to be any extra  
assistance in the event that they consumed all their food stamps 
early,'' Heins said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his agency would have to see how many people used up  
their benefits, and consult with federal officials, before deciding 
what to do about families that run short.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Unlikely To Join 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-time Democratic presidential candidate  
Jesse Jackson is signaling that he will not make a bid for the 
White House in 2000, a decision he is expected to announce 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and his wife, Jacqueline, have told associates in recent  
days that he will not seek the presidency this time around. Barring 
a sudden change of mind, he will announce that decision to 
supporters in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	On Black Entertainment Television's ``Lead Story'' over the  
weekend, Jackson said about the idea of seeking the Democratic 
nomination that he was ``not very motivated to at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While I have not decided altogether to say yes or no, I'm  
inclined not to,'' Jackson said on the program Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited his campaign to pressure Wall Street into providing  
more start-up capital to minorities as one way he might be able to 
do more good outside a race for office. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Tuesday, Jackson said, ``You  
can rest assured that tomorrow we will share with you what we 
intend to do and how. ... We intend to impact public policy in a 
major way in 1999 and 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former advisers said if he were to run it would be  
with the goal of winning the nomination and not merely to ensure 
discussion of issues he cares about. He is said to be concerned 
that the newly condensed primary season, which requires candidates 
to raise greater amounts of money sooner, could inhibit his ability 
to be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Jackson has not begun building the kind of  
organization needed to mount a serious presidential run, nor has he 
begun raising money for a bid, people close to him said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is to disclose his intentions Wednesday on the campaign  
Web site of his son Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Jackson has strongly advocated his father joining  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, his father's announcement would bring attention to  
the Internet site and raise the profile of what for Jackson Jr. is 
the beginning of an ambitious effort to build a grass-roots 
political organization to rival the political power of the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
	If Jackson bows out, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey  
would remain Vice President Al Gore's only declared competitor so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent Democrats who have opted out are Sens. Paul  
Wellstone of Minnesota, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Bob Kerrey 
of Nebraska and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's first White House bid in 1984 was followed by a second  
populist race in 1988. Nearly every presidential election season 
since has seen him at least contemplate a rerun. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old Jackson, who calls both Chicago and Washington  
home, has never held public office but remains one of the country's 
best-known black political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded Operation PUSH in 1971, and still runs the now-merged  
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a Chicago-based non-profit organization 
seeking economic and political empowerment for minorities. Jackson 
also is the author of two books, the host of the CNN talk show 
``Both Sides with Jesse Jackson'' and President Clinton's envoy for 
democracy in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this decade, Jackson was the District of Columbia's  
``shadow senator,'' advocating for statehood and voting 
representation in Congress for the nation's capital city.

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Clinton Was Truthful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Ending her silence under oath, Susan  
McDougal said today that President Clinton's testimony at her fraud 
trial was truthful and she never discussed a fraudulent $300,000 
loan with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, who refused to answer the same questions before a  
federal grand jury investigating Whitewater, took the stand in her 
own defense against charges of criminal contempt and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Mark Geragos, led her through a series of questions  
that Mrs. McDougal refused to answer on two occasions in 1996 and 
again in April 1998, when Kenneth Starr's prosecutors brought her 
before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Clinton truthful in his videotaped testimony for her 1996  
fraud trial? Geragos asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he said was untrue to me,'' replied Mrs. McDougal, who  
was convicted of fraud. ``As I sat there that day, I did not hear 
anything untruthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late husband, James, were partners with  
the Clintons in the Whitewater land development in Arkansas before 
Clinton was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes into her testimony, Mrs. McDougal began crying as  
she recalled her first real estate development project with her 
former husband. ``Talking about Jim is very hard for me. He died 
recently,'' she said, wiping away tears. Her ex-husband died in 
prison in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said she ``never discussed'' with Clinton the  
fraudulent loan in her name. Another Whitewater witness, David 
Hale, testified that Clinton had pressured him to make that loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing nervous at times, Mrs. McDougal was also asked whether  
Clinton knew about her Lorance Heights real estate development 
south of Little Rock, another business deal under investigation by 
prosecutors following the Whitewater paper trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have in a social sense told him I was working out  
there. But certainly I never discussed any substantial thing about 
Lorance Heights with Bill Clinton,'' Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	When she first took the stand, Geragos reminded jurors that Mrs.  
McDougal did not have to testify at her own trial. ``You understand 
better than anybody that you have a right not to testify,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that, yes,'' answered Mrs. McDougal, who  
frequently pushed her long hair back as she talked. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Monday, Geragos won a skirmish over whether the judge  
would allow defense witness Steve Smith to say whether he believed 
Starr's prosecutors were seeking the truth in using him in their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to a conspiracy charge in the  
Whitewater investigation in exchange for his testimony, was allowed 
to answer the question after the prosecution grilled him about his 
knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the jurors, ``I think they were seeking truthful  
information that would conform with their theory of the case. They 
sort of had a story line about what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A communications professor at the University of Arkansas at  
Fayetteville, Smith said Starr's deputies would listen if he had 
some information that conformed with their thinking but they 
weren't interested if his information didn't fit their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said the government  
may call former Associate Independent Counsel Amy St. Eve to rebut 
testimony from Smith that St. Eve handed him a ``script'' to read 
to grand jurors. Smith said portions of the statement were 
inaccurate and that he feared a perjury charge if he read it as is. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith testified that he read the statement after he and St. Eve  
made changes to it. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, defense witness Richard Holiman said he  
believed that calling Bill and David Henley, Mrs. McDougal's 
brothers, before the grand jury was a way to pressure Mrs. McDougal 
into testifying after her May 1996 Whitewater fraud conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Holiman, who represented David Henley, said his client had no  
new information after appearing before the panel once before. He 
said that giving the Henleys subpoenas was meant to send a message 
to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Associate Independent Counsel Julie Myers said in  
questioning Holiman that David Henley had only been asked about one 
topic in his first visit with the panel.

<HEADLINE> Devils Get Nemchinov From Islanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils acquired  
center Sergei Nemchinov from the New York Islanders on Tuesday in 
exchange for a fourth-round 1999 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old Nemchinov had eight goals and eight assists and  
22 penalty minutes in 67 games for the Islanders this season. New 
York signed the eight-year veteran on July 2, 1997, after he played 
six games of the 1996-97 season with Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks acquired Nemchinov from the New York Rangers, where  
he played for the first six years of his NHL career. The Moscow 
native also played 10 years in the Russian League. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot, 200-pound Nemchinov has career totals of 125 goals  
and 150 assists for 275 points and 201 penalty minutes in 565 NHL 
games. He has scored at least 20 goals in a season three times, 
including a career-high 30 in 1991-92. He also posted 28 assists 
that year for a career-high 58 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He has appeared in 52 postseason games, with seven goals and 15  
assists for 22 points and 18 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sergei Nemchinov is a proven veteran who can play all three  
forward positions,'' said Devils president and general manager Lou 
Lamoriello. ``He is familiar with the Eastern Conference and has 
been a member of a Stanley Cup winner. We are confident he will fit 
in well with our organization.''

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The trial of former Deputy Prime  
Minister Anwar Ibrahim came to a bitter close today as defense 
lawyers refused to make closing arguments before a judge they 
accused of bias. The judge in turn threatened them with contempt of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	A verdict on four charges in the sensational sex and corruption  
trial will be given April 6, Judge Augustine Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, who was ousted and jailed in September, has insisted that  
the 10 charges against him were trumped up as part of a political 
vendetta aimed at removing him as a rival to Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul, who sits as sole judge and juror, has repeatedly  
prevented Anwar's lawyers from presenting evidence they say proves 
a conspiracy of high-level government and police officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar's lawyers refused today to make their closing arguments  
until their motion was heard calling for Paul to step down from the 
case on grounds he was prejudiced against Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul, refusing to hear the motion, said he would start contempt  
proceedings against the nine-member defense team for insulting the 
court by refusing to make arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the defense chooses not to submit, it is entirely up to  
them. This places an extra burden on me to make sure justice is 
done,'' Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, in light of the defense refusal to make a closing  
statement, simply urged Paul to find Anwar guilty. ``The 
prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt,'' Attorney 
General Mohtar Abdullah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was angered that Paul refused to hear his motion, filed  
last week. Paul said the defense should have taken their complaint 
to the country's chief justice and not ask him to adjudicate on 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very unfortunate for the judicial system in this  
country. It is tragic,'' Anwar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 after leading a massive  
demonstration against Mahathir in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. That 
night, a blindfolded and handcuffed Anwar was beaten so badly by 
the country's top police officer that doctors later said he could 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor resigned and later  
admitted that he had led the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	In this trial, Anwar faces four charges of abusing his position  
for allegedly using police to intimidate people who had claimed to 
engaging in sodomy and adultery with Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	Each charge carries 14 years in jail and a $5,000 fine, and a  
conviction would also bar Anwar from entering politics for five 
years. He still faces another corruption charge and five counts of 
sodomy, which is illegal in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar's lawyers argued in their motion against Paul that a  
half-dozen witnesses, some of whom have served jail terms for 
allegedly having homosexual relations with Anwar, were tortured and 
coerced by police to fabricate stories against the jailed 
politician.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Group Chides Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A watchdog organization financed partly by  
Microsoft Corp. to monitor how Internet sites protect consumer 
privacy has decided not to audit the company, one of its biggest 
benefactors, over a controversial glitch in its software. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E of Palo Alto, Calif., instead chided Microsoft over its  
use of an identifying number that could be used to trace the 
authors of some electronic documents even when they want to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said Microsoft's uses of the number ``compromise  
consumer trust and privacy.'' But Trust-E said it will take no 
further action as an online guardian because the dispute involved 
Microsoft's commercial software, not the company's Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics pressing for new federal privacy laws said Trust-E's  
awkward role of being asked to investigate one of its biggest 
donors illustrates the risks of letting the industry regulate its 
own behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has consistently urged the Internet industry to  
find ways to police itself or face possible new privacy legislation 
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really undercuts the whole administration's claim that  
self-regulation works,'' said David Banisar, a staff lawyer at the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ``This was the 
big one. This was Microsoft, the major computer company in the 
United States. And they just missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E receives $100,000 annually each from Microsoft and nine  
other sponsors. It agrees to regulate Internet privacy policies for 
about 500 companies in exchange for a fee and a seal of approval 
for their Web sites to reassure online customers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trust-E said a bug in Microsoft's Windows 98 software that  
permitted the company to harvest identifying numbers did not 
violate privacy promises it made with Trust-E over its Internet 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``When consumers go to a company and see a statement of a  
privacy policy, they expect that will deal with their data for that 
company regardless of whether it's on the Web,'' complained Deirdre 
Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet 
civil liberties group. ``Is there a self-regulatory remedy that 
gets to problems not at the Web site?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E could have denied Microsoft use of its seal of approval.  
</P>
<P>
	``We followed our methodology when we deal with any consumer  
dispute,'' said Susan Scott, the group's executive director. ``We 
did not treat Microsoft any differently than any of our other 
licensees we have received complaints on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett, who filed the complaint, said he never seriously  
expected Trust-E to investigate Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believing in self-regulatory seal programs is like dealing  
with a shady insurance company,'' said Catlett, who runs 
Junkbusters Corp., a privacy group. ``The policy looks impressively 
long, but when something goes wrong, they point to a piece of 
fine-print legalese and you're left with zip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed earlier this month that its latest version  
of Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer. That 
number partly is planted within some documents created with its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company acknowledged it may have been collecting  
those serial numbers from customers -- along with names and 
addresses -- even when customers explicitly had indicated they did 
not want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denied it ever used the serial number together with  
its customer lists to track documents. But privacy groups 
complained that it made it technically possible for the company to 
trace documents to a specific computer even when an author wished 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has promised to purge any identifying numbers it may  
have collected inadvertently, and it is offering two free software 
programs on its Internet site to strip out the numbers.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Better 'Black Boxes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Amid questions about what caused USAir  
Flight 427 to crash in 1994, there was one certainty among members 
of the National Transportation Safety Board as they discussed the 
accident Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again they said the accident should have spurred the  
Federal Aviation Administration to order an immediate upgrade in 
the flight-data recorders used on commercial airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing 737, which spiraled into a ravine outside Pittsburgh,  
killing all 132 people aboard, had a primitive recorder that 
documented only 11 pieces of flight information. 
</P>
<P>
	Stymied by a lack of information about the position of the  
plane's flight control surfaces, including its rudder panel, the 
safety board in 1995 recommended an immediate upgrade in 737 
recorders. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said the recorders should keep track of more  
information, including the position of the flight control panels 
and the pilot commands to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the FAA gave airlines until 2001 to install recorders  
documenting at least 18 parameters -- including those requested by 
the board -- in all U.S. commercial airliners, not just 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave airlines four years to accomplish this complex task,''  
FAA Administrator Jane Garvey said in a statement issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members and their staff criticized that decision, saying  
it may have deprived them of the chance to figure out an incident 
last month in which a MetroJet 737 started to roll over -- like the 
USAir plane. The recorder on the MetroJet plane had yet to be 
upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are any failure modes that we still do not  
understand, then the best way to be sure we are on top of that 
situation is to have these recorders in place, so that through 
incidents, and incident investigation, we can prevent any future 
accidents,'' said board Chairman Jim Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff noted that Southwest Airlines, a discount carrier with  
737s comprising its entire 230-plane fleet, has voluntarily 
accelerated the upgrade to near completion despite a cost of 
$70,000 per airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a small, small investment,'' Hall said. ``It is just  
impossible to understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remark generated applause from the 100 relatives of the  
Flight 427 victims attending the board meeting, the only such 
outburst from them all day.

<HEADLINE> Reds Sign Baerga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Carlos Baerga agreed to a nonguaranteed  
minor-league contract Tuesday with the Cincinnati Reds, the second 
baseman's latest stop in his slide from prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga, 30, was waived by the St. Louis Cardinals on March 17,  
leaving him to scrounge for a job in baseball. The three-time 
All-Star with the Cleveland Indians won't have a chance to make the 
Reds' opening day roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds also optioned pitcher Manuel Barrios to Triple-A  
Indianapolis on Tuesday and reassigned outfielder Damon Hollins and 
pitcher Mark Thompson to their minor-league camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga will join the Reds on Wednesday at their training complex  
in Sarasota, where a trainer will try to get him in shape. He's had 
weight problems the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in bad shape,'' general manager Jim Bowden said. ``That's  
why he was released by the Cardinals. He's not in shape at all. 
He's going to start the year at Indianapolis and we're going to try 
to get him in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a young player. Only a few years ago, he was  
driving in 100 runs a year for Cleveland, so we're going to give it 
an effort. It's a no-risk gamble from our perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baerga has not hit .300 since 1995, when he helped the Indians  
reach the World Series for the first time in 41 years. The Indians 
traded him to the New York Mets in 1996, and he finished off a 
six-year, $21.4 million contract with the Mets last year by hitting 
.266 in 147 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His steadily declining productivity left him a free agent and  
dramatically reduced his earning power. He agreed to a 
nonguaranteed, one-year contract with St. Louis that could have 
paid him $1.25 million if he made the club. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals were looking for someone to help replace second  
baseman Delino DeSheilds, whom they lost to free agency. Baerga 
went 2-for-15 in six spring training games for the Cardinals, who 
chose to waive him last week rather than keep him on the opening 
day roster at full salary. 
</P>
<P>
	When they got rid of him, the Cardinals had to pay only 30 days'  
termination pay, amounting to $163,934. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a situation where at some point if we get him in shape,  
he might make the major league club,'' Bowden said. ``If not, he 
also might be a player we could trade down the road for a younger 
player.''

<HEADLINE> Greenhouse Credits Now Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While no big fan of the Kyoto climate treaty,  
the DuPont Co., says it is on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions 
nearly in half by next year. But will the chemical maker get credit 
for the reductions if the treaty ever is ratified? 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate bill would guarantee that companies like DuPont would  
get credit for making voluntary reductions in climate-changing 
emissions if the treaty goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the legislation, which has bipartisan support, was  
viewed a few months ago as a shoo-in for passage, many 
environmentalists are having second thoughts. And much of the 
business community is shying away because companies fear support 
would mark them as being in favor of international accord on 
climate change reached at Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year a growing number of Fortune 500 companies,  
including DuPont, United Technologies, BP-Amoco and utilities such 
as American Electric Power have made commitments to voluntarily 
curtail the greenhouse emissions they produce -- mainly by increased 
efficiencies that reduce energy use and, in turn curtail carbon 
dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which requires greenhouse gas  
reductions, nowhere close to being ratified, these companies worry 
that by making early reductions they may, in fact, eventually be 
put at a competitive disadvantage. Companies that took no voluntary 
action would be able to start at a higher benchmark if the treaty 
is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``The least our government can do is to protect those companies  
who have decided on their own to make voluntary contributions to 
the general goal of climate mitigation,'' says Sen. John Chafee, 
R-R.I., a co-sponsor of the bill, which was being discussed at a 
Senate hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, when a similar bill was introduced,  
environmental groups across the spectrum lauded the initiative, 
which at that time was led by Sens. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and 
Connie Mack, R-Fla., as a sign of Congress would take some action 
on climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Early action credit would spur companies to address climate  
change without the Kyoto treaty actually in force, the sponsors 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, more than a half dozen environmental groups  
including the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, 
Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for International 
Environmental Law have voiced opposition to the bill. For different 
reasons, business groups representing utilities, the petroleum 
industry, manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce have refused to 
endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not supporting it,'' says John Novak, director of  
environmental activities for the Edison Electric Institute, 
although its members, the nation's electric utilities, have claimed 
to have prevented the release of millions of tons of greenhouse 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry sources say that behind the business community's  
opposition is a fear by companies that the bill is another step 
toward ``backdoor implementation'' of the Kyoto treaty already 
signed by Clinton but facing strong opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman views the early-credit legislation as an attempt to  
unite ``both sides of the global warming wars'' and spur companies 
to take voluntary actions on climate change that they otherwise 
might not. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Claussen, executive director of the Pew Center on Global  
Climate Change, says assurances are needed for companies to commit 
to greenhouse gas reductions, or else these same companies may end 
up at a disadvantage competitively when a treaty is put in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clearly not in our interest for companies that do the  
right thing by voluntarily attempting to slow the rate of 
greenhouse gases entering our atmosphere to be penalized and 
economically harmed for their efforts,'' says Claussen, whose group 
includes 22 major corporations that have pledged voluntary actions 
on climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense  
Fund, is among the legislation's strongest boosters, although he 
says the bill must require that emissions reductions be 
independently verified before credits are given to a company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of getting the process started,'' said Krupp, who  
acknowledged that many of his colleagues in the environmental 
community have withdrawn their support. 
</P>
<P>
	Many environmentalists argue that it would allow companies to  
use unproven emission reductions to gain credits that eventually 
could be worth millions of dollars in an emissions trading market.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian Pavlovcic Wins Men's GS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- A Slovenian one race away from retirement  
was the fastest men's giant slalom skier in the U.S. National 
Championships on Tuesday. The second-fastest was a developmental 
team skier who has never raced on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of a day at Park City Mountain Resort, as the  
United States' best and brightest were outshone by 27-year-old Uros 
Pavlovcic, who had planned to quit ski racing after the event. Now 
he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I would win, because the United States has a  
very strong team,'' Pavlovcic said, a bit charitably given 
America's recent international record. ``But I knew I could beat 
some of them. ... Now I don't know if it's time to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A more familiar script was followed at Snowbasin Ski Resort,  
where Katie Monahan cemented her status as the nation's top women's 
super-G skier by winning her first national title in the 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavlovcic spent the winter skiing for Sierra Nevada College in  
the Lake Tahoe area, where he won every technical race he entered 
last season in the USCSA, a league one step below the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his college eligibility is up, he will be able to keep the  
first-prize money from his victory. A dispute with the Slovenian 
national team has kept him out of international competition in 
recent years, and he said this victory likely won't change things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skied the last two U.S. Championships, so this is a nice way  
to finish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavlovcic was followed by Andrew Martin, a developmental team  
member who is a familiar face on the Nor-Am circuit but has yet to 
make the national team. Martin used a blistering second run to 
finish in 1 minute, 59.99 seconds, behind only Pavlovcic's 1:59.59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've skied against (the national team) lots of times, and I  
knew I could beat these guys, but this is the first time I've done 
it in competition,'' he said. ``This tells me that I can ski at the 
next level. Hopefully I'll get a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin raced with the U.S. development team in Europe during  
January and February, ``and I came home broke. Even last week, I 
wasn't sure if I'd be out here. But I took a loan on my life 
insurance, and a couple of grants came through, so ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the first run, national team member Thomas Vonn  
slipped midway through the second run and finished third at 
2:00.11. Pre-race favorite Bode Miller, the defending champion, was 
fourth, followed by Dane Spencer and Chad Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's super-G, Monahan, of Aspen, Colo., closed her  
breakout season with a race time of 1:15.05, easily outdistancing 
Megan Gerety's 1:15.48. 
</P>
<P>
	After a miserable day of snow conditions on the same course  
during Monday's men's super-G, workers produced a 
faster-than-expected course for the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course workers did a great job, and it helped me because  
it was more my type of course,'' Monahan said. ``Basically, the 
course was edge-to-edge, turn-to-turn the whole way down, and I 
think it turned out to be a little faster than anyone anticipated 
... which was good for me, because I'm more experienced in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan had her first World Cup top-20 and top-10 finishes this  
season, highlighted by an eighth-place finish at Mammoth Mountain, 
Calif. She closed the World Cup schedule two weeks ago with a 
third-place finish and her first podium in SG at St. Moritz, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	After fifth-place finishes in the downhill and giant slalom  
races earlier in the competition, Monahan also has emerged as the 
favorite to take the combined title. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerety and Kjersti Bjorn-Roli, both Alaska natives who have  
battled knee problems, joined Monahan on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knees are pretty sore right now, so I can't really risk  
anything,'' Gerety said. ``It wasn't like I was really looking for 
speed too much. (I) just tried to make it down in one piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark, the national downhill champion, was fourth and  
Megan Ganong fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships conclude on Wednesday with the men's  
and women's slaloms at Deer Valley.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Jones Industrials Fall 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, with the Dow  
industrials briefly sliding more than 200 points, as investors grew 
uneasy about technology company earnings and the outlook for 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.9 percent, or by  
189.26, at 9,701.25 in active trading Tuesday afternoon. At one 
point, the Dow was down by 205.91 and below 9,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose above  
10,000 several times, getting as high as 10,085.31 on Friday, only 
to back off before its first close in five digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were falling even faster than the Dow  
on Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.5 percent 
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 2.7 percent 
in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates as  
AT&AMP;T Corp. launched a record $8 billion sale of corporate bonds and 
the government prepared for the sale Wednesday of $15 billion in 
two-year notes.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen's Passat Takes Top Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST HADDAM, Conn. (AP) -- Move over Camry. You've just been  
passed by Passat. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen's midsized model took over the top spot in Consumer  
Reports magazine's widely watched annual ranking of family sedans 
released Tuesday, the first time in 16 years that a Toyota has not 
topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The top ranking was a sign that Volkswagen is building on the  
success of its new Beetle model to shake off years of dismal auto 
sales in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the Passat was just as significant a car as the new  
Beetle for us, because it proves that Volkswagen can compete in 
that midsized family car market,'' VW spokesman Tony Fouladpour 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the magazine's top picks among 1999 models in other  
categories: Mazda's Protege for small sedans, Subaru's Forester for 
small sport utility vehicles, Lexus' RX300 for large SUVs, Toyota's 
Sienna for minivans, Ford's F-150 pickup, and Mazda's MX-5 Miata 
for ``driving fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top luxury car, the Mercedes-Benz E320, is the  
highest-scoring vehicle Consumer Reports has ever tested, with high 
marks for precise handling, smooth ride and brisk acceleration. But 
its list price of about $47,000 -- above most Americans' annual 
salaries -- remains out of reach for most consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the Passat lists for a much-more competitive  
$23,000. 
</P>
<P>
	VW had trouble competing at all in the United States in the  
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993 VW sold fewer than 50,000 cars in the United States,  
fewer than any year since 1956. Analysts speculated that the 
company might abandon U.S. sales entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	But the numbers have been building since then. Last year the  
automaker sold 219,679 cars here, making 1998 the company's best 
year since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	The Passat, which took off after being completely redesigned for  
the fall of 1997, helped make that happen. VW sold nearly 40,000 
Passats last year, an increase of 164 percent over 1997. The 1990 
model year Passat was the first sold in the United States, although 
the car bears little resemblance to models after model year 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The reintroduction of the Beetle, expected to spur backlogs for  
months following its well-received introduction, has helped propel 
the company further forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The Passat actually outperformed the Camry in Consumer Reports'  
testing for its 1998 auto edition, but the magazine declined to 
give it the top ranking then because testers at the magazine's 
Connecticut test track said the car was too young to gauge 
reliability. The Camry retains a strong rating, nudged out by 
Passat ``by a nose,'' Consumer Reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine based its ratings on tests at its test track and  
reliability reports on 490,000 vehicles from 384,000 of its 4.5 
million subscribers. Reliability figures came from a 1998 survey on 
cars from model years 1991 to 1998.

<HEADLINE> Panel Warns About Arsenic in Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A scientific panel recommended more stringent  
controls on arsenic in drinking water Tuesday, saying the EPA's 
standard is far too high and may expose many people to unacceptable 
risks of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the National Academy of Science admitted  
uncertainties as to how arsenic exposure triggers cancer but 
concluded current Environmental Protection Agency regulation ``does 
not sufficiently protect public health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA agreed with the report's findings, and officials said a  
new arsenic standard for drinking water would be proposed by next 
January. A final standard is likely in 2000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with the conclusions of the report that we need to  
strengthen our drinking water standards to protect public health 
and the environment,'' said Charles Fox, assistant EPA 
administrator for water issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complained that Congress told the EPA in 1974 to  
strengthen the standard, which dates back to 1942, but the agency 
has missed three deadlines to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The special committee of the Academy's National Research Council  
said EPA's current maximum allowable arsenic content of 50 
micrograms per liter of drinking water poses a much greater cancer 
risk than the agency normally considers acceptable. Allowable 
levels should be lowered ``as promptly as possible,'' the panel 
urged. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Water Works Association, representing private  
experts on drinking water quality, endorsed the call for stricter 
standards, although it said adopting the international standard of 
10 micrograms per liter could cost more than $1 billion. The group 
estimated 2,200 of the 56,000 U.S. water supply systems would be 
affected by such a rule change. 
</P>
<P>
	Inorganic arsenic, the form most likely to cause cancer, occurs  
naturally in the earth and is released into ground water that 
travels through rocks and soil. The highest exposure to arsenic is 
in drinking water from wells as opposed to areas, including most 
urban areas, that get drinking water from lakes and streams, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``New information on arsenic exposure and cancer indicate the  
EPA's current standards for acceptable level of arsenic in drinking 
water does not sufficiently protect public health,'' said Robert 
Goyer, professor emeritus at the University of Western Ontario and 
chairman of the science panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The study said males who were found to consume water daily that  
contained arsenic levels near 50 micrograms per liter had a 1 in 
1,000 risk of developing bladder cancer. It cited a possibility, 
disputed by some panel members, of a combined cancer risk of as 
high as 1 in 100 over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	This far exceeds the EPA's general goal of limiting cancer risks  
to 1 in 10,000 over a lifetime, the scientific panel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's Fox said that while the standard needs to be  
strengthened, scientific debate continues over the health effects 
of low levels of arsenic. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the number of water systems with levels of arsenic  
approaching 50 micrograms -- those relying on groundwater -- are 
relatively few in number. ``Arsenic is a problem only in a very 
limited number of communities, affecting less than half of a 
percent of the U.S. population,'' Fox said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Some environmentalists questioned whether the EPA's changes will  
be enough and suggested the agency may be minimizing the health 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's scientific report sends up a big red flare, as it  
becomes very clear that we've been right for years, and that 
arsenic in tap water represents a potential, major public health 
threat,'' said Eric Olson, a water quality specialist at the 
Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said the international standard is 10 micrograms per  
liter, five times more stringent than the current EPA standard. He 
contends the EPA's standard exposes ``tens of millions of Americans 
... to unacceptable cancer and other health risks.''

<HEADLINE>  Dow Jones Industrials Fall 200 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Tuesday, with the Dow  
industrials briefly sliding more than 200 points, as investors grew 
uneasy about technology company earnings and the outlook for 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.9 percent, or by  
189.26, at 9,701.25 in active trading Tuesday afternoon. At one 
point, the Dow was down by 205.91 and below 9,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose above  
10,000 several times, getting as high as 10,085.31 on Friday, only 
to back off before its first close in five digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were falling even faster than the Dow  
on Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.5 percent 
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was off 2.7 percent 
in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates as  
AT&AMP;T Corp. launched a record $8 billion sale of corporate bonds and 
the government prepared for the sale Wednesday of $15 billion in 
two-year notes.

<HEADLINE> Video of Avalanche May Speed Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Even on grainy videotape, it's a  
terrifying sight: Giant slabs of snow breaking loose from an 
Alaskan ridge, swallowing fleeing snowmobilers in a 30-foot wave of 
powder. 
</P>
<P>
	The minute-long video, shot by a man standing a mile away from  
Sunday's avalanche, shows snow sliding down a 2,000-foot mountain 
high in Turnagain Pass. The snowmobilers vanish in a smoky white 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Four bodies had been found. Two others remained missing today as  
searchers returned to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people who were believed missing in the avalanche had  
called to report that they were safe, said Dan Hourihan, on-scene 
coordinator for the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The searchers used 10-foot poles to probe the snow and walked  
shoulder-to-shoulder in a methodical grid pattern, State Trooper 
1st Sgt. Paul Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no tried-and-true way of doing this,'' he said. ``The  
reality is we may not find anybody until spring. That's not a good 
way to do it, but that's where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two slides 20 minutes apart roared down several miles of the  
mountain near Turnagain Pass, a popular recreation area in the 
Chugach National Forest about 55 miles southeast of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	The first slide filled a ravine and scattered some of the  
hundreds of snowmobilers who were driving in the area. The larger 
avalanche began at the top of a 3,000-foot ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses described a wall of snow that sounded like a train and  
a wind blast that drove icy particles into their faces. One said he 
saw three fellow snowmobilers buried in the snow as he sped away. 
</P>
<P>
	When the snow settled, groves of trees and rocky outcroppings  
that had given the videotape vital reference points were buried, 
complicating rescue efforts. Burke said he fears some victims were 
entangled in uprooted trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanches across central Europe have claimed more than 70 lives  
in what has become one of the century's snowiest and most 
precarious winters. In Austria, massive slides suddenly thundered 
into the picturesque villages of Galteur and Valzur last month. 
Thirty-eight people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of slides occur every day in the United States, though  
few threaten lives or property. But there has been an unusually 
large amount of snow in parts of the Northwest and southern Alaska 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In January alone, avalanches in British Columbia, Montana, Idaho  
and Utah killed 16 skiers and snowmobilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alaska slides may have been triggered by ``highmarking,'' in  
which snowmobilers drive straight uphill to see who can make the 
highest mark on the mountain, said Greg Wilkinson, a spokesman for 
the Alaska State Troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dan Hourihan, chairman of the Alaska Mountain Rescue  
Group, said warm weather and 8 feet of fresh snow created the 
conditions for the massive slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service and the U.S. Forest Service issued  
warnings last week that the conditions had raised the danger of 
snow slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims have been identified by authorities as Jodi Combs,  
26, Jeff Saunders, 29, and Christopher Scott, 28, all of Anchorage; 
and Dan Demers, 37, of Eagle River.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Air Lines Files for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Air Lines filed for  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy Tuesday and got $3 million in aid from 
another airline with a troubled history -- Pan Am -- on the day the 
government threatened to ground the tiny discount carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan American Airlines Inc., which now operates charter flights  
under ownership of a New Hampshire freight rail company, plans to 
buy the airline when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court sets a sale date for 
its assets, company spokesman Rob Kulat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three  
years, also named a president and chief executive officer, which it 
has gone without since November. Gene Gillespie, a consultant to 
the company for the last three months, will take over the 
Newark-based carrier, while Baltimore physician Charles Edwards 
will remain its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The $3 million from Pan Am, which is owned by Guilford  
Transportation Industries Inc., will allow Kiwi to maintain its 
current, six-city schedule, use Pan Am planes and expand its Puerto 
Rican schedule in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Passengers will actually see more service from Kiwi,''  
Gillespie said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no interruptions of service, the airline said. The  
airline had struggled to meet its schedule recently with only four 
planes. Two others are in disrepair, and a British company took 
possession of two other planes last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy filing comes the same day the Transportation  
Department threatened to shut it down if it didn't come up with a 
management plan in three weeks. The department said it was no 
longer confident that Kiwi management could effectively direct the 
discount carrier's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration said it has determined the  
airline can continue to fly safely despite its financial troubles, 
but said the agency has to devote too many resources to monitor the 
safety of Kiwi's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has struggled since its founding in 1992 by airline  
employees who had lost their jobs at other carriers, mostly Pan Am 
and Eastern. The founders chose the name of a flightless bird for 
their upstart enterprise to symbolize the loss of their wings at 
their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, the airline had 1,200 employees, 15 leased jets and  
flew 65 flights a day. It now employs 500 and flies out of Newark, 
Orlando, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., and San Juan and Aguadilla, 
Puerto Rico. The airline recently pulled out of Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago and Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Before those airports were dropped, the airline reported a 26  
percent increase in passengers last year, to 58,900. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi filed for bankruptcy in September 1996, declaring $20  
million in debts. It was resurrected a year later by Edwards, who 
bought the airline for $16.5 million and took majority ownership of 
the company from the employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi's announcement Tuesday came after the bankruptcy court had  
closed for the day, and Kulat said he didn't how much debt the 
airline declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department says the airline owed more than  
$750,000 to airports as of Feb. 19, and last year posted an 
operating loss of $19.8 million and a net loss of $20.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has been negotiating with Pan Am for three weeks to bail  
out the airline, Kulat said. Its fleet, based in Portsmouth, N.H., 
includes seven 727-200 aircraft. Kiwi's headquarters will remain in 
Newark, Kulat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am World Airways began flying in 1927 and shut down in 1991,  
following the 1988 terrorist bombing that killed 270 people over 
Lockerbie, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount carrier that followed never turned a profit serving  
14 cities in Florida, the Northeast, Midwest and Puerto Rico before 
falling into bankruptcy. Guilford bought the airline in June 1998.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks were lower at midday Wednesday on  
profit-taking following the market's recent steep gains. The U.S. 
dollar slipped further against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average shed 261.04 points, or 1.63 percent, to  
finish the morning session at 15,758.06. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 359.68 points, or 2.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.48 yen at midday, down 1.05 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 118.00 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, domestic investors and dealers took  
profits on the market's recent rally following the plunge in New 
York shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 218.68  
points to 9,671.83 at Tuesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the Tokyo morning session, prices recovered from early  
lows as foreign investors bought telecommunications and electronics 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors were selling shares because they felt the market had  
overheated,'' said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of Okasan 
Securities. ``But foreigners are still buying such shares as 
Fujitsu and Secom and supporting prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 13.97 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,249.74. 
The TOPIX closed down 6.05 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped back against the yen  
after briefly strengthening in reaction to rising tensions in 
Yugoslavia, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially weakened in New York on Tuesday as U.S.  
stocks tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered airstrikes against  
Yugoslavia, saying Tuesday that efforts to win a negotiated

<HEADLINE> Gramm: Why Were HUD Audits Halted? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Phil Gramm says he wants to know whether  
political pressure from the Clinton administration derailed planned 
audits of housing programs to uncover possible criminal wrongdoing 
in Baltimore, New Orleans and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have intensive oversight hearings on this  
matter,'' Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, 
said today during a meeting of the subcommittee on housing and 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm spoke after Susan Gaffney, the Department of Housing and  
Urban Development's inspector general, told senators she was warned 
to consult with Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo before launching 
investigations into housing programs in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney said HUD officials told her that any federal  
investigation could spark problems because all three cities were 
headed by black mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney said Cuomo told her he didn't think there would be any  
problem in Baltimore and New Orleans, but San Francisco ``might be 
a problem because everything in San Francisco is perceived in 
racial terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those audits were never performed, Gaffney said. Investigators  
later refocused the probe and considered conducting investigations 
into housing programs in North Texas and Long Island, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an outrage that this did not happen in the last  
Congress,'' Gramm said. ``We don't play political favorites with 
criminals. ... I don't know who is right here or what abuse has 
occurred, but we are going to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney and an official from the General Accounting Office,  
Congress' investigative arm, testified on ongoing management 
problems at HUD which have earned the department a ``high risk'' 
designation. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez conceded that the department  
still has problems to solve, but told the subcommittee it had made 
significant progress over the past few years and no longer deserved 
the ``high risk'' label. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez said Gaffney's office had taken a ``destructive, attack  
approach'' to the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney, however, said the department may be overly resentful of  
her oversight activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo ``is an ambitious man, and he needs to have a great  
success at HUD,'' told the subcommittee. ``I think he looks at me 
as a threat, as a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Truck Crash Kills One, Candy Burns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRINNELL, Iowa (AP) -- A tractor-trailer crashed into another big  
rig on a highway early today, killing one driver and setting off a 
stubborn fire -- in a load of chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened about 2 a.m. in the westbound lane of  
Interstate 80 in central Iowa a semi hauling chocolate products 
struck the rear of another semi, the Iowa State Patrol said. The 
first truck was either stopped or driving slowly when it was hit 
from behind in the right lane. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the chocolate truck, whose name was not released,  
was killed, patrol spokesman Dave Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil in the chocolate is what caused it to catch fire,  
Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why they're having so much trouble getting the fire  
extinguished. The oils from the chocolate continue to melt and 
continue to smolder, so it reignites itself and starts on fire 
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrison also said a fuel tank on one of the trucks also caught  
on fire, causing the fire to burn even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the fire was put out. Television footage showed  
burnt boxes of Reese's peanut butter cups, York peppermint patties 
and Hershey's chocolate syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	The westbound lanes of an 11-mile stretch of highway were closed  
for several hours. Eventually, one lane was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the accident remained under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Senate Unhappy With Trade Deficits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators warned the administration Tuesday  
that growing unhappiness over record trade deficits could hand 
President Clinton further embarrassing political defeats as 
Congress responds to growing protectionist pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley and U.S. Trade Representative  
Charlene Barshefsky were told the administration was not taking 
seriously enough threats to steel and other manufacturing 
industries and the farm sector from America's record-high trade 
deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	They said that without a more vigorous response from the  
administration, the nation could well end up adopting some of the 
protectionist measures being pushed that would represent a setback 
to the global trading system and America's overall prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tornado headed your way of protectionism,'' Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., told Daley and Barshefsky. ``It 
could be devastating to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The warnings came as the Senate Finance Committee took up  
legislation that was passed by the House last week in a lopsided 
289-141 vote -- one short of the number needed to override a 
presidential veto -- which would sharply limit steel imports to 
levels that existed before 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Asian financial crisis triggered a flood of cheap  
imported steel into the United States as falling world demand sent 
excess steel supplies pouring into the United States at low prices, 
forcing thousands of job layoffs at U.S. mills. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has threatened a veto if the legislation  
passes Congress, warning that the measure is inconsistent with 
global trading rules established by the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration's view had been expected to win a more  
favorable hearing in the Senate, various lawmakers warned the 
administration that it could be in for a shock unless President 
Clinton takes more aggressive action to deal with the rising trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., one of those pushing for more  
protection for the steel industry in his state, told Daley and 
Barshefsky that they had been ``dead wrong'' about the prospects 
that the steel quota bill would even pass the House, much less by 
the lopsided margin, and he said forces could produce the same 
outcome in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Daley and Barshefsky said the administration preferred a  
less radical proposal being offered by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., 
and Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., which would make it easier for industries 
to petition the government for protection from import surges but in 
a way that would still be consistent with WTO obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two administration officials said they did not favor two  
other alternatives that were put before the committee Tuesday by 
their sponsors, Sen. Arlen Spector, R-Pa., and Sen. Mike DeWine, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Specter's bill would allow an industry threatened by import  
surges to seek relief in federal court while DeWine's measure would 
turn over any higher tariffs on imported products to the industry 
being affected. 
</P>
<P>
	But DeWine said the crisis in steel required a vigorous  
response. ``Now that the House has acted all eyes are on us in the 
Senate,'' he told the Finance panel. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he would vigorously oppose  
efforts to push the country toward more protectionism, saying it 
would be a dangerous turn for the United States to take at a time 
this country is enjoying overall prosperity despite widespread 
recessions overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bills that have been presented to us here are prosperity  
killers,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the Levin and Houghton proposal represented ``a  
constructive approach'' and would further a trend already under way 
of declining steel imports following the filing of cases by the 
industry last year alleging that various countries were unfairly 
dumping steel in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Since those cases were filed, Daley said, the dramatic surge in  
imports has been reversed. He said hot-rolled steel imports from 
Japan fell from more than 400,000 tons in November to less than 
16,000 tons in January while Russian imports dropped from more than 
600,000 tons to less than 11,000 tons in January. He said the 
figures for February, which will be released Thursday, should show 
further improvement.

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Coach Savors Moment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The moment was not lost on Ohio State  
coach Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	After his team beat St. John's 77-74 Saturday night to earn a  
spot in this week's Final Four, the 48-year-old O'Brien trotted 
around the floor in Knoxville, Tenn., with a smile as wide as the 
free-throw lane. He hugged his daughters and even danced with his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys coach forever and ever and never get a chance to get to  
the Final Four,'' O'Brien said. ``People go through their careers, 
players play three or four years, and never get this opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to be thankful that we get this opportunity. It's  
special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien has been a head coach for 17 years at Ohio State, Boston  
College and St. Bonaventure. He was an assistant for five years 
before that at UConn, the Buckeyes' opponent Saturday in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, particularly O'Brien, anticipated just how special this  
season would be. O'Brien's goals were considerably lower than the 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally just wanted to win more than we lost. I know it  
sounds a little ridiculous right now, but I thought that was 
real,'' he said. ``I just thought that after five straight losing 
seasons that a winning record would have been nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In O'Brien's first season at Ohio State, the Buckeyes went 8-22,  
losing 17 straight games and tying the school record for losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the most ardent fan would have felt foolish to ask for a  
winning season this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that would have gotten us to the NIT and would have  
shown some pretty good progress,'' O'Brien said. ``Obviously, we 
have far exceeded that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, they have. The record is 27-8, marking the second-biggest  
turnaround ever for a team in the Final Four. Their improvement 
matches the best in the 25 years the NCAA has been keeping track. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the Buckeyes' first trip to the Final Four in 31 years.  
The last time they went, O'Brien was a scrawny freshman point guard 
at Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain of the last Ohio State team to make it to the Final  
Four gives a lot of the credit to O'Brien for the remarkable 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the catalyst,'' said Bill Hosket, a Columbus businessman  
and Big Ten basketball commentator. ``He's getting the most out of 
the kids, but more than that he's doing a terrific job of hiding 
their weaknesses. That's something he's done well for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question of which team had the best coaching in the  
last 80 minutes of basketball I saw in Knoxville. It's phenomenal 
what the guy has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's leading scorer, Michael Redd, said there are  
several reasons why the Buckeyes have survived this long -- and all 
are attributes nurtured by O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teamwork. Playing hard. Every possession we played with a lot  
heart,'' he said. ``That was the key for us. It really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season, point guard Scoonie Penn brashly predicted  
the Buckeyes would make it to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at him like he's nuts,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	Penn insists the Buckeyes are deserving of the trip to St.  
Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something we work real hard for,'' he said. ``I don't  
think anyone thought we could do it, but here we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he took over the Buckeyes two years ago, O'Brien inherited  
several malcontents and borderline students, but they all 
transferred or quit. His only two holdovers are seniors Neshaun 
Coleman and Jason Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, O'Brien points to the character of his players and  
the contributions from the entire roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when you don't know if they can keep giving there's  
always more,'' he said. ``They always come back.''

<HEADLINE> Converse Wants To Dump Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The unpredictable Dennis Rodman said he can be  
counted on to fight a shoe manufacturer's termination of his $15 
million endorsement contract a year early. 
</P>
<P>
	Converse Inc. of North Reading, Mass., is ending its contract  
with Rodman about one year before it was to expire, according to a 
source familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis has a contract with Converse,'' Rodman's spokesman,  
Matt Labov, said Tuesday. ``Dennis has not breached any terms of 
the contract and we expect Converse to honor the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labov did not specify what action Rodman would take.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the terms of Rodman's contract with Converse is that he  
receives $3 million if he plays in Los Angeles, Chicago or New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman recently walked out on the Los Angeles Lakers for eight  
days to address personal issues, and returned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before he signed the Converse contract in 1997, the forward  
had kicked a photographer during a nationally broadcast game. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA suspended him, and Eastman Kodak and the West Coast  
hamburger chain Carl Jr.'s pulled television commercials featuring 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say Converse's decision to release Rodman has more  
to do with the declining popularity of expensive athletic shoes and 
professional basketball than with Rodman's walking away from the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike and Reebok have significantly cut back their endorsement  
contracts with NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a combination of following that trend as well as the  
fact that Rodman is a little too eccentric to be counted on,'' said 
Bob Dorfman, sports analyst at Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, an ad agency 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was one of the worst in the history of the athletic  
footwear and apparel industry. Nike, Reebok International Ltd., 
Fila and Converse all suffered sales and profit declines. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Converse said revenue fell from $450.2 million in  
1997 to $308.4 million last year. Its stock lost more than half its 
value in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfman said athletic shoes that cost more than $100 are going  
out of style. Shoe companies are suffering from the Asian economic 
crisis as well as negative publicity about their employment of 
sweatshop workers overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has also lost popularity as a result of the player  
lockout, the retirement of Michael Jordan and a lackluster season, 
Dorfman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may be premature for Converse to cut Rodman loose, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't lost as long as he's been on the Lakers, there's a  
good chance he's going to be in the finals this year, and they're 
the most closely watched team in basketball,'' Dorfman said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Converse spokeswoman said the company does not comment on  
athlete's contracts.

<HEADLINE> Joshing Time for D.C. Humorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The line between reality and parody is a bit  
blurred these days, so it's a hard season on Washington's 
humorists. 
</P>
<P>
	This is their peak time, with good lines at a premium for the  
fancy dress dinners at which presidents and politicians try to 
outdo each other in stand-up comedy. Their cadres of writers -- each 
party and the White House has its set -- have to produce laugh lines 
for black- and white-tied affairs, most of them put on by media 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't kid you, this was an awful year,'' President Clinton  
said at the dinner of the Gridiron Club Saturday night. ``It was a 
year I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pause, wry smile.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I take that back.''  
</P>
<P>
	He went on to say that he had learned valuable political and  
personal lessons in the year of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and 
also more than he ever wanted to know about Andrew Johnson, the 
only other president ever impeached and, like Clinton, acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Senate vote had gone the other way, I wouldn't be here  
tonight,'' Clinton had said two nights earlier, to about 2,000 
people at the Radio-Television Correspondents Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Pause, wry smile.  
</P>
<P>
	``I demand a recount.''  
</P>
<P>
	Just kidding, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	But not on Friday at his first news conference in nearly a year,  
when he was asked whether lying will be part of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth-telling is important, Clinton said, ``even presidents have  
to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And besides, he added, when you check the box score, ``there  
will be that one negative and then there will be the hundreds and 
hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will show that I did 
not abuse my authority as president, that I was truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or take Vice President Al Gore's pronouncement that in Congress,  
``I took the initiative in creating the Internet.'' No joke, 
although the system that became the Internet dates from a Pentagon 
project in 1969, when Gore was 21. In fairness, the vice president 
was a leading sponsor of Internet development when he served in the 
House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	But overstatement equals wisecracks. Republican Sen. Trent  
Lott's press release reporting that he took the initiative in 
creating the paper clip. Dan Quayle's claim that he'd invented 
spell check. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton was asked about Gore's claim, the president replied  
that ``he came a lot closer to inventing the Internet than I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He then pointed to his vice president's record in supporting  
development of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
	But one day's defense is the next night's gag.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reporters are needling the vice president about inventing the  
Internet,'' Clinton told 620 people at the white-tie Gridiron 
Dinner. ``I'm hot about it, too. And I told him, I don't want you 
claiming credit for any more of my accomplishments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona spoke there, too, recalling his  
years as a Vietnam POW, and saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that sustained me through those hellish years  
was the thought that someday I would come home and invent the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton joked in his speech that while he doesn't know whether  
his wife, Hillary, is going to run for the Senate in New York, he 
is having the next Democratic National Convention held in 
Schenectady instead of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Seriously, folks, he'd said at the news conference that Mrs.  
Clinton wanted to move to New York in 2001 long before she knew 
there was going to be a Senate opening. She's never lived in New 
York, but residency is no obstacle to running. And Clinton said 
she'd told him more than a year ago that ``she thought we should 
move to New York when I left the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of which, joking about his lot and his successors,  
Clinton noted that there were a lot of potential candidates for 
president at the dinner Saturday night, McCain chief among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, here's what I want to know,'' he said. ``Who could have  
looked at the presidency over the last year and thought to 
themselves, 'Wow, that could be me'?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every president has his headaches. But not like Clinton's.  
</P>
<P>
	So when he was asked at the news conference why he's treated so  
harshly, Clinton took refuge in an old joke. A very old joke. 
</P>
<P>
	About the guy who fell off the cliff, grabbed onto a bush, and  
saw it coming up by the roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord, why me?'' he asks. ``I pay my taxes, I go to work every  
day, why me? 
</P>
<P>
	``And this thunderous voice says: ``Son, there is just something  
about you that I don't like.' ''

<HEADLINE> Where Will Holyfield-Lewis II Be? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Evander Holyfield has his eye on Las Vegas for a  
rematch. Lennox Lewis is considering a rugby stadium in Wales and a 
soccer stadium in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	And Nelson Mandela thinks South Africa would be just right.  
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield and Lewis have been ordered to fight again in a  
rematch of their disputed draw 10 days ago. But where and precisely 
when this heavyweight title bout will take place remains far from 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, told BBC Radio on Tuesday  
he would like a fight in Las Vegas in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've signed a contract already and I'm looking forward to  
it,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we'll go ahead and settle this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wembley Stadium, which can hold 80,000 and staged the 1986 Tim  
Witherspoon-Frank Bruno WBA heavyweight title fight, was initially 
put forward as a venue. But Lewis' manager Frank Maloney said it 
probably wouldn't appeal to American TV and didn't have a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney and promoter Panos Eliades spoke Tuesday with Tom  
Shorey, sales director of the new 75,000-capacity Millennium 
Stadium, which is being built in Cardiff for the rugby World Cup in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing is that it has a roof, so it would eliminate  
any worries about a 4 a.m. start,'' Maloney said. ``They are now 
going to put together a proposal and send a copy to me, Panos and 
the promoter Don King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium was built on the site of the old Cardiff Arms Park,  
where Lewis knocked out Frank Bruno in a WBC title fight in October 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney and Eliades will also have discussions with the owners  
of Scottish soccer club Glasgow Rangers, which has offered 
50,000-seat Ibrox Park as a possible venue. Unlike the Cardiff 
stadium, it doesn't have a roof. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major fight at Ibrox was Jim Watt's WBC lightweight  
title victory over Howard Davis in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the draw in New York, South African President  
Mandela offered his country as a site. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Las Vegas is going to end up being the favorite,''  
Eliades said. ``But South Africa is still a possibility, and 
Glasgow Rangers have come in with Ibrox. The Rangers people want to 
have negotiations, and that will happen on Thursday. We'll fight 
wherever the money is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One stumbling block could be Don King's involvement. According  
to HBO, Maloney and Eliades don't want the promoter to have any 
connection, but they denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've entered into a contract which gives Don King the right  
to the rematch,'' Eliades said. ``We don't have a problem with 
King. ... It is not true to say we don't want King. I'm guaranteed 
my money, and as long as he puts up his letters of credit there's 
no problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield told the BBC that after watching a tape of the fight  
he would not admit he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is Lennox fought a smart fight and a good fight but  
we both didn't do enough to be called undisputed champion,'' said 
Holyfield, who thought some of the rounds given to WBC champion 
Lewis were ``questionable''. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have bad days at the office but we have to get over the bad  
days,'' he said. ``It wasn't a great day for me but I got through 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One judge gave the fight 116-113 to Lewis. New Jersey judge  
Eugenia Williams scored it 115-113 for Holyfield, and English 
official Larry O'Connell had it a 115-115 draw.

<HEADLINE> Brand Eyes Boards in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand lowers his head, his voice  
trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
	He remembers when Duke played Michigan State in Chicago in  
December, and he's embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils won 73-67 in the Great Eight Shootout in one of  
their closest games of the season. What happened on the boards was 
not so close. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke was coming off a loss to Cincinnati, its only defeat in  
running up a 36-1 record entering the Final Four. Brand, out of 
shape at the time, and Duke were pounded on the offensive boards 
25-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, a 6-foot-8 and 270-pound center, promises that will not  
happen again when the teams meet in Saturday in St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got up 13-0 and then all of the sudden they were killing us  
on the boards,'' Brand said of the Dec. 2 game. ``I wasn't in the 
best of shape, and as a team we weren't in good running shape, or 
boxing-out shape. We couldn't even get a rebound at one point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who got three rebounds in that game, was asked if he  
remembered getting any rebounds at all against the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe one rebound, half a rebound, a tip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Three games later, Brand would be benched by coach Mike  
Krzyzewski in a move that eventually turned the sophomore's season 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost three months later, Brand returned to Chicago to play  
DePaul, this time as a star. He had 20 points and 14 rebounds in a 
32-point win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was working so hard to try to be the best but I was tired,''  
Brand said of the Michigan State game. ``I missed two wide-open 
layups sprinting down the court. I had the same opportunity 
(against DePaul) and I threw it in with one hand and coach was 
like, `Do you remember that Michigan State game?' Sure enough, I 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski didn't need to look at the tape again this week to  
recall Michigan State's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``They rebound offensively the best because they made a  
commitment to it -- and they have the players,'' he said. ``They 
keep fresh people in, too. They go eight or nine people deep and as 
a result they don't have to pace themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that first meeting, the Blue Devils limited Spartans star  
Mateen Cleaves to 3-for-17 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the type of guy who needs the ball all the time so you  
just have to work hard to deny him the basketball,'' Duke guard 
Will Avery said. ``With his team, they need him to make plays for 
them. With our team, it's different for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski cautioned against paying too much attention to a game  
played four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is relevant for both of us because we got a chance  
face-to-face to see that `He is that tall' or `He is that big,''' 
Krzyzewski said. ``But we've two different teams. Both of us are so 
much more improved than we were at that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As are Brand and Cleaves.  
</P>
<P>
	``The two best players are in incredibly better shape than they  
were at that time of the year,'' Krzyzewski said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Stay Extra 60 Days in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The jail time Mike Tyson is due to serve for  
violating his Indiana probation will stand, putting an end to talk 
that the former heavyweight champ could leave a Maryland jail as 
early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's one-year sentence for assault in Maryland might still be  
reduced to time already served, but the boxer must still serve 60 
days for violating terms of his probation for a 1992 rape 
conviction in Indiana, a prosecutor's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, even if the Maryland sentence is modified,  
he will not be released from jail on Friday,'' said Beverly 
Phillips of the Marion County prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson requested that his assault sentence be reduced to eight  
months, and a hearing is set for Friday at Montgomery County (Md.) 
District Court. Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's two lawyers in the 
Maryland case, said last week that such a reduction could free his 
client from jail by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been jailed in Maryland since Feb. 5 on charges he  
assaulted two motorists after a minor traffic accident last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman, Tyson attorney James  
Voyles and Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford conferred 
Monday in Indianapolis and also talked to Maryland authorities. 
They agreed that the boxer still must serve the extra time for his 
probation violation, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the judge modifies his sentence, at that point his Indiana  
sentence will begin. There's no retroactive in any of these 
calculations,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Indiana sentence begins, Tyson could serve as little as  
30 of the 60 days, depending on time off for good behavior and 
other provisions, she said. That means Tyson could leave jail by 
April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The integrity of both the Indiana and the Maryland sentences  
will be honored,'' Voyles said. He declined to speculate on how the 
court hearing Friday will turn out or when Tyson may leave jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Tyson struck a deal with Newman and Maryland  
authorities in which he agreed to serve his Indiana jail time in 
Maryland after he completes his assault sentence.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Ends Down 218.68 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market fell victim to another wave of  
anxiety about corporate profits Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunging more than 200 points just days after 
the blue chip index crossed 10,000 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 218.68 to 9,671.83, a loss of 2 percent and the  
second-worst point drop for the index this year. The Dow retreated 
below 9,700 for the first time since March 9, but it is still up 
5.3 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earnings confessional season has hampered the bulls'  
charge,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential 
Securities, ``and really never allowed us to establish a beachhead 
above 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 during three sessions last week, trading  
as high as 10,085.31. But it couldn't manage a close above that 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also hit hard Tuesday. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 34.87 to 1,262.14, and the Nasdaq 
composite fell 73.10 to 2,322.84, reflecting the market's 
discomfort over technology company results. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings fears spread Tuesday after Merrill Lynch warned  
that Coca-Cola's sales growth will be slowed by economic crises in 
Latin America and Japan. Coke shares lost 1 13/16 to close at 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth joined the list of earnings trouble stories. Although  
the telecommunications company didn't lower its own earnings 
projections, it did hint to analysts that its first-half results 
could be clipped by spending on new services and investments in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman lowered his first-quarter  
earnings estimate on BellSouth. The stock fell 2 13/16 to 42 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which lost ground last week after a Donaldson,  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst lowered his earnings estimate, lost 
another 2 3/16 Tuesday to close at 35 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dow component IBM, which sank last week after Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter voiced concerns about revenue growth, slid another 1 1/4 
to 165 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit-takers punished Internet stocks, although there was no  
direct news about that sector. America Online skidded 8 3/4 to 121 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Even oil stocks, which have benefited in recent weeks from  
higher oil prices, folded Tuesday as investors sold them following 
confirmation that OPEC had agreed to cut oil production by 2 
million barrels a day. Dow component Chevron fell 1 to 87 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates.  
While rates were actually lower Tuesday, with the 30-year Treasury 
bond yield down to 5.53 percent from 5.57 percent late Monday, any 
yield above 5.5 percent will disturb both the stock and bond 
markets, Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the credit markets were getting a flood of new bonds  
that could also push rates higher, with AT&AMP;T selling $8 billion 
worth of bonds Tuesday, and the Treasury's auction of $15 billion 
in two-year notes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 7-to-5 margin. Volume came to 808.66 million shares 
as of 4 p.m., up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 15.04 to 595.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 14.04 to 703.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.83 to 383.37.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slid 2.2 percent, as  
investors locked in profits following the Nikkei average's steep 
gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were lower amid concern over the economic  
outlook in the region. Germany's DAX index fell 2.07 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.74 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Wright Seeks Consistency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Jaret Wright spent part of the winter  
on his surfboard riding the Pacific Ocean waves near his new 
California beach front home. 
</P>
<P>
	While paddling through the water waiting for the next set to  
roll in, Wright had time to ponder the lessons he learned during an 
inconsistent 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year wasn't a total wipeout for the Cleveland Indians  
right-hander, but it certainly wasn't the ride he or the Indians 
expected, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot last year,'' Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
	He entered the 1998 season with high expectations following his  
stunning performance in the '97 postseason. As a 21-year-old 
rookie, Wright beat the New York Yankees twice in the division 
series, won Game 4 of the World Series and became the 
second-youngest pitcher ever to start a Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But the demands of being one of baseball's brightest young stars  
may have taken their toll on Wright as he prepared for his first 
big league season. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous off-field commitments -- autograph sessions,  
banquets, talk-show appearances -- and enough other distractions to 
cause him to lose a little of his edge. 
</P>
<P>
	So this winter, he stayed closer to home. And in the water.  
</P>
<P>
	``After the World Series and getting a chance to pitch a seventh  
game, a lot more people wanted my time,'' he said Tuesday after 
pitching 4 1-3 innings in the Indians' 15-5 win over the Houston 
Astros. ``This offseason I relaxed, worked out and stayed 
relatively focused. Not that I wasn't focused last year, it's just 
a lot more people were calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who signed a $9 million, four-year contract last  
October, came to camp this spring determined to become the No. 1 
starter the Indians have desperately been seeking, and the No. 1 
many feel Cleveland still needs to win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaret has been a real marvel to me down here,'' said Phil  
Regan, back for his second stint as the Indians pitching coach. 
``He wants to learn. He wants to be that No. 1 pitcher. He is not 
satisfied, although he signed a pretty good contract. He really has 
that desire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright won his first start last year but then went eight more  
before finally picking up victory No. 2. He finished with 
respectable numbers -- 12-10, 4.72 ERA in 32 starts -- but it wasn't 
what the Indians thought or hoped he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	His control was inconsistent, and when he needed an out pitch,  
more often than not, Wright tried to blow his fastball by hitters. 
Trouble was, they were waiting for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought there were times last year when Jaret fell in love  
with his two-seam fastball,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. 
``He could have thrown more four-seamers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Wright has been working with Regan on a number of  
things. He has moved back over to left side of the rubber before 
starting his windup to better use both sides of the plate, and he 
has been using videotape to review his performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said of all the lessons he learned last season, one  
stands out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1 of the AL championship series in New York, the Yankees  
didn't allow Wright to get out of the first inning, hammering him 
for five runs and five hits. It was a far cry from his previous 
October in Yankee Stadium, when he pitched six strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doing well and doing bad, you've got to deal with them the  
same way,'' he said. ``I think I really took that from the New York 
series. I think was a big lesson for me because I've had a little 
bit of success in the short time that I've been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes it's easy to forget Wright is just 23. He's always  
carried himself with a confidence that belies his age, and he's 
sounding more and more like a pitcher who understands that you 
can't pitch a shutout or strike out the side every time out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last spring I was probably worried about the numbers a little  
bit more than I am this time,'' he said. ``I'm not content with bad 
numbers, but even if you give up a few runs and you take something 
good from that, you're working to go where you want to. This year, 
even if I get hit around and give up a couple of runs, I think I'm 
still getting stuff done that will make me a better pitcher.''

<HEADLINE> American Missiles Would Lead Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia,  
the first phase would bring a barrage of U.S. cruise missiles from 
Navy ships and submarines and Air Force bombers aimed at 
``blinding'' Yugoslavia's extensive network of air defense radars 
and missiles, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take very seriously the threat posed by this air  
defense system and do our best to suppress that, as well as looking 
at other targets,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the air defenses had been damaged, a variety of manned  
aircraft, including U.S. and allied F-16s and American F-15s, would 
have a less risky opportunity to target weapon depots and Serb 
troop concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials declined to discuss a timetable for  
beginning the attacks but indicated they were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further sign that NATO action was approaching, Bacon said  
Yugoslav military officers who had been stationed at a NATO air 
operations center in Italy since last year as part of an exchange 
agreement were being sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	One factor being weighed by allied military officials was the  
poor weather forecast for Yugoslavia on Wednesday, which would not 
be a problem for cruise missiles but would hamper efforts to assess 
bomb damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has four warships and two attack submarines in the  
Adriatic, off the Yugoslav coast, armed with Tomahawk cruise 
missiles, which use satellite guidance to reach their targets in 
any weather, day or night. Britain has one submarine in the area 
armed with cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has eight B-52 bombers in England that would fly  
to the Adriatic and launch cruise missiles without having to enter 
Yugoslav air space and risk getting shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Also likely to be used early in an air campaign is the Air Force  
F-117A stealth bomber, which is designed to evade radar. There are 
12 F-117s at Aviano Air Base in Italy. They are armed with 
laser-guided bombs, which are extremely accurate in clear weather 
but could be hampered if conditions are cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said the Air Force B-2 Spirit bomber, equipped with  
stealth technology designed to make it nearly invisible to enemy 
radars, also might be used. The B-2 has never been used in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon spokesman said the Serb Army was taking action  
Tuesday to protect some of its air defense weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is dispersion going on now, their air defense assets,''  
Bacon said. ``The primary air defense weapons they have are SA-6 
missiles, and those are mobile missiles, as we were used to dealing 
with in Iraq. They also have some SA-3 missiles, which can be moved 
but are much more difficult and cumbersome, time-consuming to 
move.''

<HEADLINE> Low Prices Boost Crustacean Demand / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- Falling prices have put crawfish back  
on restaurant menus and in supermarkets in large numbers as the 
season of the freshwater crustacean gets in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
	The season extends from November through May, but peaks in  
April. Prices currently in South Mississippi range from about $1.19 
to $1.49 a pound live, and $2.09 to $2.19 a pound boiled. Prices 
are expected to drop at least 20 cents in the next few days as more 
crawfish flood the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Posadas, marine economist at the Coastal Research and  
Extension Center in Biloxi, said Mississippi has no commercial 
crawfish producers, but some people catch for themselves and sell 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the nation's crawfish production occurs in  
Louisiana,'' Posadas said. ``But since 1992, a lot of crawfish has 
been imported into the United States, mainly from China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Louisiana produced most of the nation's 70 million  
pounds of crawfish valued at nearly $40 million. Most were 
cultured, but nearly 23 million pounds were caught live in the 
wild. Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin between Baton Rouge and 
Lafayette produces most of the wild crawfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rexroad, owner of Claw Daddy's Crawfish in Gulfport, Miss.,  
said he hopes to sell between 750,000 and 800,000 pounds of 
crawfish this year. Rexroad has been buying all his crawfish from 
Louisiana for the last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think this will be one of our better years,'' Rexroad  
said. ``So far, we are getting more crawfish than we did last 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rexroad's prices are down 10 cents from last week. He expects  
his prices to drop an additional 30 cents by the last full week of 
March as more crawfish are caught in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's plenty of crawfish, the price has to go down,''  
Rexroad said. ``Supply and demand will always make a difference in 
what we're going to sell crawfish for and what we can buy them 
for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The river crawfish in the Achafalaya Basin have yet to be caught  
in large numbers, and when that happens, Rexroad said he expects 
prices to drop significantly. Not only are these crawfish abundant, 
they command higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basin crawfish are bigger and some people say they taste  
better,'' Rexroad said. ``They're a consistent size, unlike pond 
crawfish where you get some large ones, but there is a lot of size 
difference.'' 
</P>

<P>
	LABELLE, Fla. (AP) -- The state of Florida began burning more  
than 250 acres in a commercial grove this week to help stifle an 
outbreak of citrus canker. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadly plant disease was found Feb. 5 in red grapefruit  
trees at Siboney Grove in eastern Hendry County, the state's 
largest citrus-growing county, said Jack Neitzke, director of the 
Immokalee Citrus Canker Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The grove will lose about half its 600 acres to the fires, and  
it will not be paid for the burned trees or lost fruit, Neitzke 
said. However, the grove can harvest the varieties of fruit which 
were not affected by the outbreak, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The burning should be completed in about six weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Citrus canker can kill as many as 250 kinds of fruit trees but  
is not harmful to humans. The bacterium causes trees to weaken, 
lose leaves and drop fruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced earlier this month that Florida  
will receive $20.7 million to help fight canker, which could cause 
the state's citrus industry to lose $200 million in sales from the 
current outbreak.

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra To Get Third Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, on the West  
Coast for medical opinions about his ailing right elbow, hopes to 
know later this week the extent of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see what happens with the reports that come back from  
the medical people, and let's see how Nomar feels,'' Red Sox 
manager Jimy Williams said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tony Daly, team doctor for the Los Angeles Clippers of the  
NBA, performed and MRI and examined the 25-year-old infielder 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Garciaparra was to get a third opinion from Dr. Lewis  
Yocum, orthopedist and team physician for the Anaheim Angels. Yocum 
was expected to discuss Garciaparra's case with Red Sox team 
physician Arthur Pappas tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra has not played for the last 11 days, since  
apparently injuring his arm while making a relay throw against 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas had originally diagnosed the problem as a strain in a  
forearm ligament, and tendinitis or soreness in the biceps muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was due to rejoin the Red Sox on Wednesday, and  
Pappas will then be able to look at the medical films. 
</P>
<P>
	With Garciaparra sidelined, Boston has been using rookie Donnie  
Sadler at shortstop. Sadler scored the only run in a 1-0 win over 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Smells Heats Up in N.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- If something's rotten in North Dakota, the  
folks in Bismarck want to know how bad it stinks. How do they know? 
The scentometer and a state-certified nose. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers have been grappling with whether to change how  
odors are measured on North Dakota's smelly feedlots, hog farms and 
the like. One bill would shift the spot where such tests are taken 
from the lot's property line to a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which has brought to the fore a little gizmo that  
measures the stink. At $600 per scentometer, some lawmakers were 
expecting a high-tech gadget, something showy with digital 
readouts, blinking lights, maybe an electronic beep or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Reality was a letdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like kind of an old radio that somebody had thrown  
off their tractor, or out of their car,'' said Rep. Gene Nicholas 
of Cando, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The scentometer is a hand-held plastic box with two plastic  
prongs jutting out, awaiting the nostrils of its user. The Ohio 
company that makes it says it's been on the market for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The gadget works when the state-certified smeller inhales  
through the box. Using filters and a comparison of smelly to 
unsmelly air, a number is arrived at which either meets or fails to 
meet the state standard. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sniffer can smell the stench when seven parts of filtered  
air mix with one part of unfiltered air, it is a reading of 7 -- 
that's a violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the most accurate, but I guess it gives you something  
to go from to compare,'' said Bob Bergquist, who is helping to 
develop a large hog operation in Grand Forks County. 
</P>
<P>
	To become a state-certified smeller, by the way, means passing  
the state's odor detection exam. It's a three-step test that 
requires candidates to, among other things, distinguish between 
cinnamon, oranges and lemons -- and be able to judge the strength of 
a banana scent.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Ends Down 218.68 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market fell victim to another wave of  
anxiety about corporate profits Tuesday, sending the Dow Jones 
industrial average plunging more than 200 points just days after 
the blue chip index crossed 10,000 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 218.68 to 9,671.83, a loss of 2 percent and the  
second-worst point drop for the index this year. The Dow retreated 
below 9,700 for the first time since March 9, but it is still up 
5.3 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earnings confessional season has hampered the bulls'  
charge,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential 
Securities, ``and really never allowed us to establish a beachhead 
above 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 during three sessions last week, trading  
as high as 10,085.31. But it couldn't manage a close above that 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also hit hard Tuesday. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 34.87 to 1,262.14, and the Nasdaq 
composite fell 73.10 to 2,322.84, reflecting the market's 
discomfort over technology company results. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings fears spread Tuesday after Merrill Lynch warned  
that Coca-Cola's sales growth will be slowed by economic crises in 
Latin America and Japan. Coke shares lost 1 13/16 to close at 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth joined the list of earnings trouble stories. Although  
the telecommunications company didn't lower its own earnings 
projections, it did hint to analysts that its first-half results 
could be clipped by spending on new services and investments in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman lowered his first-quarter  
earnings estimate on BellSouth. The stock fell 2 13/16 to 42 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer, which lost ground last week after a Donaldson,  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst lowered his earnings estimate, lost 
another 2 3/16 Tuesday to close at 35 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dow component IBM, which sank last week after Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter voiced concerns about revenue growth, slid another 1 1/4 
to 165 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit-takers punished Internet stocks, although there was no  
direct news about that sector. America Online skidded 8 3/4 to 121 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Even oil stocks, which have benefited in recent weeks from  
higher oil prices, folded Tuesday as investors sold them following 
confirmation that OPEC had agreed to cut oil production by 2 
million barrels a day. Dow component Chevron fell 1 to 87 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates.  
While rates were actually lower Tuesday, with the 30-year Treasury 
bond yield down to 5.53 percent from 5.57 percent late Monday, any 
yield above 5.5 percent will disturb both the stock and bond 
markets, Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the credit markets were getting a flood of new bonds  
that could also push rates higher, with AT&AMP;T selling $8 billion 
worth of bonds Tuesday, and the Treasury's auction of $15 billion 
in two-year notes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered  
advancers by a 7-to-5 margin. Volume came to 808.66 million shares 
as of 4 p.m., up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 15.04 to 595.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 14.04 to 703.32. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.83 to 383.37.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slid 2.2 percent, as  
investors locked in profits following the Nikkei average's steep 
gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were lower amid concern over the economic  
outlook in the region. Germany's DAX index fell 2.07 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.74 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 1.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> McDougal To Say She Feared Feds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal plans to testify that  
she refused to answer grand jury questions about President Clinton 
because she didn't believe Whitewater prosecutors wanted to hear 
the truth, her lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said the defense has shown  
throughout her trial the ``bits and pieces'' of intimidation by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Susan is going to tie it up all together'' when she takes the  
witness stand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, charged with obstruction of justice and two  
counts of criminal contempt, was likely to testify today. If 
convicted, she could be sentenced to a jail term to be determined 
by the judge and fined up to $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office pursued the federal indictment against Mrs.  
McDougal after she refused to answer questions about Clinton and 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in September 1996 and again last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband, James McDougal, were  
partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in 
northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	In court Monday, Geragos won a skirmish over whether the judge  
would allow defense witness Steve Smith to say whether he believed 
Starr's prosecutors were seeking the truth in using him in their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to a conspiracy charge in the  
Whitewater investigation in exchange for his testimony, was allowed 
to answer the question after the prosecution grilled him about his 
knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the jurors, ``I think they were seeking truthful  
information that would conform with their theory of the case. They 
sort of had a story line about what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A communications professor at the University of Arkansas at  
Fayetteville, Smith said Starr's deputies would listen if he had 
some information that conformed with their thinking but they 
weren't interested if his information didn't fit their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said the government  
may call former Associate Independent Counsel Amy St. Eve to rebut 
testimony from Smith that St. Eve handed him a ``script'' to read 
to grand jurors. Smith said portions of the statement were 
inaccurate and that he feared a perjury charge if he read it as is. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith testified that he read the statement after he and St. Eve  
made changes to it. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, defense witness Richard Holiman said he  
believed that calling Bill and David Henley, Mrs. McDougal's 
brothers, before the grand jury was a way to pressure Mrs. McDougal 
into testifying after her May 1996 Whitewater fraud conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Holiman, who represented David Henley, said his client had no  
new information after appearing before the panel once before. He 
said that giving the Henleys subpoenas was meant to send a message 
to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Associate Independent Counsel Julie Myers said in  
questioning Holiman that David Henley had only been asked about one 
topic in his first visit with the panel.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Has Two Teams in Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke athletic director Joe Alleva spent most  
of Tuesday trying to solve a wonderful dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to figure out how to get from the NCAA women's semifinals  
in California on Friday, in which Duke plays Georgia, to the men's 
semifinals in Florida the next day, when Duke plays Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	Most universities consider themselves lucky to make the NCAA  
tournament at all. Now, Duke has two teams in the Final Four! 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women stunned top-ranked Tennessee 69-63 on Monday  
night to earn their first Final Four berth. A day earlier, the 
top-ranked Duke men's team beat Temple 85-64 to reach its fifth 
Final Four this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	How rare is it? So rare that Georgia is the only other school to  
have both a men's and women's basketball team reach their 
respective NCAA Final Fours in the same season, accomplishing the 
feat in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Indiana did it in 1973, when the NCAA ran the men's  
tournament and the AIAW oversaw the women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	For Alleva, it created a coast-to-coast conundrum because he was  
unable to make connections between San Jose, Calif., and St. 
Petersburg, Fla., using commercial airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Late in the day, he finally secured a private charter to take  
him, university president Nan Keohane and faculty representative 
Kathleen Smith on the ambitious journey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'm going to have to do a lot of sleeping on planes  
and get some books,'' Alleva said. ``But there was no doubt we were 
going to do this. You don't get this unique an opportunity very 
often. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's double the frenzy.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday morning, the Blue Devils' ticket office opened 15  
phone lines and still was unable to field every call, assistant 
ticket manager Bobby Sorrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school received 3,500 tickets for the men's event and 700  
for the women's event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's mission impossible around here because we have about the  
smallest athletic department in the country and here we are, with 
two teams in the Final Four,'' Sorrell said. ``That's OK. I'd take 
this problem every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's notoriously rowdy student body remained subdued, however.  
Neither victory ignited the traditionally raucous celebrations that 
feature towering bonfires at the center of campus. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was a very practical reason.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're saving our energy and conserving wood,'' said Charles  
Ellis, a senior from River Vale, N.J. ``The best is yet to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students say the women's trip through the NCAA tournament  
has been more exciting than the men's because expectations were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of like the women are David and the men are  
Goliath,'' said Michael Dobbyn, a senior from Canton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone follows the men and going to men's games is  
amazing,'' Ellis said. ``It adds so much to the semester. The women 
have almost kind of sneaked up on us. All of a sudden, it's like 
`Wow! They beat Tennessee and now they're in the Final Four, 
too.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke women have never been to a Final Four before. But coach  
Gail Goestenkors won't have to go far to find out what it's like. 
Coach Mike Krzyzewski's office is just two doors down a 
blue-carpeted hallway in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, whose top-ranked men cruised to their fifth Final  
Four of the decade with a 85-64 win over Temple on Sunday, was one 
of the first to congratulate Goestenkors when she showed up for 
work Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He watched the game last night and you could see the joy on  
his face. It was genuine,'' said Goestenkors, who's completing her 
seventh season at Duke. ``We're going to talk more later. I want 
his advice because he's been there and this is new to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flowers flooded Goestenkors' office on Tuesday but by 8 a.m.,  
she was breaking down film of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm already in that mode where you've got to get ready for the  
next game,'' Goestenkors said. ``He (Krzyzewski) came in and said, 
`Take at least this morning and this afternoon and just enjoy this. 
Appreciate this and then go ahead and prepare. But you need to 
enjoy and allow your team to enjoy this moment.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski and Goestenkors have forged a strong working  
relationship that goes back to her hiring in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said when I first came here, `I don't want Duke men's  
basketball to be the only winner here, I want people to think about 
Duke basketball as a winner,''' Goestenkors said. ``I wanted to 
know that's what they wanted. I felt that if the men's program 
could do it here, the women's program could do it here. That's what 
we're on the verge of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But wait a minute. What if the women win and the men lose?  
</P>
<P>
	``People here get emotionally involved with the men's team,  
whereas the women's team is just starting to peak everyone's 
interest,'' Dobbyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the men don't win it and the women do, it would be pretty  
somber around here and that's too bad,'' he said. ``But the 
prevailing attitude would be disappointment for the men not winning 
it rather than excitement for the women winning it.''

<HEADLINE> Headliner Awards Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The Wall Street Journal, Turner  
Original Productions and USC Radio took top honors Tuesday in the 
65th annual National Headliner Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards, given by The Press Club of Atlantic City, will be  
presented in a May 1 dinner at Trump World's Fair casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal and its reporter Alix Freedman won first place in  
investigative reporting and Best of Show in the print division for 
``Population Bomb,'' a story that exposed the chemical 
sterilization of thousands of Third World women. 
</P>
<P>
	The story told about two American population-control advocates  
who embarked on a mission to sterilize more than 100,000 women 
using quinacrine, a drug the World Health Organization believes may 
cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The story by Freedman, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1996, led  
several countries to re-examine their policies about the drug's 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alix Freedman took a little-known subject and turned it into a  
fascinating, multidimensional read that included all the shades of 
gray,'' the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner Original Productions, a nonfiction development unit of  
Turner Broadcasting System, captured best documentary and Best of 
Show among television entries for ``Dying To Tell the Story,'' the 
tale of a woman whose brother, Reuters photographer Dan Eldon, was 
stoned to death in Somalia in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Eldon set out to interview her dead brother's peers in  
photojournalism to understand what motivated him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rich visual content and first-person commentary created a  
compelling experience, a unique record of a personal quest that 
provides a dramatic example of the fundamental issues faced by 
every journalist,'' the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	USC Radio's ``Marketplace'' program -- which is syndicated on 275  
public radio stations -- won best feature and Best of Show in radio 
for ``RFK,'' an examination of the lasting impact Robert F. Kennedy 
left on Dry Branch Holler, a tiny West Virginia community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Touching, reflective, human. A most remarkable piece of  
reporting on the mystery of Robert F. Kennedy's deep and 
affectionate relationship with the impoverished residents of 
Appalachia,'' the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe won first-place awards in spot news, for its  
reporting on fatal shootings at the Connecticut Lottery 
headquarters, and in beat coverage, for its series about Harvard 
University's endowment. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News won first-place awards in three TV categories. It won  
for coverage of a major news event, ``Crisis in the White House,'' 
best human interest story, ``At Home With Bob and Michelle,'' and 
investigative reporting, ``Sound Advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press won top honors among news services and  
syndicates for coverage of a major news event -- Hurricane Mitch -- 
and for feature writing. The AP also won in three photographic 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	In radio, KTRH in Houston won first place for best newscast and  
best coverage of a live news event, an abortion clinic attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Headliner Awards is the nation's oldest journalism  
competition. About 1,600 entries were received this year.

	BIG PINE KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Forty-three illegal Cuban immigrants  
who were apparently brought ashore by smugglers were found in the 
Florida Keys over a 12-hour period, some of them trapped in the mud 
flats. 
</P>
<P>
	Two small children and 23 adults were found on Big Pine Key on  
Tuesday morning. Late Monday, 14 adults and four children were 
found stranded on the mud flats off Big Pine Key, about 30 miles

</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of the smugglers.

<HEADLINE> Michigan State Knows Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A few months ago, Michigan State coach Tom  
Izzo was wondering if he'd made the right decision by having the 
Spartans play the likes of Connecticut and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	But with all three teams now in the Final Four, Izzo says he  
thinks those games will help the Spartans in St. Petersburg -- even 
though Michigan State lost both matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's NCAA semifinals, Duke (36-1) and Michigan State  
(33-4) face off at 8:17 p.m. at Tropicana Field after Connecticut 
(32-2) takes on Ohio State (27-8) at 5:42 p.m. The winners of 
Saturday's games will meet for the NCAA championship at 9:15 p.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Spartans and Blue Devils met, Duke held  
Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves to 3-of-17 shooting and 
only nine points. Izzo admitted after that Dec. 2 game in Chicago 
that Cleaves pressed too much. 
</P>
<P>
	But Izzo sees a different ability now in his star point guard.  
And he says his Spartans are pitching in as a team to get the job 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mateen is a lot better now than he was then,'' Izzo  
said. ``I really think A.J. Granger has stepped it up a couple of 
notches. I think Andre Hutson is getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Granger scored 14 points in Sunday's 73-66 win over Kentucky in  
the NCAA Midwest Regional, with three of those baskets 
three-pointers. Hutson also scored 14, while Cleaves had 10 points 
and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Sunday's game against Kentucky, the Spartans fell behind  
by 13 points against with Duke. But in a move that has become a 
Spartan trademark this season, they battled back, closing to within 
58-55 with 6:08 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Spartans built on their comeback to beat  
Kentucky. They weren't so lucky against the Blue Devils, who shut 
down the Spartans after Cleaves missed several key shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing 73-67, the Spartans ended the Duke game with a  
36-20 edge in rebounds, which could help them Saturday if they can 
repeat the feat. So far this season, they've outrebounded their 
opponent in 35 of their 37 games while winning 33 times. 
</P>
<P>
	They also do a good job on defense. Heading into Saturday's  
contest, they've allowed 60 or fewer points in eight of their last 
10 outings. In their four NCAA games so far, they've held their 
opponents to just 38.5 percent shooting from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be tougher against Duke, which has averaged 93 points  
per game this season. But Izzo, while acknowledging his team faces 
a huge challenge, remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find a way to check 'em,'' he pledged.  
</P>
<P>
	That may require some extra maneuvers in practice, which Izzo  
plans to keep as normal as possible before the team leaves Thursday 
for Florida. Despite the experience he gained in their first 
matchup, Izzo isn't preparing the Spartans for the Blue Devil team 
they played in Chicago, but the one awaiting them in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're a lot better team than we were in December, and  
I think they're a lot better team than they were in December,'' he 
said. ``So we're going to have to make some strides this week.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Snowmobilers Had Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- The mountain slopes had danger  
written all over them before at least four snowmobilers were killed 
over the weekend in one of the nation's deadliest avalanches. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight feet of new snow had been dumped in recent days on top of  
older, packed-down snow, prompting avalanche warnings from the 
National Weather Service and the U.S. Forest Service. And a warm 
spring sun had been beating down all day Sunday, raising the danger 
even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, hundreds of snowmobilers were powering their  
machines up the mountainsides to see who could leave the highest 
track -- a practice called ``highmarking'' that is not illegal but 
discouraged because the vehicles can roll over and because the 
combined weight of man and machine can trigger an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were nervous as cats because everyone wants to go out in  
the nice weather,'' said Jill Fredston, co-director of the Alaska 
Mountain Safety Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 20 minutes before the deadly slide, a smaller avalanche  
happened in a gully a short distance away, and it wasn't enough to 
scare everybody away. 
</P>
<P>
	When the big avalanche hit late Sunday afternoon, the mile-wide  
wall of snow up to 15 feet deep swept at least six people away. As 
of Tuesday, four bodies had been found, and about 140 searchers 
probed the snow for two men. 
</P>
<P>
	The missing were identified as Tech Sgt. Victor Jones of  
Elmendorf Air Force Base and Aaron Arthur, 29, of Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Skeete of Anchorage helped recover the body of a friend  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we found him and didn't have to wait until spring,''  
Skeete said. ``That gives the family some closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine teams of searchers equipped with 10-foot poles were  
conducting a methodical, foot-by-foot probe of the snow, said to be 
30 feet deep in places. A hand-held electronic sensor and a metal 
detector were also being used to try to find the missing men. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were also relying on a jumpy videotape of the  
avalanche to provide clues about where to look. 
</P>
<P>
	That tape, shot by a man standing about a mile away, shows  
massive slabs of snow breaking loose and sliding down the mountain 
in a roiling, powdery cloud. The minute-long video shows at least 
four snowmobilers, mere specks, being swallowed up. 
</P>
<P>
	Some snowmobilers saw Sunday's danger signs and steered clear of  
the area. ``We saw all that snow and said, `There's no way we're 
going to ride here,''' Gary Sleeper of Anchorage said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the death toll rises to six, the avalanche will be the  
nation's deadliest since March 1982, when seven people were killed 
at Alpine Meadows ski area in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadliest avalanche in U.S. history was in 1910 at Stevens  
Pass, Wash., when a slide struck a train and killed 96, according 
the American Association of Avalanche Professionals in Bozeman, 
Mont.

<HEADLINE> Gas Pump Prices Rising on OPEC Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Gasoline prices are likely to continue  
rising if OPEC fulfills expectations and approves production cuts 
of 2.1 million barrels a day when its representatives meet today. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices already reflect the impact of the expected cuts, and  
industry analysts say refiners of gasoline have wasted no time 
passing on the steeper prices to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that gas prices in North America and the  
rest of the world have risen because of OPEC's decision,'' said 
Doug Terreson of Morgan Stanley, speaking from his office in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries would reduce the world's oil supply by about 2.6 percent, 
in a unified effort with non-OPEC producers to strengthen prices 
for crude that had languished at a 12-year low as recently as 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC oil ministers have said the organization plans to reduce  
daily output by its members to 1.72 million barrels. Non-OPEC 
producers like Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman are expected to 
account for additional cuts totaling 388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to curtail production was reached two weeks ago by  
the group's three biggest members -- Saudi Arabia, Iran and 
Venezuela -- together with Mexico and fellow OPEC member Algeria. 
Crude prices responded by jumping almost $3 a barrel, and gasoline 
prices followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``After it became evident that OPEC was going to cut production,  
the price at the pump really began to move quickly,'' said George 
Gaspar of Robert W. Baird and Co., a financial services firm based 
in Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of all grades of gasoline at U.S. service  
stations surged nearly 8 1/2 cents per gallon over the past two weeks, 
according to the Lundberg Survey, the steepest and fastest increase 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices shot up more than 9 percent at self-service pumps in the  
United States, where unleaded regular averaged nearly $1.03 in the 
latest survey, compared with just over 94 cents two weeks ago, 
according to the California-based Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say OPEC's plan to curtail production accounted for at  
least half of the rise in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for more expensive gasoline has been the approach  
of spring, when people usually begin spending more time in their 
cars. Gasoline inventories had been unusually large last fall and 
winter, said Fergus McLeod of the securities firm BT Alex. Brown. 
As inventories began to dwindle, gas prices began to rise from 
their depressed levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by OPEC to pump less oil will likely cause gasoline  
prices to rise further -- by two to three cents a gallon for every 
additional dollar increase in the price for a barrel of oil, McLeod 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If OPEC gets reasonably good compliance with the production  
cuts, that will lead to even higher gas prices in coming months,'' 
Terreson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, contracts for April delivery of light, sweet  
crude have traded in the $15-$15.50 range on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Crude traded as low as $10.72 a barrel on that 
exchange in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaspar foresees prices rising by as much as 10 cents a gallon  
from their current levels. The effect of cuts in oil output could 
continue to buoy gasoline prices well into the fall, he said, when 
gasoline prices typically decrease slightly as colder weather makes 
driving less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	A possible glitch in the seemingly irresistible momentum toward  
OPEC production cuts has come in the form of a protest by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Amer Mohammed Rasheed, Iraq's oil minister, said in a report  
published Monday that Iraq would insist that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's 
largest producer, make additional cuts on its own. Iraq wants Saudi 
Arabia to reduce its output closer to the level it produced at 
prior to the Gulf War. The Saudis began pumping more oil after the 
war to make up for the market share Iraq lost when U.N. sanctions 
barred exports of Iraqi oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, which now produces more than 8 million barrels a  
day, has pledged to reduce output by 585,000 barrels a day -- more 
than any other OPEC member. But Rasheed would insist that Saudi 
Arabia cut back by an additional 1.1 million barrels or more, he 
told the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly oil review published 
in Nicosia, Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
	Other OPEC oil ministers seemed to play down the potential for  
trouble at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agreement tomorrow is confirmed,'' said Venezuelan Oil  
Minister Ali Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> 3 Inducted Into Golf Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) -- Seve Ballesteros was standing at the  
podium during his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame when 
the power failed and the sound system went dead. The dashing 
Spaniard never lost his poise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has happened to be before,'' he quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	His game didn't always go according to plan, at least that's how  
it looked. Not many players have won a major championship by making 
birdie from a parking lot. Growing up with only a cut-down 3-iron 
in his hand, Ballesteros learned to hit shots that others never 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he took his place among the game's greats.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who was going to tell me that a little boy who started as a  
caddie in Pedrena, a small village in Spain, would be here today,'' 
said Ballesteros, the winner of five major championships and nearly 
80 tournaments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Alcott made the biggest splash of her career when she became  
the first LPGA member to be inducted since Betsy King in 1995. Also 
inducted was the late Lloyd Mangrum, who won two Purple Hearts in 
World War II and the U.S. Open in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 members of the Hall of Fame looking on under a blazing  
sun, the induction of Ballesteros, Alcott and Mangrum brought the 
number to 76 of those enshrined at the World Golf Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little numb,'' Alcott said. ``I look down that list and  
I've taken my place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros was elected last year on the international ballot,  
but deferred his induction until Monday. Alcott, whose 29 victories 
include five major championships, became eligible in February when 
the LPGA changed its criteria. Mangrum was elected on the PGA Tour 
ballot in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf gave a little girl the life she imagined sitting in front  
of a television,'' Alcott said. ``I was mesmerized by the rhythm of 
the swing, the sound of the golf ball, the whole dance. It's been a 
great dance, and I hope to keep dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros and Alcott grew up in different worlds and played  
different tours. All that links them is the way they discovered 
golf -- Alcott with a cut-down club she used to tear up her yard in 
Santa Monica, Calif., Ballesteros with a 3-iron that taught him 
shots few others would even dream of hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of imagination,'' Ballesteros said. ``That came  
from learning the game with only one club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Spaniard made a spectacular debut at the 1976  
British Open at Royal Birkdale. Although he lost a third-round lead 
to Johnny Miller, his bump-and-run that threaded two bunkers on the 
closing hole served notice that there would never be a dull moment 
when he was around. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Open three years later at Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes,  
making a birdie from a parking lot on the 16th hole in the final 
round. Ballesteros won two more British Opens, along with the 
Masters in 1980 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the heart and soul of the Ryder Cup, his  
intensity and determination making it the biggest worldwide event 
in golf, and he was idolized by today's young stars in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Arnold Palmer did more in America than I did in  
Europe,'' Ballesteros said. ``I feel very proud to help the people 
back in Europe. I as the one who opened the door for them. And I 
feel very good about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott's impact on women's golf goes beyond the record she  
shares with JoAnne Carner for winning at least once her first 12 
years on tour. She's responsible for victory splash at the Nabisco 
Dinah Shore, which began when she won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She took host Dinah Shore into the pond with her in 1991, the  
last time Alcott won on tour. She would have needed one more 
victory to get into the Hall of Fame under the previous 
requirements, which were so difficult that it was regarded the 
toughest shrine in sports to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new points system approved in February, Alcott would  
have qualified 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangrum won most of his 36 victories after an Army career that  
took him to Omaha Beach on D-Day and earned him two Purple Hearts. 
He won the 1946 U.S. Open, was a member of five Ryder Cup teams and 
won the Vardon Trophy twice. 
</P>
<P>
	He was represented by his stepson and was introduced by Byron  
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great golfer who was somewhat forgotten,'' Nelson  
said. ``He was a tough competitor and an excellent putter. Any time 
you beat him, you could know you were playing well.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Tutor: Haskins Knew Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former Minnesota tutor said Tuesday she  
thinks men's basketball coach Clem Haskins knew she was doing 
course work for players. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking during a news conference Tuesday, Jan Gangelhoff said  
no one ever explicitly asked her to do players' papers and she 
never told Haskins that she wrote papers for students. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said she's confident Haskins knew what she was doing.  
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff said Haskins called her to say a player who got a D  
in one class would need to get a B in another class. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff interpreted Haskins' comments to mean she should do  
whatever she could to get the player a higher grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a statement Monday through the university, with  
the approval of his lawyer, Ron Zamansky, saying Gangelhoff was not 
telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deny the allegations of former player Russ Archambault. I  
again deny the allegations of Jan Gangelhoff. They are not true,'' 
Haskins' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending Tuesday's news conference were Jeanne Payer,  
Gangelhoff's sister who said she also tutored some players; their 
lawyer, Jim Lord; and Archambault. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff and Archambault both said Haskins was lying when he  
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff previously said she wrote about 400 papers for 20  
players over a six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff told reporters that Haskins told her, ``Just  
remember, Jan, these papers can't be too good now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Archambault said he and Gophers assistant coaches joked about  
his work when he told the coaches he wrote two or three papers in 
one night. 
</P>
<P>
	A former office manager in the men's athletic department  
academic counseling office, Gangelhoff said she didn't intend to 
participate in a cheating scam with players. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she initially was a university-approved tutor, and the  
relationship evolved to where it was quicker to do players' work 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Players called her, she said, and she became overwhelmed by  
tutoring as many as nine or 10 students at a time, each of whom was 
taking several classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think about it. It was an evolvement that happened,''  
she said. ``Helping the students was always my primary goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she helped the players because she ``was a member of  
the family'' and she ``took care of these kids,'' with whom she had 
a ``special kind of relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, whose allegations set off an investigation, spoke  
calmly during the 1 1/2-hour news conference, her first on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions with a Saint Paul Pioneer Press reporter over 2 1/2  
months persuaded Gangelhoff she should make the allegations public 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not easy choices, but (the players will) be better  
people for it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff also said she received $3,000 from Haskins for her  
work when she continued to tutor after the university took her off 
the approved tutor list. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer said she gave Gangelhoff the cash in an unmarked envelope  
Payer received from academic counselor Alonzo Newby. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer said she didn't know she was doing anything wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	Archambault has also said he received cash from Haskins. The  
former player, who was kicked off the team in February 1998 for 
leaving his hotel after curfew the night before a game at Illinois, 
said Tuesday that Haskins gave him between $40 and $200 on as many 
as 10 occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash payments could bring severe NCAA penalties for Haskins as  
well as the basketball program. The university began its 
investigation Monday, and university president Mark Yudof said it 
could take up to six months to complete. Yudof said Monday he 
believes Haskins' denial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord also issued a challenge to Yudof to have testimony be taken  
under oath during the investigation, instead of privately by an 
Overland Park, Kan., law firm the university has hired.

<HEADLINE> Cyber Violinist Connects With Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hilary Hahn seems to take center stage among  
elementary schoolers with the same enthusiasm she does performing 
in the world's best-known concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing on the threshold of what critics assure will be an  
outstanding career, the 18-year-old virtuoso violinist took time 
out between New York Philharmonic performances to meet Monday with 
fourth- and fifth-graders struggling to make their instruments sing 
as hers does. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was the first for Hahn and the students of P.S. 183,  
but several felt they knew her already. The kids have been 
following her career via the World Wide Web. 
</P>
<P>
	And they came prepared with questions.  
</P>
<P>
	Why did she pick the violin?  
</P>
<P>
	How does she memorize all that stuff?  
</P>
<P>
	How much does she practice?  
</P>
<P>
	``You only have to practice on the days that you eat,'' she told  
them, parroting the rule a violin teacher once gave her. ``It's 
like sleeping or breathing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hahn is in town for a two-week stint at Lincoln Center, where  
she is performing four days with the philharmonic at Avery Fisher 
Hall and two with a chamber group in Alice Tully Hall. It's her 
second appearance with the philharmonic, the first coming when she 
was 14 and was asked to stand in for Midori, another violinist who 
gained international acclaim in her teens. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Hahn had already spent several years training at  
Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, where the curriculum is 
designed so students can practice several hours each day and travel 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Upper East Side elementary school she visited Monday,  
Hahn treated 11 children to the Andante and Allegro sections of 
Johann Sebastian Bach's Sonata in A Minor, and also showed them a 
quick bedtime exercise she used to do every night. 
</P>
<P>
	The kids, several toting violin cases themselves, sat mesmerized  
as Hahn swayed in time with the music and her fingers flew across 
the strings. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her encouragement, only 10-year-old Lucy Tung was brave  
enough to crack out her own instrument. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-grader whispered to herself when she made a mistake,  
but Hahn greeted the finish with a warm smile and hearty applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that easy, it's hard to memorize,'' the girl said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're on your way,'' Hahn assured her.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, Argentina Reach Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill Gates and Argentine  
President Carlos Menem signed an agreement Tuesday in which 
Microsoft pledged to help make Argentina one of the leading Latin 
American software producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, in turn, agreed to crack down on software piracy by  
increasing enforcement of intellectual property laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem and Gates approved the broadly worded deal in a private  
meeting during Microsoft's annual conference on Latin American 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem said the government is starting a program called  
``Argentina 2010'' aimed at making the country a strong software 
exporter to Spanish-speaking markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Few specifics were available on how Microsoft plans to help. In  
the agreement, the software giant pledged to cooperate in 
developing and promoting information technology; provide 
technological counseling to the Argentine government and donate 
educational materials. 
</P>
<P>
	``These agreements are pretty minimal in detail,'' said  
Microsoft spokesman Mark Thomas. ``It's saying we're going to work 
together, and a lot of the details are to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redmond, Wash.-based company has had an office in Buenos  
Aires for years, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for software in the region is growing. A decade ago,  
Argentina's government had one computer for every 23 employees, 
Menem said. Now it has a computer for every three employees, he 
told an audience at the Hotel Inter-Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem said his government plans to start a program aimed at  
helping more of the nation's people become computer literate.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The women's Final Four has a new -- and many would say welcome --  
twist this year. 
</P>
<P>
	There's actually some suspense over who'll win the national  
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case last year, when Tennessee stormed into the  
Final Four with a 37-0 record, then blew away Arkansas and 
Louisiana Tech to win its third straight NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee didn't even make the Final Four this year, leaving it  
to Louisiana Tech, Purdue, Duke and Georgia to decide matters in 
San Jose, Calif., this weekend. In a Left Coast Final Four, the 
Lady Vols were left out, eliminated by Duke in the East Regional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke showed us that this game is getting spread out,''  
Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore said. ``It's so good for the 
game. Everybody has some hopes and dreams, and it's not going to be 
the same team all the time. And that is so good to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (30-2) plays top-ranked Purdue (32-1) in the  
second semifinal Friday night, a showdown between the only No. 1 
seeds left in the tournament. Georgia (27-6) and Duke (28-6), both 
No. 3 seeds, meet in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wide open now,'' Louisiana Tech's Monica Maxwell said.  
``It's anybody's championship to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, making its 10th Final Four trip, is the only  
school in the field that has won a national championship. The Lady 
Techsters won the first NCAA title in 1982 and also won in 1988. 
They lost to Tennessee 93-75 in last year's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia made it for the third time in five years and the fifth  
time overall, while Purdue is making its second Final Four trip. 
Duke is a Final Four rookie, but after knocking off Tennessee 69-63 
on Monday night, the Blue Devils won't be backing down from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, there's school pride to uphold. Duke is the first program  
to have its men's and women's teams in the Final Four since Georgia 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt that if the men's program could do it here, the women's  
program could do it here,'' said coach Gail Goestenkors, who has 
been at Duke since 1992. ``That's what we're on the verge of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's loss deprived the Final Four of the game's biggest  
star, Chamique Holdsclaw. But there's still plenty of star power in 
the field, starting with Purdue's outstanding senior duo of 
Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, like Holdsclaw, was a unanimous All-American this  
year and has led her team to 30 straight victories. She and Figgs 
combined for 22 of Purdue's final 26 points Monday night as the 
Boilermakers came from behind to beat Rutgers 75-62 in the Midwest 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore said he voted for White-McCarty as the nation's No. 1  
player over Holdsclaw because ``she took a less talented team than 
Tennessee, and look where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech is the most athletic team in the field. Forward  
Amanda Wilson was a second-team All-American, guard Tamicha Jackson 
can break down just about any defense and Maxwell has played well 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has its sophomore twins, Kelly and Coco Miller, while  
Duke is a well-balanced team built around 6-foot-6 Michele VanGorp, 
a third-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue's tournament run has extended the tenure of coach Carolyn  
Peck, who is leaving at the end of the season to become the coach 
and general manager of the WNBA's Orlando Miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Boilermakers' ride has been smooth, it hasn't  
always been that way for White-McCarty and Figgs, who have played 
under three coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Dunn was dismissed after their freshman season, and most of  
the players transferred. Dunn's replacement, Nell Fortner, stayed 
only one year before being named coach of the U.S. national team. 
Peck was Fortner's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't look at the past, we don't look what we've been  
through,'' Figgs said. ``We just play for now. We know that none of 
the things we've been through are going to hurt or help us now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, two of the players who left Purdue are now  
standouts at Duke -- VanGorp and Nicole Erickson. They could meet up 
with their old team in the championship game.

<HEADLINE> Judge Asked To Clarify NCAA Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lawyers for four athletes have asked a  
federal judge to clarify letters the NCAA sent to its Division I 
schools after the judge struck down the association's use of 
minimum test scores to determine freshmen eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers want the NCAA to assure schools they will not be  
penalized if they use freshmen players suddenly made eligible by 
the Proposition 16 ruling -- even if that ruling is later reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the NCAA on Monday asked U.S. District Judge Ronald  
Buckwalter to refrain from ruling on the lawyers' request until a 
federal appeals court rules on the organization's appeal of the 
initial Proposition 16 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 8, Buckwalter declared that the minimum standardized  
test score requirements have ``an unjustified disparate impact 
against African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters the NCAA sent last week to the 302 Division I  
schools offer direction to coaches and athletic directors suddenly 
stripped of a key recruiting guideline, NCAA spokeswoman Jane 
Jankowski said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence includes reference to Article 19.8 of the  
NCAA's 1998-99 Division I rules manual, which states that the 
association could strike statistics or championships from the 
record books if a court ruling like Buckwalter's is vacated, stayed 
or reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does is help give a few general guidelines to member  
institutions and guidelines on the court ruling,'' Ms. Jankowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in court papers filed Friday, lawyers for the four black  
plaintiffs wrote that citing the article is ``tantamount to the 
NCAA advising its members that 'if you honor and heed the Court's 
permanent injunction, you do so at your peril.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers asked Buckwalter to direct the NCAA to inform its  
Division I schools that the article ``has no force or effect on any 
member who recruits, offers athletically-related financial aid or 
allows a student-athlete to compete'' if that student-athlete has 
not attained the minimum test scores that were struck down in the 
judge's ruling last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA lawyers have said in court that the immediate elimination  
of Proposition 16 could cause chaos among its member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The article threatens to strike individual and team statistics  
and championships from the record books ``in the interest of 
restitution and fairness to competing institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals is weighing whether  
give the NCAA more time to develop new freshman eligibility 
guidelines, a delay Buckwalter refused to grant them last week. The 
NCAA also plans to appeal the initial ruling to the appeals court.

<HEADLINE>  Slovenian Pavlovcic Wins Men's GS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- A Slovenian one race away from retirement  
was the fastest men's giant slalom skier in the U.S. National 
Championships on Tuesday. The second-fastest was a developmental 
team skier who has never raced on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that kind of a day at Park City Mountain Resort, as the  
United States' best and brightest were outshone by 27-year-old Uros 
Pavlovcic, who had planned to quit ski racing after the event. Now 
he's not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought I would win, because the United States has a  
very strong team,'' Pavlovcic said, a bit charitably given 
America's recent international record. ``But I knew I could beat 
some of them. ... Now I don't know if it's time to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A more familiar script was followed at Snowbasin Ski Resort,  
where Katie Monahan cemented her status as the nation's top women's 
super-G skier by winning her first national title in the 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavlovcic spent the winter skiing for Sierra Nevada College in  
the Lake Tahoe area, where he won every technical race he entered 
last season in the USCSA, a league one step below the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his college eligibility is up, he will be able to keep the  
first-prize money from his victory. A dispute with the Slovenian 
national team has kept him out of international competition in 
recent years, and he said this victory likely won't change things. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skied the last two U.S. Championships, so this is a nice way  
to finish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavlovcic was followed by Andrew Martin, a developmental team  
member who is a familiar face on the Nor-Am circuit but has yet to 
make the national team. Martin used a blistering second run to 
finish in 1 minute, 59.99 seconds, behind only Pavlovcic's 1:59.59. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've skied against (the national team) lots of times, and I  
knew I could beat these guys, but this is the first time I've done 
it in competition,'' he said. ``This tells me that I can ski at the 
next level. Hopefully I'll get a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin raced with the U.S. development team in Europe during  
January and February, ``and I came home broke. Even last week, I 
wasn't sure if I'd be out here. But I took a loan on my life 
insurance, and a couple of grants came through, so ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the first run, national team member Thomas Vonn  
slipped midway through the second run and finished third at 
2:00.11. Pre-race favorite Bode Miller, the defending champion, was 
fourth, followed by Dane Spencer and Chad Fleischer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's super-G, Monahan, of Aspen, Colo., closed her  
breakout season with a race time of 1:15.05, easily outdistancing 
Megan Gerety's 1:15.48. 
</P>
<P>
	After a miserable day of snow conditions on the same course  
during Monday's men's super-G, workers produced a 
faster-than-expected course for the women. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course workers did a great job, and it helped me because  
it was more my type of course,'' Monahan said. ``Basically, the 
course was edge-to-edge, turn-to-turn the whole way down, and I 
think it turned out to be a little faster than anyone anticipated 
... which was good for me, because I'm more experienced in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan had her first World Cup top-20 and top-10 finishes this  
season, highlighted by an eighth-place finish at Mammoth Mountain, 
Calif. She closed the World Cup schedule two weeks ago with a 
third-place finish and her first podium in SG at St. Moritz, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	After fifth-place finishes in the downhill and giant slalom  
races earlier in the competition, Monahan also has emerged as the 
favorite to take the combined title. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerety and Kjersti Bjorn-Roli, both Alaska natives who have  
battled knee problems, joined Monahan on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``My knees are pretty sore right now, so I can't really risk  
anything,'' Gerety said. ``It wasn't like I was really looking for 
speed too much. (I) just tried to make it down in one piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark, the national downhill champion, was fourth and  
Megan Ganong fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The national championships conclude on Wednesday with the men's  
and women's slaloms at Deer Valley.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Money Laundering Rules Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banking regulators, responding to a public  
outcry over privacy concerns, scrapped proposed anti-money 
laundering rules Tuesday that would have tracked the transaction 
patterns of bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Know Your Customer'' rules were put out for public comment  
in December by four federal banking agencies. Since then, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alone has received some 225,000 
e-mail messages and letters, nearly all opposing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would turn every 
bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They maintained the rules 
were unconstitutional and would violate prohibitions against 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this month, the Senate joined the deluge of criticism,  
voting 88-0 to express support for a measure directing the 
regulators to drop the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday after agency officials voted at  
open meetings, the four agencies said they had received ``an 
unprecedented number'' of comments protesting the proposal on 
privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would have required banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would have been expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and bankers reacted swiftly and positively to the  
regulators' action. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, for example, said he was ``glad to know that there are 
regulators who will listen to real people and walk away from a bad 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers  
Association, said the rules would have put banks ``in the untenable 
position of invading their customers' privacy and potentially could 
have eroded public confidence in the banking industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators' decision to withdraw the proposal ``does not  
diminish in any manner our long-standing support'' for other 
federal laws designed to fight money laundering, the agencies' 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board,  
the Office of Thrift Supervision and the office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, which oversees nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Money launderers should not be encouraged because the ``Know  
Your Customer'' rules are being scrapped, a senior Treasury 
Department official said. The official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said the department is still engaged in ``vigorous 
enforcement'' of existing rules prohibiting money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules were designed to combat money laundering  
techniques used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide 
illegal profits. Money laundering, which is a major concern of law 
enforcement officials, reached an estimated $30 billion in this 
country last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Ax Key Demand on Kosovo Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic's ruling party  
today rejected the key Western demand of a Kosovo peace plan -- 
foreign troops to police it -- even as the Yugoslav president held a 
second emergency meeting with a U.S. special envoy. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes may now be imminent barring a last-minute  
reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on the results of two hours of talks  
between Milosevic and Richard Holbrooke, who failed to change 
Milosevic's position in talks Monday night. But the action by 
Milosevic's party all but slammed the door on chances Yugoslavia 
will accept the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting persisted today in Kosovo between Yugoslav forces and  
ethnic Albanian rebels, and officials remained defiant in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not accepting foreign military troops on our territory  
under any excuse and at any price, even at the price of bombing,'' 
the general-secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, Gorica 
Gajevic, told an emergency session of the Serbian parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	``In case war is imposed on us, we will defend from the  
aggressors with all available means,'' she added. ``And everybody 
must know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ratko Markovic, head of the Serbian delegation at failed peace  
talks in France, dismissed the Western-backed peace plan as invalid 
because it was signed only by the ``separatist terrorist 
organization,'' referring to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliable Serb sources reported fighting today in the northern  
Podujevo area and in the rebel stronghold region of Drenica, the 
focus of a powerful offensive against separatist guerrillas by the 
estimated 40,000 Yugoslav forces in the southern Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center said ethnic Albanians fired on a police  
patrol on the road from Srbica to Glogovac in Drenica with mortars 
and automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was fighting near Vucitrn in the north, the  
Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke went to the presidential palace to meet with Milosevic  
again this morning after four hours of talks Monday. A U.S. source 
speaking on condition of anonymity said Holbrooke returned to the 
U.S. Embassy after today's meeting, presumably for consultations 
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Monday's talks, Holbrooke appeared to hold out little  
hope for a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be misleading you if I suggested that today's talks  
resulted in any substantial change'' in Milosevic's rejection of 
the peace plan, he said earlier today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke had said the clashes in the province between  
government forces and the KLA ``make it extra difficult to pursue 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houses in several villages were seen burning Monday,  
particularly in Drenica. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence also escalated dangerously in Kosovo's capital,  
Pristina, with bomb attacks on two ethnic Albanian-owned cafes 
Monday night killing two people and seriously injuring four. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in over a year of  
fighting in the mostly Albanian-populated province and the U.N. 
refugee agency estimated some 240,000 people are currently 
displaced within Kosovo -- not counting 190,000 who already have 
left the province of 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of Kosovo Albanians trying to flee into neighboring  
Macedonia were stranded at the border today, carrying their 
belongings in bundles, after being turned back by Macedonian 
authorities. Macedonia has been overwhelmed by more than 10,000 
refugees -- including hundreds daily this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian leaders signed a U.S.-drafted peace plan last  
week in Paris. They insisted on the deployment of NATO peacekeepers 
in exchange for giving up their demand for independence for Kosovo. 
Instead, the plan would give them wide autonomy for a three-year 
interim period. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs fear that the autonomy deal -- especially if backed by  
foreign troops -- would be the first step in secession for the 
province, which is the cradle of Serbian culture. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Milosevic was also gambling that opposition from the  
Russians and within Congress might prevent President Clinton from 
carrying through with the threatened airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to meet today at the White House with top lawmakers,  
seeking support for military action in Kosovo and trying to prevent 
the Senate from blocking funds for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov left for Washington  
today for meetings with Clinton. The Interfax news agency, citing 
unidentified sources, said Primakov would return to Moscow if NATO 
begins bombing Yugoslavia before he's scheduled to leave the United 
States on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Cutting Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC nations voted Tuesday to cut crude  
oil production deeply and maintain the reductions for a year, a 
decision that could further drive up the cost of driving, flying 
and shipping products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	However, economists predicted that the U.S. impact will be  
moderate, allowing corporations to remain profitable and putting 
only a minor dent in the buying habits of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is so strong, it's kind of hard to imagine  
consumers scaling back substantially because gasoline prices are up 
a dime,'' said Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities 
International Co. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC, as had been widely anticipated, voted to cut daily  
production by 2.1 million barrels. If the decision sticks -- and 
that's always an open question -- it would decrease the supply of 
oil on world markets by about 2.6 percent, 
</P>
<P>
	Previous OPEC promises to cut production have often been  
undermined by many of its 11 member states that have pumped more 
oil than their individual quotas allowed. However, evidence 
suggested that this time the oil cartel may show greater 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil producing nations have been struggling with budget deficits,  
depleted coffers and other forms of economic pain inflicted by the 
lowest oil prices in more than a decade. Desperate to boost 
revenues, they seem motivated by an exceptional desire to close 
ranks and honor their curtailed production levels in the hope of 
nudging prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few months, there has been considerable talk  
about the inability of oil producers, especially the members of 
OPEC, to respond appropriately to the dire situation facing us,'' 
OPEC President Youcef Yousfi of Algeria acknowledged in a speech to 
fellow ministers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A spirit of cohesion, solidarity and responsibility has  
prevailed amongst us, and oil exporters ... have reached a decision 
which, I believe, goes beyond expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, OPEC will reduce its own oil output by  
1.716 million barrels a day. Non-OPEC producers like Mexico, 
Norway, Russia and Oman will reduce production by an additional 
388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was unanimous, and there were no last minute  
obstacles to the deal, Yousfi said. OPEC members made the deal 
official after an exceptionally short, 20-minute meeting at a 
Vienna hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the heavy lifting necessary to reach the agreement took  
place well before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia and Iran, OPEC's two largest producers, held  
separate talks to resolve one of the main stumbling blocks -- their 
year-long dispute over the base line from which Iran was to make 
production cuts. In a major concession, Saudi Arabia accepted that 
Iran would reduce output from a base line of 3.9 million barrels a 
day instead of 3.6 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	The recently elected government of Venezuela, OPEC's No. 3  
producer, overcame domestic resistance and persuaded politically 
powerful trade unions to accept new cuts in production. 
</P>
<P>
	And two weeks ago, representatives of Saudi Arabia, Iran,  
Venezuela, Algeria and non-member Mexico agreed at a meeting in The 
Hague, Netherlands, to reduce output. 
</P>
<P>
	Once these hurdles were removed, Tuesday's agreement was a  
matter of rubber-stamping the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipation of the OPEC cuts prompted crude prices to rise  
about $3 in the past several weeks, bouncing off 12-year lows 
caused by a world glut of oil and slack demand in recession-wracked 
countries of Asia. Gasoline prices in the United States rose a 
sharp 8 1/2 cents in the past two weeks, following the crude 
increases. Some analysts have predicted the OPEC cuts will cause 
U.S. gas prices to rise an additional 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases are ``extremely likely'' as a result of OPEC's  
agreement, said Fergus McLeod, an oil analyst at BT Alex. Brown. 
McLeod predicted that the price of Brent crude oil on London 
futures markets would rise from about $13 now to at least $16 by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may turn out to be conservative,'' he said. ``If they  
really stick to this for a year, they could end up forcing up the 
market more than they intend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices dropped on world oil markets Tuesday as traders took  
profits following the recent runup. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts noted that OPEC can't raise prices too much or it  
may prompt other countries with higher costs of production to find 
it profitable enough to resume pumping their own oil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, automakers, airlines, truckers, plastics  
companies and other businesses that have benefited from the long 
slump in oil prices are cautiously preparing for higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the stock market -- you never know. I don't know if  
you can count on the OPEC guys to ever stick to their word,'' said 
Rick Todd, president of the 900-member South Carolina Trucking 
Association. ``Most folks are expecting prices to rise, but to what 
extent is just guesswork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compliance with the cuts remains big question with some  
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ishii Yoshiro, an analyst with Japan National Oil Corp., said he  
doubted that compliance would be better than 80 percent. ``One 
hundred percent compliance is physically very difficult,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Anti-Semitic Incidents Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anti-Semitic activity in the United States rose  
2 percent in 1998 after three years of decline, the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the increase was due to a rise in vandalism against  
synagogues and other Jewish property. 
</P>
<P>
	The ADL recorded 1,611 incidents nationwide last year. Of those,  
715 were acts of vandalism, an increase of 6 percent, after a 14 
percent decrease in 1997. The other incidents involved harassment 
of people or groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Foxman, ADL national director, said he is concerned  
about the vandalism but encouraged that there were only 86 
anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses last year, the smallest 
number since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, the state with the largest Jewish population, led with  
177 incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism, but that was down 22 
percent from the year before. New Jersey's 166 incidents 
represented a 25 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Report Praises Pentagon on Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP ) -- A congressional report gives high marks to  
the Pentagon for stepping up its handling of inquiries and 
complaints about Gulf War illnesses, but says its evaluation of 
cases could be improved. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office in a recent report says the Office  
of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illnesses, established in 
1996, has cleared a backlog of 1,200 cases and is handling 
thousands of inquiries a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department ``has made progress in carrying out its  
mandate to comprehensively address Gulf War illnesses-related 
issues,'' said the report, requested by Rep. Lane Evans of 
Illinois, ranking Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, which does nonpartisan research and investigation for  
Congress, said the Pentagon has stepped up its handling of 
complaints and inquiries from veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The military acknowledges that illnesses suffered by thousands  
of veterans are real, but years of study have not come up with 
clear diagnoses or clear evidence of causes. About 100,000 of the 
700,000 American men and women who served in the Persian Gulf in 
1991 say they are sick, and many believe their illnesses are 
related to exposure to chemical or biological warfare agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The new assessment of the Pentagon's handling of the issue notes  
that in 1996 the now-defunct Persian Gulf Illnesses Investigation 
Team operated with a staff of 12 persons and a budget of $4.1 
million and reported to an assistant secretary for health. The new 
office, which reports directly to the deputy secretary of defense, 
has a staff of 200 and a budget of $29.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In looking at six cases reviewed by the Gulf War office, the GAO  
said three of them were flawed by procedural, investigative or 
reporting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the weaknesses, however, GAO investigators agreed with  
the Pentagon's conclusions in all but one case. In that one, it 
said the possibility of exposure to chemical agents should be 
raised from ``unlikely'' to ``indeterminate'' because of 
information overlooked by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	In all cases, flaws appeared to be relatively minor. Some were  
the result of Pentagon investigators not taking advantage of 
available government databases on the health of thousands of Gulf 
War veterans, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also noted that the Gulf War illnesses office has sponsored  
18 town hall meetings with the public and veterans around the 
country and had appeared at 41 national veterans conventions to 
pursue its mission of pursuing complaints and protecting U.S. 
service members.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Agrees To Cut Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today to cut crude  
oil production by 2.1 million barrels a day and maintain lower 
levels of output for a full year starting April 1, oil ministers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 11 oil producing nations approved the cuts in an  
effort to strengthen prices and end a global oil glut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers that you know are the numbers that are agreed,''  
said Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the production cuts, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest  
producer, will slash output by 585,000 barrels of crude a day. 
OPEC's No. 2 producer Iran will curtail output by 264,000 barrels a 
day, while Venezuela will pump 125,000 fewer barrels of oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil prices had already reflected the impact of the expected  
cuts, and industry analysts say refiners of gasoline have wasted no 
time passing on the steeper prices to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that gas prices in North America and the  
rest of the world have risen because of OPEC's decision,'' said 
Doug Terreson of Morgan Stanley, speaking from his office in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to curtail production was reached two weeks ago.  
Crude prices responded by jumping almost $3 a barrel, and gasoline 
prices followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``After it became evident that OPEC was going to cut production,  
the price at the pump really began to move quickly,'' said George 
Gaspar of Robert W. Baird and Co., a financial services firm based 
in Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of all grades of gasoline at U.S. service  
stations surged nearly 8 1/2 cents per gallon over the past two weeks, 
according to the Lundberg Survey, the steepest and fastest increase 
since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices shot up more than 9 percent at self-service pumps in the  
United States, where unleaded regular averaged nearly $1.03 in the 
latest survey, compared with just over 94 cents two weeks ago, 
according to the California-based Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say OPEC's plan to curtail production accounted for at  
least half of the rise in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for more expensive gasoline has been the approach  
of spring, when people usually begin spending more time in their 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision by OPEC to pump less oil will likely cause gasoline  
prices to rise further -- by two to three cents a gallon for every 
additional dollar increase in the price for a barrel of oil, said 
Fergus McLeod of the securities firm BT Alex. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke: Little Progress in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With special envoy Richard Holbrooke reporting  
no real progress in talks with the Yugoslav president, President 
Clinton met today with top lawmakers to seek their support for U.S. 
military action in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is seeking to head off a Senate effort to block  
funds for the mission. A similar effort with lawmakers last Friday 
had mixed results. He invited the same group of about 30 House and 
Senate leaders back today for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials told The Associated Press that  
Holbrooke had made no real progress in his talks with Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic and that no further meetings were 
planned. Even as Milosevic was meeting with Holbrooke, the 
president's ruling party rejected the notion of foreign troops 
policing any peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In what would be a glimmer of hope, however, there was a  
noticeable decline in fighting in the Serbs' military offensive 
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. But the reports were considered 
still too sketchy to draw conclusions from. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes unless the Serbs agree to a peace  
plan that includes a NATO peacekeeping force. The ethnic Albanians 
signed the agreement earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke met for three hours with Milosevic Monday night in the  
Yugoslav capital and then had further meetings today. The U.S. 
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were noticeably 
pessimistic about any chances of a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's foreign policy advisers met here to discuss their next  
moves in what appeared to be a worsening situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its NATO allies have threatened to bomb  
Serbian targets if Milosevic's Serbian side in the Kosovo dispute 
continues to refuse to sign a three-year peace agreement that 
restores some self-rule for the majority ethnic Albanians, which 
signed the agreement last week. The six-nation peace plan also 
calls for a 20,000-member NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo that 
would include up to 4,000 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration aides said Clinton hoped to  
find a way to cool what has been a heated Senate debate over the 
prospect of further U.S. military involvement in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled to take a key procedural vote today on  
legislation by GOP leaders aimed at prohibiting Clinton from using 
U.S. military power in the latest Balkans crisis without first 
getting congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested Monday that, barring a breakthrough in  
Holbrooke's last-minute diplomatic offensive, NATO stands ready to 
go ahead with airstrikes against Serb positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serbia's mounting aggression must be stopped,'' Clinton said.  
``There is strong unity among the NATO allies. We all agree that we 
cannot allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with 
impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton was far from winning such unity from the  
Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong the way we're approaching this,'' said Senate  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The 
president should not use our military power to carry out 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, in Senate debate Monday, asserted that U.S. forces  
could expect to be in Kosovo ``for 50 years'' if Serbia is bombed 
into accepting a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army launched a new offensive in Kosovo over the  
weekend following the failure of the peace talks. More than 2,000 
people have died and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in a 
year of fighting between the government and rebels seeking 
independence for ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Serbia is the main republic of  
what remains of Yugoslavia -- and is under the control of Milosevic 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders in the Senate need 60 votes today to overcome  
procedural roadblocks erected by Democrats allied with the 
administration. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., conceded that Republicans probably 
didn't have the needed 60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But having the debate, and the vote, remained important because  
it enabled senators to go on record on the issue, Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartcki suggested the debate probably would be suspended if  
airstrikes were launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters late Monday he believes 
a majority of senators would support airstrikes -- if it could ever 
come to a straight yes-or-no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have warned Milosevic countless times to halt his fascist  
aggression,'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders were working with the administration  
behind the scenes to see if middle ground could be found to keep 
the Senate debate from undermining last-minute diplomatic efforts, 
or the United States' relations with its NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he had consulted with European leaders over  
the weekend by telephone and had also sent a letter to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has opposed airstrikes. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov was arriving in Washington later today for talks on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Second Reno Photographer Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A second newspaper photographer arrested  
during a car festival riot in Reno last summer has been convicted 
of obstructing and resisting officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Keegan, 26, was found guilty Monday by a municipal judge,  
who fined him $1,230 and ordered to perform 80 hours of community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan, who now works for the Los Angeles Times, was working as  
an intern at the Reno Gazette-Journal during Hot August Nights, 
Reno's annual classic car festival. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested while photographing riots that broke out  
downtown after a festival event. Police arrested 250 people in the 
melee. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said Keegan entered a police perimeter and came within  
a few feet of an officer making an arrest despite admonitions to 
get back. Also, he resisted arrest by failing to put his hands 
behind his back when officers tried to handcuff him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Ryan, Keegan's lawyer, argued the photographer was only  
trying to do his job and had not been specifically ordered to keep 
back from police. He said other photographers were in the area and 
it was questionable whether police had established a recognizable 
perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gazette-Journal's executive editor, Tonia Cunning, said the  
newspaper was considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan was the second former Reno Gazette-Journal photographer  
convicted of charges stemming from the riot. The other, Mark 
Studyvin, pleaded no contest in November to obstructing and 
resisting officers. Studyvin, who left the paper a few weeks after 
the incident, was fined $390.

<HEADLINE> 'Vanity' 888 Numbers Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 140,000 leftover ``vanity''  
toll-free numbers with the 888 prefix will become available to 
consumers and businesses next month, the Federal Communications 
Commission said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are numbers that, for instance, spell a company name,  
product or service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC could not provide examples of vanity numbers that had  
been set aside but will be made available on a first-come, 
first-serve basis April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC had set aside 370,000 vanity numbers using the 888  
prefix because some companies using the same vanity numbers with 
the original 800 prefix wanted them. The FCC had decided to give 
those companies first chance at the vanity number in the 888 
prefix, but they had to act by a certain time. Some 230,000 were 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 140,000 numbers becoming available were the leftovers.  
</P>
<P>
	To obtain one of these numbers, a person or company must contact  
a toll-free service provider, such as AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom or Sprint. 
Those providers will have a list of the available numbers.

<HEADLINE> Regulations Hamper Minority Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress must act to level the field for  
struggling minority businesses lest they become known as the 
``business poor,'' a South Carolina Chamber of Commerce vice 
president told a House hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While such businesses grew substantially between 1987 and 1992,  
according to the Census Bureau, average receipts lagged behind 
those for non-minority firms, witnesses told the House Small 
Business Committee's empowerment panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses owned by minorities also face continued difficulties  
in obtaining loans, meeting regulatory requirements or winning 
federal contracts, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yvonne Simpson, of the Greater Greenville (S.C.) commerce club,  
said business leaders must be challenged to change the status quo. 
She urged the panel to consider creating tax credits for companies 
that purchase goods from minority vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	While the number of black-owned businesses in her area increased  
by almost 98 percent during the five-year period, sales climbed by 
less than a third -- to an average of $38,000 in 1992, Simpson said, 
citing Census Bureau figures. From that sum, businesses must pay 
rent, utilities, taxes and meet other expenses before realizing any 
profit, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about, in a sense, instead of the 'working  
poor,' we have what I consider to be the 'business poor,''' Simpson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the number of minority-owned business increased 62  
percent during the period, said Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald, 
D-Calif. Black-owned companies grew from 424,000 to 621,000, and 
Hispanic-owned businesses went from 422,000 to 772,000, she said, 
citing Census Bureau data. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the growth, average receipts of under $52,000 for  
black-owned businesses and $94,000 for Hispanic companies were far 
behind the $193,000 raked in by the average firm, 
Millender-McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stella Horton, director of entrepreneurship education for EDTEC  
Inc. of Camden, N.J., said education is part of the solution. Her 
company helps teach minority youngsters the skills necessary to 
start and manage a business. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many minority youth, the opportunity (for education) does  
not exist because entrepreneurship is not discussed at their 
breakfast table, if they're fortunate enough to be at a breakfast 
table,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a former business owner, suggested that  
any measures taken to help minority businesses be based on neutral 
factors, such as size or length of time in business, instead of 
race or gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the ``main goal'' is to level the playing field  
because ``the numbers speak for themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Pitcher Paul Toth Dies at 63 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Paul Toth, a National League pitcher in the  
1960s, has died of a heart attack. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Toth, who pitched for the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals,  
had a fatal heart attack Saturday while visiting his brother in 
Anaheim, Calif., said the brother, William Toth 
</P>
<P>
	A right-hander, Toth had a 4-1 record with St. Louis in 1962 and  
was traded to Chicago in 1963, where he went 5-11 over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also spent time in the Chicago White Sox and New York  
Yankees' farm systems. Toth ended his career with the Toledo Mud 
Hens in 1966 when a knee injury forced him from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Toth lived in Erie, Mich.

	Yugoslavia Declare State of Emergency  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Yugoslav government declared a  
state of emergency today because of an ``imminent threat of 
aggression'' from NATO after the failure of the latest Kosovo peace 
mission. A U.S. envoy declared talks with Yugoslavia's president 
over Kosovo a failure today and headed to NATO headquarters, as 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia appeared imminent. Richard 
Holbrooke said he made no real progress in two days of talks with 
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. Holbrooke described the 
situation over Kosovo, where war the past year has left more than 
2,000 people dead, as ``the bleakest since we began this effort 
almost four years ago.'' With NATO airstrikes looming, the U.N.'s 
humanitarian agency and most European Union embassies in Belgrade 
were planning to close.

	Clinton Warns Yugoslavs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Western allies have  
``done everything we could do to solve (the Kosovo crisis) 
peacefully,'' but now NATO is ready to strike Yugoslavia after 
talks ended fruitlessly today. Clinton says U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke ``got nowhere'' in Kosovo peace talks with Yugoslavia 
President Slobodan Milosevic. Clinton said if Milosevic ``is not 
willing to make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make 
war'' on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ``When President Milosevic 
started the war in Bosnia seven years ago, the world did not act 
quickly enough to stop him,'' Clinton said.

	Primakov Postpones Visit to U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov  
abruptly postponed a planned trip to Washington today after he was 
briefed by Vice President Al Gore on unsuccessful diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis. Russia has steadfastly 
opposed threatened NATO airstrikes against Serb targets in the 
province. Gore and Primakov were planning to discuss increased 
economic and technical cooperation between the two nations. 
Primakov also was scheduled to meet with President Clinton.

	Jackson Unlikely To Join 2000 Race

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-time Democratic presidential candidate  
Jesse Jackson apparently will announce tomorrow that he will not 
make a bid for the White House in 2000. Jackson this weekend said 
he was ``not very motivated to at this point'' to challenge Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. Former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced candidate for the 
Democratic nomination.

	McDougal Takes Witness Stand  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Clinton business partner Susan  
McDougal, facing obstruction of justice and contempt charges for 
refusing to answer questions about Whitewater, today agreed to 
answer queries from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors. Mrs. McDougal said 
Clinton's testimony in her 1996 fraud trial was truthful. She also 
said she never discussed with Clinton a fraudulent $300,000 loan in 
her name. Another Whitewater witness, David Hale, has testified 
that Clinton had pressured him to make that loan. Mrs. McDougal has 
already served 18 months in prison for refusing to answer questions 
about the Whitewater land deal.

	NJ Seeks To Recover From Y2K Glitch

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A Y2K computer glitch delivered a windfall

accidentally credited with millions of dollars in food assistance 
allotments. A spokesman for New Jersey's Department of Human 
Services said a test Sunday to determine whether a state welfare 
computer was protected from the so-called millennium bug caused the 
error. As much as $58 million may have been involved. Grocery 
stores in the area were crowded with people eager to take advantage 
of the error involving electronic benefits.

interest rates. Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were 
down 170.95 to 9,719.56. Declining issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange led advancers 2,302-638. The Nasdaq was down 56.14 to

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants, seeking a  
pass-catching tight end, signed free agent Pete Mitchell, who 
started every game for the Jacksonville Jaguars last season. 
Mitchell has 166 catches in his four NFL seasons and caught 38 
balls last year, more than twice the total of all of the Giants' 
tight ends.

<HEADLINE> States, Feds Create `Cyberforce' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To fight Internet investment scams, state  
regulators are going undercover online and federal authorities have 
a ``Cyberforce'' that does electronic surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, however, face a daunting task in combating growing  
instances of Internet fraud with limited resources, top officials 
said Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs 
subcommittee on investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue to be vigilant,'' promised Richard  
Walker, the Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement 
director. He acknowledged, though, that with 850 attorneys and 
other enforcement employees nationwide to pursue all types of 
financial fraud, ``We are certainly challenged, if not strained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mushrooming use of the Internet by financial con artists has  
forced the SEC to take resources away from other fraud areas, 
Walker said. The other areas would include conventional stock 
manipulations and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the top cop for the SEC said the commission is  
examining the advertisements of electronic day-trading firms to see 
if they make unrealistic promises to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The firms sell training courses and special software programs to  
ordinary investors who want to try the risky, lightning-speed 
practice of day trading, exploiting small price movements in stocks 
to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency last July set up a ``Cyberforce'' of 125 people who  
pore through the Internet on the lookout for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters  
anywhere in the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and entice 
thousands of investors ``with the click of a mouse,'' noted Sen. 
Susan Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the investigative panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Collins said she would consider drafting legislation  
designed to help securities regulators in fighting online fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks now can be promoted fraudulently in Internet junk mail,  
online newsletters, electronic ``chat rooms'' and Web sites. 
Promoters don't have to give potential investors the hard sell over 
the telephone in unsolicited calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid growth in online securities fraud ``could ultimately  
place a significant burden on the regulators' limited investigative 
staff resources and thereby limit the agencies' capacity to respond 
effectively,'' congressional investigators concluded in a new 
report released by the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Compounding the problem, the SEC has been losing many of its  
enforcement attorneys in recent years to the more lucrative private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators also are feeling the pinch.  
</P>
<P>
	``There will never be enough regulators to keep the online world  
free from fraud and abuse,'' testified Peter Hildreth, president of 
the North American Securities Administrators Association, which 
represents the state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators, unlike their federal counterparts, have the  
authority to go undercover to detect fraud on the Internet. They 
can establish e-mail addresses to go ``shopping'' for fraudulent 
stock solicitations in pursuing enforcement cases. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC attorneys and aides are required by federal privacy laws to  
identify themselves on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a ``limitation,'' Walker said. He added, however, that a  
great deal of fraudulent activity had been discovered through 
electronic surveillance, as opposed to participation. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the SEC made the first-ever nationwide sweep against  
stock touters on the Internet who failed to disclose they were paid 
to make the promotions. The agency filed fraud charges against 44 
people and companies, following up in February with charges against 
another nine people and four firms.

<HEADLINE> Actor Found Dead in Vegas Motel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Strickland, who played the music critic  
on the NBC sitcom ``Suddenly Susan'' and had a role in the new 
movie ``Forces of Nature,'' was found dead in a motel room, his 
publicist and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker at the Oasis Motel found Strickland's body hanging from  
a bed sheet strung from a ceiling beam Monday, motel owner Peter 
Napoli said. A chair was next to the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the death as a suicide, police  
spokesman Steve Meriwether said. Strickland was identified by his 
publicist, Marisa McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland, 28, played Todd on NBC's ``Suddenly Susan,'' which  
stars Brooke Shields as a magazine writer. He had been on the show 
for the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland also appears in ``Forces of Nature,'' starring Sandra  
Bullock and Ben Affleck. Strickland played the ex-boyfriend of 
Affleck's fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the news of David Strickland's death  
and our condolences and support go out to his family and friends,'' 
NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., and moved to Pacific  
Palisades near Los Angeles while he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked on a number of student films and appeared in episodes  
of the television shows ``Roseanne'' and ``Dave's World.'' He also 
had recurring roles on ``Sister, Sister'' and ``Mad About You.''

<HEADLINE> Justice Pressed on Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Civil rights leaders are calling for a White  
House summit on police brutality and other aspects of the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Jackson and other leaders also asked Attorney General  
Janet Reno on Monday to visit New York City, where officers shot at 
unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo 41 times on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``We long for the presence and the face of this department,''  
Jackson told reporters after the group met privately for 75 minutes 
with Reno and aides at the Justice Department. ``We also seek a 
major White House summit on criminal justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diallo case and others in New York City are under  
investigation by the Justice Department's civil rights division and 
the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, said action is required to head off 
possible civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried to explain in the clearest of terms to the attorney  
general why we are one step away from major problems in our country 
with respect to possible civil unrest around this issue of police 
brutality and excessive use of force and why it's very, very 
important that the Justice Department find a way to step up its 
involvement in this issue,'' Mfume said. ``The president has to do 
more than make a radio address on this subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume, Jackson and leaders of groups representing Latinos,  
Asian-Americans, Jews, gays and lesbians and native Americans cited 
controversial police killings or beatings of minorities in New York 
City, California and the Pittsburgh area in recent years and 
growing use nationwide of practices that they said unfairly target 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and White House Domestic Policy Council chief Bruce Reed  
promised to relay their concerns to President Clinton, Justice 
spokesman Myron Marlin said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	National Urban League President Hugh Price said in the last two  
years in New York City, 45,000 people have been stopped and frisked 
but 37,000 of them were released without charges. Courts later 
threw out the charges against half of the 8,000 who were charged, 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state authorities recently expanded their  
investigation of the New York City Police Department to include the 
Street Crime Unit, four of whose members shot and killed Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ``has set a very explosive  
climate in New York,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a city council hearing Monday, Giuliani's police  
commissioner, Howard Safir, testified that despite criticisms of 
its tactics, the Street Crime Unit has an excellent record for 
removing guns from violent neighborhoods. He said the entire 
380-member unit has taken refresher courses in cultural diversity, 
courtesy and respect training, and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, there were 41,000 arrests in one recent year under  
an anti-loitering statute that uses personal appearance as a basis 
for arrest, said Yvonne Scruggs Leftwich of the National Black 
Leadership Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, meanwhile, Ron Daniels, head of the Center for  
Constitutional Rights, said Monday his group plans a march on 
Washington to highlight police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said the National Emergency March for Justice is set for  
April 3, marking the 31st anniversary of the assassination of the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``For far too long the federal government has been silent in the  
face of the growing outcry against the harassment, intimidation, 
brutalization and senseless killing of people in communities of 
color,'' Daniels said. ``While we appreciate the fact that 
President Clinton was finally persuaded to speak out on this issue, 
his recommendations are woefully inadequate.''

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Oil Cuts' Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- OPEC is hoping its planned production cuts will  
boost long-slumping oil prices, which could hurt businesses and 
consumers who have been enjoying low energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists are optimistic that any future oil price  
increases won't be big enough to drastically affect corporate 
profits, and they believe low inflation and strong consumer 
spending will continue even with prices at the gasoline pump moving 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy is so strong, it's kind of hard to imagine  
consumers scaling back substantially because gasoline prices are up 
a dime,'' said Dan Seto, an economist with Nikko Securities 
International Co. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC nations voted Tuesday to cut crude oil production by 2.1  
million barrels and maintain the reductions for a year. If the 
decision sticks, it would decrease the supply of oil on world 
markets by about 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, OPEC will reduce its own oil output by  
1.716 million barrels a day. Non-OPEC producers like Mexico, 
Norway, Russia and Oman will reduce production by an additional 
388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	American oil companies hope the cutbacks will bring rising  
energy prices to reverse their slumping profits, which have forced 
them to lay off thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But for prices to rise steadily, members of the Organization of  
the Petroleum Exporting Countries must prove they will not revert 
to the cheating that has undercut past promises to slash 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, automakers, airlines, truckers, plastics makers  
and other businesses that have benefited from the long slump in oil 
prices are cautiously preparing for higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the stock market -- you never know. I don't know if  
you can count on the OPEC guys to ever stick to their word,'' said 
Rick Todd, president of the 900-member South Carolina Trucking 
Association. ``Most folks are expecting prices to rise, but to what 
extent is just guesswork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil is trading in the  
$15 range, up from around $12 a month ago and a 12-year low of 
$10.72 in December. Analysts expect OPEC cuts could boost the price 
to about $17 per barrel by year's end, which they consider a modest 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	At the pump, the national average gasoline price shot up almost  
8 1/2 cents a gallon to $1.09 in the past two weeks, but it still 
remains near historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts expect pump prices to rise another 10 cents per  
gallon this year, but economists believe that would still have 
limited impact on consumers' spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to be a severe hardship, but at the  
margin it's probably going to slow their spending a bit for other 
items,'' said Gary Thayer, an economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	One industry in particular that could suffer from higher energy  
prices is tourism, as airline prices could pass on higher fuel 
prices to consumers and weekend driving trips that have become more 
frequent recently could be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Frohman, proprietor of the Grunberg Haus Bed &AMP;  
Breakfast in Waterbury, Vt., said he doesn't see low gas prices as 
a major factor in his business. Frohman said this ski season has 
been his best, but he attributed that more to favorable weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my guests driving up my driveway in larger and larger  
vehicles, so whatever savings they have in the price per gallon 
they seem to be using up in the poor mileage of the vehicles 
they're driving,'' Frohman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Woodward, a partner at Deloitte Consulting, said that  
other businesses could actually thrive amid rising energy prices if 
they translate into more hiring in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those individuals will be spending their dollars on goods and  
services produced by other industries,'' Woodward said. ``The 
overall impact will be positive on the U.S. economy.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Wilson Vows To Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- An emotional Paul Wilson vowed  
Tuesday to return from the latest setback in his injury filled 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career is not over. I haven't given up,'' Wilson said, a  
day after learning he tore a ligament in his right elbow and needs 
reconstructive surgery. ``I'm still a relatively young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 25, was the top pick in the 1994 amateur draft. Mets  
physician Dr. David Altchek recommended the surgery, but Wilson 
wants to consult Dr. James Andrews before agreeing to the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out everything I can about this particular kind  
of surgery,'' Wilson said. ``As I understand it there are two types 
of procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has not pitched in the major leagues since 1996.  
Following surgery on his right shoulder, he wasn't able to pitch in 
1997. He had an elbow injury last year and pitched in the minor 
leagues for just 57 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He was designated to start the season at Triple-A Norfolk but  
felt pain while warming up Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A one point I thought something was wrong,'' Wilson said.  
``But with bone chips in my elbow, I just assumed it was the 
problem I knew was in there and it was something that I was 
prepared to deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said Friday's pain wasn't quite the same, but he still  
threw three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a doctor, although I did know it was a different pain  
in my arm,'' Wilson said. ``I hear a lot of stories about guys 
blowing their arms out and not being able to throw the ball five 
feet. I was able to go out there and pitch. I was able to throw, I 
guess. I can't call that pitching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said he takes comfort in knowing that other current and  
former teammates have recovered from the same type of surgery. Bill 
Pulsipher, now with Milwaukee, and Jason Isringhausen have had the 
ligament replacement surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all trying to do the same thing. We're all trying to be  
big leaguers. Some of us just take a little longer than others,'' 
Wilson said. ``It's going to take more than this to beat me.''

<HEADLINE> MSU Coach: We Can Beat Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State knows all too well how  
powerful Duke can be. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Spartans played the Blue Devils in December, Duke  
scored the first 13 points and had a 17-point lead three times in 
the opening nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Spartans managed to make a game of it, closing within  
three points before finally losing 73-67 in the Great Eight in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the troubles early in that game, Michigan State coach  
Tom Izzo said he believes the loss will help the Spartans when they 
face Duke Saturday at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you some confidence that you played decent against a  
team,'' Izzo said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at least our players know their personnel. Our players  
know what to expect. They know what they do offensively and 
defensively, so there won't be a lot of surprises anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Izzo admires Duke's program, its coach and its team, he  
isn't writing off Michigan State's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said that his gritty Spartans, come-from-behind victors  
Sunday over Kentucky, shouldn't be ruled out. Michigan State can be 
tough enough to handle the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger upset than Michigan State beating Duke,''  
Izzo said. ``All I have to do is make sure our kids understand 
that. And knowing these players and knowing their toughness, I'm 
sure we're not going in there scared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nervous, maybe. Scared, no.''  
</P>
<P>
	The winner between No. 1-rated Duke (36-1) and No. 2 Michigan  
State (33-4) advances to the championship Monday night, to face 
either Ohio State or Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said Michigan State matches up with Duke somewhat, at least  
in size. And even though Duke has been the dominant team in college 
hoops this season, he has hopes for a big upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no doubt we're going to be an underdog, but we've been  
the underdog before,'' he said. ``I'm really looking forward to it; 
I really am. I'm not looking forward to it in a cocky way, thinking 
that hey, we're just going to go out and beat Duke, but in a 
confident way where I think we can do some things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Spartans want some inspiration, they and their fans don't  
have to look further than Sunday's game, in which Michigan State 
rebounded from an early 13-point deficit to slam dunk a 73-66 win 
over Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember: A slow start and a good ending is a lot better than  
a fast start and a bad ending,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State may pick up an edge from happy Spartans fans.  
After Sunday's victory, the team returned to Lansing around 
midnight to find about 300 fans crowding the airport, and Izzo 
could sense the enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was such an emotional event ... seeing all those  
people out there at 12:30 at night,'' he said. ``I think the campus 
is electric right now; people are caught up in the spirit of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only the students, but this entire community has kind of  
taken a grasp of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those caught up in the green-and-white spirit are former  
Spartans players and coaches, many of whom have shown up to root on 
this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching from the stands in St. Louis on Sunday, among others,  
were Magic Johnson and former coach Jud Heathcote, who guided 
Johnson and the Spartans to the NCAA title in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great he took the time to come back,'' Izzo said of  
Heathcote. And, he said, Johnson ``thinks we can win it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of faith in what he thinks, so I'll just go with  
that,'' Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State is scheduled to leave Thursday morning for St.  
Petersburg.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Won't Pursue Hershiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Orel Hershiser's agent told the  
Phillies on Tuesday that the 40-year-old right-hander had better 
offers, causing Philadelphia to end its longtime pursuit of the 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent that we were not the first choice, so  
there's no sense prolonging it,'' Phillies general manager Ed Wade 
said. ``I'm disappointed. I would have liked to have added him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Hershiser rejected the Phillies' first offer of  
$850,000 guaranteed and $2 million if he pitched 200 innings. He 
opted instead to sign a minor league contract with the Indians -- 
his team from 1995-97 -- and seek a better offer from teams more 
likely to play in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade resubmitted his offer on Sunday after the Indians told  
Hershiser he wasn't likely to make their club. This time, the 
Phillies GM was willing to offer more guaranteed money but wouldn't 
budge from the $2 million figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a couple of clubs out there with offers that I  
wasn't prepared to match,'' Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the teams believed to be interested are Florida, Tampa  
Bay, Atlanta and the Chicago Cub. Hershiser made $3.7 million, 
including bonuses, last year with the Giants. He was 11-10 with a 
4.41 ERA, pitching 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser's agent, Robert Fraley, did not return a telephone  
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies first started courting Hershiser last winter and  
stepped up their pursuit this spring. Hershiser, the 1988 NL Cy 
Young Award winner and one of the top postseason pitchers in 
baseball history, is closing in on 200 career victories -- a figure 
he is confident will give him a shot at the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He's decided there are better places to pursue that goal than  
Philadelphia. Hershiser continues to work out at the Indians' camp 
in Winter Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a good club,'' Wade said. ``If you sit down  
and analyze where we are with our starting lineup and some of our 
starting pitchers, I don't think this is an unattractive place to 
pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade acknowledged that chances of trading for a starting pitcher  
before the end of camp were deteriorating rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pitching market is very, very quiet,'' Wade said. ``Clubs  
that we thought would have done something are sending signals that 
they may not be doing anything in terms of pitching.''

<HEADLINE> Study Eyes Humanitarian Crises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Major humanitarian crises around the world  
are most often caused by governments trying to keep wealth and 
political power in the hands of a few, U.N. researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The research debunks popularly held beliefs that such  
emergencies are caused by deteriorating environmental conditions 
and insufficient natural resources to feed and care for people, 
researchers said Monday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors are often a source of economic hardship but are  
not the root causes for humanitarian catastrophes, which are 
largely man-made, researchers said in presenting a policy paper 
from the United Nations University's World Institute for 
Development Economics Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper defines a complex humanitarian emergency as a man-made  
crisis in which large numbers of people die from war, displacement 
and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing which is very clear: that humanitarian emergencies  
don't take place in democracies,'' said Raimo Vayrynen, a 
contributor to the study and a political science professor at the 
University of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	Of a dozen developing countries studied in the three-year  
research project, only two cases of crises occurred in democracies: 
Sri Lanka and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Most often, the humanitarian emergency occurred in countries  
with single-party rule or a military junta, and where the country 
itself was highly militarized, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In those cases, such as in Rwanda and Burundi, historic  
animosities among groups were exploited to spark mobilization to 
fight, the research said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, crises most often occurred when a single group had  
the most access to the country's wealth, and where the disparities 
in incomes were highest. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the case studies found that the conflict that sparked  
the humanitarian disaster was ``intended as a means of private 
accumulation by leaders, with ethnicity -- or other cementing 
ideology -- being used as an instrument to gain support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In suggesting ways the international community could reduce the  
threat of humanitarian crises, the researchers called for early 
intervention in vulnerable countries, where the economic and 
political inequalities might foment a crisis if it is sparked. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper also called for debt reduction, and international aid  
to be distributed across all sections of society.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Faded Hope / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated  
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as Russia's prime minister 
canceled meetings in the United States, dashing hopes for 
announcement of a new food aid package. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov decided while en route  
to Washington to cancel his trip after he was briefed by Vice 
President Al Gore on unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to resolve the 
Kosovo crisis. Russia has been opposed to NATO plans for airstrikes 
against Serbian targets in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt decision dashed hopes the Clinton administration  
would take the opportunity of Primakov's visit to announce new food 
aid to cash-starved Russia. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
a day earlier had signaled the administration is seriously 
considering new donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by increased farmer  
selling that came after Monday's rally in prices. Wheat was 
pressured by improving crop conditions in China and the southern 
Plains, at a time of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.82 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.28 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.15 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 6 cents to $4.93 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while lean hogs were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .40 cent to 67.40 cents a pound; April  
feeder cattle rose .05 cent to 71.75 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
fell .43 cent to 44.02 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose 1.55 
cents to 56 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Jurors See Tape of Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today watched a videotape of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas Youk, the man 
with Lou Gehrig's disease he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape started with Kevorkian interviewing Youk, 52, about his  
illness, which forced him to use a feeding tube and was 
progressively depriving him of control of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On camera, Kevorkian asks Youk if he wants to go ahead and end  
his life. Youk indicates he does, and Kevorkian hands him a pen to 
sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait a week and see how you feel in a week. Is that all  
right with you, Tom?'' Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape resumes later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then begins preparing an intravenous line for Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to inject. We're going to inject in your right  
arm,'' Kevorkian says. A hand is shown injecting drugs into Youk's 
intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a straight line. ... His heart is stopped,''  
Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance in the Sept. 17, 1998, death of Youk. Portions 
of the video of Youk's death were shown in November on CBS' ``60 
Minutes;'' today, jurors saw the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Monday with selection of a jury of 12 members  
and two alternates, followed by opening arguments. Kevorkian, 
acting as his own attorney, gave the defense statement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise a human being dying at my hands. But my intent isn't  
to kill a person. I am forced by my position as a physician to do 
this,'' Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury was not present to hear most of Kevorkian's  
argument. Less than three minutes into his statement, Oakland 
County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski objected, contending 
that Kevorkian was arguing law, rather than summarizing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper agreed, saying Kevorkian needed to  
argue the facts, not the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, a retired pathologist who says he's been present for  
more than 130 deaths, insists he committed no crime. He 
rhetorically asked jurors why he would have recorded Youk's death 
had he thought it murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone with reason or common sense believe I would do all  
that knowing it was a crime and give it to `60 Minutes'?'' 
Kevorkian said. ``My intent was not to murder Tom Youk, and the 
evidence will show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, has faced trial four times before on assisted  
suicide charges, with cases ending in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	He dared prosecutors to do something about the Youk case. A  
conviction would mean a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	in his statement, Skrzynski urged the jury to remember that  
despite the publicity surrounding Kevorkian, the defendant is not 
above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Begin to focus on what Jack Kevorkian does, and what Jack  
Kevorkian says, and what you will see is a man breaking the law,'' 
Skrzynski said. ``Jack Kevorkian killed Tom Youk, and Jack 
Kevorkian does not have the right to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski said Youk's death does not qualify as an assisted  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Youk did not kill himself with Jack Kevorkian's help. Jack  
Kevorkian killed Tom Youk by injecting him with drugs,'' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	While representing himself, Kevorkian will be allowed to consult  
with lawyers David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer. Defending himself, he 
said, was ``what I've planned all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge expressed misgivings about allowing Kevorkian to serve  
as his own lawyer, asking him, ``Do you understand you could spend 
the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.

<HEADLINE> Recalling Buckeyes' Last Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Thirty-one years later, and Mike Swain  
still can't forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State was playing Kentucky in Lexington in an NCAA regional  
final. The Wildcats in 1968 were led by Dan Issel, but this was 
Ohio State's day. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Sorenson took an inbounds pass and banked in a short jumper  
with three seconds left, giving the Buckeyes an 82-81 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of silent,'' said Swain, a reserve on that team.  
``A kid who had been on the team, Darrell Brautigam, put me up on 
his shoulders so we could go out and cut the nets down. But a cop 
came out and said to get away from them. They wouldn't even let us 
cut their nets down in Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That victory vaulted the Buckeyes into a killer Final Four that  
featured No. 1 Houston, No. 2 UCLA and No. 3 North Carolina. It was 
the last time Ohio State played in a Final Four until this weekend 
when the Buckeyes meet Connecticut on Saturday night in St. 
Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and Elvin Hayes had outdueled coach John Wooden's Lew  
Alcindor-led Bruins earlier in the season before 52,693 fans at the 
Astrodome. Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds and 
outplayed UCLA's Lew Alcindor. Alcindor, who later became Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar, finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and UCLA met again in another showdown in the  
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played North Carolina in the first game and it was sort of  
like a junior varsity game,'' Ohio State captain Bill Hosket said. 
``Everybody wanted the rematch. And the tournament was in L.A., so 
it was a huge event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Taylor had coached Ohio State to three consecutive NCAA  
championship games, from 1960-62. Those teams were led by Jerry 
Lucas, John Havlicek and Mel Nowell. 
</P>
<P>
	When Taylor made it back to the national semifinals six years  
later, the unranked and unknown Buckeyes didn't have a marquee 
player. They had come out of nowhere, much like the current team, 
which was last in the Big Ten a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1968 Buckeyes featured the 6-foot-7 Hosket, 6-7 Sorenson,  
burly 6-5 Steve Howell and 6-3 Jody Finney, along with point guard 
Denny Meadors. Off the bench came Swain, Ed Smith, Bruce Schnabel, 
Jim Geddes, Dan Andreas and Craig Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always kidded coach Taylor that that team put him in the  
Hall of Fame,'' Hosket said. ``When you have Lucas and Havlicek, 
you're expected to go to the NCAA tournament. But to get there with 
four centers and Meadors -- that showed he could coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The freshmen team, in the days when freshmen weren't eligible to  
play four seasons, actually had more stars. It included future NBA 
player Jim Cleamons along with a guard named Rex Kern, who would 
quarterback Ohio State to the national championship in football 
later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes tied Iowa for the Big Ten title, but since the  
conference could send only one representative to the NCAA 
tournament, Ohio State met the Hawkeyes in a playoff game in West 
Lafayette, Ind. Ohio State won 85-81 and then edged East Tennessee 
79-72 in the regional semifinal before stunning Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina featured Charlie Scott and Larry Miller and was  
coached by Dean Smith. The Tar Heels pressed the slower Buckeyes, 
built an early lead and were never threatened. Miller had 20 points 
and Bill Bunting 17 points in the 80-66 North Carolina victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In the main event, UCLA avenged its only loss, routing Houston  
101-69. Alcindor scored 19 points and had 18 rebounds while holding 
Hayes to 10 points and five rebounds. Houston was playing without 
starting point guard George Reynolds because the NCAA did not then 
permit junior-college transfers to play in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In the championship game, the Bruins rolled over North Carolina  
78-55 for their fourth title in five years and second in a string 
of seven in a row under Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship game then was preceded by a consolation game  
between the semifinal losers. Houston, which came into the Final 
Four 31-0 and ranked No. 1, ended with back-to-back losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State downed the Cougars 89-85 behind Howell's 26 points  
and 13 rebounds. Sorenson had 19 points and Hosket 19 points and 17 
rebounds. Hayes was back in form with 34 points and 16 rebounds, 
but still ended his college career on a down note. 
</P>
<P>
	``The highlight of that tournament for me was beating Kentucky  
on its home floor, and then beating Houston to feel like we 
belonged,'' Hosket said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are great memories. I just told someone the other night  
that these kids on this year's Ohio State team are creating their 
own memories now. Regardless of what happens from now on, they'll 
have these memories the rest of their lives.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Reliever Adams Has MRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Uh-oh, another Chicago Cubs pitcher is  
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Terry Adams was scratched from Tuesday's game against  
the Milwaukee Brewers pending results of an MRI. The right-hander, 
who had 18 saves two years ago but struggled with his control last 
year, had a ``dead arm'' after pitching last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned,'' manager Jim Riggleman said. ``He's a  
very talented guy that's a big part of our bullpen. We just kind of 
hold our breath and wait for the results. ... (But) he's feeling 
real good, and he's throwing real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Tuesday morning he planned to pitch, but general  
manager Ed Lynch said later the Cubs wanted to wait for the MRI. 
Team doctors in Chicago are studying the MRI, with results expected 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the MRI is fine, Adams said he'll throw in batting practice,  
take a day off and then hopefully pitch in a game this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching has been a sore spot for the Cubs this spring training.  
Kerry Wood, baseball's brightest young pitcher, learned a week ago 
that he needs ligament replacement surgery and will miss the entire 
season. He threw just 26 pitches in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who struck out 20 against Houston last May 6 to tie Roger  
Clemens' record for a nine-inning game, has had a tender elbow 
since the Cubs drafted him out of high school in June 1995. He 
missed all of last September while it was sore, returning to throw 
five innings in the Cubs' final playoff game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	And closer Rod Beck, one of just five relievers in major league  
history to reach 50 saves in one season, has missed almost three 
weeks because of a protruding disc in his lower back. He's 
scheduled to pitch Friday for the first time since the opening 
exhibition game.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Jurors See Tape of Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today watched a videotape of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas Youk, the man 
with Lou Gehrig's disease he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape started with Kevorkian interviewing Youk, 52, about his  
illness, which forced him to use a feeding tube and was 
progressively depriving him of control of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On camera, Kevorkian asks Youk if he wants to go ahead and end  
his life. Youk indicates he does, and Kevorkian hands him a pen to 
sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait a week and see how you feel in a week. Is that all  
right with you, Tom?'' Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape resumes later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then begins preparing an intravenous line for Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to inject. We're going to inject in your right  
arm,'' Kevorkian says. A hand is shown injecting drugs into Youk's 
intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a straight line. ... His heart is stopped,''  
Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance in the Sept. 17, 1998, death of Youk. Portions 
of the video of Youk's death were shown in November on CBS' ``60 
Minutes;'' today, jurors saw the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Monday with selection of a jury of 12 members  
and two alternates, followed by opening arguments. Kevorkian, 
acting as his own attorney, gave the defense statement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise a human being dying at my hands. But my intent isn't  
to kill a person. I am forced by my position as a physician to do 
this,'' Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury was not present to hear most of Kevorkian's  
argument. Less than three minutes into his statement, Oakland 
County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski objected, contending 
that Kevorkian was arguing law, rather than summarizing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper agreed, saying Kevorkian needed to  
argue the facts, not the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, a retired pathologist who says he's been present for  
more than 130 deaths, insists he committed no crime. He 
rhetorically asked jurors why he would have recorded Youk's death 
had he thought it murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone with reason or common sense believe I would do all  
that knowing it was a crime and give it to `60 Minutes'?'' 
Kevorkian said. ``My intent was not to murder Tom Youk, and the 
evidence will show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, has faced trial four times before on assisted  
suicide charges, with cases ending in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	He dared prosecutors to do something about the Youk case. A  
conviction would mean a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	in his statement, Skrzynski urged the jury to remember that  
despite the publicity surrounding Kevorkian, the defendant is not 
above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Begin to focus on what Jack Kevorkian does, and what Jack  
Kevorkian says, and what you will see is a man breaking the law,'' 
Skrzynski said. ``Jack Kevorkian killed Tom Youk, and Jack 
Kevorkian does not have the right to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski said Youk's death does not qualify as an assisted  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Youk did not kill himself with Jack Kevorkian's help. Jack  
Kevorkian killed Tom Youk by injecting him with drugs,'' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	While representing himself, Kevorkian will be allowed to consult  
with lawyers David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer. Defending himself, he 
said, was ``what I've planned all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge expressed misgivings about allowing Kevorkian to serve  
as his own lawyer, asking him, ``Do you understand you could spend 
the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.

<HEADLINE> Australian IOC Member Won't Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Phil Coles insists he won't resign from  
the IOC and contends there is a plot to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that there is a conspiracy involved, we're getting  
information about that at the moment,'' Coles told a Sydney radio 
station. ``There is an element out to destroy me for other 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' remarks came after the John Hancock insurance company, a  
major Olympic sponsor, urged him to resign from the IOC and 
Sydney's organizing committee for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Australian was severely censured by the IOC for  
accepting excessive hospitality from the Salt Lake City bidders 
that won the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He is under further investigation by the IOC following his  
ex-wife's claims that he took jewelry from a Greek businessman 
associated with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is time for Mr. Coles to do the right thing and resign  
from the IOC,'' John Hancock chief David D'Alessandro said Monday. 
``He is damaging the movement worldwide as well as Australia's 
outstanding efforts to stage what will be extraordinary games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the board of the Sydney organizers, including president  
Michael Knight, is pressuring Coles to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles told the Sydney radio station he thinks some disenchanted  
members of Melbourne's failed bid for the 1996 Games might be 
behind the plan to oust him from the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they blame me for losing the bid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles' former wife, Georgina Coles, told the IOC that Coles  
received jewelry worth about $6,300. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said the Sydney organizers have a ``lot more money  
to raise'' ahead of the games, and Coles could help by walking 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG does not need unnecessary clouds over the rings making  
it harder to sign new sponsors or win additional support from 
existing sponsors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is one of an elite group that pays $50 million  
every four years for the rights to use the Olympic rings to 
advertise its products. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro criticized the IOC leadership following the  
findings of the Salt Lake City ethics inquiry. He said he was 
removing the rings from official company reports and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in advertising to protest the IOC's failure to deal 
with the corruption scandal.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Give Brien Taylor a Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Brien Taylor has another chance, maybe his  
last. Nearly eight years after the New York Yankees made him the 
top pick in the amateur draft, he still hasn't thrown a pitch in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old pitcher wrecked his shoulder in a fight five  
years ago in a fight with a childhood friend, wiping away his 99 
mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees let him go after the 1998 season, and now he's with  
the Seattle Mariners, who signed him two months ago with the hope 
he can salvage something from his derailed career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lefty and I still bring the ball 90,'' he says. ``I've  
had some things that have discouraged me, but I'm a strong believer 
in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Yankees signed him, they gave him a $1.55 million  
bonus, a record at the time for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	But lately, Taylor's numbers look ugly. After his shoulder  
surgery, he spent 1995 with Tampa and the following three years 
with Greensboro, both Single-A teams in the Yankees farm system. 
His records were 2-5, 0-5, 1-4 and 0-1, and his ERAs were 6.08, 
18.73, 14.33 and 9.59. Rival fans sometimes taunted him about his 
lost heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brien needs to have some success real bad,'' says Benny  
Looper, the Mariners director of player development. ``We're 
looking at what he can be, not what he is right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor struck out 476 batters in 239 innings in high school at  
Beaufort, N.C., going 29-6 with a 1.25 ERA. He was 6-8 with a 2.57 
at Class-A Fort Lauderdale in 1992 and 13-7 with a 3.48 ERA at 
Double-A Albany the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was that fastball: 187 strikeouts in 161 1-3 innings  
during his first pro season, 150 in 163 innings during his second. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came Dec. 18, 1993, the day that altered his career. He  
got involved in a fight involving Ron Wilson, a former friend who 
was on parole, and his brother, Brenden. Brien Taylor wound up with 
a torn capsule and a torn labrum and was charged with misdemeanor 
counts of assault and communicating threats, counts dismissed 11 
months later by a Carteret County District Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Brien Taylor declined to talk about the details of the fight. A  
police report said it happened after Taylor went after two men who 
attacked his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, it was a freak happening,'' he says. ``I was always  
pretty much never in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He saved his money and says he doesn't need to play any more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it now as if it was meant to happen and I accept it.  
Beating myself up in the head didn't last as long because of the 
type of person I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he returned, he wasn't the same pitcher. Going from premier  
prospect to a struggling minor leaguer was a hard adjustment to 
make psychologically. He pitched in pain during his first two 
seasons after Dr. Frank Jobe operated on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty much of a wreck,'' Taylor says. ``Before, even  
when you made mistakes, you did the right thing because you were so 
strong and so much better than everybody else because of your hard 
fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle, desperate for pitching, signed him as a minor league  
free agent on Jan. 19 
</P>
<P>
	``What we saw last summer was arm strength,'' Looper says.  
``He's a left-hander with arm strength. We thought a change of 
scenery might help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Seattle sees progress this year, the Mariners will add him to  
their 40-man major league roster after this season. If not, 
Taylor's baseball career may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Under major league rules, the Mariners have one year to find out  
if they want to keep him. If they see enough potential in him, they 
will put him on their 40-man roster at the end of the season. If 
not, they will bid him goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	He could start in Peoria at extended spring training. Or the  
Mariners could send him to Single-A or Double-A. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a command problem. I would say he is a project,''  
Looper says. ``We need to see this summer what Brien's going to be 
down the road.''

<HEADLINE>  Refugees Flee Indonesia Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGKAWANG, Indonesia (AP) -- Given how brutal the ethnic  
violence had been in Borneo and how outnumbered they were, the 
Indonesian soldiers took no chances. 
</P>
<P>
	They waited until nightfall before loading the hundreds of  
refugees who had fled their burned-out villages aboard a dozen 
heavily guarded trucks outside government headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't get away that easy Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Within moments, about 100 people, some armed with spears,  
converged on the departing trucks. The soldiers opened fire with 
plastic bullets, and only after injuring at least one of the 
assailants and driving the others back did the soldiers manage to 
evacuate the refugees from Singkawang town. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200 people have been killed in ethnic violence that  
broke out in an Indonesian region of Borneo island last week. 
Ethnic Malay and Dayak fighters behind the attacks have driven 
thousands of Madurese immigrants out of their villages. 
</P>
<P>
	In some areas, gangs of Malay fighters who had set Madurese  
homes on fire could be seen parading through the streets carrying 
the heads of their decapitated victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters traveling west of Singkawang today saw three heads  
lying in a road. Nearby were two bodies whose livers and hearts had 
been cut out. No soldiers or police could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian military began reinforcing its 2,000 soldiers in  
the region with 750 to 1,000 more today. Many were seen arriving in 
Pontianak, the provincial capital, aboard six flights of C-130 
Hercules transport planes from Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	But that could still leave the soldiers vastly outnumbered in  
Sambas district, where 900,000 people live, 10 percent of them 
Madurese. 
</P>
<P>
	In many villages, the fighting didn't stop until all the  
Madurese living there had been driven away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wiranto, the commander of Indonesian forces, said today  
that he was sending the reinforcements because his men have been 
unable to persuade local leaders to help stop the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The persuasive approach hasn't worked ... so the conflicts  
must first be physically contained,'' Wiranto told Antara, 
Indonesia's official news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in today's Jakarta Post said the latest outbreaks  
of communal violence in Indonesia could jeopardize the country's 
chances of holding a national election in June. Many see the vote 
as a potential breakthrough in the country's moves toward democracy 
after the resignation of authoritarian President Suharto last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, about 200 people were killed during weeks of clashes  
between Muslims and Christians in Ambon island in eastern 
Indonesia. Fighting also has increased between rival groups in East 
Timor since the government offered to hold a referendum on the 
territory's future. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, 300 students protested peacefully in front of the  
Defense Ministry on Tuesday to urge the military to stop the 
communal violence in Indonesia before the nation disintegrates.

<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Tuesday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks didn't play in the Padres' 8-6 win over  
the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* General manager Kevin Towers said the Padres'  
Triple-A affiliate in Las Vegas is asking every day whether Brooks 
is going to play in exhibition games against Milwaukee on April 2 
and the Chicago White Sox on April 3, both at Las Vegas' Cashman 
Field. There are no guarantees that Brooks would get any at-bats, 
but his presence obviously would spur ticket sales, particularly 
for the Saturday afternoon game. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``We're going to talk to Garth in the next  
couple of days and see what his plans are,'' manager Bruce Bochy 
said. ``If he'd like to accompany us, the door is certainly open.''

<HEADLINE> Capitals Deal Hunter, Juneau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a year after making the Stanley Cup  
finals for the first time in franchise history, the Washington 
Capitals marked Tuesday's NHL trading deadline by unloading three 
veterans who had spent a combined 23 years with the club. 
</P>
<P>
	The team bade an emotional farewell to longtime captain Dale  
Hunter, the only player in NHL history to tally 300 goals and 3,000 
penalty minutes, and sent him to the Colorado Avalanche. Right wing 
Joe Juneau was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres and left wing Craig 
Berube to the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough, really emotional, after what we  
accomplished last year,'' general manager George McPhee said. 
``Pulling these guys out of the mix wasn't easy, but they're all 
unrestricted free agents and we weren't going to get anything for 
them this summer if they signed elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche gave Washington a 1999 second-round draft pick --  
previously owned by Vancouver -- in exchange for Hunter and a 
third-round selection in 2000. Juneau and a 1999 third-round pick 
went to the Sabres for minor league defenseman Alexei Tezikov and 
future considerations. Berube will join the Flyers in exchange for 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to each one of them and said if I have a chance to  
move you to a club that has a good opportunity to compete for the 
Stanley Cup, would you like to do it?'' McPhee said. ``They've all 
said yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Capitals, closing in on a league-record 500 man-games lost  
due to injuries, are about to become the first club in almost 50 
years to miss the playoffs the year before and after it made the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I inherited the oldest team in the league,'' said McPhee,  
hired before the 1997-98 season. ``I like veteran players, but we 
squeezed everything we could out of them last year. I felt it was 
important to give them another chance this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing Hunter away was especially difficult. He had been with  
the team since 1987, holds the club record with 2,003 penalty 
minutes and is second in games played with 872. His affable 
locker-room demeanor contrasted sharply with his grit on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hunter has yet to score a goal this season -- his career low  
is eight -- and he had been a health scratch 17 times since Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Juneau, 31, scored the overtime goal against Buffalo that  
eliminated the Sabres from last year's Eastern Conference finals. 
He has 14 goals and 27 assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tezikov, 20, has three goals, seven assists and 41 penalty  
minutes in 30 games this season with the Rochester Americans of the 
AHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Berube, 33, has five goals and four assists this season.

<HEADLINE> Book: IRS Whistle-Blowers Hounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican senator's book alleges that IRS  
employees who blew the whistle in Congress on abusive practices are 
suffering retaliation. The agency's chief says that won't be 
tolerated if true. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Rossotti, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service,  
met last week with Sen. William Roth to carefully go over the 
claims made by some agents in the senator's new book, ``The Power 
to Destroy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief interview Monday, Rossotti said he will enforce  
``specific instructions'' ensuring that IRS employees ``who have 
testified or done anything else along those lines'' will not suffer 
reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done everything that's humanly possible to make sure  
those employees are treated fairly, and we will continue to do 
that,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is a follow-up to high-profile hearings on the IRS last  
year in the Senate Finance Committee chaired by Roth. The 
complaints aired then led to last year's sweeping IRS reform law 
giving Americans more rights and improving oversight of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his book, the Delaware Republican says there is  
continuing evidence of an ingrained culture of taxpayer abuse 
despite the reform law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changing the culture of the IRS will require more than  
legislation,'' wrote Roth. ``It will take a decade of training and 
oversight, vigilance by Congress and zero tolerance for abuse and 
mismanagement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth and co-author William Nixon said that despite IRS pledges  
that it wouldn't happen, several agency witnesses who testified 
about problems appear to be suffering reprisals on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been deeply disturbed to hear from several that they  
are being hounded by their superiors,'' Roth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	One unidentified employee in the IRS examinations branch is  
quoted in the book as telling Roth she has gotten failing grades on 
evaluations since the hearings, compared with ``good'' to 
``superior'' for 15 years before that. The employee's bosses also 
have intervened in some of her tax cases, something she said never 
happened before. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to build a case against me, to get rid of me,''  
Roth quotes the woman as telling him recently. ``Once I contacted 
people outside the agency, things started falling apart for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roth wrote that Congress should take further steps to make sure  
IRS employees aren't held to a Mafia-like ``omerta'' code of 
silence so they can ``share information necessary for appropriate 
oversight and reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book also discloses IRS in-house surveys of 80,000 employees  
in 1995 and 1997. These surveys found that 30 percent had observed 
at least one instance of ``unfair or uncaring'' treatment of a 
taxpayer, while 13 percent had seen such abuse at least three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 15 percent said they knew of agents ``lying or  
misleading'' a taxpayer to force compliance, while 19 percent had 
seen situations in which taxpayers with political clout were given 
preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said these problems stemmed from intense pressure on agents  
to meet now-scrapped numerical enforcement quotas in an agency 
shrouded by secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too many decades, power and insufficient accountability  
have corrupted,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The book has nothing but praise for Rossotti, who left a  
computer and consulting business he founded to take over the IRS in 
mid-1997. Roth wrote that Rossotti ``can do great things to correct 
the service from the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An IRS statement in response to Roth's book says the service has  
``made substantial progress'' in changing how it deals with 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IRS clearly received its marching orders, and we took them  
seriously,'' the statement says. ``Much more remains to be done, 
and we are committed to that end.''

<HEADLINE>  OPEC Accepts Oil Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today on a plan to  
cut crude oil production by 2.104 million barrels a day and to 
maintain the lower levels of output for a full year beginning April 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 11 oil producing nations detailed the plan in a  
communique released after a meeting of OPEC members. It includes 
reductions by non-OPEC producers as well as those in the group in 
an effort to end a global oil glut and strengthen prices that had 
languished at a 12-year low as recently as December. 
</P>
<P>
	If the participating nations fully comply with the agreement,  
the supply of oil on world markets would be reduced by about 2.6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was unanimous, said Youcef Yousfi of Algeria,  
president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compliance, I am sure, will be 100 percent. And there is a  
full determination of all countries to commit to this agreement'' 
Yousfi said, before OPEC ministers began a formal meeting at the 
OPEC Secretariat. He said there were no last minute obstacles to 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, OPEC nations will reduce oil output by  
1.716 million barrels a day, Algerian officials said. Non-OPEC 
producers like Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman will reduce 
production by an additional 388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, will slash output by  
585,000 barrels of crude a day. OPEC's No. 2 producer Iran will 
curtail daily output by 264,000 barrels, while Venezuela will pump 
125,000 fewer barrels of oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC will evaluate its output levels at the group's next meeting  
in September and reserves the right to adjust production levels 
before the full 12-month period ends, al-Sabah said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on how the market reacts,'' he said, adding  
that Kuwait hoped to see prices rise to between $17 and $18 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said that the latest cuts will be  
sufficient to raise prices ``soon'' but declined to specify a time 
frame for higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent crude oil futures were trading at $13.69 a barrel by  
midafternoon on the International Petroleum Exchange in London, 
down 19 cents from Monday's close. Prices had risen sharply since 
the cuts were proposed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases are ``extremely likely'' as a result of the  
agreement, said Fergus McLeod, an oil analyst at BT Alex. Brown. 
Mcleod predicted that Brent prices would reach at least $16 by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may turn out to be conservative,'' he said. ``If they  
really stick to this for a year, they could end up forcing up the 
market more than they intend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ishii Yoshiro, an analyst with Japan National Oil Corp., doubted  
that all members of OPEC would comply fully with the lower 
production levels. Cheating by members has undermined OPEC's 
efforts to stabilize prices in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``One hundred percent compliance is physically very difficult,''  
Yoshiro said. He predicted that the group probably would not 
achieve a compliance rate of much better than 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A production decrease was proposed two weeks ago by Saudi  
Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Algeria, together with non-member 
Mexico. Crude prices responded by jumping almost $3 a barrel, and 
gasoline prices followed suit. Experts say gasoline prices are 
likely to continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
	George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co., a  
financial services firm based in Milwaukee, expects increases of as 
much as 10 cents a gallon and said the cuts could continue to buoy 
gasoline prices into the fall when prices typically decrease 
slightly as colder weather makes driving less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq wasn't included in the production cuts because its sales  
are controlled by the United Nations under an oil-for-food deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of all grades of gasoline at U.S. service  
stations surged nearly 8 1/2 cents over the past two weeks, according 
to the Lundberg Survey, the steepest and fastest increase since 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say OPEC's plan to curtail production accounted for at  
least half of the rise in gasoline prices, which last reached this 
level two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for more expensive gasoline has been the approach  
of spring, when people usually begin spending more time in their 
cars, and dwindling gasoline inventories.

<HEADLINE>  Kwan Again Surrounded by Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The women's favorite in a meet  
dominated by Russian stars, Michelle Kwan is in a familiar position 
in the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean she's comfortable. Fighting a head cold, the  
American skater had good reason to be concerned as she prepared for 
her title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming down with something,'' she admitted Monday during a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she sounded congested, Kwan was in top form -- hitting  
jump after jump -- during practice Sunday and Monday. She hopes to 
recover without taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take it until it gets really bad,'' she said.  
``I always think medication will make my reactions a little slower. 
I want to be there when I skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's qualifications begin Wednesday, with 20 percent of  
the total score at stake, followed by the short program Friday and 
the long program Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's singles opened Monday, with Russians taking both  
sections of the qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Plushenko won one group and defending world champion  
Alexei Yagudin won the other, despite a sore left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was second behind Plushenko. In  
the other group, former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, another 
Russian, was second to Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's qualifying featured a record number of quadruple  
jumps, with six skaters -- including two Americans -- executing the 
difficult maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss completed his first clean quad in competition, and Tim  
Goebel landed the first quad salchow in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, three skaters completed quad salchows in the 1997  
Grand Prix final and the 1997 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finally nailed a clean quad toe loop. He thought he had  
one in 1997, but a video replay hours later showed he slightly 
two-footed it. There was no doubt about it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I initially wasn't planning on trying it, but as soon as I saw  
two of them hit theirs out there, I knew if I wanted to be up there 
in first or second I had to go for it,'' he said. ``It worked 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished second ahead of three-time world champion Elvis  
Stojko of Canada, who hit a quad, but fell on another. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko started strong, with his quad, but had slight errors  
on a number of his other jumps. American Trifun Zivanovic landed 
seven triple jumps to place fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who has been consistent throughout the season won his  
group easily without even attempting one. His marks were nearly all 
5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze off  
Russia won the pairs short program, with China's Shen Xue and Zhao 
Hongbo close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With a huge delayed double twist lift, the Chinese might have  
beaten the Russians if Shen had not touched down on a throw triple 
loop.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Mulls Delaying Baseball Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Southern California coach Mike Gillespie saw  
Monday why many cold-weather schools support an NCAA proposal to 
push back the start of the college baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was snowy, foggy and cold outside as Gillespie addressed  
about 500 College World Series volunteers in a hotel banquet room. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie, who last season led the Trojans to their first NCAA  
championship in 20 years, said he supports the plan because it 
would develop ``a more level playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would delay the season until as late as  
mid-February, meaning snow in mid-March still couldn't be avoided 
in places like Omaha. Gillespie said in any case, the issue centers 
not on weather but on money. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a school like USC, where school is over May 5, to keep the  
athletes around after class is out -- housing them has a big 
impact,'' Gillespie said. ``I suspect that is the single biggest 
hurdle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would delay the start of the season by up to three  
weeks, meaning the College World Series could be pushed into July. 
Supporters claim it's the best way to equalize decades of dominance 
by warm-weather programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie also weighed in on the issue that won't go away:  
aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody kind of longs for the days when we played with the  
wood bat,'' he said. ``I think that would be the preferred bat, but 
again, the reality is it's all about dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you realize the expense of wood bats today, of how many  
you'd have to buy to get through the whole season, the impact on 
people's budgets, we might not be able to overcome that issue,'' 
Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA executive committee voted on Jan. 15 -- opening day for  
many schools -- to limit aluminum bats to 2 5/8 inches in diameter and 
imposed weight and length limits aimed at simulating wooden bats. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, liability concerns prompted some schools to  
switch bats in the middle of opening-day games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans were on the field at Texas when Gillespie learned of  
the limitations but he said both teams, aware of the potential 
ruling, already had agreed to use wooden bats for their series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there is a modified bat, but that's what it is --  
it's modified,'' Gillespie said. ``In the hands of big strong kids, 
it's probably not delivering the effect for which it was 
intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie also was asked about other topics.  
</P>
<P>
	--On whether the Trojans can successfully defend their title with  
a return to Omaha: ``We started 7-13 and now we're 14-14, so we're 
getting better. We have not lost sight of our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On the difference between playing for the CWS champion Trojans  
(1961) and coaching them: ``I now have a true appreciation for how 
difficult it is. At the time as players, we didn't really 
understand the significance or how difficult it really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Nebraska's whopping 50-3 victory last week over Chicago  
State: ``I couldn't believe it when I saw the score. I'm sure it 
was a tough day for Chicago State. It probably was an uncomfortable 
day for both dugouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On the NCAA expanding the playoffs from 48 to 64 teams,  
effective this season: ``I'm in favor, and I've never heard one 
dissenter. The math is simple. There are more opportunities out 
there. It's good for baseball.''

<HEADLINE>  OPEC Accepts Oil Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today on a plan to  
cut crude oil production by 2.104 million barrels a day and to 
maintain the lower levels of output for a full year beginning April 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 11 oil producing nations detailed the plan in a  
communique released after a meeting of OPEC members. It includes 
reductions by non-OPEC producers as well as those in the group in 
an effort to end a global oil glut and strengthen prices that had

aggression'' from NATO after the failure of the latest Kosovo peace 
mission. A U.S. envoy declared talks with Yugoslavia's president 
over Kosovo a failure today and headed to NATO headquarters, as 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia appeared imminent. Richard 
Holbrooke said he made no real progress in two days of talks with 
Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic. Holbrooke described the 
situation over Kosovo, where war the past year has left more than 
2,000 people dead, as ``the bleakest since we began this effort 
almost four years ago.'' With NATO airstrikes looming, the U.N.'s 
humanitarian agency and most European Union embassies in Belgrade 
were planning to close.

	Clinton Warns Yugoslavs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Western allies have  
``done everything we could do to solve (the Kosovo crisis) 
peacefully,'' but now NATO is ready to strike Yugoslavia after 
talks ended fruitlessly today. Clinton says U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke ``got nowhere'' in Kosovo peace talks with Yugoslavia 
President Slobodan Milosevic. Clinton said if Milosevic ``is not 
willing to make peace, we are willing to limit his ability to make 
war'' on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. ``When President Milosevic 
started the war in Bosnia seven years ago, the world did not act 
quickly enough to stop him,'' Clinton said.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Former Clinton business partner Susan  
McDougal, facing obstruction of justice and contempt charges for 
refusing to answer questions about Whitewater, today agreed to 
answer queries from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors. Mrs. McDougal said 
Clinton's testimony in her 1996 fraud trial was truthful. She also 
said she never discussed with Clinton a fraudulent $300,000 loan in 
her name. Another Whitewater witness, David Hale, has testified 
that Clinton had pressured him to make that loan. Mrs. McDougal has 
already served 18 months in prison for refusing to answer questions

accidentally credited with millions of dollars in food assistance 
allotments. A spokesman for New Jersey's Department of Human 
Services said a test Sunday to determine whether a state welfare 
computer was protected from the so-called millennium bug caused the 
error. As much as $58 million may have been involved. Grocery 
stores in the area were crowded with people eager to take advantage 
of the error involving electronic benefits.

Mitchell has 166 catches in his four NFL seasons and caught 38 
balls last year, more than twice the total of all of the Giants' 
tight ends.

	US: No Progress in Yugo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has  
left Belgrade after failing to reach a peace agreement on Kosovo 
with Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic. Holbrooke said 
Milosevic would not budge from his position of not allowing NATO 
troops to be stationed in Yugoslavia, a key condition of a 
U.S.-backed peace plan for the Serb province. Holbrooke said the 
situation is at its ``bleakest'' point since the peace effort 
began. A NATO attack on Yugoslavia could be only hours away.

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men accused of beating a gay  
student to death will go on trial tomorrow. Russell Henderson is 
charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Matthew 
Shepard's grisly killing last October. The attack drew calls for 
stronger bias crime laws. The other man charged in the slaying, 
Aaron McKinney, is set to go on trial in August. Both could get the 
death penalty. Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as

<HEADLINE> Teaching Aides Votee To Unionize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Graduate students at the University of  
California at Los Angeles have voted to unionize, paving the way 
for unions to form at the seven other university campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 718-269 vote, which took place March 9-11, affiliated the  
UCLA union with the United Auto Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a historic victory for academic student workers,'' said  
Connie Razza, a UCLA teaching assistant and spokeswoman for the new 
Student Association of Graduate Employees-UAW. 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of California will cooperate fully with  
SAGE-UAW and will bargain in good faith,'' Chancellor Albert 
Carnesale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Monday's announcement, there were 18 institutions,  
including the universities of Michigan and Wisconsin, with 
unionized teaching aides, according to 1997 statistics by the 
Chronicle of Higher Education. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduate students, who often teach small groups of  
undergraduates, grade papers and tutor, typically work 15 to 20 
hours a week and earn about $15,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	UC assistants walked off the job in December, the fourth such  
strike in six years and the first involving all UC general 
admissions campuses. They agreed to a 45-day ``cooling off'' period 
just before final exams. 
</P>
<P>
	The students argued that they had a right to unionize because  
they often do the bulk of the teaching at UC's research schools. 
University officials had argued that teachers' aides are students, 
not employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the state labor board ruled against the university,  
leading to this month's vote. Groups at other campuses were 
expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited about the outcome of UCLA's election and  
we're really looking forward to our own election,'' said Ricardo 
Ochoa, president of the 1,700-member Association of Graduate 
Student Employees at UC Berkeley.

<HEADLINE> Bowater To Cut Some Paper Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Bowater Inc., the world's second-largest  
newsprint producer, plans to cut production at paper mills in Maine 
and New Brunswick, Canada, next month by about 25,000 metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading after Tuesday's announcement, Bowater shares fell  
$3.87 1/2, or by 8.5 percent, to close at $41.81 1/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The production cut was made to correct an order imbalance, a  
company spokeswoman said. Most of the cutbacks will be in 
newsprint, although some other papers also will be affected, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowater previously announced a reduction of about 35,000 metric  
tons at its Quebec plant. Sagging paper and pulp prices hurt the 
company last year as it posted an $18.5 million loss, partly 
because of charges related to the planned sale of mill in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowater has 10 pulp and paper mills in the United States, Canada  
and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Trucker May Lose License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The secretary of state's office was  
reviewing state law to see if it could revoke the driver's license 
of the trucker involved in last week's deadly Amtrak crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our lawyers are looking at every possible angle,'' spokeswoman  
Anne Dybek said Tuesday. ``We want to do what's best for public 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, John R. Stokes, has not been charged in the March 15  
accident in which 11 people were killed and more than 100 injured 
after Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into his truck at a 
crossing. Stokes, 58, has a history of traffic citations over 31 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	State authorities suspended Stokes' license Jan. 25 for 60 days  
after learning he had received three speeding tickets within a year 
while driving a commercial vehicle in Indiana. After taking a 
driving course, he obtained a probationary permit to cover the 
period of the suspension, which is scheduled to end Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	State records obtained by The Associated Press also show Stokes'  
license was suspended twice when he failed to pass breath tests for 
alcohol after traffic stops in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes has denied wrongdoing and a federal official said last  
week that he was not over the legal limit for alcohol at the time 
of the train wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes' attorney, Leonard Sacks, said his client's earlier  
driving history is not relevant in the Amtrak crash. He criticized 
Secretary of State Jesse White's office for trying to find a way to 
revoke Stokes' license now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd think it would be more appropriate to wait until there's  
an investigation that's completed and they have all the 
information, rather than reacting to public clamor,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White's lawyers are trying to determine whether Stokes' license  
can be revoked even if he is not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a freight train crashed into another Tuesday morning  
just miles from the site of the Amtrak crash. The crash injured 
each train's engineer and conductor and caused another multiple-car 
derailment. The trains collided at an intersection of two train 
company's tracks.

who covered Montana state government for 30 years, died Sunday. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes covered the Legislature from 1948 until 1978. He was  
known for the depth of his knowledge of state government; even 
legislators relied on his notes and math to be sure the state 
budget was in balance. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered 16 regular and six special sessions of the  
Legislature for the AP. One of the special sessions was necessary 
when Holmes discovered a major mistake in an appropriations bill 
after legislators had gone home.

<P>
	After his retirement, Holmes returned to the Legislature to  
lobby for Montana artists until 1983. He ran unsuccessfully in 1981

saving the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. after he was 
stabbed in the chest in 1958, died Saturday. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 20, 1958, during Maynard's tenure as chief of surgery  
at Harlem Hospital Medical Center, a woman plunged a steel blade 
into King's chest at a book-signing. The blade lodged in King's 
sternum. 
</P>
<P>
	Maynard operated on King, saving his life in front of many  
public figures, including then-New York Gov. W. Averell Harriman. 
King recovered from the stabbing and left the hospital within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>

	NATO Approves Bombing Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Saying all efforts to achieve a  
negotiated settlement had failed, NATO Secretary-General Javier 
Solana ordered airstrikes against Yugoslavia today, but it was not 
known when the operations would begin. More than 400 aircraft from 
allied nations stood ready for bombings that officials indicated 
were likely within days or hours. Half a dozen U.S. Navy ships were 
ready to launch cruise missiles. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke 
declared peace talks with Yugoslavia's president on Kosovo a 
failure, and Yugolav officials declared a state of emergency -- one 
step below a state of war. 

</P>

	Attack To Target Radar, Missiles  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An initial bombing campaign against Yugoslavia  
would be an attempt to blind the country's extensive network of air 
defense radars and missiles, officials said today. American forces 
would lead the bombing, bringing a barrage of cruise missiles from 
Navy ships and submarines and Air Force jets. Once the Yugoslavian 
air defenses had been damaged, a variety of manned aircraft, 
including U.S. and allied F-16s and American F-15s, would have a 
less risky opportunity to target weapon depots and Serb troop 
concentrations.

	Russia Stays Firm on Kosovo

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today  
that Russia would step up its combat readiness if NATO attacked 
Yugoslavia, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the Russian

	Poll: U.S. Split Over Kosovo Attack

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than half of Americans in a Gallup survey  
say they favor the United States being part of a military action 
against Serb targets, and four out of five believe the president 
should get approval from Congress before sending troops to Kosovo. 
Americans felt similarly about ordering troops into Bosnia in 
October 1995. A survey conducted then showed that 79 percent 
believed the president first needed the approval of Congress.

he was ``not very motivated to at this point'' to challenge Vice 
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination. Former New Jersey

answer queries from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors. Mrs. McDougal said 
Clinton's testimony in her 1996 fraud trial was truthful. She also 
said she never discussed with Clinton a fraudulent $300,000 loan in

	States, Feds Create `Cyberforce'

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To fight Internet investment scams, state  
regulators are going undercover online and federal authorities have 
a ``Cyberforce'' that does electronic surveillance. Both sides, 
however, face a daunting task with limited resources in combating 
growing instances of Internet fraud, top officials said today at a 
Senate hearing. The mushrooming use of the Internet by financial 
con artists has forced the SEC to take resources away from other 
fraud areas, officials said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today, with the Dow tumbling

uneasy about technology company earnings and the outlook for 
interest rates. The Dow fell 218.68 points to close at 9,671.83. It 
was the 11th biggest point drop ever for the Dow, but wasn't close 
to a record in terms of a percentage decline. On the NYSE, losers

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Unpredictable NBA star Dennis Rodman said he can  
be counted on to fight a shoe manufacturer's termination of his $15 
million endorsement contract. Converse is ending its contract with 
Rodman about one year before it was to expire, according to a 
source familiar with the situation. Analysts say Converse's 
decision has to do with the declining popularity of expensive 
athletic shoes. ``Dennis has a contract with Converse,'' Rodman's 
spokesman, Matt Labov, said. ``Dennis has not breached any terms of 
the contract and we expect Converse to honor the contract.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Meets With Labor Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore defended Clinton  
administration trade policies to testy labor activists who warned 
him they weren't satisfied with the answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why I'm here,'' said Gore. ``We need to talk.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gore attended a conference of the United Auto Workers, and ran  
into a buzz-saw of questions about the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, fought hard by labor but pushed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The badgering began from the moment Gore was introduced by Iowa  
UAW head Dave Neil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are of the opinion that NAFTA does not work,'' said Neil.  
``I guess I'll just stop there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that, Gore made his arguments in a speech.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not agreed with you on every issue,'' he said. ``You  
are keenly aware of that. I am keenly aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between both Clinton and Gore with organized labor  
have been cool, and Monday's meeting underscored those tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want perfection, keep on looking,'' said Gore. ``If you  
want someone who agrees with you 100 percent of the time, keep on 
looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After making his pitch, Gore took questions from the audience  
and workers scattered around the room peppered him, not only on 
trade but on a global warming treaty that critics said could hammer 
American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see it differently than you,'' said Gore. ``I believe it's a  
real problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did concede ``there are still ongoing struggles'' in  
enforcing protections against loss of American jobs, but vowed to 
continue to press to preserve U.S. jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore insisted that he backed labor's goals, and defended  
its trade policy, one question shouted from the back of the room 
drew a cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come you don't twist arms on labor (laws) like you do on  
NAFTA?'' shouted the questioner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there was a perception'' that Clinton didn't push hard  
for labor law reform, Gore conceded, arguing that he would press 
for changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations with labor are key for Gore. He's formed a committee  
exploring the Democratic presidential nomination, and is considered 
certain to run. 
</P>
<P>
	His only challenger is former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, and  
Gore is considered the overwhelming favorite. That leaves key 
Democratic interest groups in a box, because they don't want to 
offend the leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many labor leaders also feel little real loyalty, and Gore ended  
up arguing essentially that they would be better off with him than 
a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to work with you,'' said Gore. ``I come from a  
progressive tradition that is in my bones.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Push for Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are renewing their push for  
a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to ban flag 
desecration, a measure that died last year for lack of Senate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde told the  
subcommittee on the Constitution that in a nation torn by racial 
and other differences, the flag's symbolic value as a unifying 
force makes desecrating one a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we desperately need is some symbol that unites us, that  
shows us what we have in common,'' Hyde said Tuesday. ``That's what 
the flag does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if Congress considers flag desecration a hate crime, it  
assumes the power to govern people's thoughts the way communist or 
fascist systems do, opponents argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``This amendment would give Congress the power to dictate to the  
American people how they can and cannot express themselves,'' Rep. 
John Lewis, D-Ga., told the panel. ``It would allow Congress to 
prohibit a particular expression -- to outlaw a particular 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment has acquired enough support for the two-thirds  
House majority needed for passage, and supporters are optimistic 
they can obtain the necessary approval of three-fourths of the 
states. They said they now are trying again for the third piece of 
the equation -- a two-thirds vote in the Senate -- over objections of 
critics who say the measure violates the First Amendment's 
protection of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burning the flag is burning the flag, not making a speech,''  
said subcommittee chairman Charles Canady, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In two decisions, the Supreme Court disagreed. It ruled in 1989  
that flag desecration is an act of free expression protected by the 
First Amendment. Congress responded by passing the Flag Protection 
Act, but the court struck down the law in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Republican-controlled House in 1995 adopted a  
flag-protection amendment, 312 votes to 120, far more than the 
required two-thirds. The Senate vote failed by three votes, and the 
measure died. 
</P>
<P>
	The House tried again two years later, but the Senate failed to  
take up the amendment before adjourning last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with testimony from veterans, a Holocaust survivor and a  
former Miss America, supporters are rekindling the debate amid the 
same objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde attributed the disconnect to a disagreement on the  
interpretation of flag desecration ``as free speech or as an act -- 
a hate crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you pass this amendment,'' former Rep. David Skaggs, a  
Colorado Democrat, told the panel, ``you presume to read the minds 
of dissenters across the nation.''

<HEADLINE> Dialysis Patient Shoots Nurse, Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) -- A dialysis patient, apparently angry over  
being denied something to drink, shot and critically wounded a 
hospital nurse before killing himself Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernest Jefferson of Kankakee began arguing with the nurse after  
being refused additional fluids, which are routinely restricted 
during dialysis, said Provena St. Mary's Hospital spokesman Paul 
Tutt. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour after being discharged, Jefferson, 69, returned to  
the nurse's office with a .38-caliber handgun and fired four shots, 
striking her three times before fatally shooting himself in the 
head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old nurse was shot in the upper body and shoulders  
and was being treated at St. Mary's, police said. She was in 
critical but stable condition late Tuesday, hospital officials 
said.

line and had 11 goals and 15 assists in 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Atcheynum was a key member of our team last season,'' general

<HEADLINE> 3 Inducted Into Golf Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) -- Seve Ballesteros was standing at the  
podium during his induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame when 
the power failed and the sound system went dead. The dashing 
Spaniard never lost his poise. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has happened to be before,'' he quipped.  
</P>
<P>
	His game didn't always go according to plan, at least that's how  
it looked. Not many players have won a major championship by making 
birdie from a parking lot. Growing up with only a cut-down 3-iron 
in his hand, Ballesteros learned to hit shots that others never 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he took his place among the game's greats.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who was going to tell me that a little boy who started as a  
caddie in Pedrena, a small village in Spain, would be here today,'' 
said Ballesteros, the winner of five major championships and nearly 
80 tournaments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Amy Alcott made the biggest splash of her career when she became  
the first LPGA member to be inducted since Betsy King in 1995. Also 
inducted was the late Lloyd Mangrum, who won two Purple Hearts in 
World War II and the U.S. Open in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	With 11 members of the Hall of Fame looking on under a blazing  
sun, the induction of Ballesteros, Alcott and Mangrum brought the 
number to 76 of those enshrined at the World Golf Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little numb,'' Alcott said. ``I look down that list and  
I've taken my place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros was elected last year on the international ballot,  
but deferred his induction until Monday. Alcott, whose 29 victories 
include five major championships, became eligible in February when 
the LPGA changed its criteria. Mangrum was elected on the PGA Tour 
ballot in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf gave a little girl the life she imagined sitting in front  
of a television,'' Alcott said. ``I was mesmerized by the rhythm of 
the swing, the sound of the golf ball, the whole dance. It's been a 
great dance, and I hope to keep dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros and Alcott grew up in different worlds and played  
different tours. All that links them is the way they discovered 
golf -- Alcott with a cut-down club she used to tear up her yard in 
Santa Monica, Calif., Ballesteros with a 3-iron that taught him 
shots few others would even dream of hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of imagination,'' Ballesteros said. ``That came  
from learning the game with only one club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Spaniard made a spectacular debut at the 1976  
British Open at Royal Birkdale. Although he lost a third-round lead 
to Johnny Miller, his bump-and-run that threaded two bunkers on the 
closing hole served notice that there would never be a dull moment 
when he was around. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Open three years later at Royal Lytham &AMP; St. Annes,  
making a birdie from a parking lot on the 16th hole in the final 
round. Ballesteros won two more British Opens, along with the 
Masters in 1980 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He also became the heart and soul of the Ryder Cup, his  
intensity and determination making it the biggest worldwide event 
in golf, and he was idolized by today's young stars in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Arnold Palmer did more in America than I did in  
Europe,'' Ballesteros said. ``I feel very proud to help the people 
back in Europe. I as the one who opened the door for them. And I 
feel very good about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcott's impact on women's golf goes beyond the record she  
shares with JoAnne Carner for winning at least once her first 12 
years on tour. She's responsible for victory splash at the Nabisco 
Dinah Shore, which began when she won in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She took host Dinah Shore into the pond with her in 1991, the  
last time Alcott won on tour. She would have needed one more 
victory to get into the Hall of Fame under the previous 
requirements, which were so difficult that it was regarded the 
toughest shrine in sports to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new points system approved in February, Alcott would  
have qualified 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangrum won most of his 36 victories after an Army career that  
took him to Omaha Beach on D-Day and earned him two Purple Hearts. 
He won the 1946 U.S. Open, was a member of five Ryder Cup teams and 
won the Vardon Trophy twice. 
</P>
<P>
	He was represented by his stepson and was introduced by Byron  
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great golfer who was somewhat forgotten,'' Nelson  
said. ``He was a tough competitor and an excellent putter. Any time 
you beat him, you could know you were playing well.''

<HEADLINE> Paul Wilson Is Out for the Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Poor Paul Wilson. Now that his shoulder finally has healed, his  
elbow gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who hasn't pitched a major league game since  
reconstructive shoulder surgery in November 1996, needs 
reconstructive elbow surgery and will miss this season and possibly 
a significant part of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career is not over, I haven't given up,'' Wilson said today  
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``I'm still a relatively young man. It's 
going to take more than this to beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury means all three of the young pitchers touted by the  
Mets in the late 1990s needed ligaments replaced in their pitching 
elbows. Jason Isringhausen is still working his way back to the 
majors and Bill Pulsipher returned, only to be traded to Milwaukee 
last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's very, very discouraging, as far as Paul has  
gone to come back from where he was,'' Mets general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``It's just devastating for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, examined in New York by Mets physician Dr. David  
Altcheck, intends to get a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews 
before making the final decision on surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out everything I can about this particular kind  
of surgery,'' Wilson said. ``As I understand it there are two types 
of procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a right-hander who turns 26 next week, was the top pick  
in the 1994 amateur draft. He was 1-0 this spring, allowing six 
hits in nine scoreless innings with three walks and one strikeout, 
then partially tore the medial collateral ligament in his right 
elbow on Friday while warming up for his first spring start for 
Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched anyway, allowing six runs and eight hits in three  
innings, but the pain didn't go away the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many pitchers now in the major leagues who have come  
back from this,'' said Phillips, who originally thought the injury 
wasn't serious, perhaps a bone spur. ``It certainly is 12 months. 
Then you have to build up stamina and strength, then you have to 
get innings under your belt again. Hopefully, it's short of two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wilson's only major league appearances, he was 5-12 with a  
5.38 ERA for the Mets in 26 starts in 1996. He went 4-1 with a 4.52 
ERA in seven starts last season at Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll work as hard again to do what he has to do to get  
back,'' Phillips predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, whose farm system produced Hall of Famers Tom Seaver  
and Nolan Ryan and noted pitchers such as Dwight Gooden, hasn't had 
much success of late. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen had arthroscopic shoulder and elbow surgery in  
September 1996 and a ligament replaced in his right elbow in 
January 1998. Pulsipher had reconstructive surgery on his left 
elbow in April 1996 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers last 
July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was especially upsetting to the Mets because Wilson  
worked so hard following the shoulder operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was crushed,'' Mets trainer Fred Hina said after talking  
with Wilson. ``Nobody sweats more than Paul Wilson.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets re-signed 25-year-old right-hander Oscar  
Henriquez, cut from the major league roster last week, to a minor 
league contract. They also traded Jonathan Guzman, an 18-year-old 
outfielder who played for New York's team in the Dominican Summer 
League last year, to Kansas City for utility player Shane Halter, 
primarily a shortstop. Halter hit .286 (6-for-21) with eight RBIs 
after hitting .221 with two homers and 13 RBIs in 265 at-bats last 
season. He also played the outfield, other infield positions and 
even pitched one inning for the Royals. Halter has been practicing 
at catcher this spring.

<HEADLINE> Feds Investigate Wipers, Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
complaints that windshield wipers are failing on some Ford Taurus 
and Mercury Sable cars built in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received  
25 complaints that the wipers failed, and some drivers said they 
were forced to pull over because they could not see, according to a 
monthly agency report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 555,000 of the popular cars are on the road.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of the investigation and cooperating fully,'' said  
Ford spokeswoman Karen Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is looking into motorist complaints that air  
bags deployed inadvertently on some Mazda Miata cars from the 1995 
model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda executives had no comment Monday on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	One driver complained the air bags deployed after the car was  
left parked, and another motorist said the air bags deployed for no 
apparent reason while he was traveling 25 mph to 30 mph, the report 
said. Several motorists said their Miatas struck something in the 
road, in one case an empty cardboard box the size of a briefcase 
and in another case a curb. 
</P>
<P>
	The motorists said the inflating air bags caused one crash and  
three injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mazda recalled the 1995 and 1996 Mazda 626 and MX6  
cars after more than 50 motorists complained the air bags opened 
when the cars hit a pothole or curb, got a flat tire, the driver 
braked or for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last year, General Motors recalled nearly 1 million autos  
to repair sensitive air bag systems after more than 300 motorists 
complained of air bags bursting open without any crash on 
late-model Chevrolet Cavaliers, Pontiac Sunfires and Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, the federal highway safety agency has been  
investigating nearly 1 million Chrysler vehicles and some 
Mitsubishi vehicles based on complaints that air bags are inflating 
inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA opens safety investigations with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the agency and manufacturer exchange paperwork, including 
any complaints, as in the recent Ford and Mazda cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation may then be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study components to see if they 
are defective. An investigation can lead to a recall or it may be 
dropped.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Oil Cuts' Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From giant automakers to tiny  
bed-and-breakfasts, businesses of all kinds could be pinched if 
OPEC's plan to cut oil production sends prices sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists are optimistic that any future energy price  
increases won't be big enough to dramatically hurt American 
companies' profits, and that low inflation will continue even with 
prices at the gasoline pump moving higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still will be a positive climate for energy users, just not  
as positive as before,'' said Lynn Reaser, an economist with Bank 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	American oil companies are hoping that rising energy prices will  
reverse their slumping profits, which have forced them to lay off 
thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are generally optimistic that OPEC will stick to its  
plan to cut daily oil production by 2.1 million barrels over the 
next year. But for prices to rise steadily, members of the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries must prove they 
will not revert to the cheating that has undercut past promises to 
slash production. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, automakers, airlines, truckers, plastics makers  
and other businesses that have benefited from the long slump in oil 
prices are cautiously preparing for higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the stock market -- you never know. I don't know if  
you can count on the OPEC guys to ever stick to their word,'' said 
Rick Todd, president of the 900-member South Carolina Trucking 
Association. ``Most folks are expecting prices to rise, but to what 
extent is just guesswork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil is trading in the  
$15 range, up from around $12 a month ago and a 12-year low of 
$10.72 in December. Analysts expect OPEC cuts could boost the price 
to about $17 per barrel by year's end, which they consider a modest 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	At the pump, the national average gasoline price shot up almost  
8 1/2 cents a gallon to $1.09 in the past two weeks, but it still 
remains near historic lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts expect pump prices to rise another 10 cents per  
gallon this year, but economists believe that would still have 
limited impact on consumers' spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's going to be a severe hardship, but at the  
margin it's probably going to slow their spending a bit for other 
items,'' said Gary Thayer, an economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	One industry in particular that could suffer from higher energy  
prices is tourism, as airline prices could pass on higher fuel 
prices to consumers and weekend driving trips that have become more 
frequent recently could be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mark Frohman, proprietor of the Grunberg Haus Bed &AMP;  
Breakfast in Waterbury, Vt., said he doesn't see low gas prices as 
a major factor in his business. Frohman said this ski season has 
been his best, but he attributed that more to favorable weather 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my guests driving up my driveway in larger and larger  
vehicles, so whatever savings they have in the price per gallon 
they seem to be using up in the poor mileage of the vehicles 
they're driving,'' Frohman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Woodward, a partner at Deloitte Consulting, said that  
other businesses could actually thrive amid rising energy prices if 
they translate into more hiring in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those individuals will be spending their dollars on goods and  
services produced by other industries,'' Woodward said. ``The 
overall impact will be positive on the U.S. economy.''

<HEADLINE> Ripken Returns Home To Be With Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Concerned over the failing health  
of his cancer-stricken father, Cal Ripken returned to his parents' 
Maryland home Tuesday to be at the bedside of the man who had the 
most influence on his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Sr., 63, was diagnosed with lung cancer in October.  
He began chemotherapy treatments at that time, but his health has 
not improved and he recently was released from Johns Hopkins 
Hospital, going to his home in Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prayers are certainly with him, Cal and the rest of the  
family,'' Baltimore Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``Cal Sr. was 
a mentor to an awful lot of people in baseball, most notably 
myself. He taught me how to make out my first pitching chart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. enjoyed a 36-year-old association with the Orioles  
and taught the game to his son while serving as a minor league 
manager. Ripken, a no-nonsense leader who had little tolerance for 
flashy players, won 964 games as a manager at the minor league 
level and was 68-101 with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Jr. left the team Tuesday morning after making the trip  
to Jupiter, Fla. for an exhibition game against the Montreal Expos. 
There is some question as to whether he will be available for the 
team's historic trip to Cuba this weekend, but that was not a 
pertinent issue for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal has as much time as he wants to what he has to do,''  
Miller said. ``The family wants privacy, and we will respect that. 
Our blessings, wishes and prayers are with the Ripken family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Jr. has endured a tough several months, preparing for his  
18th major-league season while closely monitoring his father's 
health. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear a lot about cancer, but until it affects your family  
you don't know much about it. Then when it breaks into the family 
structure, everybody tells you a story about the reality of this 
nasty disease,'' Ripken said before spring training. ``It affects 
your life and your perspective of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Ripken signed with Baltimore 1957 as a catcher but  
soon turned to managing, spending 14 years in the minors. His teams 
finished first or second on seven occasions, and he joined the 
Orioles' coaching staff in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired as manager in 1987, taking over a last-place team.  
He was fired in 1988 after an 0-6 start. 
</P>
<P>
	He got his job as third base coach back in 1989 but was fired  
after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was the first man in the majors ever to manage two of his  
sons, Cal Jr. and Bill, who was the Orioles' second baseman at the 
time. The three Ripkens appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, Ripken Sr. replaced his son late in a game, ending  
Cal Jr.'s streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he became ill, Ripken Sr. ran the Cal Ripken Baseball  
School, a summer camp for children, at Mount St. Mary's College in 
Emmitsburg, Md.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Software Raises Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a growth industry: Software that claims to  
protect the identity of Internet users by letting them control how 
much personal information they allow Web sites to access. 
</P>
<P>
	New technology, promoted by software makers such as Novell and  
Microsoft, is a growing part of the Internet industry's campaign to 
assure people that confidential information like their age, buying 
habits and income won't be misused by Web sites they do business 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the software products have received mixed reviews. Some  
electronic privacy advocates praise the efforts, but others fear 
the technology may actually entice Net users to divulge more 
personal data than they ordinarily would by creating a routine for 
supplying the information to online vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fairly skeptical about a lot of these so-called privacy  
technologies, because a lot of what it comes down to is 
marketing,'' said David Banisar of the Electronic Privacy 
Information Center, a Washington-based privacy advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	``You provide a lot of information into the system, but then it  
makes it easier for Web sites to obtain the information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some privacy activists said Novell Corp. may be moving in the  
right direction with a product unveiled Monday that appears to 
strike a balance between collecting information and protecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Digital Me software would let Net surfers create distinct  
online identities, allowing a user to enter a certain profile to 
show an online retailer, another to share with friends and another 
that retains anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell hopes its technology will be accepted as a standard for  
controlling personal information. Financial services giant 
Citigroup has agreed to test services based on the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Givens, project director at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a  
consumer group based in San Diego, praised the Novell software for 
allowing users to retain their anonymity. But she expressed 
concerns about making it easier for online businesses to collect 
personal information about online users. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone who participates in these services should  
think long-term about ... collection of data about themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp., for its part, bought a privacy software  
developer last year, Firefly, that makes a product that also 
encourages people to create online profiles that get sent to Web 
sites they visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The information would only be made available to Web sites that  
are certified by industry privacy watchdogs such as Trust-E or the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus' online unit, said Saul Klein, 
Microsoft's group program manager for Web platform services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft plan is intended to fit in with a broad initiative  
by the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonprofit group that sets 
standards for Internet technology to create a common way for Web 
sites and users to control the information they share with online 
companies. But Klein said Microsoft hasn't yet decided how to use 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of industry-supported groups to objectively police  
Web sites' privacy policies came under question Monday when 
Trust-E, which is financed partly by Microsoft, chided the company 
over a glitch in its software but took no further action. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason reason consumer groups say federal legislation  
is needed to prevent companies from infringing on the privacy of 
Internet users. A proliferation of software is letting businesses 
easily ``mine'' personal data about consumers by sifting through 
detailed information to more precisely target business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology can track a computer user's recently visited Web  
sites, the pages the user looked at and even the person's hobbies -- 
and then link that information to the user's name and address.

<HEADLINE> Study: Caffeine May Be Good for You </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Caffeine is not addictive for most people, a  
new study concludes, and has little effect on human health. No, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a much-promoted French study released Monday during  
the American Chemical Society's annual meeting, drinking up to 
three cups of coffee a day has no effect on the part of the brain 
responsible for addiction. And it may actually be good for you. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're a rat.  
</P>
<P>
	After spending two years with 30 rodents, researcher Astrid  
Nehlig of the French National Health Medical Research Institute 
found that moderate consumption increases energy and renders 
addiction ``quite unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by the French coffee industry and her  
employer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank loan officer Laura Comstock doesn't hesitate when asked if  
she agrees with Nehlig's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' she replies flatly.  
</P>
<P>
	Comstock must have at least two caffeinated drinks -- usually tea  
or Diet Coke -- to get through the day, plus a midmorning cup of 
joe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get headaches if I don't drink coffee,'' she said, seated at  
a coffee house during lunch, a cup of decaf in hand. ``There's got 
to be something to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Nehlig, seven or eight cups of java would have to  
be consumed in quick succession to create the same addictive brain 
activity as a low dose of, say, morphine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Addiction to caffeine is not the same as addiction to  
methamphetamines or cocaine or morphine,'' Nehlig said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not denying that there can be a dependence on caffeine,  
I'm just saying that there is no adverse physical effects to using 
caffeine in moderate levels,'' the researcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caffeine studies are all over the map when it comes to health  
effects. Some say the drug increases productivity. The Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based watchdog group, 
said it may degenerate bone mass and endanger fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Griffiths, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at  
Johns Hopkins University, has done extensive research on caffeine. 
He's skeptical of Nehlig's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start extrapolating from rats to humans, all kinds of  
things change,'' he said. And ``there is pretty substantial 
literature in animals and humans showing chronic administration of 
caffeine produces acute dependency syndrome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Rocha, who operates an outdoor coffee stand in Los  
Angeles, sees some of that every day. Does she believe caffeine is 
healthy for her customers? 
</P>
<P>
	``When I drink it, I get all jumpy and hyper, so it can't be  
good for them, either,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Freight Trains Crash in Illinois </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOMENCE, Ill. (AP) -- Two freight trains collided at an  
intersection of track early today, and some cars derailed. Three 
people suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is 11 miles from where an Amtrak crash killed 11 people  
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia-based Conrail said one of its eastbound freight  
trains hit a southbound Union Pacific train about 50 miles south of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened east of Bourbonnais, the site of last week's  
Amtrak crash, but on a different track, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people, including the trains' two engineers, were taken to  
Riverside Medical Center in Kankakee with minor injuries, hospital 
spokesman Mike Silgen said. The hospital also handled injured 
passengers in last week's crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Both trains were moving at the time of today's crash and hit at  
about a 45-degree angle, said Conrail spokesman Ron Hildebrand. One 
engine was knocked on its side and in each train, four cars were 
derailed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our engine ran into the side of their train,'' Hildebrand  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A small fire -- probably fueled by diesel spilled at the scene --  
was put out quickly after firefighters arrived, said Jim Hildreth, 
a spokesman for Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators would seek to determine if signals on both tracks  
were working. Hildebrand said he didn't know which train had the 
right of way. 
</P>
<P>
	Track speed at that point was 45 mph, he said, though he didn't  
know how fast either train was traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were using sand and other equipment to contain  
diesel fuel spilling from the derailment, said Jim Lemotte, retired 
fire chief for the Momence Fire Department, who was handling media 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's quite a mess out there, with debris all around,'' he  
said. ``It's not a real hazardous situation.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Acquire Chelios, Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings, gearing up for a third  
straight run at a Stanley Cup title, acquired defenseman Chris 
Chelios and three other veterans just before Tuesday's trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit also traded backup goaltender Kevin Hodson and two draft  
picks to Tampa Bay for wing Wendel Clark and goalie Bill Ranford 
and dealt two picks to the New York Rangers for injured defenseman 
Ulf Samuelsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks will receive defenseman Anders Eriksson and  
first-round draft picks in 1999 and 2001 for Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios had eight goals and 26 assists in 65 games this season.  
He is a key addition to the Red Wings' defense, which has been 
depleted by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a quality two-way defenseman who will add toughness to  
the Red Wings, the 37-year-old has been the subject of trade rumors 
much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman in 1989,  
1993 and 1996 and has played in nine All-Star games. Chelios has 
164 goals and 632 assists in 1061 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a chance to acquire a player like Chris Chelios,  
you get pretty excited,'' Holland said. ``He's one of the premiere 
defensemen in the National Hockey League. We felt it was a move we 
had to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios has spent the last nine seasons in Chicago after being  
traded from Montreal along with a second-round draft pick in 1990 
for Denis Savard. 
</P>
<P>
	Eriksson is in his second NHL season. The former first-round  
pick in 1993 has two goals and 10 assists in 61 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit dealt Hodson and a 1999 second-round pick for Clark and  
a sixth-round pick in 1999, Wings general manager Ken Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second deal, Detroit is giving Tampa Bay an unconditional  
draft pick for Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 14th NHL season, Clark, 32, was the Lightning's leading  
scorer. He had 28 goals and 14 assists in 65 games this season. He 
has appeared in 748 career NHL games, totaling 332 goals and 230 
assists for 562 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay backup Ranford appeared in 32 games and compiled a  
3-18-3 record in his 14th NHL season. He's got a 3.90 goals-against 
average and .881 saves percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios, Clark and Ranford will all be available to play  
Wednesday night at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodson, 27, has played in just four games with Detroit this  
season, his fourth in the NHL. He's 0-2-0, with a goals-against 
average of 3.09. 
</P>
<P>
	As Detroit's No. 2 goaltender last season, Hodson posted a  
record of 9-3-3 and a 2.67 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my first trade, so after the shock of it is over, I'm  
sure it's going to be good for me and my family,'' Hodson said. 
``I'm grateful for the time I had in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wings also acquired Samuelsson, an unrestricted free agent  
on July 1, who is out two to three weeks with a broken foot. He is 
expected to be back for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelsson played on two Stanley Cup champions in Pittsburgh,  
the last of which, in 1992, came when current Red Wings coach 
Scotty Bowman was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman said the trades come at a perfect time for the team,  
which has 12 games to go before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us depth down the stretch,'' Bowman said. ``The  
playoffs are a marathon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelsson is in his third season with the Rangers. He has four  
goals and has eight assists in 67 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers reportedly will received a second- and third-round  
draft pick in return.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Stay Extra 60 Days in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The jail time Mike Tyson is due to serve for  
violating his Indiana probation will stand, putting an end to talk 
that the former heavyweight champ could leave a Maryland jail as 
early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's one-year sentence for assault in Maryland might still be  
reduced to time already served, but the boxer must still serve 60 
days for violating terms of his probation for a 1992 rape 
conviction in Indiana, a prosecutor's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, even if the Maryland sentence is modified,  
he will not be released from jail on Friday,'' said Beverly 
Phillips of the Marion County prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson requested that his assault sentence be reduced to eight  
months, and a hearing is set for Friday at Montgomery County (Md.) 
District Court. Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's two lawyers in the 
Maryland case, said last week that such a reduction could free his 
client from jail by Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has been jailed in Maryland since Feb. 5 on charges he  
assaulted two motorists after a minor traffic accident last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Prosecutor Scott Newman, Tyson attorney James  
Voyles and Marion Superior Court Judge Patricia Gifford conferred 
Monday in Indianapolis and also talked to Maryland authorities. 
They agreed that the boxer still must serve the extra time for his 
probation violation, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the judge modifies his sentence, at that point his Indiana  
sentence will begin. There's no retroactive in any of these 
calculations,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Indiana sentence begins, Tyson could serve as little as  
30 of the 60 days, depending on time off for good behavior and 
other provisions, she said. That means Tyson could leave jail by 
April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``The integrity of both the Indiana and the Maryland sentences  
will be honored,'' Voyles said. He declined to speculate on how the 
court hearing Friday will turn out or when Tyson may leave jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Tyson struck a deal with Newman and Maryland  
authorities in which he agreed to serve his Indiana jail time in 
Maryland after he completes his assault sentence.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Again Surrounded by Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The women's favorite in a meet  
dominated by Russian stars, Michelle Kwan is in a familiar position 
in the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean she's comfortable. Fighting a head cold, the  
American skater had good reason to be concerned as she prepared for 
her title defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm coming down with something,'' she admitted Monday during a  
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she sounded congested, Kwan was in top form -- hitting  
jump after jump -- during practice Sunday and Monday. She hopes to 
recover without taking medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take it until it gets really bad,'' she said.  
``I always think medication will make my reactions a little slower. 
I want to be there when I skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's qualifications begin Wednesday, with 20 percent of  
the total score at stake, followed by the short program Friday and 
the long program Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's singles opened Monday, with Russians taking both  
sections of the qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Yevgeny Plushenko won one group and defending world champion  
Alexei Yagudin won the other, despite a sore left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss was second behind Plushenko. In  
the other group, former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov, another 
Russian, was second to Yagudin. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's qualifying featured a record number of quadruple  
jumps, with six skaters -- including two Americans -- executing the 
difficult maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss completed his first clean quad in competition, and Tim  
Goebel landed the first quad salchow in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, three skaters completed quad salchows in the 1997  
Grand Prix final and the 1997 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finally nailed a clean quad toe loop. He thought he had  
one in 1997, but a video replay hours later showed he slightly 
two-footed it. There was no doubt about it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I initially wasn't planning on trying it, but as soon as I saw  
two of them hit theirs out there, I knew if I wanted to be up there 
in first or second I had to go for it,'' he said. ``It worked 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss finished second ahead of three-time world champion Elvis  
Stojko of Canada, who hit a quad, but fell on another. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko started strong, with his quad, but had slight errors  
on a number of his other jumps. American Trifun Zivanovic landed 
seven triple jumps to place fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who has been consistent throughout the season won his  
group easily without even attempting one. His marks were nearly all 
5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze off  
Russia won the pairs short program, with China's Shen Xue and Zhao 
Hongbo close behind. 
</P>
<P>
	With a huge delayed double twist lift, the Chinese might have  
beaten the Russians if Shen had not touched down on a throw triple 
loop.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 82.42 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today, weighed down by  
technology issues as investors grew uneasy about weakening demand 
for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 82.42 at 9,808.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 9.20 at 1,287.81. The technology-heavy 
Nasdaq composite index was down 9.18 at 2,386.76. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-4 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 102.63 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a Dow stock, reflected the market's concern about high-tech  
issues. It was down 11/16 at 166 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was down 6 at 124.  
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership of the market in recent days, stemming from the  
failure to break through 10,000, has really been lackluster,'' said 
Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., 
in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, with the continued weakness in technology leaders,  
the blue chips outperformed and provided some buying opportunities. 
Belski said the Dow was low enough today that it might entice some 
buyers into the market. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Dow meandered and ended 13.04 lower at 9,890.51.  
The Dow, although it was unable to close above 10,000 on three 
separate days last week, is still up more than 8 percent so far 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slid 2.2 percent, as  
investors locked in profits following the Nikkei average's steep 
gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were lower amid concern over the economic  
outlook in the region. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index 
was down 2.07 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.74 percent, 
and France's CAC-40 was down 1.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Fights a Cold Out on the Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michelle Kwan began her journey to a  
third world title with obstacles she has not faced before. 
</P>
<P>
	With a head cold that forced her to take antibiotics, she was  
also up against the prospect of doing two free skates and a short 
program within 75 hours, all counting in the new International 
Skating Union scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's qualifications began today. The pairs title will be  
decided tonight, with Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze 
seeking their second straight world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is seeking her third, and she had to put some effort into  
the qualifications, which now count in the scoring, before Friday's 
short program and Saturday afternoon's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Kwan admitted she'd begun taking medicine for  
the cold, which she hoped to avoid out of concern medication might 
slow her reactions, but said ``I don't expect it to bother me'' in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a cold, Kwan is formidable and she had the luck of the  
draw. Her closest challengers, Maria Butyrskaya of Russia and 
Tatyana Malinina of Uzbekistan, were in the other qualifying group 
following Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, qualifications counted for nothing. They were just  
a way to eliminate the lower-end skaters. The top skaters, assured 
of qualifying, could take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now however, the qualification counts for 20 percent. A misstep  
or a missed jump could be costly for Kwan. The ISU's setup of two 
groups, each with the top skaters getting equal points, could pose 
a problem for those who are second and third. 
</P>
<P>
	That situation happened in the men's event.  
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, finished third in  
the qualifying, followed by a third in Tuesday' short program for 
the men. Previously, a third place in the short would still keep 
him in solid contention for his fourth world title. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he needs help -- a lot of it -- if he is to vault past the  
Russians ahead of him in Thursday's free skate. Both Russians won 
their group qualifications on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship is there for either Yevgeny Plushenko or Alexei  
Yagudin to lose. If either wins the long program -- or comes in 
second in the long to Stojko -- the title is his. 
</P>
<P>
	A few mistakes by both would be needed for Stojko to win.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoping for a mistake from the 16-year-old Plushenko would be  
risky. He was impressive with his jumps in the short, skating to 
``Hava Nagila.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin landed a bit off on his opening triple axel-triple toe  
loop combination, but stayed in form for the rest of the 
circus-themed routine, full of vivid and amusing gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Michael Weiss ended in fourth place after a  
program that was less technically ambitious than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Yagudin, Plushenko and Weiss, Stojko put a quad in his  
short program, but two-footed it. He characterized this year's 
championships as ``the toughest I've ever encountered by a 
hundredfold.'' He said that he had ``set up some very big 
expectations'' by assuming that his year-old groin injury would 
heal even as he competed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians also took the lead in the ice dance event with Angelika  
Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov putting in a smooth performance to the 
Paso Double and Tango Romantica. That put them solidly in first for 
the portion, counting 20 percent of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a tie for second between Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and  
Victor Kraatz and France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat. 
Each ranked ahead of the other in one of the dances, although 
Anissina and Peizerat received a first place vote from the French 
judge.

<HEADLINE> Langdon Shakes Off Shooting Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- While the pressure is on Duke as the  
overwhelming favorite to win the NCAA men's basketball title, Blue 
Devils sharpshooter Trajan Langdon has been able to lighten up a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon has been Duke's money player the past three seasons, the  
guy the Blue Devils go to for clutch 3-pointers and smooth baseline 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	That was until the postseason rolled around, where Langdon was a  
flop in 1997 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a combined 19-for-68 from the field (28 percent),  
including 11-for-38 on 3-pointers as the Blue Devils were ousted 
from the NCAA tournament by Providence and eventual national 
champion Kentucky the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Langdon's shooting problems in those years can be traced  
to Duke's lack of offense -- he was not only the major option in the 
team's attack, but sometimes its only option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have put too much pressure on myself,'' Langdon said  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With a host of talented teammates on this year's squad helping  
take the pressure off, the 6-foot-3 senior has rectified his 
tournament shooting woes the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the first tournament game against Florida A&AMP;M with  
a foot injury, Langdon has gone 19-for-30 from 3-point range in his 
last three games, including 11-for-18 in winning the East Regional 
MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole team can contribute offensively so it does take some  
pressure off my shoulders and I can relax shooting the ball,'' 
Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Duke (36-1) now heads to the national semifinals  
against Michigan State with a sizzling shooter as part of its 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan is not one who would ever succumb to pressure, but he  
is a human being and he can get worn down,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski 
said. ``He got worn down because he carried us -- further probably 
than we should have advanced a couple of times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon, one of the best free-throw shooters in Atlantic Coast  
Conference history and a 44 percent 3-point shooter this season, 
said he didn't give his prior postseason shooting woes a thought. 
That is, until the media brought it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys put it in my mind. That's all you guys talked  
about,'' Langdon told reporters Monday. ``I wasn't concerned about 
it. I wanted to do well, and then I came down with the foot injury, 
all I was thinking about was getting back on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he admits there is less pressure on his shooting this year  
with a host of other offensive options. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a different mindset. I put too much pressure on myself  
in the postseason these last couple of years. We have such a 
talented team they really don't need my shot, or if I don't shoot 
well we can win. We've even won big when I haven't shot well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he feels a special bond with Langdon, who helped  
bridge the gap between Duke's disastrous 13-18 season of 1994-95 
and this year's dominating Final Four squad that has won 31 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trajan doesn't lead for show, he leads when he needs to  
lead,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Trajan is extremely vocal in our own 
private setting. Being vocal does not mean being loud. That is a 
misconception out there. Loud just means loud. Trajan is not loud, 
but he is amazingly effective.''

<HEADLINE> Fund Taxes Can Skew Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When tax time rolls around, people who like  
mutual funds for their easy-to-understand convenience often find 
themselves wondering where the simplicity went. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax rules covering fund investments range from complicated  
to downright inscrutable. In many situations, tax issues can 
distort the picture so much that they discourage people from making 
the best investment choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem gets spotlighted each year at this time as fund  
shareholders grapple with their income-tax returns. But it never 
seems to receive the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider the decision that faces income-conscious savers as they  
look for a place to park money they don't want to tie up in 
long-term vehicles like stocks. Money-market funds, with aggregate 
assets of well over $1 trillion at last count, are one of the most 
popular choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Short- to intermediate-term bond funds, which might serve the  
same purpose just as well, typically pay more generous yields. But 
these funds have attracted, all together, barely more than $100 
billion from investors, or less than one-tenth as much as money 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common reason people give for picking money funds over  
short-term bond funds is that the latter's net asset value per 
share fluctuates slightly. But in recent years, those fluctuations 
have more often been gains than losses, with interest rates in a 
long-term decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The true reason for avoiding short-term bond funds, in a great  
many cases, is to avoid the tax hassle of dealing with capital 
gains and losses in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Just try writing a check sometime on an account in a short-term  
bond fund and then figuring out your tax bill. To most people, it's 
more trouble than it's worth. But the important thing to note is 
that the trouble arises not from some natural condition -- the 
inherent complexities of mathematics and accounting -- but rather 
purely from the tax system. 
</P>
<P>
	Another case in point: Investors' enthusiasm for variable  
annuities, which allow their holders to defer year-by-year taxes on 
dividends and capital gains, in contrast to standard mutual-fund 
investments, which do not, except in tax-favored retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my opinion,'' says Peter Katt, a Kalamazoo, Mich., life  
insurance adviser quoted in a current article published by the 
Institute of Certified Financial Planners, ``at least 90 percent of 
people currently buying variable annuities should not be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among more than 1,000 fund investors polled this past winter for  
the fund firm of Dreyfus Corp. by Response Center, a market 
research firm, 85 percent said taxes play an important role in 
their investment decisions. But almost everybody, 94 percent, said 
they weren't very familiar with the details of the most recent 
changes in the tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the respondents, 46 percent, said it was always  
better to choose a tax-free investment over a taxable one. If they 
truly believe this, they are almost certainly making decisions that 
cost them money. 
</P>
<P>
	When you choose between a tax-exempt municipal bond investment  
and a taxable corporate bond investment, the important numbers to 
focus on are the after-tax returns they would pay you. 
</P>
<P>
	Presuming that you are in the 28 percent income tax bracket, you  
should choose a tax-exempt bond only if it will yield you more than 
a taxable bond would after allowing for a 28 percent tax bite from 
its nominal payoff. If you don't take the trouble to do this 
arithmetic, you can easily wind up robbing yourself just to spite 
the tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at the results of its survey, Dreyfus concluded that  
``more education is needed for investors on the impact of taxes,'' 
in the words of Stephen Canter, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
	No arguing with that. But more time spent in study by the public  
isn't the only possible answer to the problem. A simpler, clearer 
system of tax rules -- say, one that allowed tax deferral in all 
accounts until withdrawals were made -- would go a long way toward 
encouraging people to reach the decisions that make the most 
economic sense.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lists More Targets in Beef War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It has been a tough month for American  
consumers with a taste for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the United States targeted $520 million worth of European  
imports, from Scottish cashmere sweaters and French handbags to 
Italian cheese and German coffee makers, in a fight with the 
European Union involving bananas. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the target list is an even bigger $900 million covering 81  
items, including Belgian chocolates, Danish hams, French truffles 
and Italian mopeds. These goods could disappear from American store 
shelves beginning this summer unless the two sides resolve a battle 
over beef. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the banana fight, the administration is threatening to  
impose 100 percent tariffs on a set of European products in 
retaliation against European trade barriers that have been ruled 
illegal by the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. cattle industry has put its lost export sales at $500  
million annually, while two U.S.-based companies, Chiquita and 
Dole, claim they are losing $520 million in banana sales from South 
American plantations because of European rules that favor bananas 
grown by former Caribbean colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The EU's 10-year, arbitrary and scientifically unjustified ban  
on U.S. beef has had a substantial negative impact on U.S. beef 
producers,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said 
Monday in announcing the new sanctions list in the beef dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The list will be pared after an April 21 public hearing at which  
the administration will give U.S. importers a chance to argue that 
certain products should be excluded because of economic harm to 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the banana fight, the administration began requiring  
importers to post bonds equal to the 100 percent duties as of March 
3, pending a ruling by the WTO on the proper amount of penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said in a statement Monday that the beef  
sanction threat ``will inevitably have a chilling effect on trade'' 
between the world's two largest trading partners and questioned the 
$900 million package of threatened sanctions, saying it was 10 
times larger than the amount the U.S. side was claiming in damage 
just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	European officials have resisted sales of hormone-treated beef,  
citing fears about possible long-term health consequences in a 
dispute that has stretched for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the United States actually imposed 100 percent tariffs  
on $94 million in products, including canned tomatoes, wine coolers 
and pet food. Those punitive tariffs remained in effect for five 
years until Europe agreed to allow a scientific panel to study the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing trade tensions between the United States and the  
European Union are coming at a time when the U.S. trade deficit is 
skyrocketing as the global financial crisis has cut into American 
exports of manufactured goods and farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 81 items on the preliminary sanctions list in the beef  
dispute are beef, pork and poultry products, Roquefort cheese, cut 
flowers, various tomato products, chestnuts, paprika, truffles, 
chocolate, ligonberry and raspberry jams, pears, peaches, mustard, 
mineral waters, yarn, hair clippers and moped motorcyles.

<HEADLINE> American, Pilots Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots are  
continuing negotiations in an attempt to break their stalemate over 
the carrier's recent acquisition of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the carrier and the Allied Pilots Association,  
joined by a private mediator, began Sunday at a resort outside 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse led pilots to stage a sickout last month that caused  
the cancellation of more than 6,600 flights. At issue is combining 
300 Reno Air pilots into American's 9,300-member pilots corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The carrier and its pilots had agreed to mediation if two more  
bargaining sessions failed to break their stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the parties agreed to cancel those face-to-face  
sessions because they believed that both sides were too entrenched 
to achieve progress without the help of a mediator. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-day sickout by up to 2,500 APA members forced American to  
cancel nearly 6,700 flights, inconveniencing 670,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The mediator is George Nicolau, a former president of the  
National Academy of Arbitrators who has handled arbitration for 
Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline wants to gradually bump Reno pilots up to the  
American pilot scale, after they are trained as American pilots and 
assigned to fly American jets. It says that that has been the 
industry's standard policy for handling pilot integrations 
throughout its history.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines and its pilots have  
temporarily recessed negotiations to break their stalemate over the 
carrier's recent acquisition of Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks between the airline and the Allied Pilots Association,  
joined by a private mediator, began Sunday at a resort outside 
Washington, D.C., and were recessed Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parties mutually agreed to resume mediated negotiations in  
early April after progress was made during the first three days,'' 
the airline and the union said in a statement Tuesday. ``The 
temporary recess was necessary to accommodate the schedule of 
mediator George Nicolau. At the mediator's request, the parties 
have agreed not to publicly discuss the negotiations while they are 
continuing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicolau, a former president of the National Academy of  
Arbitrators, has handled arbitration for Major League Baseball and 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno Air dispute led 2,500 APA members to stage an 11-day

into American's corps of 9,300.

<HEADLINE> `Judge Judy' Tops Daytime Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's a new queen of daytime television, and  
don't even THINK of talking back to her. 
</P>
<P>
	Tart-talking ``Judge Judy'' Sheindlin has single-handedly led a  
revival of the court show genre and surged to the top of the 
daytime ratings by dispensing no-nonsense justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' surged past Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Springer and  
Rosie O'Donnell in the ratings during TV's February ``sweeps'' 
period. Her Nielsen Media Research numbers are up 60 percent over 
last year while her three biggest rivals are down. 
</P>
<P>
	``People respond to her in the same way they responded to Jesse  
Ventura,'' said Larry Lyttle, president of Big Ticket Television, 
which produces the show. ``There's a certain attitude and 
directness and succinctness that people relate to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other court shows, combatants air their grievances before  
Sheindlin and she makes a ruling. ``Judge Judy'' seeks cases where 
the people involved have a prior relationship in order to fire up 
more passion, Lyttle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheindlin, who wrote a book titled ``Don't Pee on My Leg and  
Tell Me It's Raining,'' doesn't take kindly to being bamboozled or 
sassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a very strong personality and people like that,'' said  
Marc Berman, a television analyst for Seltel. ``People watch her to 
see how she rules a courtroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Court shows were big in the 1980s, when Judge Wapner's  
``People's Court'' was the rage. But in the cyclical world of 
syndicated television, they soon burned out. None were left on the 
air by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyttle decided to take a chance on reviving the genre when he  
met with Sheindlin, a former Family Court judge in New York, and 
the show premiered in fall 1996. He wondered how the country would 
respond to such a clearly New York personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know if people would be captivated by it or turned  
off by it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Judy'' slowly caught on and she soon had rivals. Former  
New York City Mayor Edward Koch now presides over a revived 
``People's Court.'' Former boxing referee Mills Lane and Judge Joe 
Brown started shows this season. 
</P>
<P>
	None are sensations like ``Judge Judy,'' but all are doing well  
enough to stick around, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next fall brings two new ones, including a revival of ``Divorce  
Court.''

	The courtroom shows are thriving as talk shows fade, largely due  
to oversaturation. Ratings for ``Oprah'' in February were down 18 
percent from 1998, ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' was off 16 percent 
and Springer dropped by 10 percent, Berman said. Roseanne's show is 
struggling for its life.

<P>
	Sheindlin, meanwhile, reportedly wants to sweeten her contract  
with an ownership stake and may not tape any more shows until she's 
satisfied, the New York Daily News reported, quoting sources it did 
not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge wasn't available to talk and a spokeswoman refused  
comment on her contract situation. Lyttle said Sheindlin is under 
contract and hadn't expressed to him any desire to renegotiate. He 
said he didn't expect her to boycott work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure she'd like to make more money,'' he said. ``I'd like  
to make more money. If the show continues to do well, I'm sure we 
all will.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Neagle Getting Back in Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Denny Neagle let out an audible ``Ah!''  
that the 35 people in the stands could hear when his first pitch to 
Terry Steinbach came in shoulder-high. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle broke out into a smile when pitch No. 2, another  
fastball, cruised to the plate at the same altitude despite his 
best effort to keep it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he hung his head when his 2-0 changeup left Steinbach's  
bat and headed for the brush beyond the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Neagle's biggest test of spring training went on  
Tuesday: lots of grunts and a little progress. He threw 32 strikes 
in 58 pitches -- his longest outing of the spring -- in a ``B'' game 
for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander's four innings against a Minnesota Twins lineup  
that included a smattering of big leaguers showed Neagle is headed 
in the right direction, but going rather slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was encouraged today. I was very pleased,'' general manager  
Jim Bowden said. ``I certainly think this was a step in the right 
direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds obtained Neagle from Atlanta in a November trade  
involving Bret Boone, they figured he'd be a constant in the 
rotation. Instead, he pulled thigh muscles during a drill in the 
first full-squad workout. 
</P>
<P>
	There was another setback when strength tests found weakness in  
the back of his pitching shoulder. He was put on a workout program 
and held back while he builds up the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't thrown in a regular spring game and almost certainly  
is headed for the disabled list to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's not the worst-case scenario,'' Neagle said after  
giving up three hits -- including Steinbach's solo homer -- and one 
walk in four innings. ``It might be the best thing for me, rather 
than pushing it. I might miss two starts. It's better if I miss two 
starts in April than push it and it sets me back and I miss seven 
or eight starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said if Neagle goes on the disabled list, he could be  
activated at the end of the first week of the season. Neagle 
probably would stay behind and pitch in Florida when the team 
breaks training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Don Gullett said Neagle will pitch in either a  
simulated game or a minor league game on Sunday. The Reds then will 
decide what course to take with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle's fastball was clocked at 80-82 mph in his first inning  
Tuesday and increased by a few miles per hour as he went on. The 
main problem was the wildness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's making progress,'' Gullett said. ``His fastball was  
better today, but he was up with it some. At times he threw good 
fastballs. That's the inconsistency and the rustiness.''

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down Alabama Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Assocaited Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today struck down an Alabama  
tax, ruling that it discriminates against out-of-state 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise tax is unconstitutional because it sets different  
methods for taxing in-state and out-of-state corporations that 
could give in-state corporations a tax advantage, the court ruled 
unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Alabama must scrap a tax that has brought in  
more than $100 million a year from out-of-state companies doing 
business there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state cannot justify this discrimination,'' by arguing  
that the franchise tax offsets a separate tax on in-state firms, 
the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relevant tax burdens are not roughly approximate, nor are  
they similar in substance,'' Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama imposes a franchise tax on both in-state and  
out-of-state corporations. Those based in the state must pay $10 
per $1,000 of the par value of their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The par value of a corporation's stock is determined by the  
corporation itself and does not represent the stock's book or 
market value. So in-state businesses minimize their franchise-tax 
liability by assigning only a token par value to their stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But out-of-state corporations pay Alabama's franchise tax based  
on a rate of $3 per $1,000 of ``the actual amount of capital 
employed'' in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the tax by a 5-4 vote a year  
ago. Two corporations, BellSouth and CSX Transportation, appealed 
to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the companies argued that out-of-state corporations  
pay about five times more in franchise taxes than they would if 
they were incorporated in Alabama. In all, the state collects more 
than $100 million a year in franchise taxes from out-of-state 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is South Central Bell Telephone Co. vs. Alabama,  
97-2045.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Aid Delayed in Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is all but certain to delay until  
next month its work on a bill initially aimed at rushing aid to 
hurricane victims in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators planned to resume debating the $2 billion measure  
today. By afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
was expected to turn to the Republican-written $1.74 trillion 
federal budget for fiscal 2000, a higher profile, higher priority 
measure for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	A $1.3 billion version of the aid package is expected to clear  
the House this week. Like the Senate bill, it contains nearly $1 
billion to help Central America recover from Hurricane Mitch and 
other natural disasters, plus aid for Jordan, U.S. farmers and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton requested the aid a month ago. But the Senate  
bill has been slowed by disputes over Kosovo and the federal budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	It has already attracted more than three dozen provisions by  
senators aiming to help home-state or other favored constituencies. 
With 49 other possible amendments on tap, Lott was expected to 
shift to the budget, which he would like to finish before Congress 
begins a two-week Easter break this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is unlikely to return to the disaster bill until  
lawmakers return on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans blame Clinton for the delay. They say they proposed  
time-consuming amendments seeking to block U.S. action in the 
Kosovo crisis because the president hasn't clearly defined the U.S. 
interest there and has failed to consult sufficiently with Congress 
about possible U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy, either,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee  
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``But the real problem is the way 
Kosovo has come at us has raised a lot of questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP lawmakers also say they were not about to use the federal  
surplus to pay for the bill, as Clinton wanted. Since this year's 
budget surplus comes entirely from surpluses being run by Social 
Security, the GOP has used the fight to cast Clinton as willing to 
raid Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``What slowed this down was the administration wanted to spend  
the Social Security trust fund money on foreign aid,'' said Lott 
spokesman John Czwartacki. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate versions have drawn veto threats from  
Clinton, largely because Republicans would pay for them by cutting 
food stamps, funds that back World Bank loans, and other programs 
the administration supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials say the delay will hurt efforts to send  
nearly $1 billion to Central American nations still staggering from 
Hurricane Mitch, which struck them last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the bill in mid-April is ``about the end point for  
translating congressional approval into money on the ground'' in 
time to help in Central America, Mark Schneider, an assistant 
administrator at the U.S. Agency for International Development, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider said speed is important to get aid to the region's  
farmers before the rainy season makes crop planting difficult and 
to stop potentially large numbers of immigrants from fleeing to the 
United States. In addition, schools and health facilities need to 
be rebuilt, the sooner the better, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day makes it more difficult,'' Schneider said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the measure has become a magnet for provisions  
offered by senators including: 
</P>
<P>
	--$500,000 by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., to combat erosion at Lake  
Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	--$5 million by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., to repair the government's  
Headgate Rock power plant used by the Colorado River Indian tribe 
near Parker, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	--A provision by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would  
retroactively increase federal subsidies for some wheat farmers in 
Washington, Oregon and Idaho to match subsidies given other wheat 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Language by Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both  
D-Calif., to increase grants for migrant and seasonal farm workers.

<HEADLINE> NHL Trades Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings  
made certain they will have no shortage of leadership when they 
added 59 years of experience to their roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, barely over .500 at 34-30-6, made a flurry of  
deals prior to the 3 p.m. trade deadline. They added defenseman 
Chris Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson, wing Wendel Clark, and backup 
goaltender Bill Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks will receive defenseman Anders Eriksson and  
first-round draft picks in 1999 and 2001 for Chelios, who has eight 
goals and 26 assists in 65 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a key addition to the Red Wings' depleted defensive corps,  
which may be without Uwe Krupp and Todd Gill for the rest of the 
season due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a quality two-way defenseman who will add toughness,  
the 37-year-old Chelios has won three Norris Trophy awards as the 
league's top defenseman in a 16-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit also traded backup goaltender Kevin Hodson and two draft  
picks to Tampa Bay for Clark and Ranford and dealt two picks to the 
New York Rangers for the injured Samuelsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Clark, in his 14th season, was the Lightning's  
leading scorer with 28 goals and 14 assists in 65 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford appeared in 32 games and compiled a 3-18-3 record in his  
14th NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodson, 27, is 0-2-0 in four games with Detroit this season, his  
fourth in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings acquired Samuelsson, who is out 2-3 weeks with a  
broken foot, for a 1999 second-round pick and a third-round 
selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelsson has four goals and has eight assists in 67 games in  
his third season with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit wasn't the only team making multiple moves. Last year's  
Stanley Cup finalist, the Washington Capitals, now in 12th place in 
the Eastern Conference, unloaded three veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime captain Dale Hunter was sent to the Colorado Avalanche,  
wing Joe Juneau was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres and wing Craig 
Berube to the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche gave Washington a 1999 second-round draft pick in  
exchange for Hunter and a third-round selection in 2000. Juneau, 
who has 14 goals and 27 assists this season, was dealt with a 1999 
third-round pick to the Sabres for minor league defenseman Alexei 
Tezikov and future considerations. Berube will join the Flyers in 
exchange for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough, really emotional, after what we  
accomplished last year,'' Capitals general manager George McPhee 
said. ``Pulling these guys out of the mix wasn't easy, but they're 
all unrestricted free agents and we weren't going to get anything 
for them this summer if they signed elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other deals, Philadelphia added one of the top offensive  
defenseman in the league by securing Steve Duchesne from Los 
Angeles for defensman Dave Babych and fifth-round draft pick in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne had four goals and 19 assists in 60 games.  
</P>
<P>
	San Jose obtained center Vincent Damphousse from the Montreal  
Canadiens for a 1999 fifth-round draft pick and a 2000 second-round 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse has 12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also got wing Greg Pankewiecz from the Calgary Flames  
for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edmonton Oilers picked up defenseman Jason Smith from the  
Toronto Maple Leafs for a 1999 fourth-round and a 2000 second-round 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 25, has two goals, 11 assists and 40 penalty minutes in  
60 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Blues re-acquired wing Blair Atcheynum for a  
sixth-round Entry Draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto obtained center Yanic Perreault from the Los Angeles  
Kings for minor-league forward Jason Podollan and a '99 third-round 
draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix swapped young defensemen with the Rangers, sending  
22-year-old Jason Doig to New York in exchange for 23-year-old 
Stanislav Neckar and a sixth-round pick in the 1999 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes also sent center J.F. Jomphe to Montreal for future  
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, the Blackhawks acquired right wing Chris Murray  
from the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Nelson Emerson.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Breaks Court Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Taking the witness stand after defying  
Kenneth Starr's prosecutors for 2 1/2 years, Susan McDougal said 
Tuesday she never discussed a fraudulent $300,000 loan with Bill 
Clinton and ``did not hear anything untruthful'' when the president 
testified at her 1996 trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At times crying, at times speaking animatedly to the jury in her  
criminal contempt trial, the Clintons' former real estate partner 
depicted herself as a ``people person'' who mostly left Whitewater 
financial matters to her husband, James McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified that he felt abandoned by Clinton and told her in  
1992 that one of Clinton's political enemies was paying him to talk 
to The New York Times about Whitewater. She said James McDougal 
also told her he discussed Clinton's past ``in a conference call 
with the Bush White House'' during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony opened the way for Starr's prosecutors to get  
answers from Mrs. McDougal for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy Hickman Ewing Jr. said he thinks prosecutors will  
have questions for Mrs. McDougal this week, ``but this is not a 
substitute for what would have happened in the grand jury'' if she 
had testified years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, led his client through a  
series of questions she refused to answer when she appeared before 
a federal grand jury in September 1996 and again in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Was Clinton truthful in his videotaped testimony for her 1996  
fraud trial? Geragos asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing he said was untrue to me,'' replied Mrs. McDougal, who  
was convicted of four felonies in that case. ``As I sat there that 
day, I did not hear anything untruthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the 1996 trial of James and Susan McDougal and then-Arkansas  
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, all of whom were convicted, the president 
testified that he knew nothing about a fraudulent $300,000 
federally backed loan that went into the McDougals' joint checking 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never discussed the loan with William Jefferson Clinton,''  
Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten minutes into her testimony, Mrs. McDougal began crying as  
she recalled her first real estate project with her former husband. 
``Talking about Jim is very hard for me. He died recently,'' she 
said, wiping away tears. Her ex-husband died in prison in March 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	When federal regulators forced the McDougals out of their  
failing savings and loan in 1986, the estranged couple both were in 
dire financial straits, including their foundering Whitewater 
investment with the Clintons. Mrs. McDougal said her husband's 
health was poor and she struggled to solve the problems herself 
without letting on how bad things were. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to tell Bill and Hillary Clinton,'' she said,  
because she was too proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal has asserted that she has refused to cooperate  
with Starr's investigation because prosecutors want her to 
implicate the Clintons falsely in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	She cast doubt on the motives of her former husband, who told  
prosecutors that Clinton lied in his videotaped testimony for the 
1996 trial. James McDougal felt Clinton abandoned him in 1989, she 
said, when he was tried and acquitted of felony charges relating to 
the operations of his failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, she said, James McDougal told her ``he was going  
to pay back the Clintons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told her Republican activist and lawyer Sheffield Nelson  
``would pay him some money'' for talking to the Times, Mrs. 
McDougal said. Geragos later said he'd heard the amount was ``in 
five figures'' and suggested that Nelson may have been funneling 
the money to McDougal from someone else. Nelson did not immediately 
return a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have other information that relates to where the money came  
from,'' said Geragos, but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of criminal contempt and obstructing Starr's  
investigation, Mrs. McDougal could be sentenced to jail and fined 
up to $750,000. She already has served 18 months in jail for civil 
contempt in the Whitewater matter, but prosecutors said her 
testimony was so crucial that her refusal warranted criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also was asked whether Clinton knew about another  
business under scrutiny by prosecutors following the Whitewater 
paper trail, the McDougals' Lorance Heights real estate 
development. Both the president and Mrs. Clinton have denied 
knowledge under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have in a social sense told him I was working out  
there, but certainly I never discussed any substantial thing about 
Lorance Heights with Bill Clinton,'' Mrs. McDougal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lorance Heights project has been an important part of  
Starr's investigation. Mrs. McDougal said she understood the 
$300,000 loan, deposited in her joint account with James McDougal, 
was to have been used for the project. She said she picked up the 
loan at her husband's instructions and knew nothing else about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trusted him for everything,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> PLO Body To Decide on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A 125-member PLO body will have the final word  
next month on whether the Palestinians will declare independence 
May 4, a senior Palestinian official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who was to meet today in  
Washington with President Clinton, is under heavy pressure from the 
United States to postpone any statehood declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat had said he would declare independence in the West Bank  
and Gaza Strip on May 4, when a five-year interim period of 
self-rule ends under accords with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	However, amid fears in Europe and the United States that the  
move would spark a crisis in the peace process, he has since 
softened his position, saying the decision is not final. 
</P>
<P>
	The PLO Central Committee will convene at the end of April in  
the Gaza Strip and will vote a final decision on the issue, 
committee chairman Salim Zanoun told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanoun, speaking in a telephone interview from Amman, said the  
committee will make its decision after ``assessing the 
international positions on the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Arafat promises Clinton to postpone the declaration, he would  
likely have little difficulty in getting the decision approved by 
the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabil Amr, an Arafat adviser and member of the Palestinian  
legislature, said a majority of committee members are Arafat 
supporters and will likely back any decision the Palestinian leader 
would take. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote would give a postponement more legitimacy before the  
public.

<HEADLINE> Fired Blue Jays Manager Lauds GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Tim Johnson says he isn't bitter about the  
Toronto Blue Jays' decision to fire him last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things have been said and some things are written  
that really aren't true, that I don't like the organization,'' 
Johnson was quoted as saying in Tuesday's editions of the Toronto 
Globe and Mail. ``That's untrue. I think the world of Gord Ash. I 
love the organization and I truly believe in my heart that the team 
can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ash, Toronto's general manager, decided to replace Johnson with  
Jim Fregosi after concluding Johnson's lies about his military 
service cost him the trust of players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like your heart got torn out,'' Johnson told the paper  
from Clay Center, Kan., where he is staying with his in-laws. ``It 
was probably the hardest thing Gord had to do, because he did hire 
me. I do have a good feeling for this man, I want everybody to know 
that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 49, has an offer to remain with the Blue Jays'  
organization in scouting or player development. He has a few weeks 
to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest thing was the timing part of it,'' Johnson said.  
``But they had to make a decision. Whether Gord did it or the 
owners, I don't know.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rashad Plays Zora Neale Hurston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Playwright Thulani Davis tells two stories in  
``Everybody's Ruby,'' and she reveals fascinating details along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Her play, which steadily builds, is based on an event in 1952 in  
segregated Live Oak, Fla. It begins with a bang -- and a death. Ruby 
McCollum, a black woman, is charged with murdering Doc Adams, a 
white man. 
</P>
<P>
	Viola Davis is Ruby and Beau Gravitte is Adams in the play at  
the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Kenny Leon, of the Alliance Theater 
in Atlanta, directs with scenes changing by furniture wheeled 
quickly on and off stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Phylicia Rashad plays Zora Neale Hurston, now considered one of  
the most important authors of the Harlem Renaissance. But Hurston, 
who died impoverished in the 1960s, fell out of favor in the 1950s 
and tried to reinstate herself as a writer by covering the McCollum 
trial for a black newspaper in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rashad, known as Bill Cosby's TV wife, never overplays Hurston.  
She gives her sturdy courage, but not bravado, asking questions of 
a hostile judge and walking into bars frequented by men. Neither 
blacks nor whites will talk much to Hurston. Thulani Davis, the 
playwright, is a former reporter and knows how to show Hurston 
digging for facts. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ruby's story unfolds, she becomes a personality, with  
education, intelligence, a loving husband and an inexplicable 
attachment to the doctor. Her husband, Sam, played by Bill Nunn, 
collects numbers bets and gives part of the money to Doc Adams. 
After the doctor rapes Ruby, she becomes his mistress, though she 
considers Sam good and Adams bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby shoots the doctor after she realizes that he'll murder her  
because she has borne his light-skinned child -- a definite risk for 
Adams, who wants to run for public office. Davis is an actress of 
range, taking Ruby from glowing femininity to blank-eyed defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the play's most telling vignettes, Hurston runs out of  
money and sells the portable typewriter on which she wrote seven 
books. The buyer believes a black woman with a typewriter surely 
stole it. 
</P>
<P>
	So Hurston quickly makes up a story: She's a maid and her  
employer gave it to her -- for her son, of course, not for herself. 
The buyer says it's worth $10 and gives her $6. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, when she realizes only a white writer can get the  
facts, Hurston telephones a friend, Southern author William 
Bradford Huie (Tuck Milligan), to take over the reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Hurston leaves in defeat, Rashad is able to convey her  
small bow to reality, her spirit unbroken.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian Jurors See Tape of Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today watched a videotape of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas Youk, the man 
with Lou Gehrig's disease he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which began Monday, raced toward a swift conclusion  
today with prosecution resting its case after calling three 
witnesses. Kevorkian said he would present only one witness when 
testimony resumed after lunch, but decided it would be Youk's 
widow, Melody, not his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape started with Kevorkian interviewing Youk, 52, about his  
illness, which forced him to use a feeding tube and was 
progressively depriving him of control of his body. 
</P>
<P>
	On camera, Kevorkian asks Youk if he wants to go ahead and end  
his life. Youk indicates he does, and Kevorkian hands him a pen to 
sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait a week and see how you feel in a week. Is that all  
right with you, Tom?'' Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape resumes later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then begins preparing an intravenous line for Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to inject. We're going to inject in your right  
arm,'' Kevorkian says. A hand is shown injecting drugs into Youk's 
intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a straight line. ... His heart is stopped,''  
Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance in the Sept. 17, 1998, death of Youk. Portions 
of the video of Youk's death were shown in November on CBS' ``60 
Minutes;'' today, jurors saw the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
	After that videotape, jurors were shown a tape of the ``60  
Minutes'' broadcast itself in which Mike Wallace interviewed 
Kevorkian, who said he would starve himself to death in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland County medical examiner, Dr. L.J. Dragovic, then  
took the stand and testified that Youk's body showed signs of 
muscular wasting, as from an illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic said an injection of potassium chloride -- which  
Kevorkian said he gave Youk -- would stop the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	During his cross-examination, Kevorkian pressed Dragovic on  
whether Lou Gehrig's disease contributed to Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic insisted there was no link. ``It had absolutely no  
contribution to Mr. Youk's death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic has called Kevorkian a ``crazy man,'' and said in  
November that he welcomed the murder charge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in Kevorkian's dealings simply kills themselves,'' he  
told The Detroit News last fall. ``Kevorkian is loading the gun, 
cocking the gun and making sure the deadly trajectory of the bullet 
is established so that the vital organ is hit and life is 
extinguished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Monday with selection of a jury of 12 members  
and two alternates, followed by opening arguments. Kevorkian, 
acting as his own attorney, gave the defense statement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise a human being dying at my hands. But my intent isn't  
to kill a person. I am forced by my position as a physician to do 
this,'' Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury was not present to hear most of Kevorkian's  
argument. Less than three minutes into his statement, Oakland 
County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski objected, contending 
that Kevorkian was arguing law, rather than summarizing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper agreed, saying Kevorkian needed to  
argue the facts, not the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, a retired pathologist who says he's been present for  
more than 130 deaths, insists he committed no crime. He 
rhetorically asked jurors why he would have recorded Youk's death 
had he thought it murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anyone with reason or common sense believe I would do all  
that knowing it was a crime and give it to `60 Minutes'?'' 
Kevorkian said. ``My intent was not to murder Tom Youk, and the 
evidence will show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, has faced trial four times before on assisted  
suicide charges, with cases ending in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	He dared prosecutors to do something about the Youk case. A  
conviction would mean a mandatory sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Skrzynski urged the jury to remember that  
despite the publicity surrounding Kevorkian, the defendant is not 
above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Begin to focus on what Jack Kevorkian does, and what Jack  
Kevorkian says, and what you will see is a man breaking the law,'' 
Skrzynski said. ``Jack Kevorkian killed Tom Youk, and Jack 
Kevorkian does not have the right to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski said Youk's death does not qualify as an assisted  
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Youk did not kill himself with Jack Kevorkian's help. Jack  
Kevorkian killed Tom Youk by injecting him with drugs,'' the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	While representing himself, Kevorkian will be allowed to consult  
with lawyers David Gorosh and Lisa Dwyer. Defending himself, he 
said, was ``what I've planned all along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge expressed misgivings about allowing Kevorkian to serve  
as his own lawyer, asking him, ``Do you understand you could spend 
the rest of your life in prison?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much of it left,'' he responded.

<HEADLINE> BoSox's Garciaparra Gets Good News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra and the Boston Red Sox  
got good news Tuesday -- the star shortstop has tendinitis, but no 
ligament damage, in his ailing right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, runnerup for the AL MVP award, could resume playing  
this week as a designated hitter and is expected to be in the 
opening-day lineup April 5 at Kansas City, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary report on Garciaparra's condition followed an  
MRI and examination on Monday by Dr. Tony Daly, the physician for 
the Los Angeles Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra also was examined Tuesday by Dr. Lewis Yocum,  
orthopedist and team physician for the Anaheim Angels. The 1997 AL 
rookie of the year was expected back at Boston's spring training 
camp on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, 25, hit .323 with 35 homers last season and led  
Boston with 122 RBIs. He became Boston's primary power threat after 
Mo Vaughn signed as a free agent with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortstop sought the opinions of Daly and Yocum after  
complaining of a sharp pain in the elbow of his throwing arm. He 
hasn't played shortstop in any of the last 11 Red Sox games. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra apparently hurt his elbow while making a relay throw  
against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Sox team physician Arthur Pappas had diagnosed the problem  
as a strain in a forearm ligament, and tendinitis or soreness in 
the biceps muscle.

<HEADLINE> FCC Sets 'Dialing Parity' Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators set deadlines Tuesday for  
implementing rules that would let local telephone customers dial 
the same number of digits for toll calls no matter who their phone 
company is. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission said local telephone  
companies with plans to provide ``dialing parity'' that have been 
approved by the states they serve must provide that parity by May 
7. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that haven't filed dialing parity plans with state  
regulators must do so by April 22, the FCC said, adding that states 
will have until June 22 to act on the plans and companies will have 
30 days after that to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
	And companies that haven't received state approval of their  
dialing parity plans by June 22 must file their plans with the FCC. 
They'll have to implement them 30 days after getting FCC approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's rules, which implement a provision of a 1996  
telecommunications law, aim to help open the $110 billion local 
phone market to long-distance companies and other rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The rationale: Consumers wouldn't be inclined to switch from  
their local phone company to another provider for their instate 
long-distance, or toll, calls if they had to dial extra digits to 
make those calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, a federal appeals court in St. Louis threw out  
the FCC's dialing parity rules, saying states, not the FCC, have 
the power to set such rules. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court reversed that ruling Jan. 25, declaring  
the FCC does have the power to set these and other rules to open 
the local telephone business to competition.

<HEADLINE> Ali Pushes Boxer Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the recent title fight between Evander  
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis ``the biggest fix in fight history,'' 
Muhammad Ali on Tuesday said he was humiliated that the sport ``had 
sunk to its lowest levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain,  
R-Ariz., Ali said ``it was clear to all who watched that the 
deciding victor of the match was England's Lennox Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heavyweight unification title fight between Holyfield and  
Lewis on March 13 in New York ended in a draw, sparking 
investigations by a New York City grand jury, a New York state 
Senate committee, the New York State Athletic Commission and the 
Nevada Gaming Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a boxing fan, introduced a bill earlier this year which  
would restrict coercive option contracts by which promoters control 
a boxers' career, such as contracts forcing a boxer into a 
long-term deal in exchange for a shot at a world title. McCain 
named the bill for Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the former three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the  
world, I believe I have the credibility to say Lennox Lewis won 
this bout without question and should have been named the clear and 
decided victor,'' Ali wrote. ``What occurred once the 12-round 
event concluded will surely go down in the boxing annals as the 
biggest fix in fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Ali added his support to McCain's bill, which is  
aimed at protecting boxers from exploitation and requiring more 
openness from promoters about their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require promoters and organizers of major boxing events  
to disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of a boxer's 
purse. Identical legislation passed the Senate last October by 
voice vote, but the House did not take up the measure before the 
session ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has taken on added importance, Ali said, in  
light of the disputed draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professional boxers have for too long been the target of  
unscrupulous managers and promoters,'' Ali wrote. ``As witnessed 
(March 13), the three sanctioning organizations that award the 
title belts have joined the list of abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray justice will be done and somehow along the way, honor  
can be restored to this sport,'' Ali added.

<HEADLINE> Bliss Leaving New Mexico for Baylor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Dave Bliss, who took New Mexico to  
seven NCAA tournaments in nine years but failed to satisfy the 
expectations of many Lobos fans, was hired Tuesday as basketball 
coach at Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico athletic director Rudy Davalos said a combination of  
the money Baylor offered -- a reported $600,000 a year -- and Bliss' 
frustration with the criticism he received from fans this season 
convinced him to end his 11-year tenure in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talked about their financial offer,'' Davalos said. ``It's  
a pretty good chunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico went 25-9 this season and lost in the second round of  
the NCAA tournament to Final Four member Connecticut. The last four 
seasons have been the most successful in Lobos history with 102 
victories and four first-round victories in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lobos' failure to advance further than the second round made  
Bliss a frequent target of the fans' and local media's wrath. This 
season, the criticism also focused on New Mexico's schedule, rated 
one of the weakest in the country. One state legislator called it 
``pathetic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you stay at a job long enough, you develop a core of  
supporters and you develop people that are critics,'' Davalos said. 
``A lot of times coaches tend to hear the critics more than the 
masses. I think that, along with a lucrative contract, was the 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to move on and we've got to move on,'' Davalos said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bliss informed Davalos of his decision Tuesday morning. During a  
news conference later Tuesday in Waco, Texas, Bliss said the 
decision to leave UNM was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not from what we were coming to, but what we were leaving,''  
Bliss said. ``We had been at New Mexico for 11 years. We really 
enjoyed the 11 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bliss also expressed elation at the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had this unbelievable respect for Baylor. We are  
all Christians and we look at the mission statement that this 
university has,'' he said. ``It speaks to what the Baylor family is 
all about. This is what I saw as I looked down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico will conduct a national search for Bliss'  
replacement, and Davalos said he expected to have a new coach 
within two weeks 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to move very quickly on this. It's been a national  
topic and everyone knows about it. We consider it a national 
posting already,'' Davalos said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his initial list contained six candidates, but he  
expected to talk with other potential applicants while he was at 
the Final Four at St. Petersburg, Fla., this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss' decision to leave drew mixed reaction from Lobos players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed in the whole thing,'' sophomore guard Kevin  
Henry said. ``I love playing for coach Bliss. That's one of the 
reasons I chose to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry wouldn't rule out the possibility of transferring to  
another school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life goes on. He has to do what's best for him and his family  
I guess,'' Henry said. ``I have to weigh my options. Take a look at 
some different things. I have to do what's best for me. I 
definitely have a decision to make and I'm going to try to make the 
best one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neither good nor bad to me,'' said junior Damion Walker,  
who was suspended by Bliss for two games late in the regular 
season. ``I'm just looking forward to moving on. I'm happy with 
whoever comes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever is brought in probably will receive a salary comparable  
to Bliss' pay, Davalos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bliss earned $140,000 this season. His total financial package  
including basketball camps, shoe and radio and television 
contracts, was estimated at more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	His salary at Baylor would nearly double, to $600,000 a year,  
according to a report Tuesday on ESPN.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible candidates mentioned for the New Mexico job: former St.  
John's coach Fran Fraschilla, Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson, former 
New Mexico assistant and current Arizona State assistant Tony 
Benford, Rice coach Willis Wilson and Gonzaga coach Dan Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bliss, New Mexico also has been ranked in the Top 25 for  
54 consecutive weeks dating back to the end of the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Lobos' winningest coach, finishing 246-108 at the  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	At the NCAA tournament West Regional in Denver two weeks ago,  
Bliss indicated during a news conference prior to the Lobos' loss 
to Connecticut that he had tired of the criticism 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing we have to coach against in Albuquerque is  
the community,'' Bliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Baylor, Bliss takes over a program that is finishing a  
five-year NCAA probation for recruiting violations and has been the 
weakling in the Big 12 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	This season Baylor finished 6-24 overall and 0-16 in the Big 12,  
leading to coach Harry Miller's resignation. Baylor put itself on 
probation in 1994 after it learned then-coach Darrel Johnson's 
assistants did correspondence course work for four junior college 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before going to New Mexico, Bliss was 142-101 in eight seasons  
at Southern Methodist and 77-62 in five years at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Bliss at Baylor will be Doug Ash, his assistant of 24  
years.

<HEADLINE> Marijuana-Scented Cigarettes Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., seeking  
ways to cash in on the popularity of marijuana in the 1970s, 
developed a cigarette that mimicked the drug's smell, according to 
industry documents. 
</P>
<P>
	A company chemist noted in a June 3, 1974, memo that mixing  
Virginia and Turkish tobaccos, pekoe teas, alfalfa and oregano 
produced ``a foreign taste, liked by some, with a sidestream aroma 
easily mistaken for marijuana.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the aroma of marijuana is easily recognized and  
difficult to cover up, a marketable product of similar aroma should 
have great appeal to marijuana smokers,'' the chemist wrote. 
``Alternate uses might include a curiosity item, research placebo 
or educational tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Mark Smith told the Saint Paul Pioneer Press  
in a story published today that the idea went nowhere. Smith said 
it was ``independent thinking'' by an employee and the kind of 
ill-conceived idea that could show up in the files of any industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proof of whether a company's responsible or not lies in  
the fact that these ideas never went very far,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the company currently has ``absolutely zero interest  
in marijuana'' and that he had no information on what happened to 
the chemist involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo was among confidential industry documents made public  
as a result of the state's $6.6 billion legal settlement with the 
cigarette makers.

	US: No Progress in Yugo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke has  
left Yugoslavia with no agreement on Kosovo, apparently increasing 
the prospects of an imminent NATO attack on Yugoslavia. U.S. 
officials said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had not budged 
despite several hours of discussions. Milosevic has steadfastly 
refused to agree to a U.S.-brokered peace plan that calls for NATO 
troops to be stationed in Yugoslavia. The ethnic Albanians signed 
the agreement earlier this month. More than 2,000 people have died 
and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in a year of fighting 
between the government and rebels seeking independence for ethnic 
Albanians.

	Clinton Warns Yugoslavs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton warned Yugoslavia again  
today, saying NATO is ``united and prepared'' to carry out strikes 
against Serb targets. Clinton earlier tried to win over some 
lawmakers in an effort to stop the Senate from blocking funds for a 
military mission in Yugoslavia. After word that talks between a 
U.S. envoy and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on a peace 
deal for Kosovo collapsed, Clinton gathered key members of Congress 
to ``make the case for the policy he is pursuing,'' a White House 
spokesman said. ``Serbia's mounting aggression must be stopped,'' 
Clinton said. ``We cannot allow President Milosevic to continue the 
aggression with impunity.'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he 
expects Congress to support action in Kosovo.

	Group Denies Former Hostage's Claim  
</P>
<P>
	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The militant Islamic group Hezbollah  
denied today the allegation by former American hostage Terry 
Anderson that it kidnapped him in 1985, saying it was ``an illusory 
claim.'' Anderson, a former AP correspondent, filed yesterday a 
$100 million lawsuit against Iran, alleging that the Islamic 
Republic sponsored the captors, who he said were members of the 
Iranian-inspired, Shiite Muslim Hezbollah. Hezbollah also denied 
being a terrorist organization. Anderson was held in captivity for 
2,454 days.

	Germany, U.S. To Swap Spy Files  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany will finally be able to recover  
potentially explosive East German spy files from the United States 
in exchange for decoded tapes detailing years of Cold War 
espionage. German authorities believe that the files will identify 
up to 1,000 previously unknown agents for the East German state 
security service, or Stasi, including Cold War helpers from 
then-West Germany. The files disappeared from Germany shortly after 
the Berlin Wall came down in 1989. The United States has never 
formally acknowledged having the files.

	Japan Fires at Unidentified Vessels  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese destroyers today fired warning shots near  
two unidentified ships that intruded into Japanese waters and then 
fled north into the Sea of Japan. The decision to send military 
ships to stop the boats -- the first such action since World War II 
for Japan -- followed more than 12 hours of pursuit by the civilian 
Maritime Safety Agency. It was the first incident involving live 
ammunition since 1953, when Japanese patrol boats fired warning 
shots at a suspected Soviet spy ship.

already served 18 months in prison for refusing to answer questions

	Regulators Study Holyfield Betting  
</P>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Gambling regulators are looking into a flurry  
of late betting on Evander Holyfield that sent odds soaring just 
before he stepped into the ring with Lennox Lewis. A million 
dollars or more may have been bet on Holyfield in the hours before 
the controversial draw March 13 at Madison Square Garden. The bets 
not only changed the fight odds, but drew the attention of the 
Nevada Gaming Control Board because of the way they were placed. 
Almost all of the money ended up being refunded to bettors when the 
fight was ruled a draw, even though Holyfield appeared to have 
lost.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar weakened against most major  
currencies Tuesday as U.S. stocks tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.00  
Japanese yen, down from 118.11. The euro was quoted at $1.0911, up 
from $1.0908. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell during Asian trading until it was boosted by the  
decline of Tokyo's main stock index, which dropped 2.2 percent from 
Friday, its last session before Monday's national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency also gained support from comments by Japanese  
officials who said they didn't want to see a strong yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisuke Sakakibara, the vice finance minister for international  
affairs, said Japan not only felt that ``an excessively strong yen 
isn't desirable'' but that the country ``will take decisive action 
against an excessively strong yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was making gains until the Dow Jones industrial  
average started falling from the opening bell at the New York Stock 
Exchange. The Dow ended the day more than 200 points lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar weakened against the yen (and other currencies) in  
a way that was coincident with the weakening of U.S. equities,'' 
said Jim Collins, a financial futures analyst in the Chicago office 
of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4585 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4631, and 1.5086 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5035. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6377, up from $1.6287. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7926 German 
marks, down from 1.7931; 6.0119 French francs, down from 6.0132; 
and 1,774.60 Italian lire, down from 1,776.20.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Seethes at Tiger's Temper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	 *``Golf is usually played with the outward appearance of great  
dignity. It is, nevertheless, a game of considerable passion --	
either the explosive type, or that which burns inwardly and sears	
the soul.'' -- Bobby Jones	
</P>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods is the explosive  
type. 
</P>
<P>
	Watch an important putt slide by the hole, and it won't be long  
before he slams his putter into the side of the bag. Read his lips 
after an approach strays off line. See the scowl when he walks from 
green to tee. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Match Play Championship, Woods swung from the heels on  
the 17th tee, needing a long, straight drive to keep alive of any 
hope of winning his quarterfinals match against Jeff Maggert. When 
the ball hooked into the rough, he tomahawked his driver into the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the kind of behavior that Arnold Palmer wants to stop.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that frown all the time, and that slamming the club  
down doesn't do anything for his game and the game,'' Palmer said 
on the eve of his Bay Hill Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the world in his hands. All he has to do is enjoy it  
and laugh, and enjoy the ability that he has to fullest extent. 
He's not convincing anybody of anything when he slams a club down. 
They know he's good. He's proven that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Palmer proved with his sharp criticism is that Woods  
operates under different standards than anyone else on the PGA 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Calcavecchia threw his putter into the pond in the Honda  
Classic and hardly anyone noticed. Scott Hoch broke his 3-wood in 
the Tour Championship and no one cared. Craig Stadler flings his 
club at any tournament and everyone laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week in the Bay Hill Invitational, just two days after  
Palmer's remarks about Woods' behavior, Davis Love III caught a 
plugged lie in the 17th bunker. After blasting out 45 feet past the 
hole, Love climbed out of the bunker and smacked a sprinkler head 
with his sand wedge, shattering the valve and causing water to gush 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Love found a note in his locker from Palmer, the  
tournament host and course owner. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a mock bill -- $3.50 for parts, $175,000 for labor.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a little different story if I would have  
done it,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one draws the size of galleries as Woods. No one gets as much  
television time. No one gets the amount of attention when they win 
or the same scrutiny when they don't. Woods was reminded of that 
when he sacked Fluff Cowan last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els fired longtime caddie  
Ricci Roberts and it barely got a paragraph. Woods fired Cowan and 
went through two weeks of Caddygate. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I do is news,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it works both ways.  
</P>
<P>
	So Woods might have caught more grief had he broken the  
sprinkler head. How many more headlines would he have captured had 
he, and not David Duval, shot a 59 on Sunday to win a tournament? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of transcending the game, of being an icon,''  
Duval said. ``He's always going to be under a lot more scrutiny, 
just like Michael Jordan was. At the same time, he's compensated 
for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer says he talked to Woods about his responsibility when  
Woods turned pro at age 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't have his hearing aid on,'' Palmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago at the PGA Tour awards ceremony, Palmer put his hand  
on Woods' shoulder and issued another warning about the trappings 
of success, the responsibility of being in the spotlight. Maybe 
that's why Palmer shook his finger at Woods and turned his head 
when it came to Love. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Jack (Nicklaus) was considered, when he first  
started, as a whiner and a crybaby because he was beating the crap 
out of everybody. So, anything he did, they picked on,'' Love said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy at the top ... Tiger is going to get criticized for  
things he does more than somebody else. From that respect, I 
understand where he's coming from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods understands it, too.  
</P>
<P>
	He says his tantrums have decreased, if only because he has  
become increasingly aware of a microphone not far from his every 
move on the course, cameras that still stay on him until they get a 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's interesting how people say golf needs more emotion,''  
Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then we start expressing emotion on the golf course and we're  
crucified for doing it, because it's not the right kind of emotion. 
You can't have the good without the bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Woods, there is always a lot of both.

<HEADLINE> Widow Can't Testify for Kevorkian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today watched a videotape of Dr.  
Jack Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas Youk, the man 
with Lou Gehrig's disease he is accused of murdering. Kevorkian 
then failed in his impassioned effort to introduce testimony from 
Youk's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial in the 52-year-old man's September 1998 death, which  
was taped and seen by millions on ``60 Minutes,'' seemed to be 
racing toward a swift conclusion today as the prosecution rested 
its case after calling just three witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's defense effort, acting as his own lawyer, hit a snag  
when Judge Jessica Cooper ruled the jury could not hear from Youk's 
wife, Melody. The judge said Kevorkian was incorrectly trying to 
get arguments about law rather than presentation of fact before the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution essentially argued that since mercy killing is  
not a defense allowed in the murder statute, presenting material to 
the jury about Youk's suffering would be irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper repeatedly urged Kevorkian to let his lawyers represent  
him. Kevorkian repeatedly declined, and the judge turned aside his 
request to call the widow. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then told the judge that he wanted to call Youk's  
brother, who was out of town. The prosecution objected, and the 
judge sent the jury home for the day so the two sides could argue 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Cooper, in trying to understand Kevorkian's  
argument, said: ``What you're talking about is mercy killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Kevorkian: ``You may say it's mercy killing but I call  
it something else. ... What difference does it make what you call 
it? It's a medical service for an agonized human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he couldn't give such service, he said, ``That's worse than  
taking my life. Why do you think I don't fear prison? If you made 
me abjure my responsibility as a physician, that would be worse 
than killing me, so I don't fear anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance. By his own count, he has taken part in more 
than 130 suicides since 1990. He has been tried four times on 
assisted suicide charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day today, jurors watched the tape that was seen,  
in edited form, on the CBS program. It started with Kevorkian 
interviewing Youk about his illness, which forced him to use a 
feeding tube and was progressively depriving him of control of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	On camera, Kevorkian asks Youk if he wants to go ahead and end  
his life. Youk indicates he does, and Kevorkian hands him a pen to 
sign a consent form. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait a week and see how you feel in a week. Is that all  
right with you, Tom?'' Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape resumes later.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian then begins preparing an intravenous line for Youk.  
</P>
<P>
	``Are you sure you want to go ahead now?'' Kevorkian asks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to inject. We're going to inject in your right  
arm,'' Kevorkian says. A hand is shown injecting drugs into Youk's 
intravenous line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a straight line. ... His heart is stopped,''  
Kevorkian says. 
</P>
<P>
	After that videotape, jurors were shown a tape of the ``60  
Minutes'' broadcast itself in which Mike Wallace interviewed 
Kevorkian, who said he would starve himself to death in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland County medical examiner, Dr. L.J. Dragovic, then  
took the stand and testified that Youk's body showed signs of 
muscular wasting, as from an illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic said an injection of potassium chloride -- which  
Kevorkian said he gave Youk -- would stop the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	During his cross-examination, Kevorkian pressed Dragovic on  
whether Lou Gehrig's disease contributed to Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic insisted there was no link. ``It had absolutely no  
contribution to Mr. Youk's death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragovic has called Kevorkian a ``crazy man,'' and said in  
November that he welcomed the murder charge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial began Monday with selection of a jury of 12 members  
and two alternates, followed by opening arguments. Kevorkian gave 
the defense statement himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise a human being dying at my hands. But my intent isn't  
to kill a person. I am forced by my position as a physician to do 
this,'' Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury was not present to hear most of Kevorkian's  
argument. Less than three minutes into his statement, Oakland 
County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski objected, contending 
that Kevorkian was arguing law, rather than summarizing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper agreed, saying Kevorkian needed to argue the facts, not  
the law.

<HEADLINE> NHL Trades Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings  
made certain they will have no shortage of leadership when they 
added 59 years of experience to their roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, barely over .500 at 34-30-6, made a flurry of  
deals prior to the 3 p.m. trade deadline. They added defenseman 
Chris Chelios and Ulf Samuelsson, wing Wendel Clark, and backup 
goaltender Bill Ranford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks will receive defenseman Anders Eriksson and  
first-round draft picks in 1999 and 2001 for Chelios, who has eight 
goals and 26 assists in 65 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He is a key addition to the Red Wings' depleted defensive corps,  
which may be without Uwe Krupp and Todd Gill for the rest of the 
season due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a quality two-way defenseman who will add toughness,  
the 37-year-old Chelios has won three Norris Trophy awards as the 
league's top defenseman in a 16-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit also traded backup goaltender Kevin Hodson and two draft  
picks to Tampa Bay for Clark and Ranford and dealt two picks to the 
New York Rangers for the injured Samuelsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Clark, in his 14th season, was the Lightning's  
leading scorer with 28 goals and 14 assists in 65 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford appeared in 32 games and compiled a 3-18-3 record in his  
14th NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodson, 27, is 0-2-0 in four games with Detroit this season, his  
fourth in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings acquired Samuelsson, who is out 2-3 weeks with a  
broken foot, for a 1999 second-round pick and a third-round 
selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelsson has four goals and has eight assists in 67 games in  
his third season with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit wasn't the only team making multiple moves. Last year's  
Stanley Cup finalist, the Washington Capitals, now in 12th place in 
the Eastern Conference, unloaded three veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime captain Dale Hunter was sent to the Colorado Avalanche,  
wing Joe Juneau was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres and wing Craig 
Berube to the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche gave Washington a 1999 second-round draft pick in  
exchange for Hunter and a third-round selection in 2000. Juneau, 
who has 14 goals and 27 assists this season, was dealt with a 1999 
third-round pick to the Sabres for minor league defenseman Alexei 
Tezikov and future considerations. Berube will join the Flyers in 
exchange for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really tough, really emotional, after what we  
accomplished last year,'' Capitals general manager George McPhee 
said. ``Pulling these guys out of the mix wasn't easy, but they're 
all unrestricted free agents and we weren't going to get anything 
for them this summer if they signed elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other deals, Philadelphia added one of the top offensive  
defenseman in the league by securing Steve Duchesne from Los 
Angeles for defensman Dave Babych and fifth-round draft pick in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne had four goals and 19 assists in 60 games.  
</P>
<P>
	San Jose obtained center Vincent Damphousse from the Montreal  
Canadiens for a 1999 fifth-round draft pick and a 2000 second-round 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse has 12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks also got wing Greg Pankewiecz from the Calgary Flames  
for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edmonton Oilers picked up defenseman Jason Smith from the  
Toronto Maple Leafs for a 1999 fourth-round and a 2000 second-round 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 25, has two goals, 11 assists and 40 penalty minutes in  
60 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Blues re-acquired wing Blair Atcheynum for a  
sixth-round Entry Draft pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto obtained center Yanic Perreault from the Los Angeles  
Kings for minor-league forward Jason Podollan and a '99 third-round 
draft pick.

<HEADLINE> It's Not End of World for Lady Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pat Summitt's message was simple: Losing isn't the end of the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a game, and winning and losing both can be great ways to  
teach kids how to get ready for the real world,'' Summitt said 
Tuesday following the Lady Vols' loss to Duke in the NCAA East 
Regional championship the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-63 loss to Duke ended the Lady Vols' run at an  
unprecedented fourth straight NCAA championship and also ended the 
college careers of seniors Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing isn't something the Tennessee Lady Vols are used to,  
especially the past four seasons with Holdsclaw and Jolly. In that 
span, Tennessee is 131-17 and 21-1 in the NCAA tournament with 
three national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, since the ninth grade, Holdsclaw never has won anything  
but a championship at the end of the year. She won four straight 
New York State titles with Christ the King High School in New York 
City before entering Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Duke, Holdsclaw and the Lady Vols struggled. She tied  
her season low with eight points and was just 2-of-18 from the 
field. She cried on Summitt's shoulder after fouling out with 25.4 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	When they talked Tuesday, Summitt reminded Holdsclaw of what she  
accomplished at Tennessee -- three national championships, three 
Southeastern Conference regular-season titles, three SEC tournament 
titles and three times a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw also leaves as the NCAA tournament's leading scorer  
and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has been the dominant team in the 1990s, making five  
trips to the Final Four and winning four national championships. 
The Lady Vols' only Final Four loss in the 1990s came in the 1995 
title game to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep things in perspective. As much as you would  
love to see them go out with a championship or with a Final Four 
experience, you have to remind yourself, and in this case them, of 
what a wonderful three, four years it's been,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Championships three out of four years ... is not bad.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was favored to add a fourth championship and break a  
tie with Immaculata (1972-1974) and Delta State (1975-1977), the 
only other three-peat national champions. The Lady Vols returned 
all five starters and added two solid freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt lost one starter before the season began. Center  
LaShonda Stephens was forced to quit due to a degenerative knee 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup center Teresa Geter had arthroscopic surgery on her right  
knee in December and hyperextended it in January, limiting her play 
the rest of the season. That pushed freshman Michelle Snow into the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	And defensive specialist Kyra Elzy missed most of the season  
with continuing knee problems after tearing her ACL in mid-February 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee ran into more trouble in the NCAA tournament. Semeka  
Randall tore two ligaments in her left ankle, forcing her to miss 
the second round game and limiting her play in the next two. 
</P>
<P>
	When it counted, the Lady Vols looked lost at times against  
Duke. They simply didn't play the suffocating defense that helped 
them rout opponents by an average of 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The encouraging sign for Summitt was how much her Lady Vols were  
hurting in the locker room and when she talked with them Tuesday. 
She already is figuring out how to use the loss as motivation for 
next season for a group of sophomores that are 70-3 since arriving 
at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not planning on going away,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> IRS Limits Use of 'Threat' Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The IRS is cutting back on the use of a new  
letter criticized as too intimidating to taxpayers facing audits. 
The agency has to fix its heavy-handed wording. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after its inception, the Internal Revenue Service  
announced Tuesday it will stop sending letters to all audited 
taxpayers warning that their employers, neighbors and even banks 
could be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next week, the letters will be mailed only in  
situations where the IRS has tried and failed to get the needed 
audit information from the taxpayer, said IRS Commissioner Charles 
Rossotti. A rewrite is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these letters have gone out too early and needlessly  
alarmed taxpayers in cases where the IRS had no need to contact 
outside parties,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters, in use since mid-January, were intended by Congress  
in the new IRS reform law to be a ``fair warning'' to taxpayers 
that the agency was preparing to use these powers. But lawmakers 
and tax professionals say the agency stumbled by choosing such 
intimidating wording and sending the letters at the beginning of an 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned fair warning into a threat,'' said David Lifson,  
tax committee chairman of the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants. ``If the IRS is going to contact your friends 
and neighbors, that's a pretty serious step. It should only be 
undertaken in the most extreme circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti said the new policy on the letter more accurately  
reflects a long-standing IRS practice of resorting to outside 
contacts only if all else fails. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to send these letters when we can work  
directly with the taxpayer in most cases,'' Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is still working on a new version of the letter that  
Rossotti said will be ``clearer, better-written'' than the current 
one. Several tax professional organizations, including AICPA, are 
involved in improving the wording. 
</P>
<P>
	The current letter says that during an audit, the IRS ``may need  
to contact third parties. Third party contacts may include, but are 
not limited to, neighbors, employers, employees and banks. We may 
use these contacts to help us determine your correct tax liability, 
identify your assets, or locate your current address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Tuesday to IRS, Lifson submitted a draft replacement  
explaining more carefully that the taxpayer will be notified in 
advance if any outside party is to be contacted and that a list of 
who has been contacted can be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	``If taxpayer rights are to be protected, and if taxpayers are  
to perceive the IRS as protecting those rights, the IRS should 
avoid even the appearance of engaging in secretive activities in 
noncriminal cases,'' Lifson wrote to IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	One vocal congressional critic of the IRS, Sen. Christopher  
Bond, R-Mo., said the rewritten letter should help taxpayers 
``minimize the damage to personal and business relationships'' if 
such contacts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We mustn't lose sight of the real reform at the heart of this  
matter,'' Bond said. ``The notice is supposed to serve taxpayers, 
not frighten them.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Study Holyfield Betting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Gambling regulators are looking into a flurry  
of late betting on Evander Holyfield that sent odds soaring just 
before he stepped into the ring with Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	A million dollars or more may have been bet on Holyfield in the  
hours before the March 13 fight at Madison Square Garden. The bets 
not only changed the fight odds, but drew the attention of the 
Nevada Gaming Control Board because of the way they were placed. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all of the money ended up being refunded to bettors when  
the fight was ruled a draw, even though Holyfield appeared to have 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe by gambling regulators comes on top of investigations  
by a Manhattan grand jury, a state Senate committee and the New 
York State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada investigators are primarily concerned with whether the  
money was bet on behalf of one individual or group by so-called 
``messenger'' bettors, which is against Nevada law. But a source 
close to the probe told The Associated Press that the agency was 
also working with out-of-state agencies investigating the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at any betting patterns we can find,'' said  
Keith Copher, chief of enforcement for the agency that regulates 
Nevada casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $1 million might have been bet just before the fight  
in Las Vegas sports books and those run out of the Caribbean, 
causing the odds favoring Holyfield to jump. 
</P>
<P>
	One longtime Las Vegas bettor said the betting pattern was so  
unusual that he suspected the money was bet with inside knowledge 
of what the outcome might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a real scam, except it didn't work,'' said Lem  
Banker, one of a very few sports bettors who has made a living over 
the years wagering on sporting events and is well respected in the 
industry. ``There was a lot of what I call `unnatural money' 
wagered on Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield was a slight favorite in the week before the fight,  
but the bout was nearly a pick 'em by Saturday, said Pete Korner of 
Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which sets the odds for most Las 
Vegas sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	Then just before the fight began close to midnight EST, a rush  
of money pushed odds to as much as 8-5 and 9-5 on Holyfield, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously somebody or some group was playing Holyfield very  
late,'' Korner said. ``They did their homework well waiting for the 
price to come down before they bet it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Lupo, sports book director at the Stardust hotel, said the  
late Holyfield money caused the line to move from minus 130 to 
minus 160 (8-5) just before the fight. But Lupo said he believes 
the bets were not out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see any unusual betting,'' Lupo said. ``It was all  
small money, no real large wagers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mirage, which has one of the largest casino sports books,  
had no comment, according to spokeswoman Jenn Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, investigators want to know whether the money  
was bet by ``messenger'' bettors who fanned out to various casinos 
to make bets at the direction of one bettor. 
</P>
<P>
	Messenger betting is done primarily by big bettors to get bets  
down at various casinos without the odds being raised too quickly 
and to avoid the identification forms that must be filled out for 
any bet of $10,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King says Holyfield and Lewis have agreed to fight  
again, although television and promotional arrangements must be 
worked out before a rematch can happen. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, Holyfield told the BBC today he would like the  
rematch in Las Vegas. He also said that after watching a tape of 
the fight he still didn't think he lost and some of the rounds 
given to Lewis were ``questionable''. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is Lennox fought a smart fight and a good fight,''  
Holyfield said. ``But we both didn't do enough to be called 
undisputed champion.''

<HEADLINE> Primakov Postpones Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's abrupt  
cancellation of a visit to Washington is a new step back for the 
once-warm relations between the United States and post-Soviet 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the cancellation -- an angry reaction to NATO's plan  
to bomb Yugoslavia -- there is little Russia can do about the West's 
plans. Russia lacks the military or economic might to impose its 
views and it is desperate for Western financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been arguing for months against the use of force by  
NATO to solve the Kosovo crisis. A close ally of Yugoslavia, Russia 
wants to maintain its traditional influence in the Balkans and show 
it can stand up to the West, especially NATO, which it sees as a 
threat to its own security. 
</P>
<P>
	For similar reasons, Moscow bitterly denounced U.S. and British  
airstrikes against Iraq late last year, briefly recalling its 
ambassadors from Washington and London. It even briefly put some of 
its forces on alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's protests were mainly bluster and Moscow quietly moved  
to patch up the quarrel within a few days. The protests this time 
may be longer and more heated. The issue is likely to unite 
President Boris Yeltsin and his usual opponents, the Communists and 
nationalists who dominate the Russian parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Tuesday that Russia  
would step up its combat readiness if NATO attacked Yugoslavia, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. But the Russian military, short of 
everything from weapons to food, is close to collapse. After years 
of decline, Russia's economy is in tatters, unable to sustain any 
kind of meaningful military operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The air force, once one of the most powerful in the world, now  
has few planes and would not pose any major threat to NATO even if 
Moscow wanted to intervene. Russian pilots only fly for a few hours 
each year, far below the level necessary to maintain the most basic 
flying skills and many of their planes are old and dilapidated. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has no bases near Yugoslavia and no way to project its  
limited power in the region. The Russian navy is in even worse 
shape, with just a handful of warships capable of taking to the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional insult to Russia is that three former Soviet  
satellites -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- are now 
part of NATO's powerful military system. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia desperately needs Western aid.  
</P>
<P>
	Primakov had been flying to the United States to plead for more  
Western loans, his government's last hope of handling the financial 
crisis that devastated the Russian economy last August. Russia is 
seeking at least $4 billion in new loans from the International 
Monetary Fund, where the United States has strong influence. Moscow 
knows it must maintain stable ties with the United States and other 
Western nations to have any hope of solving its enormous economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is little danger of reviving the Cold War rivalry  
that dominated the world for more than 45 years, the diplomatic 
honeymoon that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 is 
crumbling.

<HEADLINE> Missing Sightseer's Body Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- One of the last photographs of  
Carole Sund shows her laughing during a trip to Yosemite National 
Park with her daughter and a close family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an image her grieving family is thankful to have.  
</P>
<P>
	The photograph was released Monday as authorities identified  
Mrs. Sund's remains, found last week in the charred hulk of the 
rental car the three women were using when they vanished during 
last month's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another body found in the trunk of the car has not been  
identified. Mrs. Sund, 42, was traveling with her daughter Julie, 
15, and Silvina Pelosso, 16, a friend from Argentina, when they 
vanished Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI used dental records to identify Mrs. Sund's body and may  
use DNA tests to identify the other victim. Agents said an autopsy 
had been performed but did not disclose Mrs. Sund's cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said agents are pursuing leads to find the third person,  
but refused to elaborate and also did not say where the film was 
found. Only seven photographs were released at the family's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the photographs) mean a lot, because they're the last  
ones we'll ever have. We're very grateful for them,'' said Carole 
Carrington, Mrs. Sund's mother. ``They also mean that they were 
having a wonderful time and we're glad about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The photos of the women, believed to have been taken Feb. 14 or  
15, show them in joyful poses -- Julie and Silvina smiling in front 
of a Yosemite waterfall, Mrs. Sund and Silvina laughing near the 
Merced River. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance five weeks ago prompted a massive search in  
mining country just outside Yosemite. The FBI found the burned out 
car Friday in a forest, about three hours north of the Cedar Lodge 
in El Portal, the spot near Yosemite where the women had been 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was moved over the weekend to a hangar at nearby  
Columbia Airport, where arson experts from the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms looked for tell-tale chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arson is often used to cover up or conceal evidence of other  
crimes such as murder. However, there is potential to obtain 
incriminating evidence even after a fire,'' said B.J. Zapor, a 
spokesman for the ATF. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis and Carole Carrington spoke briefly after their daughter  
was identified, dry-eyed but clearly stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst nightmare that could ever happen,''  
Carrington said. ``Why people would do this to three good people -- 
I just can't imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund's husband and Julie's father, Jens Sund, was in  
seclusion at the family home in Eureka with the couple's three 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
	On CNN's ``Larry King Live'' on Monday night, Silvina's mother,  
Raquel Pelosso, said she feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there's no chance they can find my daughter alive,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Wins Ratings Week With Oscar / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The success of NBC's ``Providence'' gave TV  
networks hope that viewers were receptive to midseason replacement 
series. Last week's results prove there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC won the ratings race on the strength of the Oscars, but it  
ditched the mystery series ``Strange World'' after it finished a 
disastrous 91st place in last week's Nielsen Media Research 
rankings. It will be replaced by ``NYPD Blue'' reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS pulled ``The Magnificent Seven'' last week following a poor  
run. And NBC yanked ``Lateline'' after it finished tied for 82nd 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two positive signs from last week: CBS's ``Payne'' finished a  
strong 12th during its premiere last week, and ``Rescue 77'' proved 
to be the WB's third most popular show for the week in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	More high-profile premieres are on the way. Two new ABC  
comedies, ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,'' take to 
the air tonight. Fox debuts ``Futurama,'' an animated series by the 
creator of ``The Simpsons,'' on Sunday night.

	Bombing Imminent on Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The NATO secretary-general has  
ordered airstrikes against Yugoslavia, President Clinton asked for 
and received Congressional support on military action and it 
appears the bombing could begin at anytime. Despite poor weather 
conditions, half a dozen U.S. Navy ships are ready to launch cruise 
missiles. Earlier today, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke declared 
peace talks with Yugoslavia's president on Kosovo a failure, and 
Yugolav officials declared a state of emergency -- one step below a 
state of war.

	Senate Votes To Support Strikes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate gave its blessings tonight to a  
NATO-ordered air campaign against Yugoslavia that appears to be 
imminent, but the vote to approve was not overwhelming. The Senate 
voted 58 to 41 to back President Clinton's bid for NATO airstrikes, 
with many Republicans expressing misgivings. ``This is a mistake. 
This is a civil war. We're going to regret it,'' said Sen. Bob 
Smith, R-N.H. And Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, declared, ``We're 
coming close to starting World War III.''

	Clinton Holds Ground With Arafat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told Palestinian Leader  
Yasser Arafat today the United States opposes a unilateral 
Palestinian declaration of statehood and said the matter should be 
resolved through negotiations with Israel. Clinton is one of a 
number of world leaders Arafat is consulting as he ponders what to 
do after May 4, the end of the five-year negotiating period 
outlined in Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. The Palestinian 
leader was unusually reticent after his hour-long discussion with 
Clinton, declining to provide details to reporters.

	Pinochet Awaits Extradition Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet will  
learn tomorrow whether his lawyers have successfully fought efforts 
to extradite him to Spain to face charges of human rights abuses. A 
seven-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest 
court, will deliver its ruling after deliberating for seven weeks. 
If the judges decide in Pinochet's favor, his lawyers will 
immediately ask that bail restrictions be lifted so the 83-year-old 
general can return home to Chile. But if the tribunal rules that 
Pinochet is not entitled to immunity from prosecution as a former 
head of state, it will kick off a Spanish extradition battle that 
could last years.

	Japan Fires at Mystery Ships

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese destroyers blasted warning shots into the  
water near two falsely identified ships and chased them through 
Japanese waters Wednesday as they fled toward North Korea. It was 
Japan's first such use of military ships since World War II. A 
government spokesman indicated that the ships had suspicious 
antennas, no visible fishing gear and no national flags, which 
could indicate spy vessels. Although the nationality of the ships 
remained uncertain, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said 
Tokyo will press North Korea to hand them over because Japanese 
radar tracked them entering North Korean waters.

	Volkswagen's Passat Takes Top Spot

	EAST HADDAM, Conn. (AP) -- For the first time in 16 years, the  
Toyota Camry has been beaten for the top spot in the widely watched 
annual ranking of family sedans by Consumer Reports magazine. The 
No. 1 ranking for Volkswagen's Passat, a midsized model, was a sign 
that the German automaker is building on the success of its new 
Beetle model to shake off years of dreary auto sales in the U.S. 
market. ``We think the Passat was just as significant a car as the 
new Beetle for us, because it proves that Volkswagen can compete in 
that midsized family car market,'' VW spokesman Tony Fouladpour

<HEADLINE> Judge Asked To Clarify NCAA Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lawyers for four athletes have asked a  
federal judge to clarify letters the NCAA sent to its Division I 
schools after the judge struck down the association's use of 
minimum test scores to determine freshmen eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers want the NCAA to assure schools they will not be  
penalized if they use freshmen players suddenly made eligible by 
the Proposition 16 ruling -- even if that ruling is later reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the NCAA on Monday asked U.S. District Judge Ronald  
Buckwalter to refrain from ruling on the lawyers' request until a 
federal appeals court rules on the organization's appeal of the 
initial Proposition 16 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 8, Buckwalter declared that the minimum standardized  
test score requirements have ``an unjustified disparate impact 
against African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters the NCAA sent last week to the 302 Division I  
schools offer direction to coaches and athletic directors suddenly 
stripped of a key recruiting guideline, NCAA spokeswoman Jane 
Jankowski said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence includes reference to Article 19.8 of the  
NCAA's 1998-99 Division I rules manual, which states that the 
association could strike statistics or championships from the 
record books if a court ruling like Buckwalter's is vacated, stayed 
or reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does is help give a few general guidelines to member  
institutions and guidelines on the court ruling,'' Ms. Jankowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in court papers filed Friday, lawyers for the four black  
plaintiffs wrote that citing the article is ``tantamount to the 
NCAA advising its members that 'if you honor and heed the Court's 
permanent injunction, you do so at your peril.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers asked Buckwalter to direct the NCAA to inform its  
Division I schools that the article ``has no force or effect on any 
member who recruits, offers athletically-related financial aid or 
allows a student-athlete to compete'' if that student-athlete has 
not attained the minimum test scores that were struck down in the 
judge's ruling last week. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA lawyers have said in court that the immediate elimination  
of Proposition 16 could cause chaos among its member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The article threatens to strike individual and team statistics  
and championships from the record books ``in the interest of 
restitution and fairness to competing institutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals is weighing whether  
give the NCAA more time to develop new freshman eligibility 
guidelines, a delay Buckwalter refused to grant them last week. The 
NCAA also plans to appeal the initial ruling to the appeals court.

<HEADLINE> McNown Ends Friendship With Felon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, told by  
the FBI to stop associating with a convicted felon, says his 
friendship with Dominic Montemarano is over. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown told the Los Angeles Times in Tuesday's editions he  
hasn't talked to Montemarano, a 60-year-old with reputed organized 
crime ties since being questioned by the FBI last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Montemarano was sent to prison in 1987 on federal racketeering  
charges. He was released in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began a sports-betting investigation after the Bruins  
lost to Miami and Wisconsin in their final two games of the season. 
Before that, they were unbeaten, clinched the Pacific-10 Conference 
title and were contending for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI questioned several UCLA football players, but failed to  
uncover any evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, a projected first-round NFL draft pick, told the  
newspaper that FBI agents told him on Feb. 27 to ``stop associating 
with the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went over and said 'Hey, look' -- and before I even said  
more, he said 'You can't see me anymore,''' McNown said. ``He 
didn't want anything bad to happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown said Montemarano was aware that people were talking and  
told the quarterback, ``'I don't want you to get in any trouble. We 
can't talk anymore. That's the way it's got to be.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown said he didn't think his friendship with Montemarano will  
affect his chances in the NFL draft April 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crime Legislation Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of  
killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay 
college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime 
laws that could deter future acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plea was seconded by a relative of James Byrd Jr., the black  
man who was chained to the back of a pickup truck last summer and 
dragged to his death over East Texas roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Shepard and Byrd nephew Daryl Verrett appeared at a  
Washington news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign 
and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, urging Congress and 
state legislatures to enact new statutes against hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes  
from happening. But they can reduce them,'' Mrs. Shepard said 
haltingly, her statement punctuated by sobs. ``They can help change 
the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to 
target specific groups of people and get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, a University of Wyoming freshman, was pistol-whipped,  
lashed to a fence and left for dead last October. He died in a 
hospital five days later. The first of Shepard's two alleged 
attackers, Russell Henderson, goes on trial Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she  
and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Byrd's case, the first of three white men accused in his  
slaying, white supremacist John William King, was sentenced last 
month to death by lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's nephew took issue with Texas Gov. George W. Bush and  
others who question the need for special hate-crime statutes. Bush 
said Monday: ``People, when they commit a crime, have hate in their 
heart. I think it's hard to distinguish between one degree of hate 
or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are  
meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes are done to send a message of terror to persons of  
different color, religious beliefs, sexual orientations, ethnicity, 
nationality or etc.,'' Verrett said. ``The message is if you are in 
any way like this individual, you are hated, you are subhuman, you 
have no right to be on this earth, and if possible, all people like 
you should be exterminated from this earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The savagery of the Shepard and Byrd slayings horrified the  
nation, giving new impetus to consideration of hate-crimes laws in 
Washington and state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures pending in Congress would make federal prosecution of  
hate crimes easier and would expand existing statutes, allowing the 
Justice Department to prosecute crimes that were based on a 
person's sex, sexual orientation or disability. Now, the statute 
only covers crimes based on race, color, religion or national 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws, but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional Republicans have suggested the legislation is  
unnecessary because state laws protect the groups identified in the 
bill. And some social conservatives bridle at what they view as 
special protections for homosexuals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Senate Support in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, seeking to head off a  
Senate effort to block funds for U.S. military action in Kosovo, is 
calling top lawmakers back to the White House to seek greater 
congressional support for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	His efforts to win lawmakers' support at a session last Friday  
had mixed results. He invited the same group of about 30 House and 
Senate leaders back today for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration aides said Clinton hoped to  
find a way to cool what has been a heated Senate debate over the 
prospect of further U.S. military involvement in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton suggested Monday that, barring a breakthrough in a  
last-minute diplomatic offensive by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, 
NATO stands ready to go ahead with airstrikes against Serb 
positions under the control of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serbia's mounting aggression must be stopped,'' Clinton said.  
``There is strong unity among the NATO allies. We all agree that we 
cannot allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with 
impunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Clinton was far from winning such unity from the  
Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was scheduled to take a key procedural vote today on  
legislation by GOP leaders aimed at prohibiting Clinton from using 
U.S. military power in the latest Balkans crisis without first 
getting congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong the way we're approaching this,'' said Senate  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. ``The 
president should not use our military power to carry out 
negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration and its NATO allies have threatened to bomb  
Serbian targets if Milosevic's Serbian side in the Kosovo dispute 
continue to refuse to sign a three-year peace agreement that 
restores self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The other side in the dispute, Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, signed  
the peace agreement last week in Paris. It calls for a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo of 25,000 to 30,000 troops, of which 
up to 4,000 would be Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens, in Senate debate Monday, warned that U.S. forces could  
expect to be in Kosovo ``for 50 years'' if Serbia is bombed into 
accepting a peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav army launched a new offensive in Kosovo over the  
weekend following the failure of the peace talks. More than 2,000 
people have died and hundreds of thousands have been displaced in a 
year of fighting between the government and rebels seeking 
independence for ethnic Albanians, who make up the vast majority in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Serbia is the main republic of  
what remains of Yugoslavia -- and is under the control of Milosovic 
in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders in the Senate need 60 votes today to overcome  
procedural roadblocks erected by Democrats allied with the 
administration. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., conceded that Republicans probably 
didn't have the needed 60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But having the debate, and the vote, remained important because  
it enabled senators to go on record on the issue, Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Czwartcki suggested the debate probably would be suspended if  
airstrikes were launched. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters late Monday he believes 
a majority of senators would support airstrikes -- if it could ever 
come to a straight yes-or-no vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have warned Milosevic countless times to halt his fascist  
aggression,'' Biden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders were working with the administration  
behind the scenes to see if middle ground could be found to keep 
the Senate debate from undermining last-minute diplomatic efforts, 
or the United States' relations with its NATO allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Monday he had consulted with European leaders over  
the weekend by telephone and had also sent a letter to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has opposed airstrikes. Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov was arriving in Washington later today for talks on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: McDougal Feared Prosecution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's  
lawyer says she should tie together the theory of her defense when 
she takes the stand to explain that she refused to answer federal 
grand jury questions about President Clinton because she did not 
believe prosecutors were seeking the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, charged with obstruction of justice and two  
counts of criminal contempt, was expected to testify in her own 
defense today. If convicted, she could be sentenced to a jail term 
to be determined by the judge and fined up to $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office pursued the federal  
grand jury indictment against Mrs. McDougal after she refused to 
answer questions about Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton in September 1996 and again last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal and her late ex-husband, James McDougal, were  
partners with the Clintons in the Whitewater real estate venture in 
northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said Monday the defense  
has shown throughout the trial the ``bits and pieces'' of 
intimidation from Starr's office. He said that when his client gets 
on the stand, ``Susan is going to tie it up all together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In court, Geragos won a skirmish over whether the judge would  
allow defense witness Steve Smith to say whether he believed 
Starr's prosecutors were seeking the truth in using him in their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who pleaded guilty in 1995 to a conspiracy charge in the  
Whitewater investigation in exchange for his testimony, was allowed 
to answer the question after the prosecution grilled him about his 
knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith told the jurors, ``I think they were seeking truthful  
information that would conform with their theory of the case. They 
sort of had a story line about what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A communications professor at the University of Arkansas at  
Fayetteville, Smith said Starr's deputies would listen if he had 
some information that conformed with their thinking but they 
weren't interested if his information didn't fit their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Associate Independent Counsel Mark Barrett said the government  
may call former Associate Independent Counsel Amy St. Eve to rebut 
testimony from Smith that St. Eve handed him a ``script'' to read 
to grand jurors. Smith said portions of the statement were 
inaccurate and that he feared a perjury charge if he read it as is. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith testified that he read the statement after he and St. Eve  
made changes to it. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, defense witness Richard Holiman said he  
believed that calling Bill and David Henley, Mrs. McDougal's 
brothers, before the grand jury was a way to pressure Mrs. McDougal 
into testifying after her May 1996 Whitewater fraud conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Holiman, who represented David Henley, said his client had no  
new information after appearing before the panel once before. He 
said that giving the Henleys subpoenas was meant to send a message 
to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Associate Independent Counsel Julie Myers said in  
questioning Holiman that David Henley had only been asked about one 
topic in his first visit with the panel.

<HEADLINE> Bill Extends Crop Insurance Sign-Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers who applied for crop insurance through  
an Iowa company only to find out later that their request had been 
denied will get a 14-day extension to buy new insurance under a 
bill that passed Tuesday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which was recommended by the Agriculture  
Department, is expected to get easy approval in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are not sure the exact number of farmers affected but  
they are likely to be in the thousands -- including scores of rice 
farmers in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, American Agrisurance of Council Bluffs, Iowa, had  
offered coverage to farmers, including an offer to rice farmers for 
the first time, only to be overwhelmed by the response, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the financial stress on farmers and government  
assistance to help farmers increase coverage, ``Sales of that 
particular product exploded,'' said spokesman John Scherle. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three years it has offered the insurance, the company  
sold about $1.5 million worth of premiums, Scherle said. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, applications that were expected to increase three  
to five times, saw a 30- to 40-fold increase, Scherle said. 
</P>
<P>
	A problem arose because by the time the company decided it could  
take no new applications, the deadline had ended for farmers to get 
coverage elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill essentially gives farmers affected until April 12 to  
buy new crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting farmers in this kind of predicament is unacceptable  
and this bill fixes the problem,'' said House Agriculture Chairman 
Larry Combest, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1212.

excused Ripken Jr. from their exhibition game against the Montreal 
Expos in Jupiter, Fla. so he could be at his father's side in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ripken family asks that the media respect their privacy at  
this difficult time,'' the Orioles said in a statement. ``The 
thoughts and prayers of the Orioles organization are with the 
Ripken family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. enjoyed a 36-year-old association with the Orioles  
and had the pleasure of managing his son. The elder Ripken signed 
with Baltimore 1957 as a catcher but soon turned to managing, 
spending 14 years in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	His teams finished first or second on seven occasions, and he  
joined the Orioles' coaching staff in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired as manager in 1987, taking over a last-place team.  
He was fired in 1988 after an 0-6 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was a no-nonsense leader who had little tolerance for  
flashy players. He won 964 games as a manager at the minor-league 
level and was 68-101 as manager of the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was the first man in the majors ever to manage two of his  
sons, Cal Jr. and Bill, who was the Orioles' second baseman at the 
time. The three Ripkens appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, Ripken Sr. replaced his son late in a game, ending  
Cal Jr.'s streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was rehired as Orioles third base coach in 1989, but  
was fired after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Until he became ill, Ripken Sr. ran the Cal Ripken Baseball  
School, a summer camp for children, at Mount St. Mary's College in 
Emmitsburg, Md.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Video May Speed Rescues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURNAGAIN PASS, Alaska (AP) -- Even on grainy videotape, it's a  
terrifying sight: Giant slabs of snow breaking loose from an 
Alaskan ridge, swallowing fleeing snowmobilers in a 30-foot wave of 
powder. 
</P>
<P>
	The minute-long video, shot by a man standing a mile away from  
Sunday's avalanche, shows snow sliding down a 2,000-foot mountain 
high in Turnagain Pass. The snowmobilers vanish in a smoky white 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Four bodies have been found. As many as six people were still  
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 volunteers aided by search dogs were expected to resume  
searching today, using 10-foot poles to probe the snow and walking 
shoulder-to-shoulder in a methodical grid pattern, State Trooper 
1st Sgt. Paul Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no tried-and-true way of doing this,'' he said. ``The  
reality is we may not find anybody until spring. That's not a good 
way to do it, but that's where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two slides 20 minutes apart roared down several miles of the  
mountain near Turnagain Pass, a popular recreation area in the 
Chugach National Forest about 55 miles southeast of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	The first slide filled a ravine and scattered some of the  
hundreds of snowmobilers who were driving in the area. The larger 
avalanche began at the top of a 3,000-foot ridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses described a wall of snow that sounded like a train and  
a wind blast that drove icy particles into their faces. One said he 
saw three fellow snowmobilers buried in the snow as he sped away. 
</P>
<P>
	When the snow settled, groves of trees and rocky outcroppings  
that had given the videotape vital reference points were buried, 
complicating rescue efforts. Burke said he fears some victims were 
entangled in uprooted trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanches across central Europe have claimed more than 70 lives  
in what has become one of the century's snowiest and most 
precarious winters. In Austria, massive slides suddenly thundered 
into the picturesque villages of Galteur and Valzur last month. 
Thirty-eight people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of slides occur every day in the United States, though  
few threaten lives or property. But there has been an unusually 
large amount of snow in parts of the Northwest and southern Alaska 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In January alone, avalanches in British Columbia, Montana, Idaho  
and Utah killed 16 skiers and snowmobilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alaska slides may have been triggered by ``highmarking,'' in  
which snowmobilers drive straight uphill to see who can make the 
highest mark on the mountain, said Greg Wilkinson, a spokesman for 
the Alaska State Troopers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dan Hourihan, chairman of the Alaska Mountain Rescue  
Group, said warm weather and 8 feet of fresh snow created the 
conditions for the massive slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service and the U.S. Forest Service issued  
warnings last week that the conditions had raised the danger of 
snow slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims have been identified by authorities as Jodi Combs,  
26, Jeff Saunders, 29, and Christopher Scott, 28, all of Anchorage; 
and Dan Demers, 37, of Eagle River.

<HEADLINE>  Paraguay Vice President Slain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Gunmen assassinated the vice president  
in downtown Asuncion today, sowing fresh political turmoil in 
Paraguay's young democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Maria Argana was heading to his office at 8 a.m. when two  
men in camouflage gear got out of a black car, approached his sport 
utility vehicle and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio and television reports said the attackers used sidearms  
and heavy-caliber weapons in the attack on Paraguay's second 
highest-ranking official. 
</P>
<P>
	The assassination ratcheted up the political tension in a  
country where President Raul Cubas has been fending off calls for 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	No motive was immediately reported for the attack, in which a  
bodyguard also was shot and the driver was injured, apparently 
after being hit by flying glass. The identity of the attackers was 
not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas appealed for calm in a nationwide address, saying  
``Paraguay and its people are in need of urgency, order, and 
tranquility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later told reporters that three suspects were being sought in  
Argana's assassination. Cubas also said he was closing Paraguay's 
borders with Argentina and Brazil for a manhunt and was sending 
soldiers into the streets to keep peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The president had become increasingly isolated in recent months,  
even within his own party. Cubas appealed to his detractors not to 
make Argana's killing a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not considering resigning from office,'' Cubas said.  
Referring to his 4-year term that began last August, he added, ``I 
will finish out my mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senator from the ruling Colorado Party, Juan Carlos Galaverna,  
said Argana was shot repeatedly. The vice president's bloodied body 
lay slumped in the back seat of the red sport vehicle before being 
carried away. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bystanders massed around the roped-off site of the  
attack, while police with white gloves searched for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of police and soldiers blocked downtown streets in  
Asuncion, the capital. Some businesses closed and public transport 
was temporarily halted. 
</P>
<P>
	Argana was a former foreign minister and president of the  
Supreme Court under ex-dictator Alfredo Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted last Thursday to begin impeachment proceedings  
against Cubas, alleging he violated the constitution in 1998 by 
freeing a jailed general. 
</P>
<P>
	Last March, a military tribunal had sentenced Lino Oviedo, a  
55-year-old former army chief, to 10 years in prison for trying to 
oust then-President Juan Wasmosy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Oviedo's release split Paraguay's ruling  
Colorado Party, causing a rift between factions led by Argana and 
Cubas. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas' Colorado Party has a majority in both chambers, but  
lawmakers aligned with Argana voted with the opposition to pursue 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court head Wildo Rienzi on Friday ordered Cubas to send  
Oviedo back to prison, but the president refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Landlocked Paraguay, which returned to democracy in 1989 after  
35 years of dictatorship, has no rules laying out a process for 
impeachment.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Tips for investors from state securities regulators for avoiding  
fraud on the Internet: 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't expect to get rich quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't assume that your computer service provider monitors its  
bulletin boards and other investment sites. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't buy thinly traded, little-known stocks of small  
companies, known as ``penny stocks,'' simply because they were 
promoted and hyped online. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't act on the advice of anyone who hides his or her  
identity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't be fooled by claims of ``inside information'' such as  
upcoming company announcements of new contracts or products. 
</P>
<P>
	--If someone says they have checked something out, don't assume  
they have actually done so. 
</P>
<P>
	--Call your state securities agency for information or advice.

<HEADLINE> Giants Sign Tight End Pete Mitchell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Giants finally got  
their pass-catching tight end by signing free agent Pete Mitchell, 
who started every game for the Jacksonville Jaguars last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who has 166 catches in his four NFL seasons, will  
complement starter Howard Cross, who is primarily a blocker. Cross 
had 13 of the 16 receptions by Giants' tight ends last season, 
while Mitchell caught 38 balls by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who played at Boston College, was originally  
designated a transition player by the Jaguars, meaning they had the 
right to match any offer. 
</P>
<P>
	However, that label was dropped when Jacksonville signed Kyle  
Brady from the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 248-pound Mitchell has caught at least one pass in  
60 of his 64 NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	``First and foremost, Pete is competitive and tough,'' Giants  
coach Jim Fassel said. ``The dimension he gives us as a pass 
receiver should be very positive. He's going to help us get better 
and he will fit in well with our team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell was a fourth-round draft pick of the Miami Dolphins in  
1995 and was traded to Jacksonville before the season, joining Tom 
Coughlin, who had been his college coach.

<HEADLINE> Hoffa Sworn In As Teamsters Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Teamsters have sworn in James P. Hoffa as  
the union's new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming a post once held by his late father, Hoffa took the  
oath of office Monday at the union's headquarters. He then 
administered it to other newly elected officers, most of whom were 
sworn in through a conference call, before holding an executive 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The new panel passed several resolutions, including one  
authorizing auditors to review the union's financial records. Hoffa 
has pledged to balance the Teamsters' budget during his first year 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The board also passed a resolution to create an internal ethics  
panel to help reshape the image of the union, which has been 
tainted by charges of ties to organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa, son of Jimmy Hoffa, defeated Tom Leedham in a rerun  
presidential election last December. A campaign finance scandal 
overturned president Ron Carey's 1996 re-election and barred him 
from trying to reclaim the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky certified the results of  
Hoffa's victory in January. However, he barred one of Hoffa's 
running mates from taking office and delayed certifying the 
election results for two vice presidential posts representing 
Canadian locals. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham had argued that the election results should not be  
certified until investigations of other candidates on Hoffa's slate 
had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, U.S. District Judge David Edelstein in New York  
affirmed Hoffa's victory and Cherkasky's decision that 
certification of the election results should not be delayed because 
of charges pending against some members of the Hoffa slate.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Hall of Fame Funds Pledged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York State Senate committed $835,000  
Tuesday to improvements at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, where 
attendance has lagged since the 1994 strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The allocation would come from ``cultural development'' funds  
the state used to provide about $95 million for upgrades to the 
Buffalo Bills' stadium in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate's Majority Leader Joseph Bruno urged his counterpart in  
the Assembly, Speaker Sheldon Silver, and Gov. George Pataki to 
allocate money they control to raise the $2.56 million needed for 
the Hall of Fame project. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned renovations in Cooperstown include a redesigned entrance  
to better protect the exhibits inside from weather extremes. 
</P>
<P>
	Money is also needed to update exhibits and consider more  
interactive attractions aimed at youngsters, including virtual 
reality exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will help us take the steps necessary to assure the future  
of our collections and to return tourism in the region to the 
levels enjoyed before the 1994 baseball strike,'' Hall chairman 
Edward Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall drew 407,047 in 1993 and was on its way to an even  
higher total the following year until the baseball strike started 
on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance in 1995 was 326,000 and it continued falling until  
bottoming out at 285,000 in 1997. It rallied to 331,284 in 1998, a 
year in which the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race the New 
York Yankees' dream season helped restore interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokesman Charles Deister called the proposal a ``great  
idea.'' There was no immediate word from Silver. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of previous government spending on private enterprises,  
Brian Backstrom of Change-New York, said such grants often cannot 
be defended as smart investments by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps we should only be making $2.5 million grants to  
private tourist destinations when it can be shown that there will 
be $2.5 million worth of benefit to the public,'' Backstrom said. 
``Sometimes, the best allocation is to make no allocation at all. 
Perhaps it would be better to return $2.5 million to the public in 
the form of tax breaks.''

<HEADLINE> Study:Implant Helps Deaf Kids Learn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most profoundly deaf children who have a  
device called a cochlear implant surgically installed are able to 
attend regular school classes within four years, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, by Dr. John K. Niparko of Johns Hopkins University  
School of Medicine in Baltimore, found that 80 percent of 
profoundly deaf children who receive the cochlear implant were able 
to move out of special education training and into ordinary 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before cochlear implant, most of these children were in  
self-contained classrooms or they were bused to state schools for 
the deaf,'' Niparko said Tuesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The 80 percent success was among children who had the surgery  
before the age of 4 and who received four years of training and 
experience after the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the 20 percent who failed to progress to regular classes  
were children who received the implant after age 4, Niparko said. 
Later surgery, he said, makes it more difficult for the child to 
adjust to the hearing assistance device. 
</P>
<P>
	The study is based on long-term tracking of 35 children who  
received the cochlear implant at Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Niparko said his study did not look at the children's individual  
scholastic achievement, but he noted that to be allowed to join 
regular classes, ``these children have to show some scholastic 
success and require less and less rehabilitative support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 1 percent of cochlear implant patients never  
receive a significant benefit from the surgery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cochlear implants are electronic systems that send  
sound-generated impulses directly to the brain, bypassing a flawed 
part of the inner ear. With training, patients learn to interpret 
these signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Niparko said the devices are implanted in children who are born  
profoundly deaf because a key part of the ear, called the cochlea, 
fails to function properly. Usually the failure is the result of 
malformed or missing structures called hair cells. These are cells 
that convert sound-generated vibrations into nerve impulses sent to 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	About one child in every thousand babies born in America suffers  
from profound deafness, said Niparko.

	Although young children benefit most from cochlear implants,  
Niparko said the surgery is also offered to adults with profound 
deafness. He said studies show about half of all adult patients 
report a significant improvement in their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Wires from the cochlear implant transmit impulses from an  
externally worn device that gathers sounds. The external device 
requires periodic electrical recharging. Electronic parts installed 
inside the ear are sealed and designed to last 120 years, said 
Niparko, and the mechanical failure rate is about one percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered experimental, cochlear implants are now offered  
at more than 200 U.S. hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost for implanting the $20,000 cochlear device,  
including surgery, hospitalization and follow up, is about $42,000, 
according to the Deafness Research Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three Japanese regional banks from Tokyo have  
agreed to form an alliance to match competition from major national 
banks, an official at one of the three banks said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new alliance by Hachijuni Bank Ltd., Joyo Bank Ltd. and  
Gunma Bank Ltd. is aimed at cutting costs through joint development 
of new financial products and other moves, said Makoto Shinohara, 
spokesman of Hachijuni Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinohara said competition will intensify in years to come as  
major banks shift their business more to domestic markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint committee set up by the three regional banks will work  
out details on broad alliance, Shinohara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, 15 of Japan's largest banks received at  
total of 7.5 trillion yen ($63.5 billion) in public funds as part 
of a government bailout to stabilize the nation's troubled 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	In obtaining taxpayer money, some of the 15 banks were forced to  
close overseas operations or integrate them, and urged to restrict 
their activities to the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is mired in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden banks scale back on lending, starving companies of 
cash. Many financial institutions are now struggling to write off 
massive bad loans left over from the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past several years, the three regional banks involved  
have shed jobs and closed branches while at the same time disposing 
of bad debts they held, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest move by the three banks is a first alliance by  
regional banks in Japan, the report said. The three banks now have 
cross-shareholdings among them, with each holding up to 6 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Hachijuni, Joyo and Gunma all have relatively strong balance  
sheets, with problem loans as defined under U.S. standards 
accounting for in a range of only 2 percent to 3 percent of their 
loan portfolios, the bank spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Protest Filed Over Lesbian Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A Methodist bishop has reluctantly  
filed a complaint against 69 pastors who participated in a ``holy 
union celebration'' of a lesbian couple, vowing to fight a church 
ban on such observances. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Melvin Talbert, head of the 375-church California-Nevada  
United Methodist Conference, said he brought the complaint with 
``sorrow and regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert said his church's ban on ceremonies recognizing gay  
relationships is an ``act of injustice.'' But he said church law 
required him to act on a complaint brought by two pastors upset 
that the ministers presided over a Jan. 15 ceremony for two 
lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will uphold law, but I will not be silenced. I will continue  
speaking out against the law and will continue working to change 
the position of our church to be more in keeping with the teachings 
and compassion of Jesus,'' Talbert said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The action is the first step toward a possible church trial for  
the Rev. Don Fado and 68 other ministers. If convicted, they could 
be removed from the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Fado said Talbert had no choice, and he said the event was  
planned to ``make a statement to the church that it needs to 
reevaluate this policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fado led the wedding-like celebration for Jeanne Barnett, 68,  
and Ellie Charlton, 63, who have been together 15 years. The women 
have long been active in Fado's church, St. Marks United Methodist; 
Charlton is a member of the conference board of trustees, and 
Barnett is conference lay leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict over same-sex weddings has been simmering for years  
within the United Methodist Church, which with 8.5 million members 
is the nation's second-biggest Protestant denomination after the 
Southern Baptists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the church's legislature, the General Conference, added  
a provision to the Methodists' Book of Discipline that says: 
``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not be 
conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our 
churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later this week in Chicago, the Rev. Gregory Dell, a minister  
for 28 years, is scheduled to go on trial before a church tribunal 
for presiding over the ``marriage'' of two men. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Rev. Jimmy Creech performed a blessing for a  
lesbian couple in his Omaha, Neb., congregation. Last March, eight 
of 11 members of a Methodist tribunal decided to take no action 
against Creech. Though acquitted, Creech was not given another 
church assignment and was put on leave.

<HEADLINE> Revamped Boilermakers Keep Winning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Two years ago, Purdue had a new  
staff and nine newcomers on its 12-player women's basketball 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of last season, the Boilermakers were the Big Ten  
champions. And as the 1998-99 season nears an end, they are the No. 
1 team in the nation and playing for a possible NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	All this with a lame-duck coach.  
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Peck, who took over when Nell Fortner left to coach the  
U.S. national team, led the Boilermakers to the Big Ten tournament 
title and to the NCAA round of eight last year. She then agreed to 
stay one more season before moving on herself. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, she's having too much fun to think beyond this  
weekend's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing I enjoy the most is seeing our players enjoying what  
they're doing,'' said Peck, 33, who next month will become coach 
and general manager of Orlando's WNBA expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great transition from high school to college. ... It's  
a different kind of fun. Watching them learn what the different fun 
is the best part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Boilermakers (32-1) beat Rutgers 75-62 in the  
Midwest Regional final Monday night to advance to the Final Four at 
San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	They will play West Regional champion Louisiana Tech in the  
semifinals Friday. Duke and Georgia will play in the other 
semifinal, and the two winners will meet Sunday for the title 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue lost to Louisiana Tech in the regional finals last year,  
then started its march to the top with a 78-68 victory over 
Tennessee to start the new season, snapping the three-time 
defending NCAA champions' winning streak at 46 games. 
</P>
<P>
	A 73-72 loss at Stanford the next week was Purdue's only loss of  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to sound like a recording, but we have two great  
leaders -- Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs,'' Peck said. 
``If one gets it done on offense, the other one gets it done on 
defense. This team looks to both of them for guidance and 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camille Cooper had a career-high 20 points in the victory Monday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has stepped up big time in the NCAA tournament. She came  
out and she played big. And these two seniors showed confidence in 
her,'' Peck said. ``It was a total team effort. You only saw seven 
players play, but it was all 15.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty scored seven of her team-high 22 points during a  
game-turning 16-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want this to be our last game and our team didn't  
want this to be our last game. We probably came out a little too 
flat to start the game, but we played with a lot more emotion in 
the second half both offensively and especially defensively,'' 
White-McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experience paid off, the coach said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year Steph and 'Kari were in these kinds of situations,''  
Peck said. ``A couple of times we were down 17 and came back to 
win. ``That experience that two senior captains have ... they never 
lost their composure, they never folded and as long as they stay 
confident, the rest of this team stays confident. They led their 
team, and once they got the lead they held onto it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Kelly Komara agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``When things got tight and it got late, Steph and 'Kari just  
put this team on their backs,'' said Komara, who made three free 
throws in the final minute. ``What can you say? But what else would 
anyone expect?''

<HEADLINE> Impersonal Acceptance Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Who says that students who go to big  
colleges get treated impersonally, like they're just numbers? 
</P>
<P>
	Truman Bradley, of Boulder, Colo., for one.  
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Bradley, a prospective Arizona State University  
student, recently got a letter from the school that began: 
``Congratulations on 987-65-4321's admission.'' (The number used in 
this story has been changed.) 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, addressed to Truman's father, Jeff Bradley, added  
that as a parent ``you will be a partner with the university in 
encouraging 987-65-4321 to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father's reply: ``Thank you for offering our son,  
987-65-4321, or as we affectionately refer to him around the house 
-- 987 -- a position in the ASU class of 2003. His mother, 
123-45-6MOM, and I are very happy... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Desch, director of undergraduate admissions, said the  
impersonal letter was a glitch in a batch of several thousand 
letters sent to prospective students. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first five, the computer picked up the student's Social  
Security number instead of the name. Those were have been discarded 
but inadvertently were mailed, Desch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how it happened,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The mother of at least one other prospective student informed  
the school that she'd received such a letter, said Desch. He could 
not recall her name.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices slumped Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after Russia's prime minister canceled meetings in 
the United States, dashing hopes for announcement of a new food aid 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, energy futures retreated, while copper  
continued higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Grains and soybeans suffered in late trading on word that  
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov decided while en route to 
Washington to cancel his trip. Primakov, who is staunchly opposed 
to NATO plans for airstrikes against Serbian targets, apparently 
turned back after he was briefed by Vice President Al Gore on 
unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to resolve the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The abrupt decision dashed hopes the Clinton administration  
would take the opportunity of Primakov's visit to announce or 
negotiate new food aid to cash-starved Russia. U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary Dan Glickman a day earlier had signaled the 
administration is seriously considering new donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans also were pressured by increased farmer  
selling that came after Monday's rally in prices. Wheat was 
pressured by improving crop conditions in China and the southern 
Plains, at a time of weak export demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.82 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.28 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell 1 3/4 cents to 
$1.15 3/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 6 cents to $4.93 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
despite official ratification of an agreement by some of the 
world's top oil producers to slash output. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said a decision by the Organization of  
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to cut daily 
output some 2.1 million barrels already had been factored into the 
market. Some suggested prices may be move substantially higher 
again until there are clear indications the cuts are being adhered 
to over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors instead positioned themselves for the release of  
weekly inventory figures from the American Petroleum Institute and 
the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	May crude fell 23 cents to $15.51 a barrel; April heating oil  
fell .73 cent to 41.66 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline fell 
.51 cent to 48.91 cents a gallon; April natural gas fell 1.5 cent 
to $1.754 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures moved higher a second day on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange amid continuing optimism the industrial metal's 
fortunes are rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants have speculated Japanese manufacturing  
demand is on the rise as supplies were withdrawn from Singapore 
warehouses. While London Metal Exchange supplies were unchanged 
overnight, investors took solace from the fact that new supplies 
from Chile have yet to show up. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palmeiro Aims at Opening Day Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- As his Texas teammates finish  
tucking in their jerseys and begin heading out of the clubhouse for 
batting practice, Rafael Palmeiro takes his time lathering cream 
cheese and jelly on a bagel. These days, he's in no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro spends most of his time in the lonely, depressing  
training room recovering from two operations on his right knee. 
He's working hard in hopes of being back by opening day, but it's 
just not the same as being on the field, especially not for the 
major leaguer who has played more games this decade than everyone 
but Cal Ripken and not when it's his first year back in Texas after 
five seasons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in here is the tough part,'' Palmeiro said in a nearly  
empty clubhouse. ``But my teammates have been very encouraging. 
They've tried to make me feel a part of it, even though I haven't 
been out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro underwent arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 to clean out  
some rough cartilage under his right kneecap probably caused by 
wear and tear from his offseason regimen of running stairs. Less 
than four weeks later, Palmeiro was jogging and tore the cartilage 
that absorbs weight and provides stability, forcing another 
operation. Doctors said the injuries aren't related and Palmeiro 
calls them ``a fluke, a coincidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling them that I'm going to be ready for opening day,''  
said Palmeiro, who has missed just 24 games in the last nine years. 
``I have to stay positive and think I'm going to be ready and work 
for it. If I'm not, I'm not. But at least I'm going to try to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers manager Johnny Oates is looking forward to having his  
new slugger bat between Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez. If 
Palmeiro can get in about three exhibition games, don't be 
surprised if Palmeiro is Texas' designated hitter in the April 5 
opener against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are players who bring a presence to your lineup and for  
us he's one of them,'' Oates said. ``We would not want to miss him 
for an extended period of time. If we do have to miss him, 
hopefully it's for a very brief time early in the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro has done some hitting in a batting cage, and so far the  
knee has passed every test. His final obstacles are rebuilding 
strength in the knee and the typical spring training chore of 
regaining timing at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can catch up quickly,'' Texas hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo  
said. ``His swing isn't the type you have to work, work, work, 
work. He's so fluid that he only needs to make little 
adjustments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving the Rangers, Palmeiro has been among baseball's  
top 10 in home runs and RBIs -- far outpacing Will Clark, who took 
his job in Texas. The past four seasons, Palmeiro has hit at least 
38 home runs and 104 RBIs, winning Orioles MVP three times. He's 
also earned Gold Gloves the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro was outraged that the Rangers signed Clark over him  
five winters ago and made harsh comments against the team's 
management. But when he had the chance to return, Palmeiro called 
Texas and said he was willing to sign for less than other teams 
were offering. He signed a $45 million, five-year deal in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be back, but it's hard to judge how much  
because I'm not out there, being a part of games and the 
excitement,'' he said. ``Eventually, it's going to be great. I just 
have to take my time and get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro's numbers could be even better this year considering  
the people hitting around him and the stadium where he'll play half 
his games. Palmeiro has a .772 slugging percentage at The Ballpark, 
with a homer every 8.8 at-bats and an RBI every 3.59 times up -- all 
tops among visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a hitter, you feel good in some parks and other parks you  
don't feel as good. And The Ballpark felt like one of the better 
ballparks for me to hit in,'' Palmeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro said he doesn't think about what might have been had he  
never left Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``My five years in Baltimore were outstanding; I had a great  
time,'' he said. ``I'm thankful I was able to play there, but I'm 
also thankful I'm going to have the opportunity to come back here 
and maybe do some great things for this team.''

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Players' Scandal Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An attorney for two sisters who maintain they  
did course work for some Minnesota basketball players says others 
were pressured to help the athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My clients aren't the only ones that have information about  
academic misconduct with the men's basketball department. Others 
have contacted us to confirm that they, too, were pressured to help 
players keep their eligibility through special academic 
assistance,'' said James Lord, who represents Jan Gangelhoff and 
Jeanne Payer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord declined to name any of the others who contacted him  
claiming to have knowledge of academic wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangelhoff, a former office manager in the university's academic  
counseling unit, and Payer planned a news conference today to 
display the papers they say they wrote for players. Gangelhoff's 
claims that she wrote papers and did course work for at least 20 
current and former players have triggered an investigation into 
academic fraud at the university. The official investigation began 
Monday. She said coach Clem Haskins paid her to keep tutoring a 
player after the university's academic counseling unit told her to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequently, former player Russ Archambault has said Haskins  
gave him several hundred dollars in cash while he was a member of 
the team from 1996 through February 1998, when he was dismissed by 
Haskins for leaving his hotel after curfew the night before a Big 
Ten game at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash payments could bring severe NCAA penalties for Haskins as  
well as the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins issued a statement Monday through the university with  
the approval of his attorney, Ron Zamansky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I deny the allegations of former player Russ Archambault. I  
again deny the allegations of Jan Gangelhoff. They are not true,'' 
Haskins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people of the state of Minnesota are smart and recognize  
that people in leadership positions can have false allegations 
raised for whatever reason or agenda,'' Haskins said. 
``Fortunately, America has a system of justice that preserves the 
rights of all people, including those of athletes and coaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zamansky declined to discuss any other specific allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that the University of Minnesota is now  
fighting so hard to deny the existence of a conspiracy to keep 
university basketball players eligible to play,'' said Lord, the 
attorney for Gangelhoff and Payer. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Mark Yudof took exception to Lord's use of  
the word conspiracy, calling it ``irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Yudof spoke with Haskins by telephone from Florida,  
where the coach is for the Final Four. He said he wanted 
reassurance of Haskins' denials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got that,'' Yudof said.  
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he believed Haskins but added, ``What I personally  
believe is not the issue. We will have investigators who will 
interview the witnesses and look at the document and see what can 
be corroborated and what can't, and we'll go with the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the allegations prove true, Yudof promised swift action but  
did not say what that might be.

<HEADLINE>  Palmeiro Aims at Opening Day Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- As his Texas teammates finish  
tucking in their jerseys and begin heading out of the clubhouse for 
batting practice, Rafael Palmeiro takes his time lathering cream 
cheese and jelly on a bagel. These days, he's in no hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro spends most of his time in the lonely, depressing  
training room recovering from two operations on his right knee. 
He's working hard in hopes of being back by opening day, but it's 
just not the same as being on the field, especially not for the 
major leaguer who has played more games this decade than everyone 
but Cal Ripken and not when it's his first year back in Texas after 
five seasons in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in here is the tough part,'' Palmeiro said in a nearly  
empty clubhouse. ``But my teammates have been very encouraging. 
They've tried to make me feel a part of it, even though I haven't 
been out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro underwent arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 to clean out  
some rough cartilage under his right kneecap probably caused by 
wear and tear from his offseason regimen of running stairs. Less 
than four weeks later, Palmeiro was jogging and tore the cartilage 
that absorbs weight and provides stability, forcing another 
operation. Doctors said the injuries aren't related and Palmeiro 
calls them ``a fluke, a coincidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm telling them that I'm going to be ready for opening day,''  
said Palmeiro, who has missed just 24 games in the last nine years. 
``I have to stay positive and think I'm going to be ready and work 
for it. If I'm not, I'm not. But at least I'm going to try to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers manager Johnny Oates is looking forward to having his  
new slugger bat between Juan Gonzalez and Ivan Rodriguez. If 
Palmeiro can get in about three exhibition games, don't be 
surprised if Palmeiro is Texas' designated hitter in the April 5 
opener against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are players who bring a presence to your lineup and for  
us he's one of them,'' Oates said. ``We would not want to miss him 
for an extended period of time. If we do have to miss him, 
hopefully it's for a very brief time early in the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro has done some hitting in a batting cage, and so far the  
knee has passed every test. His final obstacles are rebuilding 
strength in the knee and the typical spring training chore of 
regaining timing at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can catch up quickly,'' Texas hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo  
said. ``His swing isn't the type you have to work, work, work, 
work. He's so fluid that he only needs to make little 
adjustments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving the Rangers, Palmeiro has been among baseball's  
top 10 in home runs and RBIs -- far outpacing Will Clark, who took 
his job in Texas. The past four seasons, Palmeiro has hit at least 
38 home runs and 104 RBIs, winning Orioles MVP three times. He's 
also earned Gold Gloves the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro was outraged that the Rangers signed Clark over him  
five winters ago and made harsh comments against the team's 
management. But when he had the chance to return, Palmeiro called 
Texas and said he was willing to sign for less than other teams 
were offering. He signed a $45 million, five-year deal in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to be back, but it's hard to judge how much  
because I'm not out there, being a part of games and the 
excitement,'' he said. ``Eventually, it's going to be great. I just 
have to take my time and get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro's numbers could be even better this year considering  
the people hitting around him and the stadium where he'll play half 
his games. Palmeiro has a .772 slugging percentage at The Ballpark, 
with a homer every 8.8 at-bats and an RBI every 3.59 times up -- all 
tops among visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a hitter, you feel good in some parks and other parks you  
don't feel as good. And The Ballpark felt like one of the better 
ballparks for me to hit in,'' Palmeiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro said he doesn't think about what might have been had he  
never left Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``My five years in Baltimore were outstanding; I had a great  
time,'' he said. ``I'm thankful I was able to play there, but I'm 
also thankful I'm going to have the opportunity to come back here 
and maybe do some great things for this team.''

	US Talks With Yugoslavia Fruitless  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Talks between a U.S. envoy and  
Yugoslavia's president have ended without a peace deal, meaning 
NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia may be imminent. President Slobodan 
Milosevic rejected a key element of the U.S.-backed peace plan 
which called for the deployment of NATO troops in Yugoslavia. 
Milosevic's decision all but slammed the door on chances of on 
agreement. Ethnic Albanians last week signed the deal that gives 
them limited autonomy in Kosovo. Meanwhile, fighting resumed in the 
Serbian province as Yugoslav forces defied NATO threats.

	U.S. Seeks Senate Support in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, seeking to head off a  
Senate effort to block funds for U.S. military action in Kosovo, is 
calling top lawmakers back to the White House to seek greater 
congressional support for the mission. There are deep divisions in 
Congress over the president's plan for military intervention in 
Kosovo. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., says the administration has 
failed to make the case for ground troops in the Serbian province. 
But Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., says he is convinced a majority of 
Congress would back military action if asked to vote on the matter.

	OPEC Agrees To Cut Oil Production  
</P>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members agreed today to cut crude  
oil production by 2.1 million barrels a day and maintain lower 
levels of output for a full year starting April 1, oil ministers 
said. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, will slash output by 
585,000 barrels a day. Oil prices had already reflected the impact 
of the expected cuts by rising sharply, and industry analysts say 
refiners of gasoline have wasted no time passing on the steeper 
prices to consumers. The OPEC move likely will cause gas prices to 
rise further.

	Marijuana-Scented Cigarettes Tested  
</P>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Tobacco industry memos indicate that  
Brown &AMP; Williamson in the 1970s developed a cigarette that smelled 
like marijuana, in hopes of cashing in on the drug's popularity. A 
company chemist noted in a June 3, 1974, memo that mixing Virginia 
and Turkish tobaccos, pekoe teas, alfalfa and oregano produced an 
``aroma easily mistaken for marijuana, that should have great 
appeal to marijuana smokers.'' A company spokesman said the idea 
was ill-conceived and that Brown &AMP; Williamson has ``zero interest 
in marijuana.''

the United States today amid growing tensions over NATO's threat to 
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia. The Kosovo crisis looks 
likely to dominate Primakov's visit, though he would prefer to 
focus on winning new loans for Russia's deeply troubled economy. 
Primakov reportedly would return to Moscow if NATO begins bombing

	Garciaparra To Get Third Opinion

<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Red Sox star shortstop Nomar  
Garciaparra, who has missed the last 11 days of spring training, 
will get a third medical opinion about his ailing right elbow. He 
apparently injured his arm while making a relay throw against 
Toronto. Boston's team doctor originally diagnosed the problem as a 
strain in a forearm ligament, and tendinitis or soreness in the 
biceps muscle. But Garciaparra got an MRI exam yesterday and will 
meet today with the Anaheim Angels' physician.

<HEADLINE> Report: Converse Cuts Rodman Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The unpredictable Dennis Rodman has been told to  
find new shoes to fill, according to The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball shoe manufacturer Converse Inc. of North Reading has  
ended its $15 million endorsement contract with Rodman about one 
year before it was to expire, the Globe said it was told by 
unidentified sources in a story for today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe also was told that Rodman, a forward for the Los  
Angeles Lakers, contends Converse owes him about $3 million, and 
plans to fight the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Converse told Rodman last week that it was using an exit clause  
in the 1997 contract to end the deal, the Globe said it was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Converse signed Rodman to try to score points against such  
competitors as Adidas, Nike and Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had kicked a photographer during a nationally broadcast  
game just before the contract was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA suspended him; Eastman Kodak and the West Coast  
hamburger chain Carl Jr.'s pulled television commercials featuring 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	But James E. Solomon, senior vice president of marketing at  
Converse, said Rodman was ``an inherently good individual who has a 
strong competitive spirit and a good work ethic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven months later, the value of Converse shares dropped 5.9  
percent, and investors were said to be worried that the demand for 
the Rodman shoe, the All-Star '99, was 10 percent less than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe said it could not reach Solomon for comment Monday,  
but the newspaper quoted NBC courtside reporter Jim Gray as saying 
during a national broadcast Sunday that Converse ``terminated that 
contract due to breach of contract involving terms of behavior, 
number of games played, and not having a deal in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Converse dropped from fifth in the market share of basketball  
sneakers in 1997 to seventh last year, and last month the company 
said its revenues fell from $450.2 million in 1997 to $308.4 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Converse stock has lost more than half its value in the last  
year, and closed Monday at 3 3/8, down one-eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea was to use Rodman's obvious visibility to  
increase the numbers in the basketball shoe area -- where sales are 
flat industry-wide -- to try to solidify the core business, while 
expanding into fashion and performance sneakers,'' Gregg Hartly, 
executive director of the Sporting Goods Manufacturing Association, 
told the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't work. Dennis was always in the spotlight more for  
his personality problems than what he did on the court,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn Now Walks Among Angels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Mo Vaughn says he hasn't shed any pounds. He  
looks slimmer this spring, so it must be the weight off his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger Clemens told me if you get out of Boston, because of the  
regime that's in control, it adds five years to your career,'' 
Vaughn says. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has something to prove this year, not just to himself and  
to the Anaheim Angels, but to the Red Sox and all their fans. Just 
like Clemens, he wants to show general manager Dan Duquette and 
chief executive officer John Harrington made a colossal mistake by 
letting him go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think about my friends, my teammates, but I won't miss that  
organization. I don't miss the garbage and I don't miss the people 
running the team,'' Vaughn says on a cloudless spring morning, the 
desert sun starting to warm the dry air. ``It's just something that 
had to happen,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The words start coming quickly. Mo is a man who doesn't play  
games. He can't hide his feelings, even if he tried. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' Vaughn says. ``We could have played for Lou  
Gorman for the rest of our careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette, who replaced Gorman as general manager in January  
1994, didn't aggressively pursue Clemens, who then signed with 
Toronto and won consecutive Cy Young Awards for a record five. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after Clemens left, the Red Sox kept saying they  
wanted to keep Vaughn, but all their offers were months late and a 
few million dollars short, so he signed an $80 million, six-year 
contract with the Angels, who look to him for power on the field 
and off. 
</P>
<P>
	As in: Drive in the runs and drive the rest of the clubhouse to  
excel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything they brought him here for, he's going to give us,''  
says Tim Salmon, a veteran of the Angels' September flops in 1997 
and 1998. ``He's not going to have MVP-type years every year. But 
he brings so much to the table, he's going to make myself, he's 
going to make Darrin Erstad, he's going to make Jim Edmonds have 
those MVP-type years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clemens, Vaughn brings intensity and all those intangibles  
that baseball managers cite. He had a personal trainer come by at 7 
a.m. every day this spring, bullying the body even before he went 
to the ballpark for BP. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dedicates himself and prepares himself as good as  
anybody,'' Angels manager Terry Collins says. ``He not only drives 
himself to it, he drives everyone to do the same thing. We did our 
homework. We know what he's like. He's not going to hold clubhouse 
meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's at those crucial times in games, when players need to suck  
it up to get a hit, or pitchers need to bear down and get an out, 
that Vaughn makes his presence felt. A little word here and there, 
just to let a teammate know this is the time when winning teams 
separate themselves from the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell a player something,'' Collins says. ``But if it  
comes from Mo Vaughn, it means a lot more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim, which has never been to the World Series since starting  
play in 1961, has not been known as a hearty bunch. For years, Gene 
Autry tried to spend for a winner. Now that it's The Walt Disney 
Co.'s team, the Mouse people in charge want to change that 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Up in LA, the Dodgers brought in Kevin Brown for wins and  
toughness in their laid-back clubhouse. It's Vaughn's job to do the 
same down in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's hurt, everyone's sore, probably after a  
week-and-a-half of the season,'' Collins says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Vaughn comes in. Collins says Vaughn carries a  
message with him everywhere he goes, and doesn't even have to 
verbalize it: 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make excuses. Play every game to completion. Don't give  
away any bats. Watch the batting cage. This guy comes in with a 
purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn has struggled this spring, going 12-for-38 (.316) through  
Tuesday with no homers and nine RBIs. Layered in windbreakers and 
sweatshirts in the early morning cool of the desert spring isn't 
what he's used to, and the high skies seem to have given him 
trouble picking up the ball out of pitchers' hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, it's spring training, so he's not concerned. He  
still has time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	And, he's no longer in the center of the Beantown glare, with  
Red Sox fans wondering if he'll stay or go, with the team hinting, 
making and withdrawing offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always feeling like I had to go out and prove myself to  
the people I worked for,'' Vaughn says. ``There was never a rest 
period, a stable period. If I had stayed, I would have retired 
angry. I didn't want to choose that way to leave the game. I would 
have never had fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll live in Newport Beach, about a half-hour drive from the  
ballpark. It will be quite different from life in Easton, Mass., 
where he wasn't just a ballplayer, he was a civic hero. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox brought up the negatives, the July 1995 bar fight in  
Boston (he was defending a girl friend and no charges were brought) 
and the January 1998 arrest in Dedham, Mass., on a drunken driving 
charge (he was acquitted). After 7 1/2 seasons with the team, he had 
enough. He wanted peace of mind to go along with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry about my situation at all,'' he says. ``It was  
worth the struggle. It made me a better person. It made me 
strong.''

	NYON, Switzerland (AP) -- The governing body of European soccer  
UEFA put off until at least Wednesday a decision about the European 
2000 qualifying matches for Saturday in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Disaster Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved a $2 billion bill Tuesday  
containing aid for Central America's efforts to recover from 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after senators added $40 million for families of  
victims of last year's accident in which a Marine jet sliced the 
cable of an Italian ski gondola, killing 20 skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall bill was approved by voice vote, and marked a  
reversal for a measure that only Monday seemed destined to remain 
unfinished for another month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the major hurdle to the bill's passage disappeared after  
Republicans removed language from the bill seeking to block U.S. 
involvement in a seemingly imminent NATO attack on Kosovo. Instead, 
the two parties agreed to separate, bipartisan language supporting 
U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
	The $40 million for the gondola accident -- up to $2 million for  
the family of each victim -- was added on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen days ago, a U.S. military court-martial cleared the  
pilot, Capt. Richard J. Ashby, of involuntary homicide and 
manslaughter charges in the accident. The next day, President 
Clinton said the United States was ``heartbroken and horrified'' 
and would make amends. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., sponsor of the measure, said it would  
``permit the United States to shoulder unambiguously its 
responsibility, uphold the honor of the United States military both 
at home and abroad, and begin to ease the grieving of 20 families 
who lost their loved ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robb's amendment provides the money but gives Defense Secretary  
William Cohen 90 days to decide whether to make the payment. 
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said officials there would want to 
examine the provision. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, it seemed all but certain that the Senate would not  
complete the overall bill this week. That would have meant it would 
not be finished until after lawmakers return from a two-week recess 
on April 12, a delay that Clinton administration officials 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	The House was likely to approve a $1.3 billion version of the  
disaster bill on Wednesday. The House measure had no funds for the 
gondola accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if both chambers approved their bills, however, it still  
seemed unlikely that they could write a compromise and send it to 
Clinton by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	It also seemed unlikely that they could resolve the veto threats  
Clinton has issued against both disaster bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opposes GOP plans for paying most of the measure's costs  
with cuts in programs he favors, such as food stamps and U.S. funds 
used to back World Bank loans. The president proposed paying for 
the measure out of this year's expected federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate bills contain nearly $1 billion to help  
Central America recover from several recent natural disasters. Most 
of the money would go to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa 
Rica, battered last October by Hurricane Mitch, which killed 9,000 
people and caused tremendous damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills also contain funds to support Jordan, American  
farmers and a variety of other items. The Senate measure has $140 
million to help U.S. steel companies hurt by low-cost imports, 
while the House would replace a Corporation for Public Broadcasting 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 3, 1998, cable car accident occurred as a Marine Corps  
EA-6B Prowler jet was flying a training mission through the Italian 
Alps. The plane sliced the gondola cable, sending the 20 skiers on 
an eight-second, 370-foot plunge to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb, a former Marine, said he has been pressing the Pentagon to  
make payments since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials have expressed support for the idea of making  
payments. But they have said they believe it must be done under a 
treaty that requires such incidents to be pursued in Italy's 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Robb's measure would provide the $40 million in addition to any  
future settlement in Italian courts. The money would come from the 
existing budget of the Navy, of which the Marines are a part.

<HEADLINE>  OPEC Accepts Oil Production Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC members unanimously agreed today on  
a plan to cut crude oil production by 2.104 million barrels a day 
and to maintain the lower levels of output for a full year 
beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of 11 oil-producing nations approved the cuts in a  
unified effort with non-OPEC producers to reduce a global 
oversupply of oil and strengthen prices that had languished at a 
12-year low as recently as December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compliance, I am sure, will be 100 percent,'' OPEC  
President Youcef Yousfi of Algeria said before OPEC ministers began 
a formal meeting. ``And there is a full determination of all 
countries to commit to this agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Smooth sailing'' was how Kuwait's Oil Minister Sheik Saud  
Nasser al-Sabah described the talks that led to the cuts. 
``Everyone is happy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  
Countries to pump less oil will likely cause gasoline prices to 
rise further, with some experts seeing increases of as much as 10 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co., a  
financial services firm based in Milwaukee, said the cuts could 
continue to buoy gasoline prices into the fall when prices 
typically decline as colder weather makes driving less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	But oil prices were lower today. Brent crude oil futures were  
trading at $13.69 a barrel by mid-afternoon on the International 
Petroleum Exchange in London, down 19 cents from Monday's close but 
unchanged since the cuts were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, OPEC nations will reduce oil output by  
1.716 million barrels a day, Algerian officials said. Non-OPEC 
producers like Mexico, Norway, Russia and Oman will reduce 
production by an additional 388,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, will slash output by  
585,000 barrels of crude a day. OPEC's No. 2 producer, Iran, will 
curtail daily output by 264,000 barrels, while Venezuela will pump 
125,000 fewer barrels of oil a day. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC will evaluate its output levels at the group's next meeting  
in September and reserves the right to adjust production levels 
before the full 12-month period ends, al-Sabah said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on how the market reacts,'' he said, adding  
that Kuwait hoped to see prices rise to between $17 and $18 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said that the production cuts will  
be sufficient to raise prices ``soon'' but declined to specify a 
time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Price increases are ``extremely likely'' as a result of the  
agreement, said Fergus McLeod, an oil analyst at BT Alex. Brown. He 
predicted Brent prices would reach at least $16 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they really stick to this for a year, they could end up  
forcing up the market more than they intend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ishii Yoshiro, an analyst with Japan National Oil Corp., doubted  
that all members of OPEC would comply fully with the lower 
production levels. Cheating by members has undermined OPEC's 
efforts to stabilize prices in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's oil minister, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, said his country  
has already started to notify customers that it will be producing 
less crude: 96,000 fewer barrels a day under its share of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq wasn't included in the production cuts because its sales  
are controlled by the United Nations under an oil-for-food deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement to decrease production was reached two weeks ago  
by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Algeria, together with 
non-member Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Australian IOC Member Won't Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Phil Coles insists he won't resign from  
the IOC and contends there is a plot to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that there is a conspiracy involved, we're getting  
information about that at the moment,'' Coles told a Sydney radio 
station. ``There is an element out to destroy me for other 
reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' remarks came after the John Hancock insurance company, a  
major Olympic sponsor, urged him to resign from the IOC and 
Sydney's organizing committee for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Australian was severely censured by the IOC for  
accepting excessive hospitality from the Salt Lake City bidders 
that won the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He is under further investigation by the IOC following his  
ex-wife's claims that he took jewelry from a Greek businessman 
associated with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it is time for Mr. Coles to do the right thing and resign  
from the IOC,'' John Hancock chief David D'Alessandro said Monday. 
``He is damaging the movement worldwide as well as Australia's 
outstanding efforts to stage what will be extraordinary games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the board of the Sydney organizers, including president  
Michael Knight, is pressuring Coles to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles told the Sydney radio station he thinks some disenchanted  
members of Melbourne's failed bid for the 1996 Games might be 
behind the plan to oust him from the board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they blame me for losing the bid,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles' former wife, Georgina Coles, told the IOC that Coles  
received jewelry worth about $6,300. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said the Sydney organizers have a ``lot more money  
to raise'' ahead of the games, and Coles could help by walking 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``SOCOG does not need unnecessary clouds over the rings making  
it harder to sign new sponsors or win additional support from 
existing sponsors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is one of an elite group that pays $50 million  
every four years for the rights to use the Olympic rings to 
advertise its products. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro criticized the IOC leadership following the  
findings of the Salt Lake City ethics inquiry. He said he was 
removing the rings from official company reports and billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also said he was canceling negotiations with NBC  
for $20 million in advertising to protest the IOC's failure to deal 
with the corruption scandal.

<HEADLINE> Japan Fires at Unidentified Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese destroyers today fired warning shots near  
two unidentified ships that intruded into Japanese waters and then 
fled north into the Sea of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to send military ships to stop the boats -- the  
first such action since World War II for Japan -- followed more than 
12 hours of pursuit by the civilian Maritime Safety Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said destroyers dispatched to intercept the  
vessels fired into the water near both unidentified ships. Chief 
Cabinet spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said military ships were needed 
because Maritime Safety Agency patrol boats could not keep up with 
the vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maritime Safety Agency said its patrol boats spotted the  
vessels in Japanese territorial waters 150 miles north of the Noto 
peninsula, some 180 miles northwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	When the ships failed to heed orders to halt, the patrol boats  
gave chase and fired bursts from 20-millimeter and 13-millimeter 
machine guns, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the first involving live ammunition since 1953, when  
Japanese patrol boats fired warning shots at a suspected Soviet spy 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	After an emergency meeting of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and  
other leaders, the destroyers were sent to intercept and inspect 
the unidentified vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonaka said the ships, which did not display national flags or  
have any fishing equipment on deck, were fleeing north. He said 
they carried suspicious antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	The antennas indicated the ships may have been in Japanese  
waters for spying operations. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is north of where the ships were seen, across the  
Sea of Japan.

<HEADLINE> SEC chairman Wants to Expand Power / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's top securities regulator  
wants to expand the power of independent directors of mutual fund 
companies in an effort to better protect the millions of Americans 
who invest in the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, made the proposals in a speech Monday to the Investment 
Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The protection of investors and the preservation of their  
confidence require a universal vigilance and a common determination 
for constant improvement,'' Levitt said in the speech in Palm 
Desert, Calif. ``That improvement, for the mutual fund industry, 
lies in promoting and safeguarding independence, accountability and 
transparency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 77 million Americans now invest in mutual funds, whose  
total assets exceeded $5.5 trillion at the end of last year, up 
from around $1 trillion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent fund directors, who come from diverse backgrounds,  
are watchdogs responsible for protecting investors' interests and 
maintaining the funds' integrity. Their duties include overseeing 
mutual fund fees, monitoring financial performance and preventing 
conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Levitt also has been pushing the industry for  
improved disclosure of fund fees and investment risks. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed Monday that the SEC:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require the boards of mutual fund companies to have a majority  
of independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current rules, less than a majority -- 40 percent -- of fund  
companies' directors must be independent of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt noted that most large fund companies voluntarily have a  
majority of independent directors. He did not specify how large the 
new required majority should be. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that any new independent directors be nominated by  
current independent directors rather than fund company managers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that there be attorneys available to directors who also  
are independent from company management. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that investors be given information by which to judge  
the independence of their funds' directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt said the SEC, which must vote to formally open the  
proposals to public comment, will act on them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, Chris  
Wloszczyna, said the group had no specific comment on Levitt's 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mutual funds have the strongest system of governance in the  
private sector, and independent directors ... are a crucial 
component of this highly effective system,'' ICI Chairman John J. 
Brennan said in a statement. ``It makes sense to examine the 
industry's best practices to see if a good system can be made even 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ICI announced it had formed an advisory group on best  
practices for fund directors, comprised of independent directors 
and industry officials, which would prepare a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt's proposals grew out of a two-day SEC conference last  
month on the role of independent fund directors. 
</P>
<P>
	At that meeting, Paul Roye, the SEC's top mutual fund regulator,  
said independent directors have played an important role in keeping 
the industry remarkably free from scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Roye added, the SEC will ``aggressively and vigorously  
pursue'' reports of legal violations brought to it by independent 
directors of mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Roye did not specifically mention any avenues the SEC might  
take, but it was clear he referred to the agency's power to bring 
civil lawsuits against fund company officials.

<HEADLINE> Xavier Out To Prove Point in NIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nobody was more disappointed than Xavier coach  
Skip Prosser when the Musketeers, despite 21 victories, were not 
invited to the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	His immediate reaction after he first saw the 64-team field on  
television earlier this month was: ``I'm baffled a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three NIT victories later, Xavier (24-10) plays Clemson (19-14)  
tonight in the semifinals at Madison Square Garden. By beating 
Toledo, Wake Forest and Princeton on the road to the NIT's final 
four, Prosser and his players are feeling a lot better about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot say enough how grateful we are to be here,'' Prosser  
said Monday. ``I've never been through this before. But I talked to 
coaches who have been in a situation where they should have gone to 
the NCAAs and didn't. And to a man, they said the NIT was a great 
experience, especially if you get to New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other semifinal, California (20-11) plays Oregon (19-11)  
in a matchup of Pac-10 foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the Musketeers are here, they hope to become the second  
Xavier team to win the NIT. The 1958 version also won the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But first comes Clemson, trying to build for next season with a  
strong showing in the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think coming to New York will be a springboard for the  
future,'' Tigers coach Larry Shyatt said. ``It was also important 
for them to get another road win before coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, which will have a slight height advantage up front, is  
looking for its first postseason championship of any kind since 
winning the Southern Conference 60 years ago. The Tigers earned 
their trip to New York by beating Georgia, Rutgers on the road, and 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers are led by guard Terrell McIntyre, who averages 17.9  
points, and boast a front line of 6-foot-8 Harold Jamison, 6-9 
Andrius Jurkunas and 6-10 Tom Wideman. Jamison averages 12.6 points 
and 9.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier, though, might have the best player on the court in 6-8  
senior James Posey, the A-10's defensive player of the year who 
also averages 17 points and 9.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Musketeers' comeback 65-58 win over Princeton on March  
17, Posey had 19 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are really powerful and we don't have guys that size,''  
Prosser said. ``They have a nice blend of power, speed and 
quickness. We've played teams that are big but not as quick. 
Sometimes we have success with our pressure, but this will be 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cal-Oregon matchup marks the third meeting between the teams  
this season. The Ducks won the first two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throw out the first two,'' said Bears coach Ben Braun, whose  
team reached the semis with wins over Fresno State, DePaul and 
Colorado State. ``Pride is on the line. Now we have a chance to 
play for an NIT championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon coach Ernie Kent says the Bears may have the emotional  
edge, but the previous games were far from blowouts. Oregon won 
71-69 in overtime in Berkeley on Jan. 2, and then won 93-82 in the 
regular-season finale in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in tough, hard battles with them,'' said Kent,  
whose Ducks beat Georgia Tech, Wyoming and Texas Christian to make 
it to New York. ``We know each other very well, so we don't have to 
go overboard on preparation. But we will have to combat that energy 
burst they'll bring, having lost to us a couple of times.''

are led by forwards A.D. Smith (13.1 points) and Alex Scales (14.5 
points), with guard Terik Brown (12.1 points) running the show. The 
Bears, making their first appearance at the Garden since 1946, 
counter with guards Geno Carlisle (15.6 points) and Thomas Kilgore 
(14.9 points).

<HEADLINE> Whittenburg To Coach Wagner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dereck Whittenburg, a key member of North  
Carolina State's 1983 NCAA championship team, was hired Wednesday 
as coach at Wagner College. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Whittenburg, an assistant for five years at  
Georgia Tech, replaced Tim Capstraw, who was fired after 10 seasons 
with a record of 117-164. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittenburg is probably best known for a missed shot -- a  
35-footer in the final seconds of the 1983 title game with Houston 
that fell well short of the basket. It was grabbed by teammate 
Lorenzo Charles and put in for the winning score in one of the 
dramatic upsets in tournament history. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his stint at Georgia Tech, Whittenburg was an  
assistant at North Carolina State under the late Jim Valvano, who 
coached the 1983 team.

<HEADLINE> Miller Unhappy With Cardinals Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals linebacker Jamir Miller  
apparently won't get what he wants -- neither in money nor in a 
stellar role as some team's pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a free agent who has been testing his market value with  
other teams, reportedly has been offered a two-year Cardinals 
contract worth about $6 million overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ferguson, Cardinals vice president of player personnel, said  
he will do what he can to get Miller to re-sign -- the team's avowed 
wish for weeks now -- but hinted that time may be running out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jamir has to understand what his market value is, and we  
appreciate that,'' Ferguson told The Arizona Republic on Monday. 
``But we have an offer on the table and we've got to do something 
in the next few days, or we have to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the Cardinals' leading tackler last season, visited the  
New England Patriots and the Chicago Bears. Tennessee talked with 
his agent, Steve Baker, but didn't schedule a visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots coach Pete Carroll told the Republic he likes Miller  
but won't pursue him further for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is going to depend on what happens with Arizona,''  
Carroll said. ``We wanted to find out where he was because he's a 
quality player and can help a club. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're not going after it (a contract) at this time,'' he  
added. ``We're just going to monitor what takes place in the 
Arizona negotiations. To attract him right now is more than we want 
to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said Miller made it clear he wants a situation in which  
he can serve more extensively as a pass rusher than he can behind 
Andre Wadsworth and Simeon Rice with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could use Jamir as an outside rusher in nickel situations.  
That's what he wants,'' Carroll said. ``He's also played nickel 
linebacker behind the line of scrimmage. He's done a lot of things. 
That is what makes him attractive. He's a very flexible player. 
</P>
<P>
	``His heart is set on rushing the passer right now,'' Carroll  
added. ``That's why he's hesitant to fully commit to Arizona, 
because they can't promise him that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's right, Ferguson said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he believes in what Miller can do ``but nobody's going  
to design a defense for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a young player who can come back in here with an  
up-and-coming defense and really establish himself, but we will 
determine what we are going to do if and when he signs,'' Ferguson 
said. ``There will be no promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he added, ``we've made it clear that we want Jamir  
back.''

<HEADLINE> ComEd Selling Non-Nuclear Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The parent of Commonwealth Edison is selling  
seven non-nuclear power plants and nine other units to Edison 
International Co. of California for $4.8 billion as it prepares for 
electricity deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of six coal-fired plants and one gas- and oil-fired  
plant will help strengthen Unicom Corp.'s balance sheet and improve 
service in the years before competitors are given the chance to 
entice customers away, Unicom's chairman and chief executive, John 
Rowe, said Tuesday in announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have noted that many utilities are turning toward  
delivery of electricity, rather than producing power, because 
distribution is less regulated and provides for greater name 
recognition among consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The competition is in the production, not the delivery of  
energy,'' Everen Securities analyst Dan Rudakas said. ``Once 
(ComEd) gets their nukes running well and can demonstrate a good 
track record, I'm sure they'll evaluate selling them as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The units are being sold to Edison Mission Energy of Rosemead,  
Calif., a unit of Edison International that builds and operates 
electrical generating plants in the United States and around the 
world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Italy 
and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Unicom purchase would give the company its first entry into  
the potentially lucrative Midwest market, where prices for 
electricity rose to all-time highs last year during a summer heat 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading following the announcement of the deal, Unicom nudged  
up 6 1/4 cents to close at $38.25 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where Edison International gained 12 1/2 cents to $24.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Edison Mission has been on a buying spree after selling most of  
its regulated utilities operating in Southern California under 
state-required deregulation rules. The company recently agreed to 
buy a Homer City, Pa., power plant from GPU Inc. and New York State 
Electric &AMP; Gas Corp. for $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe announced in July that the company would sell the  
coal-fired plants that account for about 30 percent of the 
utility's generating capacity. The sale reaps a generous bonus for 
Unicom; the six coal-fired plants are carried on the company's 
books at about $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the sale also will be used to allow Unicom's ComEd  
to write down the value of its nuclear power plants. ComEd has the 
largest number of nuclear plants in the nation, with eight of 10 
units currently operating at five nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups this week have said ComEd should share proceeds  
from the sale with its customers after years of high rates and poor 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, which is subject to approval by the  
Illinois Commerce Commission, ComEd for five years will buy back 
electricity from Edison Mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 priority is to provide our customers with reliable  
electricity,'' Rowe said. ``This sale is a double win because the 
proceeds will help us to improve our delivery system, while our 
contracts with Edison Mission Energy will ensure that we still have 
access to the electricity produced at these plants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,725 union and management employees at the plants will  
receive severance and training if they are not offered jobs under 
the new ownership, ComEd executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale properties include the six coal-fired plants that  
together have 5,645 megawatts of generating capacity: Crawford and 
Fisk in Chicago; Waukegan; Joliet; Lockport in Will County and 
Powerton in Pekin. Collins Station, located in Morris, Ill., has 
2,698 megawatts of generating capacity and runs on natural gas or 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale also includes nine smaller plants -- called peaking  
units -- that have a combined capacity of 1,429 megawatts, are 
fueled by either gas or oil and are located mainly in the Chicago 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	ComEd provides service to more than 3.4 million customers across  
northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state's population.

<HEADLINE> UConn's Freeman Is Power in Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Make it to the Final Four, and suddenly  
everyone's your friend or long-lost kin. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut All-American Richard Hamilton and teammate Kevin  
Freeman had dozens of phone messages awaiting them when the Huskies 
returned from beating Gonzaga on Saturday in the West Regional 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution was to disconnect the phone and let parents dole  
out the six tickets each player is allotted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to get caught up in that stuff,'' Freeman said.  
``You've got a lot of people who really don't know you or were your 
friend in the past. Then you've got relatives that want to fly in 
from everywhere. They can make it to Florida, but they couldn't 
make it to Hartford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman's postseason play has been a big reason why relatives  
have been able to come out of the woodwork. Huskies (32-2) are 
headed to St. Petersburg, Fla., the school's first Final Four 
appearance in 21 tries in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman had 13 points and a career-high 15 rebounds -- 10 off the  
offensive boards -- in UConn's 67-62 victory over Gonzaga to advance 
to St. Petersburg, Fla. In the final minutes, he hit two free 
throws to give UConn the lead for good at 57-55 and then iced the 
game with two more from the line with 6.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	With the game on the line, there were no butterflies. Just net.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I can have that same confidence and God will bless  
me with the same strokes to allow the ball to go in,'' Freeman said 
Monday. ``It's just a matter of focus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies, winners of the West Regional, take on Ohio State on  
Saturday. The Buckeyes (27-8) advanced to the Final Four with a 
77-74 victory over St. John's in the South Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	He was snubbed three weeks ago when it came time to pick the Big  
East's first, second or third all-conference teams, but has gotten 
accolades since with his rebounding and clutch shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman was named to the West Regional All-Tournament team. And  
his performance in the conference tournament earlier this month 
earned him Most Outstanding Player honors. 
</P>
<P>
	His award-winning efforts aren't anything out of the ordinary  
for the 6-foot-7 junior. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the incredible ability to will himself to do things,''  
said coach Jim Calhoun. ``He's done it in a humble sort of way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's leading rebounder, the muscular Freeman is averaging  
7.3 rebounds. With 12.6 points per game, he's the third-leading 
scorer behind Hamilton and flashy point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	When they've gone cold at times -- El-Amin was 0-for-12 against  
Gonzaga -- the Huskies look inside to Freemen and get results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin brings toughness. He brings it consistently,'' center  
Jake Voskuhl said. ``He's playing the best basketball right now 
that he's played since he's been here. The sky's the limit for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman and the 6-11 Voskuhl have played together for three  
years, and with the addition of 6-8 sophomore Edmund Saunders, are 
formidable in the post. 
</P>
<P>
	They decided early on in the second half of the Gonzaga game to  
get every rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at Kevin, Kevin looked at me,'' Voskuhl said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies went on to get 10 second-chance points in the last  
eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the communication, especially with me and Jake down  
low, is something that develops over time. We have a natural 
bond,'' Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he's put the Big East snub behind him and just  
tries to prove every game he's one of the top players in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people don't want to recognize it, they won't,'' he said.  
``Hopefully we'll continue to win and I'll continue to be the X 
factor that beats you.''

<HEADLINE> Wings Acquire Chelios, Samuelsson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Detroit Red Wings, strengthening their defense for a third  
straight run at a Stanley Cup title, acquired all-star defenseman 
Chris Chelios on Tuesday from the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks will receive defenseman Anders Ericksson and  
first-round draft picks in 1999 and 2000, according to a lawyer 
familiar with the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios had eight goals and 26 assists in 65 games this season.  
He is a key addition to the Red Wings' defense, which has been 
depleted by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as a quality two-way defenseman who will add toughness to  
the Red Wings, the 37-year-old has been the subject of trade rumors 
much of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman in 1989,  
1993 and 1996 and has played in nine All-Star games. Chelios has 
164 goals and 632 assists in 1061 career games. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios has spent the last nine seasons in Chicago after being  
traded from Montreal along with a second-round draft pick in 1990 
for Denis Savard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ericksson is in his second NHL season. The former first-round  
pick in 1993 has two goals and 10 assists in 61 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wings also acquired injured defenseman Ulf Samuelsson from  
the New York Rangers. Samuelsson, an unrestricted free agent on 
July 1, is out two to three weeks with a broken foot but is 
expected to be back for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelsson is in his third season with the Rangers. He has four  
goals and has eight assists in 67 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers reportedly will received a second- and third-round  
draft pick in return.

<HEADLINE> Paul Wilson Is Out for the Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Poor Paul Wilson. Now that his shoulder finally has healed, his  
elbow gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who hasn't pitched a major league game since  
reconstructive shoulder surgery in November 1996, needs 
reconstructive elbow surgery and will miss this season and possibly 
a significant part of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career is not over, I haven't given up,'' Wilson said today  
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. ``I'm still a relatively young man. It's 
going to take more than this to beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury means all three of the young pitchers touted by the  
Mets in the late 1990s needed ligaments replaced in their pitching 
elbows. Jason Isringhausen is still working his way back to the 
majors and Bill Pulsipher returned, only to be traded to Milwaukee 
last July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's very, very discouraging, as far as Paul has  
gone to come back from where he was,'' Mets general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``It's just devastating for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, examined in New York by Mets physician Dr. David  
Altcheck, intends to get a second opinion from Dr. James Andrews 
before making the final decision on surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find out everything I can about this particular kind  
of surgery,'' Wilson said. ``As I understand it there are two types 
of procedures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a right-hander who turns 26 next week, was the top pick  
in the 1994 amateur draft. He was 1-0 this spring, allowing six 
hits in nine scoreless innings with three walks and one strikeout, 
then partially tore the medial collateral ligament in his right 
elbow on Friday while warming up for his first spring start for 
Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	He pitched anyway, allowing six runs and eight hits in three  
innings, but the pain didn't go away the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many pitchers now in the major leagues who have come  
back from this,'' said Phillips, who originally thought the injury 
wasn't serious, perhaps a bone spur. ``It certainly is 12 months. 
Then you have to build up stamina and strength, then you have to 
get innings under your belt again. Hopefully, it's short of two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wilson's only major league appearances, he was 5-12 with a  
5.38 ERA for the Mets in 26 starts in 1996. He went 4-1 with a 4.52 
ERA in seven starts last season at Triple-A Norfolk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll work as hard again to do what he has to do to get  
back,'' Phillips predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, whose farm system produced Hall of Famers Tom Seaver  
and Nolan Ryan and noted pitchers such as Dwight Gooden, hasn't had 
much success of late. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen had arthroscopic shoulder and elbow surgery in  
September 1996 and a ligament replaced in his right elbow in 
January 1998. Pulsipher had reconstructive surgery on his left 
elbow in April 1996 and was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers last 
July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was especially upsetting to the Mets because Wilson  
worked so hard following the shoulder operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was crushed,'' Mets trainer Fred Hina said after talking  
with Wilson. ``Nobody sweats more than Paul Wilson.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets re-signed 25-year-old right-hander Oscar  
Henriquez, cut from the major league roster last week, to a minor 
league contract. They also traded Jonathan Guzman, an 18-year-old 
outfielder who played for New York's team in the Dominican Summer 
League last year, to Kansas City for utility player Shane Halter, 
primarily a shortstop. Halter hit .286 (6-for-21) with eight RBIs 
after hitting .221 with two homers and 13 RBIs in 265 at-bats last 
season. He also played the outfield, other infield positions and 
even pitched one inning for the Royals. Halter has been practicing 
at catcher this spring.

<HEADLINE>  Phillies' Lieberthal Feels Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Finally, Mike Lieberthal doesn't have  
to worry about his pelvic injury when he's breaking out of the 
batter's box or rounding the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Phillies catcher has been doing those things a lot  
lately. Lieberthal had two more hits Tuesday in a 5-2 loss to the 
Royals, raising his spring average to .560. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel anything really at all,'' said Lieberthal, who  
missed the final two months last season because of a stress 
``reaction'' in the pelvic area. ``I'm hitting, I'm catching, I'm 
running full speed. They said once it was gone, it would be gone 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal went on the disabled list last July 24 and didn't  
play another game until this spring. Doctors told him the injury 
would need 6-to-7 months of rest to heal, but after that it was 
very unlikely to recur. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is he healthy, Lieberthal is crushing the ball this  
spring. He's 14-for-25 with seven extra-base hits for a .920 
slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to hit during the offseason so that I was ready  
coming down here,'' Lieberthal said. ``The only thing I wasn't able 
to do during the offseason was run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal had a breakthrough season in 1997, hitting 20 homers  
and driving in 77 runs while handling the pressure of catching a 
veteran pitching staff in the midst of a 68-94 season. He had eight 
homers in 313 at-bats before getting hurt last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies manager Terry Francona expects Lieberthal to put up  
even better numbers than he did in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's as good as it's going to be,'' Francona  
said. ``I think he's better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not telling the confident Lieberthal anything he doesn't  
already know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the ability to be one of the top 2-3 catchers  
in the league, defensively and offensively,'' Lieberthal said. 
``You don't really see that many catchers in the game that give you 
both defense and offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as making the All-Star game, Lieberthal's task may be  
easier now that Charles Johnson is in the American League with the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	But enough pressure. Francona thinks Lieberthal will thrive in  
his new spot lower in the lineup -- probably seventh -- now that Ron 
Gant has been added to bolster the middle and protect Scott Rolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring a guy up to the big leagues and hit him fourth  
or fifth as a catcher, I think you're asking a bit much,'' Francona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting was by far the easiest adjustment Lieberthal had to make  
as an everyday big league catcher. Always confident in his 
defensive ability, he quickly learned that there's a lot more to 
calling a game and handling pitchers in the majors than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help that Lieberthal had to catch veterans like Curt  
Schilling, Danny Jackson, Terry Mulholland and Larry Anderson when 
he first came up. Suffice it to say, there were times when he 
walked out to the mound and felt very humbled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to recognize things they were doing wrong,''  
Lieberthal said. ``I knew I had to go out and talk to them, but I 
didn't know what I was going to say -- and I knew they weren't going 
to listen to what I had to say. They respected me. It's just that 
they'd been in the game 10 years and knew a lot more.''

to worry about his pelvic injury when he's breaking out of the 
batter's box or rounding the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Phillies catcher has been doing those things a lot  
lately. Lieberthal had two more hits Tuesday in a 5-2 loss to the 
Royals, raising his spring average to .560. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel anything really at all,'' said Lieberthal, who  
missed the final two months last season because of a stress 
``reaction'' in the pelvic area. ``I'm hitting, I'm catching, I'm 
running full speed. They said once it was gone, it would be gone 
forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal went on the disabled list last July 24 and didn't  
play another game until this spring. Doctors told him the injury 
would need 6-to-7 months of rest to heal, but after that it was 
very unlikely to recur. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only is he healthy, Lieberthal is crushing the ball this  
spring. He's 14-for-25 with seven extra-base hits for a .920 
slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to hit during the offseason so that I was ready  
coming down here,'' Lieberthal said. ``The only thing I wasn't able 
to do during the offseason was run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal had a breakthrough season in 1997, hitting 20 homers  
and driving in 77 runs while handling the pressure of catching a 
veteran pitching staff in the midst of a 68-94 season. He had eight 
homers in 313 at-bats before getting hurt last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies manager Terry Francona expects Lieberthal to put up  
even better numbers than he did in '97. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that's as good as it's going to be,'' Francona  
said. ``I think he's better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not telling the confident Lieberthal anything he doesn't  
already know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the ability to be one of the top 2-3 catchers  
in the league, defensively and offensively,'' Lieberthal said. 
``You don't really see that many catchers in the game that give you 
both defense and offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as making the All-Star game, Lieberthal's task may be  
easier now that Charles Johnson is in the American League with the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	But enough pressure. Francona thinks Lieberthal will thrive in  
his new spot lower in the lineup -- probably seventh -- now that Ron 
Gant has been added to bolster the middle and protect Scott Rolen. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you bring a guy up to the big leagues and hit him fourth  
or fifth as a catcher, I think you're asking a bit much,'' Francona 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting was by far the easiest adjustment Lieberthal had to make  
as an everyday big league catcher. Always confident in his 
defensive ability, he quickly learned that there's a lot more to 
calling a game and handling pitchers in the majors than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help that Lieberthal had to catch veterans like Curt  
Schilling, Danny Jackson, Terry Mulholland and Larry Anderson when 
he first came up. Suffice it to say, there were times when he 
walked out to the mound and felt very humbled. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to recognize things they were doing wrong,''  
Lieberthal said. ``I knew I had to go out and talk to them, but I 
didn't know what I was going to say -- and I knew they weren't going 
to listen to what I had to say. They respected me. It's just that 
they'd been in the game 10 years and knew a lot more.''

<HEADLINE> World Is Still Shakespeare's Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The seven Academy Awards won by the hit movie  
``Shakespeare in Love'' underscore that the Bard of the now-waning 
millennium looks set to live on in the next one, too. 
</P>
<P>
	With a spate of Shakespeare-inspired films due out for release  
this year, alongside seemingly ceaseless stage revivals and 
biographies, all the world's still Shakespeare's stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people have responded to is a very funny, very romantic,  
wonderful movie,'' American film director Michael Hoffman said of 
``Shakespeare in Love,'' which trumped the favored ``Saving Private 
Ryan'' to take the best picture Oscar on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman will open his own screen adaptation of Shakespeare's ``A  
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' starring Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline 
and Michelle Pfeiffer, this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The populist treatment of the Bard in ``Shakespeare in Love''  
gives the genre a boost by helping make Shakespeare's works more 
accessible to an audience that might formerly have been daunted by 
the very idea of characters talking in verse. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie ``certainly takes Shakespeare out of the ivory tower,  
which is really great,'' Hoffman said. ``It puts audiences in touch 
with the notion that this is popular theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What it's done is blow away the negative associations with  
period pieces,'' said Oliver Parker, who directed the 1996 film 
``Othello,'' with Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakespeare lives on, Parker said, because his stories ``are  
essentially extremely passionate. 'Othello' is one of the greatest 
love stories ever told.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't lost on the publishers of a slim volume of verse  
recently issued bearing the title, ``Shakespeare in Love: The Love 
Poetry of William Shakespeare.'' Its cover forgoes a picture of the 
Bard for one of Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow in a clinch. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Shakespeare's best-known lovers, Antony and Cleopatra,  
will feature in this summer's lineup of four productions at the 
reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theater by the River Thames 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket sales for the season are up markedly, with 20 percent  
already sold, even though the first performance is two months away. 
</P>
<P>
	And moviegoers will have a full curriculum of the Bard's  
tragedies and comedies to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
	Branagh, whose film version of ``Henry V'' more than a decade  
ago brought him Oscar nominations for best actor and best director, 
currently is shooting an adaptation of ``Love's Labors Lost,'' with 
Nathan Lane and Adrian Lester. 
</P>
<P>
	The upcoming teen movie ``10 Things I Hate About You'' is freely  
drawn from ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' Shakespeare's celebrated 
comedy about the battle between the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of ``Titus Andronicus'' is due for release this year  
starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. And a new updating of 
``Hamlet'' -- the third film version of the play this decade -- is in 
the works with Ethan Hawke as the melancholy Dane and Bill Murray 
as Polonius. 
</P>
<P>
	``The period movie is still a niche event,'' said David Aukin,  
co-chief executive of HAL, a British production company. ``To 
achieve the sort of breakthrough that 'Shakespeare in Love' has 
achieved is exceptional.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Plant Clouding Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Confirming what environmentalists have long  
contended, a federal study found that a coal-fired power plant is 
the single largest source of emissions clouding the view at the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency study found that the Mohave  
Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev., 75 miles west of the national 
landmark, does not create the majority of the haze but is the 
largest single source of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Moore, air quality program manager for the Grand Canyon  
Trust, said the study backs what the conservation group has said 
all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``Visibility at the canyon is made up of a bizillion things, but  
the largest single source of pollution contributing to visibility 
impairment at the Grand Canyon is the Mohave power plant,'' he said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cars, lawn mowers, leaf blowers and industrial plants spew  
emissions into the air that combine with dust, pollen and other 
natural material to blanket the entire Colorado River plateau, 
including Grand Canyon National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the emissions responsible for the milky haze, which  
reduces how far visitors can see and gives the naturally red rocks 
a bluish tint, actually originate in Southern California, said 
Regina Spindler, the EPA study manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that 3 percent to 21 percent of the summertime  
sulfates hanging over the Grand Canyon are emitted by the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The generating station, which can supply power to 1.5 million  
households in California, Arizona and Nevada, is operated by 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
	Nader Mansour, the manager of environmental regulations for the  
company, said Edison doesn't dispute the EPA findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it does show is under certain circumstances, it's  
possible for the plant to have a small contribution to visibility 
at the canyon,'' he said. ``I don't think that surprises anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While cleaning the plant won't instantly clear the haze, it's  
the biggest chunk of the veil that can be taken out in one place, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	After accepting public comment on the study, the EPA could force  
the owners of the generating station to clean up the plant, which 
is fueled by coal slurry pumped through a 273-mile pipeline from 
the Hopi and Navajo reservations in the northeast corner of 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of the company have already agreed to begin cleaning  
up the plant.

<HEADLINE> Gift Certificates Vary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: I received gift certificates for Christmas and now want to  
use them to buy new things for spring. Do merchants accept the same 
gift certificates online as they do at their stores? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Many merchants don't allow any crossover between their stores  
and Internet operations. 
</P>
<P>
	That means if you have a gift certificate from a Macy's or Gap  
store, it can't be used online. If you have one from 
barnesandnoble.com, it can't be used at any of the giant 
bookseller's retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	This convoluted system can be confusing. Many people see a brand  
name, such as Macy's, and assume the store and online shop are one 
in the same. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the time, it isn't so. Many online sites are  
separate from the traditional stores with which they share a name. 
Some retailers even go so far as to hire outside companies to 
handle their Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since their Internet sites are so new, they don't have systems  
in place yet that allow their regular stores to communicate with 
their Web sites,'' says Preston Gralla, author of ``The Complete 
Idiot's Guide to Online Shopping.'' ``But that doesn't make it any 
less confusing to the consumer who doesn't understand why they 
aren't interchangeable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just shoppers with gift certificates facing this  
problem. Many merchants also don't permit customers to return 
products bought online at their stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts believe all this will change as retailers  
become more savvy with their online operations. 
</P>
<P>
	One merchant that permits crossovers is 1-800-Flowers. It allows  
the same gift certificates to be used when purchasing something in 
its stores on its Web site or over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Online shoppers just type in their gift certificate serial  
number into the 1800flowers.com Web site. They then receive a 
confirmation number and can proceed with the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't spend the entire amount of the gift certificate at  
one time, a new certificate is issued to the customer for the 
remaining balance.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Software Raises Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a growth industry: Software that claims to  
protect the identity of Internet users by letting them control how 
much personal information they allow Web sites to access. 
</P>
<P>
	New technology, promoted by software makers such as Novell and  
Microsoft, is a growing part of the Internet industry's campaign to 
assure people that confidential information like their age, buying 
habits and income won't be misused by Web sites they do business 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the software products have received mixed reviews. Some  
electronic privacy advocates praise the efforts, but others fear 
the technology may actually entice Net users to divulge more 
personal data than they ordinarily would by creating a routine for 
supplying the information to online vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fairly skeptical about a lot of these so-called privacy  
technologies, because a lot of what it comes down to is 
marketing,'' said David Banisar of the Electronic Privacy 
Information Center, a Washington-based privacy advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	``You provide a lot of information into the system, but then it  
makes it easier for Web sites to obtain the information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some privacy activists said Novell Corp. may be moving in the  
right direction with a product unveiled Monday that appears to 
strike a balance between collecting information and protecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Digital Me software would let Net surfers create distinct  
online identities, allowing a user to enter a certain profile to 
show an online retailer, another to share with friends and another 
that retains anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell hopes its technology will be accepted as a standard for  
controlling personal information. Financial services giant 
Citigroup has agreed to test services based on the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Givens, project director at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a  
consumer group based in San Diego, praised the Novell software for 
allowing users to retain their anonymity. But she expressed 
concerns about making it easier for online businesses to collect 
personal information about online users. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone who participates in these services should  
think long-term about ... collection of data about themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp., for its part, bought a privacy software  
developer last year, Firefly, that makes a product that also 
encourages people to create online profiles that get sent to Web 
sites they visit. 
</P>
<P>
	The information would only be made available to Web sites that  
are certified by industry privacy watchdogs such as Trust-E or the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus' online unit, said Saul Klein, 
Microsoft's group program manager for Web platform services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft plan is intended to fit in with a broad initiative  
by the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonprofit group that sets 
standards for Internet technology to create a common way for Web 
sites and users to control the information they share with online 
companies. But Klein said Microsoft hasn't yet decided how to use 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The ability of industry-supported groups to objectively police  
Web sites' privacy policies came under question Monday when 
Trust-E, which is financed partly by Microsoft, chided the company 
over a glitch in its software but took no further action. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one reason reason consumer groups say federal legislation  
is needed to prevent companies from infringing on the privacy of 
Internet users. A proliferation of software is letting businesses 
easily ``mine'' personal data about consumers by sifting through 
detailed information to more precisely target business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology can track a computer user's recently visited Web  
sites, the pages the user looked at and even the person's hobbies -- 
and then link that information to the user's name and address.

<HEADLINE> Wolf Dies After Six Days in Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Free only six days, a young Mexican gray wolf was  
found dead along a highway near the Arizona-New Mexico line. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-month-old wolf, found Sunday by a motorist, was set free  
March 15 along with another female pup and two adults, federal 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Stuart, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman in  
Albuquerque, N.M., said the wolf was found along Highway 191, 16 
miles north of the ranching community of Clifton. 
</P>
<P>
	He said officials did not know how the wolf died. The body was  
sent to Oregon for lab tests, results of which should be available 
in about three weeks, Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead wolf was found just two miles from the acclimation pen  
where she and the rest of the family group had spent two months 
before being released in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The three other wolves will remain free, Stuart said.  
</P>
<P>
	In all, five Mexican gray wolves, including a pair released in  
December, are free. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and  
northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near 
extinction by the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state officials began releasing wolves into the wild  
last year, but so far, the program has been off to a rocky start. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the original 11 released early last year, five were found  
shot to death, a sixth is missing and presumed dead, and the others 
had to be recaptured.

<HEADLINE> DA Gets $62,001 for Ramsey Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the JonBenet  
Ramsey slaying received an additional $62,001 Tuesday to keep 
working for up to three more months. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the action is not a signal of when the panel,  
which convened in September, will wrap up. The grand jury's term 
expires April 22, but District Attorney Alex Hunter can extend it 
for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in  
the basement of her home. No arrests have been made, and police and 
prosecutors have been accused of bungling the investigation at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	The child beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain  
under suspicion. The Ramseys maintain their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental allocation, approved by the Boulder County  
commissioners with little fanfare, means state, county and city 
agencies have spent about $1.7 million on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury proceedings are secret. But Bob Grant, the district  
attorney in nearby Adams County who has consulted with Hunter on 
the case, has speculated the grand jury could finish its work by 
mid-April.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 152.91; Nasdaq Down 51.38 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors grew  
uneasy about technology company earnings and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 152.91 at 9,737.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 26.39 at 1,270.62. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 
composite index was off 51.38 at 2,344.56. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is mounting concern about what earnings are going to  
look like in the first quarter, particularly for technology 
companies, and without tech stocks, the market's in trouble,'' said 
William Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said investors were also worried about interest rates.  
While rates were modestly lower today, with the 30-year Treasury 
bond yield down to 5.56 percent, any yield above 5.5 percent will 
disturb both the stock and bond markets, Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the credit markets were getting a flood of new bonds  
that could also push rates higher, with AT&AMP;T selling $8 billion 
worth of bonds today, and the Treasury's auction of $15 billion in 
two-year notes on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 373.84 million 
shares, up from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a Dow stock, reflected the market's concern about high-tech  
issues. It was down 13/16 at 166 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online was down 6 at 124.  
</P>
<P>
	The technology companies weren't the only ones to falter today.  
Shares of Coca-Cola fell 2 9/16 to 65 1/8 after analysts at Merrill 
Lynch said they expect volume growth to slow down due to the 
economic crises in Latin America and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average slid 2.2 percent, as  
investors locked in profits following the Nikkei average's steep 
gains last week. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets were lower amid concern over the economic  
outlook in the region. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index 
was down 2.07 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.74 percent, 
and France's CAC-40 was down 1.74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senator Wants Orioles Entourage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski and her staff  
scrambled Tuesday to secure passports on short notice for 15 
underprivileged boys so they can travel to Cuba with the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The passport office ``is trying to move heaven and earth and  
every piece of paper to help these young people go as goodwill 
ambassadors with the Orioles to Cuba,'' the Maryland Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, it would take two weeks just to get a passport. A  
waiver from the Treasury Department is required when traveling to 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a race against time,'' Mikulski said.  
</P>

	Orioles owner Peter Angelos offered to provide a plane to fly a  
group of about 100 children and about 50 chaperones from the 
Baltimore-Washington area to Cuba. Sunday's game against a Cuban 
national team will be the first in Cuba involving a major league 
team since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers scrambled during the weekend to finalize plans for  
the Cuba trip. The plane is scheduled to leave Baltimore-Washington 
International Airport on Thursday. As of Sunday, 50 youths had been 
signed up by parents who could afford the $750 per person tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some protests from Cuban Americans that the trip will  
serve only to cast a positive light on Fidel Castro's government, 
Mikulski said she believes the trip can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been a believer that exchanges based either on sports  
or culture promote understanding between nations,'' she said. 
``Perhaps a visit from the Orioles could be one more step in 
convincing Castro to ... end communism in that country.''

<HEADLINE> Prairie Dog May Become Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department said Tuesday it will  
begin a nine-month review to see if the black-tailed prairie dog, 
considered a pest by some and an imperiled critter by others, 
should be protected by the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the first  
step toward possibly protecting the historically durable rodent 
whose range extends across much of the West from Montana and the 
Dakotas to New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Gober, a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist, said the  
black-tailed prairie dog has been called ``one of the most hated 
and most loved species in the country'' and there is reason to 
believe it may need protection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gober emphasized that no decision is expected to be made  
right away on whether it should be listed as endangered or even 
threatened, a less restrictive category. He said there was not 
enough evidence of the species' decline to warrant an emergency 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Wildlife Federation had filed a petition seeking  
protection for the black-tailed prairie dog, saying the species is 
in danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Government biologists acknowledge the prairie dog numbers have  
declined dramatically for various reasons including urban sprawl, 
ranchers shooting or poisoning the animals, and a disease known as 
the sylvatic plague that has wiped out huge colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biologists say the animals have a history of rebounding  
and are among the most durable on the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to know a whole lot more before we can make a call on  
whether the species need the protection of the act,'' said Gober, 
who is based in Pierre, S.D., and is the agency's chief biologist 
dealing with prairie dog colonies. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 90-day review, the agency could determine that listing  
the species as endangered is needed, is not needed, or may be 
warranted but precluded because of considerations involving other 
species. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time there were believed to be as many as 5 billion  
black-tailed prairie dogs across the West, but there are probably 
no more than 10 million today, Gober said. As recently as three 
years ago there were 100 million to 250 million acres of prairie 
dog colonies, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Gober 
said currently there may be about 1 million acres of so-called 
``dog towns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, talk of federal protection of the pesky animals --  
small rodents closely related to squirrels -- is controversial 
throughout the West. Ranchers complain that they run rampant and 
question why they could be even considered imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
	If given protection under the Endangered Species Act, ranchers  
and developers would be required to take precautions to protect the 
animals and comply with federal regulations to protect their 
grassland habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Gober said he could not predict the impact on ranchers and  
development. 
</P>
<P>
	While prairie dogs may be considered endearing by some, they  
have been a scourge to many landowners, ranchers and developers. 
Often they burrow extensive tunnel networks, kill grass and destroy 
hay fields. Their holes pose dangers to cattle and horses, 
cattlemen complain. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, a growing number of prairie dogs have migrated  
to near metropolitan areas, their colonies forming rings around 
cities such as Denver and Lubbock, Texas, Gober said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Lubbock, a field near a local television station, has  
long been home to a large prairie dog colony. One of the city's 
parks has been dubbed ``Prairie Dog Town'' and visitors hike 
through a field full of dogs.

<HEADLINE> Smithsonian Plan Ruffles Feathers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Smithsonian Institution is using $20  
million from a California businessman and amateur big game hunter 
to renovate the National Museum of Natural History, and ruffling a 
few scientists' feathers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kenneth E. Behring Family Hall of Mammals opens,  
probably in 2003, it will replace the existing, dated displays of 
stuffed elk, gazelles and other mammals with state-of-the-art 
depictions of animals in more natural settings. It will also 
displace, at least temporarily, popular displays of birds and fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to renovate,  
including restoring the rotunda to its Beaux Arts grandeur,'' 
museum director Robert Fri said. The bird and fish displays will be 
incorporated into other exhibits or refurbished and moved elsewhere 
in the museum at some point, Fri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal documents obtained by The Associated Press show some  
Smithsonian employees challenged Fri's plans both high-handed and 
scientifically flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	One bird expert complained that affected scientists were never  
consulted before learning last July that the Bird Hall would be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's chief taxidermist, who has worked there 40 years,  
also complained about the changes to the old exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my professional opinion, to destroy the classic mammal  
dioramas ... would be a great loss to this museum and to the 
visitors' experience,'' taxidermist Francis Greenwell wrote in a 
memo to Fri last June. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Greenwell said he may have ``an antiquated  
viewpoint, but I'm entitled to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Having been here as long as I have, I'd just like to see the  
Smithsonian keep its good reputation we've had so long,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fri acknowledged the internal dissension, but said scientists'  
gripes will be resolved in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not at the expense of birds and fish, it is that  
eventually they'll have to be reinstalled elsewhere in the 
museum,'' Fri said. ``This is a 10-year-plus effort ... and when 
you make the first move, you have to move things. Some things stay 
out of commission and go back later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behring's money will help make needed repairs to some areas Fri  
calls rundown, and help replace shopworn or outdated exhibits. But 
the cash comes with strings attached -- notably that the money go 
largely for the display of mammals. 
</P>
<P>
	Behring is a California real estate developer and former  
National Football League team owner who also is an enthusiastic 
sport hunter. He pledged the $20 million in November 1997, the 
Smithsonian Institution's largest single donation by far. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the scientists here, a lot of curators, are not happy  
about this,'' said a Smithsonian marine biologist who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. ``Because a rich guy likes stuffed animals, 
we will not have a sea life hall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As noted in one of the Smithsonian's own brochures, oceans cover  
nearly 70 percent of the Earth's surface and contain 90 percent of 
the planet's living things. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum's nearly 7 million annual visitors ``won't be  
learning much about that,'' when the exhibits come down later this 
year, the biologist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some birds will be included in the new mammal exhibits, which  
Fri said will focus on evolution and ecosystems rather than 
individual specimens. A few whales or other marine mammals will 
probably also stay in the main exhibit area, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Behring's relationship with the museum made headlines last week,  
when the Humane Society of the United States criticized his attempt 
to donate the remains of an extremely rare bighorn sheep he shot on 
a hunting trip to the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Humane Society contended the Smithsonian lent its  
credibility to help its benefactor skirt the Endangered Species 
Act. Fri and other museum officials dismissed that as nonsense, and 
noted the carcass is not intended for display in the new Behring 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
	But museum officials acknowledge that Behring's interest in  
mammals affected the schedule and scope of the renovation. In 
theory, donors with particular interest in birds or fish could give 
the same sort of earmarked donation.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Issue Scraps New Bank Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bending to a public outcry over privacy  
concerns, bank regulators have scrapped proposed anti-money 
laundering rules that would have tracked the transaction patterns 
of bank customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Know Your Customer'' rules were put out for public comment  
in December by four federal banking agencies. Since then, the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. alone has received some 225,000 
e-mail messages and letters, nearly all opposing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates, conservative groups, ordinary people and the  
nation's bankers have complained that the rules would turn every 
bank teller into a spy for Big Brother. They maintained the rules 
were unconstitutional and would violate prohibitions against 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the Senate joined the deluge of criticism,  
voting 88-0 to express support for a measure directing the 
regulators to drop the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Tuesday after agency officials voted at  
open meetings, the four agencies said they had received ``an 
unprecedented number'' of comments protesting the proposal on 
privacy grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would have required banks to verify their  
customers' identities, know where their money comes from and 
determine their normal pattern of transactions. The current 
requirements for banks to report any ``suspicious'' transactions to 
law enforcement authorities would have been expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and bankers reacted swiftly and positively to the  
regulators' action. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, for example, said he was ``glad to know that there are 
regulators who will listen to real people and walk away from a bad 
idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers  
Association, said the rules would have put banks ``in the untenable 
position of invading their customers' privacy and potentially could 
have eroded public confidence in the banking industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators' decision to withdraw the proposal ``does not  
diminish in any manner our long-standing support'' for other 
federal laws designed to fight money laundering, the agencies' 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board,  
the Office of Thrift Supervision and the office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, which oversees nationally chartered banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Money launderers should not be encouraged because the ``Know  
Your Customer'' rules are being scrapped, a senior Treasury 
Department official said. The official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said the department is still engaged in ``vigorous 
enforcement'' of existing rules prohibiting money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules were designed to combat money laundering  
techniques used by drug traffickers and other criminals to hide 
illegal profits. Money laundering, which is a major concern of law 
enforcement officials, reached an estimated $30 billion in this 
country last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Laundering includes the use of wire transfers and bank drafts as  
well as ``smurfing,'' the practice of breaking down transactions 
into smaller amounts that do not have to be reported under the Bank 
Secrecy Act.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Seattle SuperSonics Vin Baker, who suffered a  
partial ligament tear of the right thumb in a game last week, was 
placed on the injured list Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star forward was averaging 13.6 points and 6.1 rebounds  
in 23 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker suffered the injury during the second quarter of Friday's  
loss at Golden State and is expected to miss four to six weeks.

<P>
	Baker isn't sure how the injury happened, saying that the  
basketball may have jammed his thumb or he may have caught it in 
another player's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	He reentered the game in the third quarter with his thumb  
heavily wrapped and also played during the first quarter of 
Sunday's loss at Denver.

<HEADLINE> Senators Demand Pressure on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of 34 senators wants Vice  
President Al Gore to press Russia's prime minister to stop his 
country's cooperation with Iran on missiles and nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter released Monday, the 34 said Prime Minister Yevgeny  
Primakov must be convinced that ``an Iran armed with nuclear 
weapons and advanced ballistic missiles is no more in Russia's 
interests than in our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to urge you to make Iranian acquisitions of Russian  
ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology an issue of the 
highest priority in these talks,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the letter was  
signed by 20 Democrats and 14 Republicans, including Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov was arriving in Washington today, with meetings set to  
begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring pressure from the United States, Russia has sold  
nuclear and missile technology partly because of the hard currency 
it brings to the suffering Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators' letter noted that both Congress and the  
administration have acted against the Russian-Iranian connection, 
but it said ``the leakage of Russian ballistic missile and nuclear 
weapons technology ... has not abated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that the Russian government's efforts to stanch  
the flow of this dangerous technology to Iran have been decidedly 
lackluster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By acquiring such technology, the senators wrote, ``Iran would  
be in a far stronger position to dominate the Persian Gulf region, 
and it would pose an immediate threat to U.S. forces in the gulf, 
to our allies throughout the Middle East and even to some locations 
in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Russia was likely to seek the right to launch  
more U.S. satellites, a major source of hard currency. It said Gore 
should tell Primakov that an increase would not be considered 
without ``a sustained comprehensive effort by the Russian 
government to shut off the flow'' of dangerous technology to Iran.

	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Sitting beside Nelson Mandela,  
Michael Jackson on Tuesday announced two concerts to raise money 
for charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop star, wearing a black military-style jacket and huge

	``He has certainly been my inspiration to want to do something  
before the end of the century,'' he said. ``I love this man very 
much and I love Africa. It is right to announce this project here 
in the very cradle of mankind, the birthplace of us all.''

	MEDIA, Pa. (AP) -- A gunman walked into a home Tuesday night and  
fatally shot three children -- two of them his own -- and critically 
injured another youth before shooting himself to death, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was believed to be an estranged boyfriend of the  
children's mother, who could only watch in horror as the shootings 
took place in front of her, Delaware County prosecutor Patrick 
Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened at about 10 p.m. in Media, a Philadelphia  
suburb and the Delaware County seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delaware County Daily Times said those killed were an  
8-year-old girl, two teen-age boys and the gunman. A 16-year-old 
girl was taken to Crozer-Chester Medical Center in critical 
condition with a bullet wound to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said the man surprised the victims sitting in either the  
television or living room. He said the gunman never aimed the gun 
at the woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence shocked residents of Media, a quiet community of  
older houses and tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two ladies crying, and the cops put them in the car  
and took them away,'' said Don Johnson, who lives a block from the 
crime scene. 
</P>

	``I been here nine years,'' Johnson said. ``Sometimes I go out

<HEADLINE> NCAA To Investigate UNLV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The NCAA made it official Tuesday, telling UNLV  
its basketball program is once again under investigation for 
possible recruiting and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
	A visit by investigators to the UNLV campus last week led to a  
letter from the NCAA notifying UNLV officials that it will launch a 
preliminary inquiry into several allegations surrounding coach Bill 
Bayno's program. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said he was apprehensive about the probe, but believes his  
program has not violated any NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never knowingly, willingly, violated any rules,'' Bayno  
said. ``I look forward to the truth coming out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation will take up to six months and could uncover  
violations other than the ones that sparked the probe, according to 
a letter from NCAA investigative chief David Price to UNLV 
president Carol Harter. 
</P>
<P>
	Harter said the university, which had a checkered relationship  
with the NCAA under former coach Jerry Tarkanian, would cooperate 
fully in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly treat this inquiry as a serious matter and will  
review each issue as soon as we are provided the appropriate 
information,'' Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno, a fourth-year coach, also pledged his cooperation.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about our program,'' he said. ``I've never had a  
problem with the NCAA anyplace I've ever been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The probe comes after a former student manager for the team  
claimed that cash payments were made on behalf of former player 
Tyrone Nesby to an auto leasing company. Mike Viellion claimed that 
he was given money from associate head coach Glenn Cyprien to make 
the payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Viellion also claimed Cyprien let center Kaspars Kambala use  
Viellion's car to run some errands while Viellion was out of town. 
Kambala wrecked and totaled the car, and Viellion feels he was 
never compensated properly for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bayno and Cyprien have denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Price, the NCAA's vice president for enforcement, also listed  
possible recruiting violations in his letter to Harter, and said 
that other violations could be uncovered as the investigation 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said he did not know what the possible recruiting  
violations might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Dirk Taitt, the NCAA director of enforcement, and another  
investigator were on the UNLV campus last week to meet with 
Viellion and UNLV officials and to look at other allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayno said the formal letter notifying UNLV of the preliminary  
inquiry was expected, calling it just another step in the process 
of resolving the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA probe is the first at UNLV since Tarkanian left in 1992  
after battling the organization for years over various allegations.

<HEADLINE> Dead Actor Was Due in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Strickland, the ``Suddenly Susan'' actor  
who apparently committed suicide by hanging himself in a motel 
room, was due in court in a drug case on the day he was found dead, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Police shed no new light Tuesday on Strickland's death, which  
was discovered Monday morning. But records reviewed in Los Angeles 
showed that he was supposed to have appeared in court there on that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was arrested Oct. 31 for cocaine possession and  
pleaded no contest on Dec. 21, records show. He was put on 
probation for three years and ordered into a rehabilitation 
program. He was due in court for a progress report on that program. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Cheung, an attorney who was representing Strickland,  
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there nothing to indicate foul play. No note was  
found, there was no indication of drugs, and Strickland did not 
place any long-distance calls from his room, Lt. Wayne Petersen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found nothing to indicate anything but a suicide,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland, 29, played the role of Todd, a music critic in NBC's  
``Suddenly Susan,'' and was in ``Forces of Nature,'' the No. 1 box 
office movie last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. and NBC said production of ``Suddenly Susan'' was  
being halted indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana Tech Eyes National Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Louisiana Tech is back in the NCAA Final Four  
for the third time this decade, a feat coach Leon Barmore thinks is 
much tougher than it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, the Lady Techsters reached the Final Four six  
times and won two titles. Barmore says women's basketball is ``10 
times better'' now. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make the Final Four now, you've done something,''  
Barmore said. ``When you win a region like this year, you've won 
the equivalent to a Final Four 10 years ago. That's how good the 
game is getting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Techsters (30-2) defeated third-seeded UCLA 88-62 to  
win the West Regional on Monday night at the Sports Arena. Amanda 
Wilson had 23 points and 12 rebounds and Monica Maxwell added 22 
points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech, the West's top seed, will meet Purdue (32-1), the  
Midwest's top seed, on Friday in San Jose. It's a rematch of last 
year's Midwest Regional final, which Tech won 72-65. Purdue beat 
Tech 71-65 in December in West Lafayette, Ind., and brings a 
30-game winning streak into the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question we're going to have to play just like this  
or even better because Purdue is really good,'' said Barmore, who 
voted for Purdue's Stephanie White-McCarty as national player of 
the year over Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I voted for White is she took a less talented team  
than Tennessee and look where they are,'' he said. ``I'm excited 
about this team (Tech) making the Final Four because this game is 
getting so good, ask Tennessee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke upset three-time defending NCAA champion Tennessee 69-63 in  
the East Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wide-open now,'' Maxwell said. ``It's anybody's  
championship to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Against UCLA, Tech trailed by 10 points in the first half before  
cranking up its running game and dominating the offensive boards 
with a 27-13 edge against the bigger Bruins. The Lady Techsters 
grabbed a total of 49 rebounds, with Wilson and Maxwell leading the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (Maxwell) took it to us,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said.  
``She'd just flash in there and do some things we hadn't seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two regional games, Wilson had 50 points and 32 rebounds and  
Maxwell totaled 31 points and 17 boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this team wouldn't be where it is if  
Monica hadn't turned her season around three weeks ago,'' Barmore 
said. ``She had not played like this all year. If she did, she'd be 
one of the top two or three players in America. She's so good right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if Amanda hadn't been doing what Monica's been doing, we'd  
be going home,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> HMOs Lead to Less Pro Bono Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The efforts of managed-care organizations to  
cut Americans' health costs may be having unplanned effects on care 
for the poor and on medical research, according to a study by an 
independent medical research foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, doctors and hospitals have charged insured  
patients enough to subsidize free or low-cost care for some people 
without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is being threatened by cost-cutting imposed in recent  
years under managed care, according to the study, which appears in 
today's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
The study was undertaken by the Washington-based Center for 
Studying Health System Change. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, many physicians may reduce or altogether  
eliminate charity care to the medically indigent,'' the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	That conclusion was challenged by Karen Ignagni, president of  
the American Association of Health Plans, who said the study 
established no cause-and-effect between managed care and lower 
levels of charity work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is market forces that have brought us to this point,''  
Ignagni said, concluding that paid medical care can no longer 
cross-subsidize the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last decade, cost-cutting by managed care systems has  
brought 3 million to 5 million Americans into health insurance 
systems who otherwise would not have had coverage because of its 
high cost, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study on charity work found that doctors who earn most of  
their income from managed care insurance systems devote less time 
to charity than other physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of uninsured is increasing, and I think we face  
serious questions about whether the health-care safety net can 
remain viable,'' said the study's lead researcher, Peter J. 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate report in the same journal raised the possibility  
that cost-cutting by managed care systems is also reducing some of 
the money available for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports compared communities where managed care is more  
common with areas where it is less in use. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither included comparable figures for earlier years, and  
Cunningham acknowledged that, without such data, ``we cannot 
conclude with certainty that access to care has eroded over time 
with the increase in managed care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The use of managed care has grown sharply in recent years in  
reaction to the rising costs of health care in America. Managed 
care includes private systems such as HMOs, preferred provider 
organizations, independent practice associations and point of 
service plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Such plans impose various limits on which doctor a patient can  
choose, set cost limits for various treatments and sometimes 
require pre-approval for certain treatments to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
	In their sample of 9,871 physicians across the country, the  
researchers found that those who received no income from managed 
care systems donated an average of 10 hours to free or reduced-cost 
medical care in the month before they were surveyed. By contrast, 
physicians who earned more than 85 percent of their income from 
managed care had donated just 5.2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found that charity care was less available  
in communities where managed care is more common than in places 
where it is less used. And, the report added, doctors in private 
practice more often provided charity care than those in larger 
groups or working for HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said possible solutions could include providing  
direct public subsidies for the indigent, expanding health-care 
insurance coverage or adjusting insurance payment rates to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas J. Reardon, president-elect of the American Medical  
Association, which has had run-ins with the managed care industry, 
said the nation should consider expanded coverage for children, tax 
deductibility for health insurance costs, tax credits and public 
vouchers for low-income people.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise Amid Stock Selloff / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury securities rose Tuesday as a steep  
selloff in the stock market freed up some cash just in time for a 
huge bond sale by AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/8 point,  
or $3.75 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, eased to 5.54 percent from 5.57 percent late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The market recovered after slumping as the pricing was announced  
for an $8 billion bond offering from AT&AMP;T, the biggest sale of 
corporate debt in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the recovery to a torrent of money fleeing  
the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 
218.68 to 9,671.83, a loss of 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds gained after two sessions of worry about how well the  
market would absorb AT&AMP;T's offering and a flood of new Treasury 
debt that will be auctioned on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose between 1/8 and 9/32 point from Monday, while intermediate 
maturities rose 5/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.44 
points to 1,285.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 4.48 percent from  
4.50 percent in Monday's auction, while the discount fell 0.1 
percentage point to 4.37 percent. Six-month yields fell to 4.52 
percent, as the discount fell 0.04 percentage point to 4.36 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields fell to 4.69 percent from 4.71 percent late  
Monday, while the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.47 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.75 percent from late Monday's rose to 4.81 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/8 to 125. The average yield to maturity 
rose to 5.18 percent from late Monday's 5.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Majerus Says He's Staying in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah basketball coach Rick Majerus is  
staying put. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus told KUTV in Salt Lake on Tuesday night that he has  
withdrawn his name from consideration for Notre Dame's vacant head 
coaching position and doesn't plan to field other offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm delighted about coming back next year, and I can say that  
with certainty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, Majerus turned down San Diego State's offer to  
take over its moribund men's basketball program. He had been San 
Diego State's No. 1 choice since Fred Trenkle announced Feb. 11 
that he was resigning at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still led the rumor list to succeed John MacLeod at Notre  
Dame, with hazy reports of meetings between Majerus and Notre Dame 
officials. Majerus had said several times that he was 99 percent 
sure he would coach at Utah next season -- with Notre Dame making up 
the other ``1 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has ruled out the Irish altogether.

<HEADLINE> Gang Indicted on Federal Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Twenty-two reputed members of a Vietnamese gang  
that police said has been shaking down Asian business owners have 
been indicted on federal racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to about a dozen suspects arrested on Monday in St.  
Louis, the FBI said it made arrests in Boston, San Jose, Calif., 
and Columbia, S.C.. Those defendants will be brought to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests are the result of a three-year investigation of the  
Black String Gang, which police said operates mostly in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, made public Monday, accuses the alleged gang  
members of crimes such as extortion, robbery and murder conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Business owners said they were shaken down and their homes  
invaded. 
</P>
<P>
	One merchant described how gang members gathered in Vietnamese  
restaurants, tying up tables by nursing cups of tea and coffee and 
ignoring pleas to pay their bills and leave. Finally, the young men 
might ask for $10 or $20 for cigarettes or other items.

<HEADLINE> Sound Bites: Audio Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``People'' (Ark 21) -- Howard Jones  

</P>
<P>
	Anyone who thinks Howard Jones was strictly an 1980s phenomenon  
should listen to his eighth and latest release, ``People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disc, covered with oval-shaped photos of HoJo fans, kicks  
off on a catchy, upbeat note with ``You're the Buddha'' and 
``Tomorrow Is Now.'' But the classically trained pianist wastes no 
time reminding us he's king of the pop ballad (who can forget 
1986's haunting ``No One Is to Blame'') with the sorrowful ``Let Me 
Be the First to Know,'' the understated ``Not One of the Lonely 
Tonight,'' and the beautiful lullaby ``Sleep My Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' richly orchestrated, grown-up sound will resonate with  
his now thirtysomething fans who discovered him in high school. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Photograph Smile'' (Fuel 2000) -- Julian Lennon  

</P>
<P>
	To call Julian Lennon's first album in seven years Beatle-esque  
would be a gross understatement. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say it's not good because it is a pleasant enough  
earful of acoustic instrumentation with poetic lyrics like, ``Wind 
through the window, come sing me a song'' from the song ``Good to 
Be Lonely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of the Fab Four would be pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	What the 35-year-old son of John Lennon and his first wife,  
Cynthia, lacks is originality. He has said he can't help it if his 
voice sounds like his legendary father's. Even so, his music 
shouldn't leave you humming Beatles' tunes. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``U2: The Best Of 1980-1990'' (Island) -- U2  

</P>
<P>
	No one deserves a greatest hits album more than the legendary  
U2. The Dublin-based, multimedia moguls have been cranking out hits 
like ``Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' ``Pride (In the Name of Love)'' and 
``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,'' since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Any self-respecting U2 fan already owns this collection, a  
ready-made party soundtrack with great sing-along value. But true 
delight is found in the limited B-sides collection, which includes 
``The Three Sunrises,'' ``Silver and Gold'' and the instrumental 
``Bass Trap.'' A couple of terrific covers, ``Everlasting Love'' 
and ``Unchained Melody,'' rounds out the mix and leaves you 
wondering why they didn't make the cut in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Second Sight'' (Out Front) -- Jami Sieber  

</P>
<P>
	Don't be intimidated by Jami Sieber's instrument of choice -- the  
electric cello. Her music is lush, dark and mysteriously beautiful. 
Time to dim the lights, light a few candles and lose yourself in 
its velvet intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell It by Heart,'' a standout on her latest effort, ``Second  
Sight,'' was composed for a documentary film about breast cancer 
scheduled to run on Public Television this fall. In fact, much of 
the album sounds like a film score, but without the predictability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sieber's cello is accompanied by congas, saxophone, accordion,  
udu and other more exotic instruments, but her richly haunting 
strings dominate. Her sound creations are not only a journey, but a 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tree of Love,'' with its poetic lyrics spoken by Sieber, sets  
you running down a trail in the middle of a forest. ``I Carry 
You,'' with backing vocals by Sieber's mother, transports you 
within the cold walls of a medieval castle. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of Peter Gabriel's ``Passion'' or ``The Mission''  
soundtrack should consider ``Second Sight'' mandatory listening. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten Year Night,'' (Red House) -- Lucy Kaplansky  

</P>
<P>
	Lucy Kaplansky may not be a household name, but it should be.  
The Chicago native's crystal-clear voice soothes like a cool breeze 
on a stifling summer day, comforts like the arms of a longtime 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest solo effort, buoyed by backing vocals from John  
Gorka, Richard Shindell and Jennifer Kimball, formerly of the 
Story, rests comfortably between alt-country and rock. Gone is the 
over-the-top twang of a couple of tracks on her last album. What 
remains is Kaplansky's passion, her unabashed truth-telling -- fresh 
eyes surveying the familiar terrain of love, relationships, 
loneliness, survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplansky says she left former partner Shawn Colvin in the 1980s  
for fear of stardom. Her steps are more assured now as she strides 
towards greatness.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Reeves Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A bad season got worse for  
Bryant Reeves on Tuesday when the Vancouver Grizzlies center 
learned he will be out indefinitely with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was listed as day to day until he sees doctors again  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-footer pulled up lame in a shootaround Monday with  
soreness in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	With Reeves hobbled and guard Doug West placed in the injured  
reserved list with a broken big right toe, the Grizzlies signed 
fee-agent Terry Dehere to a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, Vancouver's first-ever draft pick, has taken the brunt  
of criticism for the Grizzlies 5-21 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in the first season of a six-year, $65-million contract,  
he showed up to the team's training camp 40 pounds overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves missed 20 games during his first three years in the NBA,  
mostly because of knee tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> ABC Wins Ratings Week With Oscar / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After riding the Academy Awards telecast to a  
weekly Nielsen ratings victory, ABC hopes the success carries over 
to two high-profile series premieres and an unusual 12-hour 
documentary series. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC won the week with a 10.0 rating and 17 share. NBC was second  
with an 8.4 rating and 14 share, CBS had an 8.0 and 13 and Fox was 
at 5.6 and 9, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oscars had a 28.6 rating and 46 share on Sunday night. While  
this represented an 18 percent drop from 1998, when ``Titanic'' won 
best picture, it was on par with other Academy Awards telecasts 
from the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is premiering two new comedies Wednesday night, ``The Norm  
Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,'' hoping for more success than 
its last midseason replacement series -- the mystery ``Strange 
World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing a disastrous 91st place in its second week last  
Tuesday, ``Strange World'' was dumped and replaced with ``NYPD 
Blue'' reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate success of NBC's ``Providence'' in January gave  
the networks hope that a strong slate of midseason shows would pull 
them out of their doldrums. Since then, the results have been 
decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS pulled ``The Magnificent Seven'' last week following a poor  
run. NBC yanked ``Lateline'' from its schedule after a one-week 
return when it finished tied for 82nd last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two positive signs from last week: CBS's ``Payne'' finished a  
strong 12th during its premiere last week, and ``Rescue 77'' proved 
to be the WB's third most popular show for the week in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Next Monday night, ABC begins the first of its long-awaited  
documentary series, ``The Century.'' Subsequent episodes air in 
two-hour installments on April 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10. ABC spent more 
than $20 million on the project, which took several years to 
produce and was almost abandoned due to cost concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we're doing here is unprecedented,'' said ABC  
News President David Westin. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB led the three developing networks last week with a 3.2  
rating and 5 share. UPN had a 1.9 rating and 3 share. Pax TV 
benefited from reruns on rival networks to finish with an unusually 
strong 0.9 rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with an 8.0  
rating and a 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was second with 
an 7.6 and 16, while the ``CBS Evening News'' had a 6.9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of March 15-21, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``Academy Awards,'' ABC, 28.6; ``Oscar Preview 
Show,'' ABC, 18.1; ``Friends,'' NBC, 16.6; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.4; 
``Frasier'' special, 14.0; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Barbara Walters 
Special,'' ABC, 12.7; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 12.4; 
``ER,'' NBC, 12.1; ``NCAA Basketball Post-Game Show,'' CBS, 11.6.

<HEADLINE> Action in Nursing Home Cases Lags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of concern about the quality of  
care a beloved aunt was getting at a Detroit nursing home, Denise 
Bryant's worst fears came true: Her aged aunt was found dead, with 
her head and neck caught between the side rails and the mattress of 
her bed. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bryant complained to Michigan authorities, it took 13 days  
for an initial investigation, which found no wrongdoing by the 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigator did not even interview any of the staff or  
residents at the home. I call it a 'drive-by' investigation,'' 
Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was another five months before a follow-up investigation  
Bryant demanded found that several beds at the nursing home had 
dangerous gaps between their rails and mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other current residents were at current risk due to the same  
problem,'' Bryant told senators at a hearing Monday. ``Complaints 
must be acted upon immediately and not months later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a new report from congressional auditors, Byrant's  
experience is not unusual. The General Accounting Office found that 
``serious complaints alleging that nursing home residents are being 
harmed can remain uninvestigated for weeks or months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And although the federal government provides most of the money  
to states for nursing home inspections to enforce national 
standards, it has done little to ensure that complaints from 
families, residents and employees are responded to adequately, 
according to the GAO report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding in advance to the public release of the findings, the  
Clinton administration last week sent state inspection agencies a 
letter saying they now must act within 10 days to any complaint 
alleging harm to nursing home residents. In the past, inspectors 
had to meet a two-day deadline only in situations meeting a graver 
standard of posing ``immediate jeopardy'' to a resident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health and Human Services Department also will distribute  
new posters, pamphlets and videos to help educate nursing home 
residents and their families about the new standards and how to 
file complaints. The materials are scheduled to be in nursing homes 
by May. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 2000 budget, President Clinton has asked for an  
additional $60 million for enforcement of nursing home standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are troubled by what the GAO has found ... and agree that  
further refinements in our complaint process are needed,'' said 
Nancy-Ann DeParle, administrator of the HHS agency that oversees 
federal Medicaid and Medicare payments to nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO independently audited nursing home complaints in  
Maryland, Michigan and Washington, and reviewed state auditors' 
reports for 11 other states: Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New 
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when there is a complaint filed? Not very much,  
I'm sorry to say,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of 
the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, which held Monday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO auditors cited several graphic examples of serious  
complaints, like Bryant's, that should have been investigated 
quickly under the old federal two-day rule, but somehow slipped 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Kathleen Wilbur, director of Michigan's  
Department of Consumer and Industry Services, said state nursing 
home inspection agencies need more money to keep up with increasing 
demands. Nevertheless, Michigan has initiated a 30-day study of its 
complaint process and will make improvements by May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our record of timeliness on reviewing complaints is  
unacceptable,'' Wilbur said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO also found that absent federal deadlines for  
investigating any but the most serious complaints, states' own 
rules have allowed complaints that may involve significant risk of 
harm to residents to go uninvestigated for as long as six months. 
</P>
<P>
	And even where states do set strict deadlines for themselves,  
they often are not met. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, the GAO found that only one in five complaints  
classified by state authorities as serious enough to be 
investigated within 10 days were actually looked into in that 
timeframe. In Washington it was fewer than half.

<HEADLINE> IOC Denies Compensation for Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- The IOC rejected Quebec City's demand for  
compensation to cover the cost of its failed bid for the 2002 
Winter Games, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The city requested $8 million in compensation last month after  
an IOC investigation determined that some of its members received 
improper gifts from organizers of the successful bid by Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec officials said the request was turned down by IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who wrote that there were no 
grounds for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec City's mayor, Jean-Paul L'Allier, told a city council  
meeting that he never expected the IOC would pay compensation, but 
had hoped for an expression of regret,

<HEADLINE> Iowa Hires Steve Alford As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Steve Alford liked to bump chests with  
Southwest Missouri State players when they did something exciting. 
That won't change now that he is the new coach of the Iowa 
Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess, being a young coach, I'm a little naive. I just  
thought the chest bump was something that all coaches did,'' said 
Alford, 34. ``I just think that's my passion for the game coming 
out, my excitement and enthusiasm for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who guided Southwest Missouri to the NCAA tournament's  
Sweet 16, was hired to replace Tom Davis. Davis is Iowa's 
winningest coach, but his contract was not renewed after 13 years 
in Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, of New Castle, Ind., made it clear Monday he intends to  
stay in Iowa City a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a Big Ten person. Now I am in the Big Ten,'' said Alford,  
a two-time All-American who led the Hoosiers to the NCAA title in 
1987 and was the school's No. 2 career scorer with 2,438 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dream hasn't been to be at a particular school, other than  
the right timing ... spiritual issues, family issues, academic 
issues, all the way down to athletic issues,'' he said. ``I think I 
have found that here at the University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no need to be looking anywhere else. This is where I  
would like to call home for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Sam, who will join him at Iowa as an assistant, said  
that was his take on his son's new job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this could be a long-term project,'' Sam Alford said.  
``He would like it to be the final move in coaching for him. Money 
was not the top priority. I think being in the Big Ten is the big 
priority in this job. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford accepted a five-year contract that calls for a base  
salary of about $350,000 annually. He made about $188,000 at 
Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	With camps, shoe-and-clothing contracts and broadcasting  
contracts, that could swell to about $600,000, Iowa athletic 
director Bob Bowlsby said. Additional, incremental incentives will 
be negotiated that would put Alford ``in the $900,000 range,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, who led the Bears to a 22-11 mark this season, was 78-48  
at Southwest Missouri State. He began his coaching career at 
Manchester College in 1992 and took the team to the NCAA Division 
III title game in 1995 before moving on to SMS. 
</P>
<P>
	His career coaching record is 156-77 in eight seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be more excited about the future of the Iowa  
basketball program,'' said Bowlsby, who has been looking for Davis' 
replacement since he announced last April that Davis' contract 
would not be extended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over that period of time, I spoke with dozens of people about  
potential basketball coaches. A few names kept coming up over and 
over and over again, and one of those was Steve Alford,'' Bowlsby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who earned a total of $419,561, was 269-140 at Iowa, but  
fell out of favor because he never won a conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes finished 20-10 this season -- their fifth straight  
20-win season -- after NCAA tourney wins over Alabama-Birmingham and 
Arkansas. Their season, and Davis' Iowa career, ended Thursday 
night when they lost 78-68 to Connecticut in the West Regional 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears beat Wisconsin and Tennessee in the first two rounds  
of tournament play before falling 78-61 to top-ranked Duke in the 
NCAA East Regional semifinal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of like match play -- Iowa advanced and I knew we  
needed to advance,'' said Alford, who said he and Bowlsby reached a 
``gentlemen's agreement'' by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said he has not yet talked to Davis, ``but I will do that  
because I respect him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said the Hawkeyes need to share his passion for the game  
while shooting for a conference title and a shot at a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's not the goal they want, then there's probably going to  
be more changes,'' Alford said. ``I'm not in the business to beg. I 
don't beg people to play or to come to the University of Iowa. 
Hopefully, the individual players that make up the team right now 
are going to have the same vision that I have. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that takes place, I don't think you'll see anybody leaving.  
If those visions differ, then I think you're going to have some 
people that may want to go the other way. I hope that's not the 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the returning Hawkeyes said they couldn't wait for next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to this. This is a great new change for  
us. I'm ready to get started,'' said forward Jacob Jaacks, who will 
be a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly how I feel. I'm just real excited to get the  
opportunity to work with him,'' guard Ryan Luehrsmann said. ``The 
other guys feel the same way. We're real (eager) about it and feel 
that he's got a great vision and we're excited to be a part of 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Sharks Acquire Habs' Damphousse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to add some offensive punch as  
they edge toward the playoffs, the San Jose Sharks acquired 
Montreal Canadiens captain Vincent Damphousse just before the trade 
deadline Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for the veteran center, Montreal will receive a  
fifth-round draft pick this year, a second-round pick in 2000 and 
future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the guy's got some darned good credentials,''  
Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi said. ``This guy has played at 
a high level and played for Team Canada, so there's more to him 
than just numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse, who becomes an unrestricted free agent July 1, had  
12 goals and 24 assists in 65 games this season. But he is still 
considered a talented face-off man and defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi, aware of concerns about Damphousse's lackluster play  
this season, said the Sharks were willing to take the chance -- 
because of his track record and because the team did not have to 
give up too much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good risk,'' Lombardi said.  
</P>
<P>
	In his 13th season, Damphousse is just seven games shy of 1,000  
career games. A two-time All-Star, he has 916 career points, 
including 340 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had four 90-point seasons, and has had at least 30 goals  
in five seasons. And he has playoff experience: He was a key member 
of the 1993 Stanley Cup-winning Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	Damphousse should join the Sharks on Wednesday, the team said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Solvents Cause Birth Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Women exposed to certain solvents on the job are  
13 times more likely to give birth to a baby with major defects, 
researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers also found an increased risk of miscarriages,  
low birth weight, fetal distress and prematurity. 
</P>
<P>
	The study looked at what are called organic solvents, which are  
used in many industries and trades. The chemicals -- found in 
paints, pesticides, adhesives, lacquers and cleaning agents -- have 
been linked to a host of physical and mental problems in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems among women exposed to organic solvents were most often  
found among those who worked in factories, as laboratory 
technicians, in graphic design or printing and as chemists, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Dr. Sohail Khattak of the Hospital for Sick  
Children in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Richard Schwarz, obstetrics consultant to the March of  
Dimes, said the study was too small to draw definite conclusions 
about the risk of birth defects. He also questioned its methods 
because the study group was selected from women who had called with 
concerns about pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said: ``It's a red-flag kind of study. We shouldn't  
ignore it. I suggest it requires a further look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers looked at 125 pregnant women who had been  
exposed to organic solvents during their first trimester between 
1987 and 1996. They were compared with 125 pregnant women not 
exposed to solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the group exposed to solvents on the job, 113 gave birth,  
eight suffered miscarriages and four had abortions. There were 13 
major birth defects and five minor ones among their babies; there 
were one major malformation and one minor one among the women not 
exposed to solvents. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the exposed group had premature births, compared with  
three in the control group. Eight babies in the exposed group were 
underweight, compared with three in the control group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen women who were exposed for more than seven months had  
labor with fetal distress that required resuscitation, while only 
one member of the control group did. 
</P>
<P>
	Khattak said such chemical exposure is avoidable. ``If proper  
precautions are taken and the guidelines for proper handling 
followed, the risk is no greater than that for the general 
population,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Khattak said his was the first study to follow women through  
their pregnancies rather than look at medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	That, he said, explains why its findings were so clear while  
previous studies on solvents and birth defects have been 
inconclusive.

<HEADLINE> It's Not End of World for Lady Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Pat Summitt's message was simple: Losing isn't the end of the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a game, and winning and losing both can be great ways to  
teach kids how to get ready for the real world,'' Summitt said 
Tuesday following the Lady Vols' loss to Duke in the NCAA East 
Regional championship the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 69-63 loss to Duke ended the Lady Vols' run at an  
unprecedented fourth straight NCAA championship and also ended the 
college careers of seniors Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing isn't something the Tennessee Lady Vols are used to,  
especially the past four seasons with Holdsclaw and Jolly. In that 
span, Tennessee is 131-17 and 21-1 in the NCAA tournament with 
three national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, since the ninth grade, Holdsclaw never has won anything  
but a championship at the end of the year. She won four straight 
New York State titles with Christ the King High School in New York 
City before entering Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Duke, Holdsclaw and the Lady Vols struggled. She tied  
her season low with eight points and was just 2-of-18 from the 
field. She cried on Summitt's shoulder after fouling out with 25.4 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	When they talked Tuesday, Summitt reminded Holdsclaw of what she  
accomplished at Tennessee -- three national championships, three 
Southeastern Conference regular-season titles, three SEC tournament 
titles and three times a first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw also leaves as the NCAA tournament's leading scorer  
and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has been the dominant team in the 1990s, making five  
trips to the Final Four and winning four national championships. 
The Lady Vols' only Final Four loss in the 1990s came in the 1995 
title game to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep things in perspective. As much as you would  
love to see them go out with a championship or with a Final Four 
experience, you have to remind yourself, and in this case them, of 
what a wonderful three, four years it's been,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Championships three out of four years ... is not bad.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee was favored to add a fourth championship and break a  
tie with Immaculata (1972-1974) and Delta State (1975-1977), the 
only other three-peat national champions. The Lady Vols returned 
all five starters and added two solid freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt lost one starter before the season began. Center  
LaShonda Stephens was forced to quit due to a degenerative knee 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup center Teresa Geter had arthroscopic surgery on her right  
knee in December and hyperextended it in January, limiting her play 
the rest of the season. That pushed freshman Michelle Snow into the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	And defensive specialist Kyra Elzy missed most of the season  
with continuing knee problems after tearing her ACL in mid-February 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee ran into more trouble in the NCAA tournament. Semeka  
Randall tore two ligaments in her left ankle, forcing her to miss 
the second round game and limiting her play in the next two. 
</P>
<P>
	When it counted, the Lady Vols looked lost at times against  
Duke. They simply didn't play the suffocating defense that helped 
them rout opponents by an average of 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The encouraging sign for Summitt was how much her Lady Vols were  
hurting in the locker room and when she talked with them Tuesday. 
She already is figuring out how to use the loss as motivation for 
next season for a group of sophomores that are 70-3 since arriving 
at Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not planning on going away,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> UConn Coach Rides Emotional Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Jim Calhoun's passion for basketball is out  
there for everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the court, life becomes more complicated for  
Connecticut's winningest coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the postseason began, Calhoun has experienced the joys of  
a first grandchild and the death of a friend. Both were much on his 
mind when the Huskies advanced to their first Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than enough to make a 56-year-old coach cry, and he  
didn't care who saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found myself more nostalgic,'' Calhoun said Tuesday. ``I  
found that tears and outward emotions don't seem to be the one 
thing that I have a problem hiding anymore or see fit to hide over 
the past couple weeks. It gives me a different perspective on a 
couple different things, particularly my own journey through this 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His trek through college basketball, as coach of Northeastern  
for 14 years and at UConn since 1986, has been a steady climb to 
the top. He has a career record of 552-257 and is the only coach in 
Division I history to have at least 250 wins at two different 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains the winningest coach at Northeastern with a 250-137  
record. On Jan. 23, he earned his 287th win at UConn, making him 
the winningest coach in school history. Saturday's win over Gonzaga 
in the West Regional title game sends Calhoun to his first Final 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few three or four days, I'm getting a much  
better feeling for what that bright light of the Final Four can 
do,'' he said. ``People get a chance to look closer at your 
program, at your career, at what our kids have achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his ``kids'' was 26-year-old Joe McGinn. A popular team  
manager from 1992-95, he had kidney disease most of his life and 
died March 9 as the team was preparing for its first-round game in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond between the two was like father and son. When doctors  
last year decided legs should be amputated, Calhoun broke the news 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most emotional thing I've ever done,'' he said.  
``Much more emotional than a Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Calhoun, born to son Jim Jr. and wife Jennifer, arrived  
during the Big east tournament and sweetened the postseason 
immeasurably for her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
	He has carried her picture in his pocket throughout the NCAA  
tournament. It doesn't take much to get Calhoun talking about 
little Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the prettiest 3 1/2-week-old child I've ever seen,'' he  
said. ``And that's said without one bit of bias. It puts your life 
into different perspective and has allowed my wife and myself to do 
this. It's a wonderful feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those feelings converged moments after the Gonzaga game as  
he struggled through tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an amazing thing,'' he said. ``I've lost a son and  
gained a granddaughter. It's an emotional time.''

<HEADLINE> Conn. Stadium Opponents File Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Opponents of the New England Patriots'  
move to Hartford filed suit Tuesday in an attempt to keep the NFL 
team out of Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed that the team, Gov. John G. Rowland, and other  
state officials violated Connecticut's constitution and did not 
give the public enough of a chance to voice their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is more than just about the Patriots,'' said Tom Sevigny,  
whose Stop the Stadium! organization is one 10 plaintiffs listed in 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have tapped into the frustration that the people have felt  
now for a very long time about their government and the way their 
government is run. They understand that they have been excluded for 
far too long in favor of corporations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Rowland, said the lawsuit comes as  
no surprise and is no threat to the stadium plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone who has seen the complaint to date feels the lawsuit  
is without merit,'' Pagani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriots spokesman Stacey James would not comment on the  
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Cochran, the lead attorney, said the General Assembly  
ignored public input before agreeing to the $374 million stadium 
deal. He also said it's unconstitutional for the state to grant 
such a lucrative deal that allows a private company to skip steps 
in permitting processes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't need our subsidy, and we don't think there's any  
constitutional power to give them our subsidy,'' Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, which also include the Connecticut Citizen  
Action Group, the Connecticut Public Interest Research Group and 
seven state residents, say they don't mind having a professional 
football team in the state. But they are opposed to the way in 
which the Patriots deal was brokered. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the lawsuit filed in Superior Court in Hartford,  
consumer advocate Ralph Nader is promising to file a federal suit 
next month to block the stadium project. 
</P>
<P>
	Before lawmakers approved the stadium spending bill in December,  
one public hearing was held on the issue. Some have said that 
hearing wasn't taken seriously by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Blumenthal, the state's Attorney General, said the  
General Assembly closed the Patriots deal by the book.

<HEADLINE> Nev. Cops Sued Over Rape Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARKS, Nev. (AP) -- After she called 911 in November to report  
that she had been raped, Jennifer W. says, police laughed at her, 
called her a liar and warned her she would have to pay for the lab 
tests if the results came back negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, last week, the man she accused pleaded guilty to raping  
her. And he also admitted raping a teen-age girl more recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Jennifer, a 24-year-old junior at the University of Nevada  
at Reno, is suing the Sparks Police Department, its chief and three 
other members of the force for more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Her federal lawsuit, filed March 17, alleges that her civil  
rights were violated and that police were negligent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wouldn't be a second victim if the Sparks police did  
their jobs instead of calling me `a goddamned liar,''' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers accused in the case and City Attorney Chet Adams  
say they cannot comment while the case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Mobly pleaded guilty to attacking Jennifer, who asked  
that her last name not be used. Mobly and his roommate, Aaron 
Cross, also pleaded guilty to charges they lured a 17-year-old girl 
to their apartment on Jan. 2 and raped her before she escaped the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are asking for 30 years in prison for Mobly and 20  
for Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer, like the 17-year-old girl, met the men through the  
Internet. Jennifer dated Mobly briefly, then tried to break it off 
via e-mail. Mobly wanted to meet, and she told him he could come to 
her parents' house, where she lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer said Mobly showed up with Cross and immediately  
attacked her, handcuffing her hands and feet, stuffing a sock in 
her mouth and putting her in a suitcase in the trunk of his car. 
Mobly later cut off her clothes and raped her. Then they drove her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thanked her for helping them live out their fantasy,''  
says her attorney, Marc Picker. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer says she told them she would call the police, but they  
told her that nobody would believe that someone had raped her and 
then taken her home. ``Little did Jenn know he was right and she 
was wrong,'' Picker says. 
</P>
<P>
	She did call police, and spent three hours being interviewed. At  
the end, officers told her they thought she was lying and 
threatened to prosecute her unless she immediately withdrew her 
complaint, Picker says. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jennifer was taken to a hospital for an examination,  
Detective David Adams allegedly told her she would be charged for 
the test if it came back negative for signs of rape. She was 
billed, but Picker says he thinks it came back positive and police 
lied. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer, a biology and psychology major, says she urged  
investigators to search Mobly's trunk for DNA evidence and her room 
for fingerprints. She says the police laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father keeps the garage as clean as the White House. He  
told them there were tire marks in the garage that he would never 
leave there and they blew him off,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Mobly even sent her a taunting e-mail: ``I got away with  
rape.'' Jennifer says she called police to tell them about it and 
got a call the next day from Sgt. Robert Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me, `You're a goddamned liar. Nobody in town believes  
you. Your parents don't believe you. You accused an innocent man of 
rape,' and he slammed the phone down on me,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later, police contacted her, saying her case was  
going to the district attorney's office because of new evidence: A 
17-year-old student who had been lured through another Internet 
liaison to Mobly and Cross' apartment had escaped an assault, 
half-naked. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer says police did not even apologize. ``I knew it was  
going to be rough, that they would ask me a lot of hard 
questions,'' she says. ``But I never imagined I would be called a 
liar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Picker says four other women have come forward with stories  
about being accused by the Sparks police of making up rape 
complaints over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer has left school and is in counseling to deal with the  
taunts she says she heard. ``I don't know why they didn't believe 
me,'' she says. ``I hope what I went through will make things 
better for other women in future cases.''

<HEADLINE> Ali Pushes Boxer Protection Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling the recent title fight between Evander  
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis ``the biggest fix in fight history,'' 
Muhammad Ali on Tuesday said he was humiliated that the sport ``had 
sunk to its lowest levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain,  
R-Ariz., Ali said ``it was clear to all who watched that the 
deciding victor of the match was England's Lennox Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heavyweight unification title fight between Holyfield and  
Lewis on March 13 in New York ended in a draw, sparking 
investigations by a New York City grand jury, a New York state 
Senate committee, the New York State Athletic Commission and the 
Nevada Gaming Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a boxing fan, introduced a bill earlier this year which  
would restrict coercive option contracts by which promoters control 
a boxers' career, such as contracts forcing a boxer into a 
long-term deal in exchange for a shot at a world title. McCain 
named the bill for Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the former three-time heavyweight boxing champion of the  
world, I believe I have the credibility to say Lennox Lewis won 
this bout without question and should have been named the clear and 
decided victor,'' Ali wrote. ``What occurred once the 12-round 
event concluded will surely go down in the boxing annals as the 
biggest fix in fight history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, Ali added his support to McCain's bill, which is  
aimed at protecting boxers from exploitation and requiring more 
openness from promoters about their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require promoters and organizers of major boxing events  
to disclose more financial information and to inform state boxing 
commissions of charges, costs and fees they take out of a boxer's 
purse. Identical legislation passed the Senate last October by 
voice vote, but the House did not take up the measure before the 
session ended. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has taken on added importance, Ali said, in  
light of the disputed draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professional boxers have for too long been the target of  
unscrupulous managers and promoters,'' Ali wrote. ``As witnessed 
(March 13), the three sanctioning organizations that award the 
title belts have joined the list of abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pray justice will be done and somehow along the way, honor  
can be restored to this sport,'' Ali added.

<HEADLINE> Lady Bulldogs Think in the Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andy Landers was in no mood Tuesday to talk about  
the teams that won't be in the women's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	So don't bring up Tennessee. Or Connecticut, either. All Landers  
cares about is the Georgia Lady Bulldogs, who did know the way to 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I'm not going to  
sit around and talk about those guys,'' Landers told reporters. 
``We're in the Final Four. If y'all want to talk about us, we'll 
talk. ... As far as UConn or Tennessee, I don't want to talk about 
them. They're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia didn't have to face UConn, the No. 1 seed in the  
Mideast. The Huskies were upset by Iowa State in the regional 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after the Lady Bulldogs routed Iowa State 89-71 in the  
regional final, three-time defending national champion Tennessee 
was upset by Duke in the East championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's loss precluded Georgia from having a chance to  
avenge three double-figure losses to the Lady Vols -- two during the 
regular season, the other in the Southeastern Conference 
tournament. Instead, the Lady Dawgs will meet Duke in the 
semifinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not concerned about who we will play. We're just excited  
to be in the Final Four,'' junior forward Angie Ball said. ``I kind 
of wish we were the team that had knocked Tennessee off. But I 
guess we have to play Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia will be playing in the Final Four for the fifth time,  
the third in the last five years. But the Lady Bulldogs have never 
won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ball and the rest of her teammates are mindful of those who came  
before them, not that Landers would let them forget. Three weeks 
ago, he invited ex-Georgia greats Teresa Edwards, Kedra 
Holland-Corn, Lady Hardmon and Stacey Ford to join the current team 
as it watched the NCAA selection show on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go back and talk about how great it would be to win for  
those players,'' Ball said. ``They're all players who could have 
won national championships. They all had the talent to do it, but 
they didn't do it for whatever reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia (27-6) didn't get much time to celebrate its trip to the  
Final Four, arriving back in Athens about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday. Some 
players even had morning classes to attend before they departed for 
Atlanta in the evening to catch a flight to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got up this morning, I wasn't too tired,'' said Kelly  
Miller, who had a 10 a.m. biology lab after scoring a career-high 
33 points in the victory over Iowa State. ``I was still on a high, 
I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her twin sister, Coco Miller, rebounded from a no-point,  
banished-to-the-bench, crying-marred regional semifinal to score 16 
points in Monday's victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt she would come back in the way she did,'' said Landers,  
who appeared perturbed at Coco Miller during Saturday's game. ``I'm 
very proud of the way she responded. It was not like Coco was being 
punished. I want to make it clear that was not it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, you take a player out and then put them back in.  
Sometimes, you take them out and things go well. We're at the point 
in the season where we're not experimenting now. We're trying to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All was forgotten and forgiven as the Lady Bulldogs advanced to  
another Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like a dream come true,'' Kelly Miller said. ``This is  
one of the reasons we came to Georgia. I'm so excited. I can't 
believe we're actually going to the Final Four.''

<HEADLINE> UN Actions in Rwanda Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed  
an independent inquiry into U.N. actions before and during the 1994 
genocide that killed more than 500,000 people in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has been blamed for helping contribute to the  
slaughter for not having warned about the potential for the 
genocide and not doing enough once it was under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan, who was head of U.N. peacekeeping operations at the time,  
said in a letter that ``questions continue to surround the actions 
of the United Nations'' immediately before and during the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, asked the  
Security Council to support an independent inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-member council has until Thursday to raise objections to  
Annan's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan said ``the primary purpose of the independent inquiry  
would be to establish the facts and to draw conclusions as to the 
response of the organization to the tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Belgian Senator Alain Destexhe, who  
spearheaded a parliamentary probe into the Belgian role in the 
massacre, urged Annan to appoint an investigative commission to 
review the U.N. role -- even if the Security Council doesn't 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council, particularly permanent council members  
France and the United States, have been faulted for having 
withdrawn U.N. peacekeepers after the bloodletting started. 
</P>
<P>
	Destexhe said an investigation is the only way to ensure that  
another such bloodbath never occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months before the genocide started on April 7, 1994, the  
United Nations received warnings that the Hutu government was 
planning a systematic campaign to kill minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the genocide ended, over 500,000 Tutsis and politically  
moderate Hutus were slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium was also blamed for having pulled its peacekeeping  
contingent from Rwanda after 10 Belgian troops were slaughtered on 
the first day of the genocide.

<HEADLINE> Police Employees Trained in Sitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Police Department didn't take the matter  
sitting down after two employees slipped off their rolling desk 
chairs and fell on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilian employees in the department's fingerprint and photo  
unit were ordered to undergo a training session on how to safely 
sit in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take hold of the arms and get control of the chair before  
sitting down,'' a supervisor said in a recent memo. 
</P>
<P>
	About 26 employees were expected to attend the half-hour session  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Department safety officer Patrick Sweeney said the chair-related  
injuries are no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
	In two cases, chairs rolled out from under employees. A third  
employee hurt her back when the adjustable seat dropped abruptly. 
One worker's injuries kept her out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people know how to sit in a chair,'' while others need  
some instruction, Sweeney said. He said he also planned to cover 
other common office hazards, such as open cabinet drawers.

<HEADLINE> ABC Plans 27-Hour Millenium Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ABC is planning a 27-hour special to mark the  
start of the year 2000, a telethon-like affair with Peter Jennings 
as the host. 
</P>
<P>
	The special will blend news and entertainment, with ABC  
correspondents stationed in different time zones to mark the 
historic entry into the new year, ABC News President David Westin 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings will be stationed in a new studio ABC is building in  
New York's Times Square. The studio, which will house ``Good 
Morning America,'' is expected to be ready in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran anchorman seemed almost insulted when asked if he  
would stay awake for the entire 27 hours, matching Jerry Lewis' 
round-the-clock performance during the annual Labor Day telethon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely,'' he said. ``The idea of being able to go from  
time zone to time zone around the world and get some sense of 
what's going on is exciting. A lot of it will be very 
celebratory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to following the New Year's celebrations, news  
organizations will be watching closely to see the immediate effect, 
if any, of the Y2K computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, NBC and Fox representatives had no comment Tuesday on how  
their networks will mark the special night. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC has spent several years, and more than $20 million, on ``The  
Century,'' a documentary series reviewing the last 100 years. It 
will run in six, two-hour segments on March 30 and April 1, 3, 5, 8 
and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Year's special won't leave Dick Clark out in the cold --  
figuratively speaking. The veteran host of ABC's ``New Year's 
Rockin' Eve'' will have some role in the New Year's special, Westin 
said.

<HEADLINE> Actor Found Dead in Las Vegas Motel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- David Strickland, who played the music critic  
on the NBC sitcom ``Suddenly Susan'' and had a role in the new 
movie ``Forces of Nature,'' was found dead in a motel room, an 
apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A worker at the Oasis Motel found Strickland's body hanging from  
a bed sheet strung from a ceiling beam Monday, motel owner Peter 
Napoli said. A chair was next to the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating the death as a suicide, police  
spokesman Steve Meriwether said. Strickland was identified by his 
publicist, Marisa McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland, 29, played the comically insecure writer Todd on  
NBC's ``Suddenly Susan,'' which stars Brooke Shields as a magazine 
writer. He had been on the show for the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland also appears in ``Forces of Nature,'' starring Sandra  
Bullock and Ben Affleck, playing the ex-boyfriend of Affleck's 
fiancee. The movie opened last week and was No. 1 at the box office 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland appeared cheerful and spoke of his future during an  
interview just a few weeks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to do a bunch of different things,'' he told  
AP Network News. ``I'd love to direct an episode next year of 
'Suddenly Susan.' I think that's the best part about the 
entertainment business. I'd even like to try to get into a garage 
band.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be 30, 38, 39 and doing something really great and  
sort of have this look back and say, 'He's worked consistently,''' 
he said. ``There's something nice about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said the company was ``deeply  
saddened by the news of David Strickland's death and our 
condolences and support go out to his family and friends.'' NBC 
spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., and moved to Pacific  
Palisades near Los Angeles while he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked on a number of student films and appeared in episodes  
of the television shows ``Roseanne'' and ``Dave's World.'' He also 
had recurring roles on ``Sister, Sister'' and ``Mad About You.''

<HEADLINE> Faulty Rudder Blamed in 737 Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Government investigators believe an  
unexpected rudder reversal on three Boeing 737s caused a pair of 
fatal accidents and nearly a third. Now the National Transportation 
Safety Board is deciding what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping up a two-day hearing into the cause of the 1994 crash  
of USAir Flight 427 outside Pittsburgh, the board members today 
were set to agree with their staff that the probable cause was a 
rudder reversal, according to sources close to the board. 
</P>
<P>
	That finding was expected to trigger up to 10 safety  
recommendations, including one urging the Boeing Co. and the 
Federal Aviation Administration to collaborate on rudder changes to 
the 737, the world's most popular airliner. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the sources said the members would decide to revise  
their admittedly vague opinion about the 1991 crash of United 
Airlines Flight 585 outside Colorado Springs, Colo. A year after 
the crash, the members said it was caused either by a rogue wind or 
a loss of a ``lateral or directional control system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was one of only four without a definitive cause in  
the board's 31-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, investigators used eerie computer simulations and  
dry investigative analysis to argue that rudder reversals not only 
explain the USAir crash, but also the United Airlines crash and a 
1996 incident in which the pilots of an Eastwind Airlines 737 
struggled to maintain control of their aircraft as they prepared to 
land in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The USAir crash killed all 132 aboard; all 25 on the United  
plane also died. 
</P>
<P>
	The rudder panel runs up the tail of an airplane and sweeps the  
nose left and right. In a reversal, a jam or misalignment in the 
controlling linkage could cause it to go in the direction opposite 
of that which the pilots intend when they press on the rudder 
pedals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those circumstances, a pilot trying to recover from a  
minor control problem -- as was the case for the crashes and the 
near-miss -- could actually make the situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rudder reversal scenario will match all three events,''  
Dennis Crider, chairman of the NTSB's Aircraft Performance Group, 
told the board members. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing withheld extensive comment until the board hearing  
concluded. ``When the facts show us an opportunity to make (the 
737) even safer, we will,'' a company statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 is the most common jetliner in commercial aviation.  
There are over 3,100 in the worldwide fleet, and at any time, there 
are over 800 in flight. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier meetings with reporters, Boeing said its own  
investigation of the three incidents has found no supporting 
physical evidence for a rudder reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a submission to the board the company mentioned the  
possibility of pilot error in the Pittsburgh crash, a powerful wind 
in the United Airlines crash and a misrigged yaw damper -- another 
element of the rudder system -- for the Eastwind incident. 
</P>
<P>
	In their presentations, the NTSB staff members rebutted those  
explanations point by point, in one instance saying the wind that 
Boeing blames for the Colorado Springs crash would have had to have 
been 36 times stronger than any similar ``wind rotor'' ever 
recorded in that city. 
</P>
<P>
	Since none of the planes had today's more informative flight  
data recorders, the board staff was forced to make assumptions in 
developing its hypotheses. That approach prompted doubts for one 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see all these assumptions, I get a little twitchy,''  
said Robert T. Francis II, the board's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The USAir crash occurred Sept. 8, 1994, as the 737 approached  
Pittsburgh after a flight from Chicago. Despite being in clear 
skies, the plane suddenly spiraled 6,000 feet into the ground, 
killing everyone aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investigators suggest a part in the rudder linkage -- a  
hydraulic valve known as the power control unit -- may have jammed, 
causing a rudder reversal. If the first officer pressed on the 
right pedal to counteract a leftward movement of the plane, he 
would have held a flip-flopped rudder in the wrong position.

<HEADLINE> It's Not End of World for Lady Vols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Pat Summitt doesn't believe that all good things  
must come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Tennessee is losing what many consider the best women's  
player ever in Chamique Holdsclaw, along with fellow senior Kellie 
Jolly. And the Lady Vols' run at a historic fourth straight NCAA 
championship ended Monday night with a 69-63 loss to Duke in the 
East Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But Summitt said the team's ``not planning on going away.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We may not have a dynasty, but trust me, we'll suit up with  
our returning players,'' she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw leaves as Tennessee's leading scorer, men's or  
women's. With Jolly, she combined to lead the Lady Vols to a 131-17 
overall, 21-1 in the NCAA tournament with three national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt said losing Holdsclaw and Jolly will affect Tennessee,  
but she pointed out that the cupboard isn't bare. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall, Tennessee's second- and  
third-leading scorers, will be juniors, along with Kristen Clement 
and Teresa Geter. Tennessee also has four recruits coming in, 
including 1999 Naismith winner Kara Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to her and guard April McDivitt, Summitt expects to have  
her first real 3-point threats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the cupboard's bare here,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Starting at a team meeting today, Summitt also plans to use  
Monday night's loss as motivation and a teaching tool for next 
season. When Holdsclaw went 2-of-18 from the floor, no one stepped 
up on offense. Tennessee's suffocating defense also disappeared as 
the Lady Vols looked lost at times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why did things turn out the way they turned out? Obviously, I  
know Duke played an extraordinary first half while we were not,'' 
Summitt said. ``Why were we not Tennessee?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's Final Four will be the first that Tennessee  
hasn't played in since 1994. In five other Final Fours this decade, 
the Lady Vols won four of their six national championships. Their 
only Final Four loss came in the 1995 title game to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means that Tennessee will remain tied with AIAW champs  
Immaculata (1972-1974) and Delta State (1975-1977) as winners of 
three straight national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt spent Tuesday calling her players, including Holdsclaw,  
who hadn't ended a season with a loss in the previous seven seasons 
through high school. Monday night, Holdsclaw cried on Summitt's 
shoulder after fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt said she reminded Holdsclaw of what she accomplished at  
Tennessee -- three All-American teams, three Southeastern Conference 
regular-season titles and three SEC tournament titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw also leaves as the NCAA tournament's career leading  
scorer and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to keep things in perspective. As much as you would  
love to see them go out with a championship or with a Final Four 
experience, you have to remind yourself, and in this case them, of 
what a wonderful three-four years it's been,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Championships three out of four years ... is not bad.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks To Dedicate DiMaggio Monument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The New York Yankees will honor Joe  
DiMaggio by erecting the fifth monument at Yankee Stadium and will 
dedicate it on April 25 prior to a game against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died on March 8, already has been honored with a  
plaque at the ballpark, dedicated to him by Mickey Mantle on June 
8, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have monuments to manager Miller Huggins (dedicated  
May 30, 1932), Lou Gehrig (July 4, 1941), Babe Ruth (April 19, 
1949) and Mantle (Aug. 24, 1996). All monuments have been dedicated 
following the death of the men they honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The monuments to Huggins, Ruth and Gehrig originally were in  
center field, in the field of play, but were moved to Monument 
Park, behind the left-field fence, when the stadium was remodeled 
in 1974-76.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Killing in Suicide Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A man whose stepdaughter's bones were  
identified last month -- 10 years after she disappeared -- apparently 
confessed to killing her in a suicide note before hanging himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``You were right -- I did it,'' said the note apparently left by  
Richard Lackey, 51, who was found dead Monday in his Hopkinsville, 
Ky., apartment. ``I had no excuse for what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note was addressed to Chelmsford police Sgt. Timothy  
O'Connor, who had been investigating the killing of Nancy Ann 
Lackey Launt, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Lackey was both the uncle and stepfather of the girl, whose  
remains were found buried near a car wash Lackey once managed in 
Chelmsford, about 25 miles northwest of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The bones were discovered by a car wash employee on Oct. 24 and  
identified in February through dental records and DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lackey's letter did not say how or why the girl was killed, but  
it indicated drinking may have played a role, Middlesex District 
Attorney Martha Coakley said Tuesday. Investigators are trying to 
confirm the letter was written by Lackey and still consider the 
case open. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the way Nancy's body was buried was similar to  
the way that Lackey hid the body of his fiancee, Janeal Bason, in 
1968. Lackey pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in her 
death and served eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in court that he and Ms. Bason were arguing when he  
grabbed her by the throat and she fell, hitting her head on a 
concrete slab. He buried her body in a shallow grave in the woods 
and covered it with debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Lackey's body was discovered by his wife, Marie, when she  
returned home from work Monday afternoon. He apparently had hanged 
himself in the bathroom of their apartment in western Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie Lackey was Nancy's mother and had been previously married  
to Richard Lackey's brother.

<HEADLINE> Crude Falls Despite OPEC Deal Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crude and its products fell on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday despite official ratification of an 
agreement by some of the world's top oil producers to slash output. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants said a decision by the Organization of the  
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to cut daily 
output some 2.1 million barrels already had been factored into the 
market. Some suggested prices may be move substantially higher 
again until there are clear indications the cuts are being adhered 
to over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	May crude fell 23 cents to $15.51 a barrel; April heating oil  
fell .73 cent to 41.66 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline fell 
.51 cent to 48.91 cents a gallon; April natural gas fell 1.5 cent 
to $1.754 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in May  
fell 15 cents to $13.73 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	After markets closed, the API reported that U.S. crude oil  
supply in the week ended March 19 rose by 823,000 barrels to 
337.909 million barrels from 337.086 barrels a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline stocks fell by 4.792 million barrels to 221.427 million  
barrels from 226.219 million barrels. Refineries were operating at 
91.5 percent capacity, compared to 93.3 percent the week before.

<HEADLINE> 'Fatal Vision' Case To Get DNA Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- The former Army doctor whose murder  
conviction inspired the ``Fatal Vision'' book and movie has 
insisted for years that a band of drug-addled hippies killed his 
pregnant wife and two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court set ground rules Tuesday for DNA testing that  
Jeffrey MacDonald hopes will back up his claim, 29 years after the 
three were bludgeoned and stabbed to death in their Fort Bragg 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government's case is predicated on there's no evidence of  
the presence of outside assailants,'' MacDonald said by telephone 
from a Sheridan, Ore., prison. ``There were other people in the 
apartment that night murdering my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA testing, which was not available during MacDonald's 1979  
trial, is the latest attempt by the former Green Beret to win a new 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge James Fox ruled that an independent  
lab would perform the tests and told lawyers on both sides they had 
two weeks to pick one. The lab also will determine which samples of 
blood, hair and fibers from the crime scene will be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox refused requests by MacDonald lawyer Barry Scheck to allow a  
third party or defense team representative to oversee the unsealing 
of evidence stored at the FBI's crime lab in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheck, a forensics expert, helped win acquittal for O.J.  
Simpson during a criminal trial for the 1994 killings of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. A civil jury later found Simpson 
liable in the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald, 55, is serving three life sentences for killing his  
wife, Colette, and daughters Kimberly and Kristen on Feb. 17, 1970. 
He claims hippies attacked his family, chanting ``Acid is groovy. 
Kill the pigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he's innocent. Science will speak,'' said Andrew  
Good, a Boston defense attorney who is working for MacDonald 
without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox said the DNA tests carried risks for the defense, since the  
results could present new evidence pointing to MacDonald's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Brian Murtagh, who handled the original trial and was  
the government's lead lawyer at Tuesday's hearing, said a hair 
found on a bloodstained bed in the MacDonald home has not 
previously been tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Murtagh said MacDonald has denied having any contact with a  
blood-stained sheet in the master bedroom of the family's home. But 
if blood or hair samples taken from the sheet prove to be his, it 
could corroborate the case against him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitochondrial DNA tests, which have identified the remains of  
missing servicemen and the family of Czar Nicholas II in Russia, 
could be helpful in finding a new suspect, Scheck said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test results ``could come back to some killer or serial  
killer or could return to some unsolved murder that occurred while 
Mr. MacDonald was in jail,'' Scheck said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court allowed the DNA tests while rejecting  
MacDonald's effort to reopen his case on the basis of his claim 
that the FBI misled the courts about fiber evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald had argued that blond synthetic fibers found in his  
wife's hair brush came from a wig one of the hippies wore. 
</P>
<P>
	A forensic examiner at the FBI crime lab who said the fiber came  
from a doll -- not a wig -- was among a dozen FBI technicians cited 
in a 1997 Justice Department report that criticized 
evidence-handling and management problems at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The MacDonald prosecution drew widespread notice and was  
chronicled by Joe McGinniss in his best-selling book ``Fatal 
Vision,'' which was made into a television miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
	MacDonald thought he had found a sympathetic author. But  
McGinniss painted him as a cool liar and womanizer who murdered his 
family, then created a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years after the slayings, Jerry Allen Potter and  
Fred Bost wrote ``Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the MacDonald 
Murders'' in which they criticized the government's case and argued 
the Army bungled the crime scene.

<HEADLINE> MIT Report Admits Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Female faculty at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology for years were systematically shortchanged 
in areas ranging from promotions and salaries to office space and 
access to research money, according to a report issued by the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, five years in the making, found that female  
professors at MIT's School of Science suffered unintentional 
discrimination. But it also lauded administrators for taking 
several measures to address inequities once they were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that in no case was this discrimination conscious or  
deliberate,'' Science School Dean Robert Birgeneau said in the 
report. ``Indeed, it was usually totally unconscious and unknowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, the effects were real.''  
</P>
<P>
	Questions about discrimination were first raised in 1994 after  
DNA researcher Nancy Hopkins was told that a course she spent five 
years developing was being discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, along with two female colleagues, started a poll of  
tenured women in the School of Science -- one of five at MIT -- and 
found that female faculty had less office space and lower salaries 
than their male counterparts. There also were no female department 
heads, and while MIT granted raises to men who had job offers 
elsewhere, the school often just let the women leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Birgeneau investigated the claims, and worked to correct the  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, MIT has raised women's salaries an average of 20  
percent to equal the salaries of male faculty members; increased 
research money and space for women; awarded them key committee 
seats; and increased the pensions of a handful of retired women to 
what they would have been paid if the salary iniquities had not 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released on MIT's Web site this week and first  
reported on by The Boston Globe, also urges the establishment of 
committees in the other four schools at MIT and a similar effort 
involving minorities.

	Hunter began his career with the Quebec Nordiques, now the  
Avalanche. He played for the Nordiques until June 1987, when he was 
traded to the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	To get Hunter, the Avalanche gave up one of its two second-round  
picks in the upcoming 1999 entry draft in return for Washington's 
third-round pick in the 2000 entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter is the only player in NHL history to tally 300 goals and  
3,000 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he has 321 goals, 693 assists and 3,548 penalty minutes  
in 1,395 career games. His playoff totals include 41 goals, 73 
assists and 691 penalty minutes in 167 games played.

<HEADLINE> High Court Limits 'Junk Science' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave American businesses  
more ammunition to fend off product-liability lawsuits Tuesday by 
extending the reach of guidelines that let trial judges exclude 
``junk science'' as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Those guidelines, fashioned in a key 1993 decision, also apply  
to the planned testimony of all expert witnesses, the court said in 
a decision insurers predicted could play a huge role in anticipated 
lawsuits over Year 2000 computer woes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that (the 1993 ruling's) general holding ....  
applies not only to testimony based on 'scientific' knowledge, but 
also to testimony based on 'technical' and 'other specialized' 
knowledge,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for a unanimous court. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision ended a family's lawsuit against a tire  
manufacturer over a 1993 Alabama traffic accident that killed one 
person and injured seven others. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices voted 8-1 in separate ruling that a federal trial  
judge correctly barred an engineer from testifying that he believed 
a defect had caused a tire blowout and the accident. Breyer said 
the trial judge, acting in his role as gatekeeper, rightly doubted 
whether the engineer's methodology could reliably determine the 
cause of the tire's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really bad day for consumers,'' said Gerson Smoger, a  
Dallas attorney with Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. ``It 
enhances judicial power at the expense of letting juries assess the 
credibility of evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Craig Berrington, general counsel of the American Insurance  
Association, called the decision ``a sweeping victory for honest 
trials and honest decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ruling could reduce the number of anticipated  
lawsuits over Year 2000 computer problems. ``In the vast majority 
of these disputes, the expert testimony of software engineers or 
computer science experts will be essential'' to claims of alleged 
design defects, Berrington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's highest court in 1993 told judges deciding on the  
admissibility of expert evidence to consider whether the theory or 
technique had been tested, whether it was reviewed by other 
experts, its possible rate of error and whether it was generally 
accepted by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines, aimed at ensuring that planned testimony is both  
relevant and reliable, apply directly to federal courts only but 
most state courts model their rules after their federal 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial judge trying to decide whether to admit the testimony of  
a nonscientific expert witness -- such as an engineer or computer 
software designer -- ``may consider one or more of the specific 
factors ... when doing so will help determine that testimony's 
reliability,'' Breyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ruling also emphasized that trial judges have broad  
discretion in making such determinations and that appeals courts 
can overrule them only if they find an ``abuse of discretion'' -- a 
legal standard difficult to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond engineers, the decision did not attempt to pin down just  
what expert witnesses might be affected. ``We can neither rule out, 
nor rule in, for all cases and for all time the applicability of 
the (1993 guidelines),'' Breyer said. ``Too much depends upon the 
particular circumstances of the particular case at issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Alabama case, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had  
ruled that the 1993 guidelines do not apply to nonscientific 
testimony. Its ruling gave the Patrick Carmichael family another 
chance to show that engineer David Carlson's testimony should have 
been allowed in their lawsuit against the Kumho Tire Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's ruling said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	Breyer said the trial court ``decision in this case -- not to  
admit certain expert testimony -- was within its discretion and 
therefore lawful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Carmichael family member was killed and seven were injured  
when one of a minivan's tires blew failed, the driver lost control 
and the van overturned in Baldwin County, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens agreed that the rules for scientific  
testimony apply to nonscientific testimony as well, but said the 
11th Circuit court should first decide whether the trial judge 
correctly excluded the engineer's planned testimony.
