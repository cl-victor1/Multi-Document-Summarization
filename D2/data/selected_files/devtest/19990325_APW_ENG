<HEADLINE>  Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 169.55 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly Thursday, boosted  
by strong earnings reports and growing confidence that NATO air 
strikes in Kosovo would not reverberate on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology and financial services stocks led the rally.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.55 to 9,836.39, the  
blue chips' first advance after four days of losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 21.40 to 1,289.99, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 69.52 to 2,434.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell sharply earlier in the week amid fears that NATO's  
intervention in Kosovo might escalate tensions throughout eastern 
Europe, said William Sullivan, a market strategist at Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the caution and anxiety that we saw in the equities market  
on Tuesday began to dissipate yesterday and was removed today,'' 
Sullivan said. ``We now have NATO involvement, but it does not 
appear to be extreme, the bombing appears to be contained, there 
appear to be no U.S. or NATO casualties as of yet. All these things 
are helping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, recalled  
that stocks fell in advance of past military actions in Kuwait and 
Iraq, only to rise after air strikes or fighting actually began. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, ``the bombs fell in the Persian Gulf and we went up,  
because we were now dealing with reality,'' Wachtel said. ``I love 
reality; I can react to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relief over the Kosovo action allowed traders to focus on  
positive earnings news. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were boosted by a report late Wednesday that  
semiconductor maker Micron Technology had turned a profit in its 
second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, and its  
stock dropped Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, 
and its stock dropped 4 9/16 to 47 7/16 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. But other computer stocks rose. Microsoft added 8 11/16 
to 179 15/16 ahead of a stock split Friday and following reports 
that the software maker next Tuesday will start settlement 
discussions to end its antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks rose after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter posted  
first-quarter profits of $1.76 per share, far above the $1.34 
expected by analysts. Morgan Stanley stock advanced 5 1/2 to 103 7/8 
advanced on the NYSE and pulled other financial services issues 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
	American Express led the Dow components higher, climbing 5 3/8 to  
122 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financials overall, and the broker dealers in particular, have  
been hot,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; 
Co. in Boston. ``And it's a healthy sign in the market to have the 
technology leadership at least shared by the financial sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares rose in response to bullish remarks from  
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities analyst Alan Braverman. America 
Online led the group, rising 9 3/8 to 126 1/2 on the NYSE. AOL announced 
a marketing alliance with online auctioneer eBay, whose stock rose 
14 to 159 3/8 on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates rose in the credit markets as bond prices fell.  
Bonds had advanced earlier in the week as investors, concerned 
about the imminent Kosovo action, sought the safety of Treasurys. 
But many investors went back into stocks Thursday, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.58 percent from  
5.53 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported unemployment claims fell last  
week, and the National Association of Realtors said sales of 
existing homes remained near record high levels in February. 
Neither report appeared to affect stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 9-to-5 margin  
on the NYSE, where consolidated volume came to 944.81 million 
shares, up slightly from Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.27 to 604.86, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 8.80 to 712.40. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.59 to 392.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO air strikes 
on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets relaxed after early anxieties over the military  
action, and made a strong comeback following a generous interest 
rate cut by Sweden. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.68 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.94 percent.

	NATO Launches New Yugoslavia Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO planes that participated in a  
second round of U.S.-led attacks on Yugoslavia have returned safely 
to their bases tonight, the Pentagon has reported. The strikes 
involved warplanes from bases in Italy, cruise missile-launching 
Navy ships and B-2s armed with one-ton satellite-guided bombs. In a 
pointed statement of what may lie ahead for Yugoslavia, NATO 
commander Gen. Wesley Clark said the allied air campaign would 
continue as long as necessary to stop Serb aggression in Kosovo. 
``We're going to systematically and progressively attack, disrupt, 
degrade, devastate and ultimately, unless President Milosevic 
complies with the demands of the international community, we're 
going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said. 

</P>
<P>
	Congress Differs on Kosovo Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While supporting U.S. troops in the Balkans,  
members of Congress differ on what course U.S. policy should take 
next. Sen. Jesse Helms, for example, proposes to make removal of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic official U.S. policy. Sens. 
Mitch McConnell and Joseph Lieberman introduced legislation to 
earmark $25 million to arm the Kosovars to defend themselves 
against the Serbs. But Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, said he thought both were bad ideas. ``We 
should not be injecting such ideas in the middle of a military 
operation,'' he said. 

</P>
<P>
	Congress Approves 2000 Budget Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans overpowered Democrats in both  
houses of Congress tonight to win approval for their ``budget for 
the new millennium,'' a blueprint designed to showcase support for 
Social Security, the Pentagon and a new round of tax cuts. 
Democrats argued that GOP-backed tax reductions would favor the 
wealthy at the expense of the long-term health of Medicare and 
Social Security. Senate passage of the $1.74 trillion spending plan 
for the 2000 fiscal year came on a 55-44 vote. The House ratified a 
similar spending plan on a vote of 221-208.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers who killed an unarmed  
African immigrant in a barrage of 41 bullets were indicted today on 
second-degree murder charges, according to a source close to the 
case. Amadou Diallo was killed Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his Bronx 
apartment building after he was hit by 19 of the bullets. The 
killing has unleashed a wave of protests against police brutality 
and angered critics who say police officers target minorities. More 
than 800 people have been arrested at the almost-daily 
demonstrations.

	EU Leaders Work On Finance Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- European Union leaders struggled today to conclude  
almost two years of negotiations, trying to develop a fiscal plan 
enabling the EU to admit 12 new members. The overhaul of the EU's 
annual budget, $92 billion this year, is considered vital to 
bringing in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and up to nine 
other members. A tentative agreement outlined changes in 
calculating membership fees to reduce payments by Germany, the 
Netherlands, Austria and Sweden. Britain also appeared headed to 
retain its annual rebate from the EU, which compensates London for 
years of lopsided contributions.

Inc. of California and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden agreed on a common 
set of standards for the digital technology known as code division 
multiple access, or CDMA. Mobile phones and other devices based on 
the new technology should hit the market by next year.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A rice extract has been shown to be a  
powerful means of lowering cholesterol. The results of one of the 
first two U.S. studies of the substance, called Cholestin, were 
presented today at a medical conference sponsored by the American 
Heart Association. It showed that people with mildly elevated

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Geno Carlisle's 3-point play with 4.7 seconds  
capped yet another California comeback, lifting the Golden Bears to 
a 61-60 victory over Clemson to win the NIT championship. The 
Tigers had taken a 60-58 lead with 29.8 seconds left, but Carlisle 
drove the lane and scored as Tom Wideman was called for the foul. 
After a timeout, Carlisle walked to the line and swished the 
decisive free throw.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Profits Up 81 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Profit surged 81 percent at Morgan Stanley Dean  
Witter &AMP; Co. in the first quarter of its fiscal year, soaring past 
analysts' estimates, on strong trading activity and fees from 
mergers and acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprised investors welcomed the positive numbers released  
Thursday, which followed a 13 percent profit gain by Lehman 
Brothers last week. Anticipating a trend, investors bid up the 
shares of several investment houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley's shares jumped almost 6 percent, or by $5.75 to  
$104.12 1/2 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of 
Merrill Lynch, which is expected to report earnings in mid-April, 
were up $3.06 1/4 at $88.31 1/4, also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see all the securities firms with a positive rebound  
from the third and fourth quarter numbers'' of 1998, said Samuel 
Liss, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``This 
will be the highest quarterly results since last July for this 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley said it earned a record $1.04 billion, or $1.76 a  
share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with $574 million, or 
91 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue jumped 
33 percent to $5.35 billion from $4.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit from operations also came to $1.76 a share and was  
far above the average $1.34 expected by analysts surveyed by First 
Call. The company's operating results were 50 percent better than a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley's profits from its securities business surged 55  
percent to $755 million. The biggest factor in that number was the 
trading division, which was buoyed by the robust stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's recovery from last summer's hair-pulling downturn  
has restored confidence and liquidity to companies and investors. 
The Dow Jones industrial average continues to dance around the 
10,000-mark, despite the start of NATO's aerial bombardment of 
Serbian targets in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a great quarter, right on the heels of an excellent  
performance in 1998 when the environment was much tougher,'' Philip 
J. Purcell, the Morgan Stanley chairman, and John J. Mack, the 
company's president, said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley was the No. 1 stock underwriter in the first two  
months of the year, responsible for the Del Monte Foods and Perot 
Systems initial public offerings, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate takeovers were also a lucrative line. Morgan Stanley  
was involved in several large deals, including British Petroleum's 
purchase of Amoco, insurer American International Group's 
acquisition of financial services business Sun America, and drug 
wholesaler McKesson's deal with health care software provider HBO. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's asset management division reported a 40 percent  
increase in profits to $147 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Its credit and transaction services division, which includes the  
Discover credit card business, posted a 36 percent increase in 
profit to $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, the company's online trading unit, Discover  
Brokerage Direct, which is growing quickly, is considering offering 
customers after-hours trading to compete with Instinet, TradeBook 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Longer trading days are quickly becoming the norm as  
corporations branch out into foreign markets and trade their shares 
on foreign exchanges. Last month, the New York Stock Exchange 
confirmed it was also considering stretching the market's hours to 
be more competitive and give investors more liquidity.

<HEADLINE> McDougal: Husband Made Up Stories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors are bearing down on  
Whitewater figure Susan McDougal in an attempt to show they had no 
political agenda in finding out what she knew about President 
Clinton's former business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, beginning her third day on the stand today, got  
into several contentious exchanges Wednesday with prosecutor Mark 
Barrett, prompting U.S. District Judge George Howard to admonish 
her twice to answer questions directly and refrain from speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ken Starr had a plan and it was to convict me so that  
he could then get testimony against the president,'' Mrs. McDougal 
said, in response to a question from Barrett about the 1996 trial 
in which she was convicted of four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr didn't pick the 12 jurors,'' Barrett snapped.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal responded that it was Starr's office that put on  
``perjured'' testimony by prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tirelessly questioning Mrs. McDougal, Barrett had her review the  
many ways she was associated with the people or businesses that 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was authorized to investigate in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Her connections, she acknowledged, included her marriage to  
James McDougal, their ownership of Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan, 
their partnership with Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton in the Whitewater real estate venture, and her receipt of a 
fraudulent $300,000 loan in 1996 that was used in part to benefit 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI agent has linked the $300,000 loan to a $27,600 loan made  
in Clinton's name that was used to pay off Whitewater debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with two counts of criminal contempt  
and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to answer 
grand jury questions in September 1996 and again in April 1998. She 
already has served 18 months in prison on a civil contempt citation 
imposed on her by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals and then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted of  
fraud in 1996 in the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal testified that after that trial, in which she and  
her ex-husband were convicted of multiple felonies, James McDougal 
tried to persuade her to say she had an affair with Clinton so 
Starr's office could ``get'' the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim told me ... 'You don't have to say that Clinton  
pressured''' a Little Rock judge to make the $300,000 loan that 
benefited Whitewater because 'you can just say you had a sexual 
affair with Clinton,''' Mrs. McDougal told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged that McDougal, who subsequently died in prison, told  
her that ``there is a man'' in Starr's office ``named Hickman 
Ewing'' who ``believes he can get Clinton on a sex charge before 
the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the federal courthouse, Ewing took issue with her  
testimony. ``That's outrageous. I never said anything like that,'' 
he said. ``I'm positive nobody else said anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Easing Installment Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- Millions of Americans who discover they do not  
have the money to pay their tax bills may find the Internal Revenue 
Service is not playing its same old brand of hardball. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of last year's IRS reform law, numerous requirements are  
being eased so taxpayers can work out installment plans and, in 
some cases, settle large debts by offering a lower compromise 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of collecting nothing from people with an unpaid tax  
bill, we're able to collect something,'' IRS Commissioner Charles 
Rossotti said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS agents are being trained to try harder to work  
things out with taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, we asked them to go out and protect the  
government's interest,'' said Harry Manaka, IRS chief of 
collections. ``Now, we're telling our people that customer service 
and the need to protect taxpayer rights always trumps the need to 
collect money when they come in conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many taxpayers do not have the money to pay Uncle Sam but are  
not doing anything wrong. Accountants give one primary piece of 
advice: file the tax return by April 15 no matter what to avoid IRS 
late penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, for the first time, the IRS is permitting taxpayers  
to pay with several popular credit cards: American Express, 
Mastercard or Discover. Visa decided to sit out this year to see 
how the program went. 
</P>
<P>
	But paying with plastic means a steep interest rate, sometimes  
18 percent or higher. A bank loan is an alternative, but people who 
cannot get that either may turn to the IRS for an installment 
agreement at an interest rate currently running at 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this year, the IRS is guaranteeing that a taxpayer  
with a debt of $25,000 or less will be able to pay in installments 
for up to five years with little extra paperwork. Previously, the 
debt was $10,000 with a three-year payment window. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who get these installment agreements will avoid an IRS  
lien, which drastically can affect a person's credit and ability to 
get loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the incentive of the government to ruin anybody's  
credit,'' Manaka said. ``As long as a taxpayer is current, our 
incentive is to allow the payments to continue without filing a 
lien.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, under the old rules, 2.8 million taxpayers had IRS  
installment plans to pay their taxes. But some people have tax 
liability too high to pay that way, particularly those involved in 
difficult situations such as a failing business or a messy divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	For those taxpayers, the IRS has a program called ``offers in  
compromise'' in which payment for a lower amount is negotiated with 
the agency. For years, however, the program had stringent paperwork 
requirements that frequently meant people got turned down, even if 
the problem were something as simple as a missing signature. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, only 25,052 out of 105,255 offers were accepted.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were very, very finicky about only accepting what we  
considered perfect offer forms. We would reject them before we even 
started to look at the merits,'' Manaka said. ``Now, our intention 
is to work with the taxpayer and try to perfect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the IRS is expanding the financial data its agents  
will use to determine a proper tax payment compromise, such as a 
person's future earning power. Only agents trained specifically in 
negotiating these deals will handle them, instead of the 
jack-of-all-trades approach of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Brand, a former IRS compliance chief now with the KPMG  
accounting firm, said the new offer-in-compromise system should 
``at least make sure the person gets a fair hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an expectation that the IRS treat people with more  
concern about the total impact of these actions on their lives,'' 
Brand said. ``What you're trying to do is turn the individual into 
a compliant taxpayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS reform law also set up new appeals rights and other  
protections for people who find themselves owing taxes, such as a 
requirement that a judge give permission before the agency tries to 
seize someone's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest key is changing the attitude of IRS agents.  
Manaka said that will take time, but the agency has instituted a 
new system of grading performance that moves away from dollar and 
numerical collection goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to involve the taxpayer more and listen to the  
taxpayer,'' he said. ``That is a major change in philosophy.''

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Anniversary Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- Just after noon, the canned music stopped  
at the Wal-Mart and the cash registers grew silent. Some of the 
patrons bowed their heads, some closed their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The customers were real quiet,'' recalled store manager James  
Winchester on Wednesday. ``It's an odd thing in a building this 
size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A moment of silence across the county marked the one-year  
anniversary of the deaths of four students and a teacher who were 
gunned down at Westside Middle School by two schoolboys. Ten others 
were wounded. It was one of a series of school shootings that 
shocked the nation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:20 p.m., about 250 people attended a ceremony at the  
Craighead County Courthouse for students Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann 
Herring, Stephanie Johnson, all 12, and Britthney Varner, 11, and 
teacher Shannon Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	A wreath of white roses and red apples was laid in memory of  
Mrs. Wright. Four other wreaths -- decorated with a softball, 
ladybugs, frogs, yellow daffodils and ivy -- were for the students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was indeed one year ago that this horrendous thing  
happened,'' the Rev. Laird Duran said. ``Since then, our community 
has not been the same. No parent, husband or friend should have to 
experience this horrible loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the dead filed out of the courthouse and took their  
seats in the five rows of metal chairs facing the podium. Many 
wiped away tears as they prepared for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Renee Brooks, Natalie's mother, told the crowd, ``For a year we  
have basically only survived, now we must go on. ... Natalie, I 
love you, my darling. Thank you for all of the little signs you are 
still with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two students, Mitchell Johnson, now 14, and Andrew Golden, 12,  
were sentenced in August for the attack. They are to serve in a 
juvenile prison until they turn 18.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya Wants Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya didn't know it at the time,  
but he didn't need to knock down Ike Quartey in the 12th round of 
their Feb. 13 fight to retain his welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	If De La Hoya has his way, he'll know exactly where he stands  
should Oba Carr get that far with him when they meet in May for the 
WBC 147-pound crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that De La Hoya believes knowing the score makes any  
difference in how he fights the last round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always close the show,'' De La Hoya said Thursday. ``The  
fans always remember the last few rounds and that is where I want 
to dominate. Even if I'm ahead 15 points I'm going to go out there 
and try to knock a guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum are pushing the Nevada Athletic  
Commission to allow the scoring of the three ringside judges to be 
posted in the arena at the Mandalay Bay when the fighters meet May 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes in the wake of the disputed draw between  
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in their heavyweight unification 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in New York was a travesty,'' Arum said. ``And  
no one learned until the fight was over that the crime had been 
committed. I say let's watch the crime as it's occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who remained undefeated in 30 fights with his split  
decision over Quartey, said he wants to lead the way for the 
scoring of the ringside judges to be posted after each round of a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the ones who lose will be the judges who are being paid  
off,'' De La Hoya said. ``The fans can't lose. It's going to 
benefit everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has asked the Nevada commission to allow open scoring on a  
trial basis for a May 8 super batamweight title fight between WBC 
champion Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners plan to meet sometime next month to consider the  
request, although some have expressed reservations about a variety 
of scenarios that could occur under open scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to push for open scoring and with my ability and  
what I stand for in boxing, I can do it,'' De La Hoya said. ``You 
expect a good fight and a good decent decision when you go to see a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya might have benefited from open scoring in his fight  
against Quartey. De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card, 
but led by two and one on the other two going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needed to do was outbox Quartey in the final round to  
win. Instead, De La Hoya abandoned all caution and came out and 
knocked Quartey down with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of punches. All three 
judges gave him a two-point round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just instinct,'' De La Hoya said. ``My style isn't to  
survive. It's to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) will defend his WBC title for  
the ninth time against Carr, a Detroit fighter who earned his title 
shot with a win over Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey 
undercard. Also on the card is Floyd Mayweather, who will defend 
his WBC super featherweight title against Goyo Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) has lost his previous two title  
fights, against Quartey and Felix Trinidad and will be a heavy 
underdog against De La Hoya, who may fight Trinidad in a Sept. 18 
megafight if Arum and Don King can get together and agree on a 
price for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's tough to deal with  
Don King. But I'm really pushing for that fight.''

<HEADLINE> Earthgrains Co. Buys Spanish Baker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Earthgrains Co. said Thursday it will buy  
Reposteria Martinez Group, a Spanish maker of fresh-baked sweet 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of the privately held company, which had sales  
of about $80 million in 1998, is expected to double sales of 
Earthgrains's Bimbo SA snack cake division to about 35 percent of 
total net sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Bimbo, headquartered in Barcelona, already is the No. 1 branded  
packaged bread and bun producer in Spain. The acquisition means 
Bimbo becomes the branded market leader in the retail sweet-good 
segments of cake and morning goods there as well. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis-based Earthgrains operates packaged fresh-bakery and  
refrigerated-dough businesses in the U.S. and Europe. It had sales 
of $1.7 billion in fiscal 1998. Major brands include Colonial, 
Rainbo, IronKids, Earth Grains and others. 
</P>
<P>
	An Earthgrains spokesman said the company has not yet determined  
whether any layoffs are necessary for Reposteria's 1,100-person 
work force. No plants will be closed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Strongest Explosion Ever Observed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most powerful explosion ever observed -- a  
deep space eruption detected in January -- released in just seconds 
a burst of energy equal to billions of years of light from 
thousands of suns. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say in studies to be published Friday that the  
explosion, called a gamma ray burst, occurred 9 billion light-years 
from Earth. What caused the explosion is still a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is probably something to do with massive stars,'' said S.  
George Djorgovski, a California Institute of Technology astronomer. 
``The real truth is, we don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected by Italian and U.S. science  
satellites that sent an alert to a network of ground instruments 
and telescopes. Within seconds, telescopes focused on the area of 
the sky where the burst originated and captured views in visible 
light. Later, more powerful telescopes photographed the explosion's 
afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert enabled astronomers, for the first time in history, to  
capture optical views of a gamma ray burst event as the detection 
was underway. Analyzing this light helped the scientists determine 
that the burst happened about 9 billion light-years from Earth. A 
light-year is about 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	An international team of astronomers wrote a series of reports  
on their study of the gamma ray burst in two scientific journals, 
Nature and Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski, co-author of a study in Nature, said an analysis of  
light and other energy spewing from the explosion suggests that for 
a very brief instant the explosion was more luminous and energetic 
than the whole rest of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the gamma rays were emitted equally in all directions,  
their energy would correspond to 10,000 times the energy emitted by 
our sun over its entire lifetime of about 5 billion years,'' he 
said in an interview. ``Yet the burst last only a few tens of 
seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there is some evidence the energy was detected  
as a concentrated beam that was pointed at the Earth. A beam would 
give an impression of greater energy in the explosion, just as a 
flashlight beam focused on one spot appears to be brighter than an 
uncovered bulb that scatters the same amount of light in all 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the gamma ray energy were sent out in a beam, said  
Djorgovski, that would reduce the energy estimate only by a factor 
of ten to 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would still be the most powerful explosion ever observed,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts were discovered in 1967, but the phenomenon  
remains mysterious. The bursts occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, lasting for only a few milliseconds 
to a few minutes. Because of the short duration, large telescopes 
in the past could not be focused in time to catch optical views. 
The satellite alert system now makes that possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there have been more than 150 theories proposed  
to explain gamma ray bursts. The two leading ideas, he said, both 
involve massive stars. One theory proposes that the burst occurs 
when two massive stars merge and form a black hole. Another theory 
proposes that the energy eruption comes from a hypersupernova, a 
stellar explosion much larger than that of an ordinary supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is perfectly possible that the source is even stranger and  
more unusual,'' said Djorgovski, ``but the circumstantial evidence 
suggests it involves massive stars.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry, Shapiro Resolve Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry and attorney Robert Shapiro  
have resolved their legal dispute arising out of Shapiro's 
representation of the New York Yankees outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro sued Strawberry last June in Los Angeles Superior Court,  
claiming he had failed to pay about $100,000 in fees for a contract 
settlement Shapiro negotiated with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was announced in a press release from John  
Morris, Strawberry's attorney in New York, which said in part: 
``Mr. Shapiro provided valuable legal services to Mr. Strawberry at 
a time crucial to Mr. Strawberry's career, and Mr. Strawberry has 
agreed to compensate Mr. Shapiro for those services,'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers released Strawberry nearly five years ago because of  
drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said Thursday from his New York office that part of the  
resolution was a confidentiality agreement, so he couldn't comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	``By their nature, I think settlements mean everybody is  
partially happy and partially unhappy,'' Morris said. ``Darryl is 
relieved to put this behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After representing Strawberry, Shapiro served as one of the  
attorneys for O.J. Simpson in the former football player's murder 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, has also played for the New York Mets and San  
Francisco Giants in an up-and-down career marred by a federal 
conviction on tax charges and a 60-day suspension following a 
positive drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has been a model citizen with the Yankees, and is  
making a comeback this spring from colon cancer.

<HEADLINE> Relieved Garciaparra Eager To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Just one hour after rejoining the Red  
Sox, an eager Nomar Garciaparra was ready to travel with his 
teammates to a road game Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to get out there and watch,'' he said. After all, he  
had been away since Sunday when he left for Los Angeles to have his 
ailing right elbow checked by two doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was told the Red Sox weren't playing Texas in Port  
Charlotte, 45 minutes away, as he had thought. Instead, they were 
embarking on a 2 1/2-hour journey to face Philadelphia in a night game 
at Clearwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, Clearwater,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll stay here.''  
</P>
<P>
	His competitiveness tells Garciaparra to jump right back in. His  
mind, and probably his trainer and manager, tell him to be prudent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get back as soon as possible,'' Boston's star  
shortstop said. ``They're probably going to slow me down, but we're 
going to be smart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was a good day for the AL's 1997 rookie of the year  
and his teammates, who were happy to have their best offensive 
player back. One by one, they shook his hand in greeting as he 
stood in street clothes by his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled broadly as he discussed the positive medical reports  
and the possibility he'll be back at shortstop in a few days as his 
tendinitis subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was going to be bad,'' he said. ``I guess  
I've got the peace of mind to know it is OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra thinks he hurt his right elbow on a relay throw  
March 11. He had pain there before, but this was more severe. So he 
decided to see Dr. Tony Daly, the Los Angeles Clippers physician, 
on Monday, and Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Anaheim Angels physician, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly took an MRI and they looked at the results together.  
</P>
<P>
	``He showed me everything,'' Garciaparra said. ``The  
inflammation, how the tendons were intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That eased his mind. The elbow, treated with anti-inflammatory  
drugs, has begun to improve. He could play as early as Friday 
against Texas, most likely as designated hitter, and thinks he 
could return to shortstop Saturday against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hit .323 with 35 homers and a team-high 122  
RBIs last season, said he won't have to change his workout routines 
or the way he throws. He knows he may experience pain in the elbow 
in the future, but he's confident his current condition doesn't 
make the elbow more susceptible to serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess my fear all along was ... is there going to be a  
certain situation where I make this throw is it going to be my last 
throw?'' Garciaparra said. ``You don't ever want to feel you get a 
play and maybe shouldn't throw this ball because you don't know 
what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to get the injury checked before the season so he  
could have it taken care of rather than risk further problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to go into the season saying `it's still  
hurting' and not know what's wrong,'' Garciaparra said. ``We had to 
make sure and this is a good time to make sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he hasn't played the field since March 11, he's been in  
the lineup as a DH since he could swing a bat even with the 
tendinitis. He also fielded grounders in practice so he expects to 
slip comfortably into his routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Friday, the Red Sox have nine exhibition games left  
before the season opener April 5 in Kansas City. Garciaparra has no 
doubt he'll be in the starting lineup, playing shortstop with a 
clear mind and a sound elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to worry about it anymore,'' he said. ``I can go  
out there and just play my game.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rebound Moderately / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Buying of blue-chip issues led the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index made a moderate rebound today as the dollar 
edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 470.57  
points, or 3.03 percent, closing at 15,986.04. The index had shed a 
total of 863.31 points in the previous two days, including 
Wednesday's 503.63-point loss, or 3.14 percent, its second-largest 
fall this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 117.86 yen, up 0.14  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but marginally lower than its late 
New York level of 117.89 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices rallied amid continued strong foreign buying  
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was overheated recently from a technical  
perspective, but the drop over the previous two days eased those 
worries,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, general manager of the equity 
division at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's gains were led by blue-chip electronics issues,  
including Sony, Fujitsu and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 663  
million shares, compared with Wednesday's turnover of 685 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 911 to 303, with 105 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 22.34 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,255.93. 
The TOPIX lost 30.12 points, or 2.38 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar inched up against the yen as  
U.S. players covered short, or oversold positions, although trading 
remained thin since most Japanese players held back ahead of 
Japan's fiscal year end on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Most traders said the Japanese currency market reacted little to  
NATO's move, mainly because the news had already been factored in. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes were conducted after months of diplomacy  
failed to end fighting that has killed more than 2,000 people in 
the rebellious province of Kosovo and left more than 400,000 
homeless in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. currency is often regarded as a safe haven in times of  
international unrest. The dollar ranged between 117.74 yen and 
118.39 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.60 yen, up from  
128.16 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the new benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.880 percent from Wednesday's finish of 
1.945 percent, driving its price up to 99.31 yen from 98.76 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 211 bond was chosen as the new index today in  
consideration of factors such as increased trading volume and 
investor interest in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Gay Attack Trial To Open Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Seven people were dismissed Thursday as  
jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused in the 
beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection process, which began Monday, is going on behind  
closed doors. Twenty-two of 71 potential jurors have been 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to  
lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6. 
Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and 
pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold. 
The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  
not participate in Shepard's beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Holt, a 52-year-old Greek literature professor at the  
University of Wyoming, said he was relieved after being excused 
from jury selection Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laramie's small enough that if you don't know the victim, you  
at least know people who do,'' he said. ``I know some people who 
knew Shepard. I know some people close to Henderson's family. It 
sent shock waves through the town.''

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia-Upjohn Has New Antibiotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn is banking on a  
new type of antibiotic to fight bacterial infections that are 
increasingly resistant to existing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But while studies indicate the drug, Zyvox, works well, its  
success in the marketplace may be hurt by doctors who prefer to use 
older therapies first, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. officials say patients would be best  
served if doctors use Zyvox first, especially when other drugs are 
known to fail in fighting certain bacteria. The company expects to 
apply for U.S. approval for Zyvox later this year. If approved, the 
drug would be the first new class of antibiotic on the market in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bacteria have never seen an antibiotic like Zyvox,'' Gary  
Tarpley, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's vice president of discovery research, 
told analysts at a meeting in New York on Thursday. ``It is 
superior to existing drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors say a new antibiotic like Zyvox should be  
reserved for special cases, in part to slow down the time it takes 
the bugs to become resistant to the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of argument about how do you best prevent  
resistance. Do you go for the big gun and kill everything or use 
the simplest antibiotics?'' said Trish Perl, the top infection 
control officer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ``People 
don't know which strategy is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox has some unique properties, Perl said, but she thinks  
doctors may benefit from first using older drugs such as 
penicillin. ``If the patient needs the drug they will get it, but 
do you need to always use a high octane gas for your car even when 
your engine will run fine on low octane?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox is considered part of a new class of antibiotics because  
the drug attacks bacteria before the start of the bacterial growth 
cycle, earlier than other antibiotics currently available, the 
company said. The earlier that cycle is interrupted, the quicker 
the drug can restore the patient's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug can be administered orally or intravenously.  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities, said Zyvox  
presents a tough challenge for Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's marketers. If 
the drug is used the way the company wants, annual sales would 
easily surpass $1 billion; if the drug is used as a last line of 
defense, annual revenue would be significantly less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies come out with new antibiotics every few years but  
because they work similar to drugs already available, bacteria are 
more likely to become resistant to them, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 160 antibiotics are available to fight disease. But drug  
resistance is becoming a major issue in combating tuberculosis or 
certain types of hospital-based staphylococcus infections, for 
example. Many antibiotics no longer have much effect on these 
virulent organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of infectious bacteria becoming immune to all  
available antibiotics has shaken the public health community, which 
now warns doctors that overprescribing of antibiotics can hasten 
the evolution of resistant germs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several drug manufactures are working on developing new types of  
antibiotics. French drug maker Rhone Poulenc Rorer is awaiting 
federal Food and Drug Administration approval for Synercid, which 
also would be a new class of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bridgewater, N.J.-based Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's new class of  
antibiotic is still likely to face bacterial resistance, but it 
should take the microorganisms a longer time to figure a way to 
beat the drug, Perl said. ``The organisms are smarter than we 
are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Zyvox is used liberally, Perl said, bacteria could develop  
resistance quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn disputes that point, saying that the use of  
antibiotics is not the sole cause of drug resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company feels strongly that Zyvox as an early treatment is  
the appropriate strategy,'' Tarpley said. ``It doesn't seem an 
optimal strategy to use agents that patients know are resistant and 
then switch later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn closed at $59.50, up $1.37 1/2, in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Woman Held in Cyanide Mailings Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman suspected of mailing cyanide packets  
disguised as nutritional supplements to people around the country 
died Thursday at a federal medical facility in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Schoonover, 50, had been found to be terminally ill with  
cancer after her arrest in California and was sent to the Federal 
Medical Center on Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas. In 
September, doctors said she had only six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schoonover case sent a scare across the nation last August  
when she was arrested outside the post office in Marina del Rey, 
where she had allegedly stuffed cyanide packets attached to health 
supplement brochures into 100 envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said Schoonover was wearing rubber gloves, holding a  
container marked with a skull and crossbones and scooping a 
substance from the container into envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no known deaths from cyanide mailings.  
</P>
<P>
	In a van where Ms. Schoonover was living, authorities found two  
``hit lists'' naming individuals apparently targeted to receive the 
cyanide packets, postal inspectors said.

	A two-count federal complaint had been filed against Ms.  
Schoonover before prosecution was put on hold because her health.

<HEADLINE> Senators Want To Cut Co. SEC Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the stock market has boomed, the Securities  
and Exchange Commission has collected in fees from publicly traded 
companies and the securities industry nearly five times what the 
market watchdog agency needs to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Now senators of both parties want to help companies by cutting  
these fees, most of which end up in the government's general 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt on Wednesday endorsed the idea, which  
has backing from both Wall Street and politicians at a time of a 
big federal budget surplus, now at an estimated $111 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current fiscal year, the SEC is expected to take in  
$1.52 billion in securities registration, transaction and other 
fees, while its operating budget is only $337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Senate Banking  
subcommittee on securities, and Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., the 
panel's vice chairman, both called the excess fees ``a backdoor 
tax'' on companies trying to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The government should ``give money back to the taxpayers,''  
Bunning said at Wednesday's subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., another panel member, said the  
fees ``were not meant to be a tax.'' With record numbers of 
Americans investing in stocks, he said, ``It is unfair to keep the 
fees at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the full Banking  
Committee, also criticized the excess fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Grams noted, however, that there is no ``clear consensus on how  
to fix the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, Reps. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., and Robert Menendez,  
D-N.J., proposed late Wednesday a bill that would cap the amount of 
fees the SEC could collect at around $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt testified that the SEC has tried to reduce the fees by,  
for example, eliminating fees for certain types of disclosure 
forms. On Tuesday, the agency agreed to eliminate transaction fees 
on some over-the-counter stock trades -- a change Levitt said would 
save companies an estimated $15 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, ``These actions just begin to scratch the  
surface. ... We've got to force costs down'' to make the U.S. 
securities industry more competitive in the global market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association,  
said the excess fees ``drain capital from the private markets, 
removing it at the very beginning of the capital-raising process, 
and diverting it into the U.S. Treasury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real capital that could be used to fund new  
businesses, to build plants, to create jobs and to add to the 
national wealth,'' Lackritz testified.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Sign Hershiser for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Mets won the bidding war for Orel Hershiser,  
agreeing today to a $2 million, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, a 40-year-old right-hander who went to spring  
training with Cleveland, also was sought by the Chicago Cubs, 
Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said today during a news 
conference in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent pitcher Hideo  
Nomo outright to the minors. If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A 
Norfolk, the team would save Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he 
does report, the Mets will probably place Nomo on unconditional 
release waivers next Wednesday and give him only 45 days' 
termination pay, $719,262. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine appeared to be upset at the  
demotion, saying Wednesday he had told his players not to worry 
about their performance in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Valentine softened his tone but clearly remained upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``As down as I was yesterday over  
losing a player that I had a lot of sweat equity in and a guy I was 
pulling for to do well, I'm even higher that than today knowing one 
of the greatest competitors and one of the best pitchers I've ever 
seen is lined up on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract  
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. Indians manager Mike 
Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's rotation 
but was willing to keep him as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Orel had a sentimental desire to be here, and we  
wanted him to be here,'' Indians assistant general manager Mark 
Shapiro said. ``Unfortunately, we just didn't have a starting spot 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 11-10, with a 4.41  
ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who has the chance to earn $500,000 in performance  
bonuses with the Mets, has a career record of 190-133, and he 
admits he'd like to win at least 10 more to reach 200 and possibly 
improve his chances of being elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Los Angeles Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major 
league record with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was 
MVP of the NL championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 
in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Mets manager Bobby Valentine, but general 
manager Steve Phillips made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Wants Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya didn't know it at the time,  
but he didn't need to knock down Ike Quartey in the 12th round of 
their Feb. 13 fight to retain his welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	If De La Hoya has his way, he'll know exactly where he stands  
should Oba Carr get that far with him when they meet in May for the 
WBC 147-pound crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that De La Hoya believes knowing the score makes any  
difference in how he fights the last round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always close the show,'' De La Hoya said Thursday. ``The  
fans always remember the last few rounds and that is where I want 
to dominate. Even if I'm ahead 15 points I'm going to go out there 
and try to knock a guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum are pushing the Nevada Athletic  
Commission to allow the scoring of the three ringside judges to be 
posted in the arena at the Mandalay Bay when the fighters meet May 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes in the wake of the disputed draw between  
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in their heavyweight unification 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in New York was a travesty,'' Arum said. ``And  
no one learned until the fight was over that the crime had been 
committed. I say let's watch the crime as it's occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who remained undefeated in 30 fights with his split  
decision over Quartey, said he wants to lead the way for the 
scoring of the ringside judges to be posted after each round of a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the ones who lose will be the judges who are being paid  
off,'' De La Hoya said. ``The fans can't lose. It's going to 
benefit everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has asked the Nevada commission to allow open scoring on a  
trial basis for a May 8 super batamweight title fight between WBC 
champion Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners plan to meet sometime next month to consider the  
request, although some have expressed reservations about a variety 
of scenarios that could occur under open scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to push for open scoring and with my ability and  
what I stand for in boxing, I can do it,'' De La Hoya said. ``You 
expect a good fight and a good decent decision when you go to see a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya might have benefited from open scoring in his fight  
against Quartey. De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card, 
but led by two and one on the other two going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needed to do was outbox Quartey in the final round to  
win. Instead, De La Hoya abandoned all caution and came out and 
knocked Quartey down with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of punches. All three 
judges gave him a two-point round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just instinct,'' De La Hoya said. ``My style isn't to  
survive. It's to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) will defend his WBC title for  
the ninth time against Carr, a Detroit fighter who earned his title 
shot with a win over Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey 
undercard. Also on the card is Floyd Mayweather, who will defend 
his WBC super featherweight title against Goyo Vargas.

	Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) has lost his previous two title  
fights, against Quartey and Felix Trinidad and will be a heavy 
underdog against De La Hoya, who may fight Trinidad in a Sept. 18 
megafight if Arum and Don King can get together and agree on a 
price for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's tough to deal with  
Don King. But I'm really pushing for that fight.''

<HEADLINE>  Mets Sign Hershiser for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The New York Mets won the bidding war for Orel Hershiser,  
agreeing today to a $2 million, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, a 40-year-old right-hander who went to spring  
training with Cleveland, also was sought by the Chicago Cubs, 
Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said today during a news 
conference in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent pitcher Hideo  
Nomo outright to the minors. If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A 
Norfolk, the team would save Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he 
does report, the Mets will probably place Nomo on unconditional 
release waivers next Wednesday and give him only 45 days' 
termination pay, $719,262. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine appeared to be upset at the  
demotion, saying Wednesday he had told his players not to worry 
about their performance in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Valentine softened his tone but clearly remained upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``As down as I was yesterday over  
losing a player that I had a lot of sweat equity in and a guy I was 
pulling for to do well, I'm even higher that than today knowing one 
of the greatest competitors and one of the best pitchers I've ever 
seen is lined up on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract  
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. Indians manager Mike 
Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's rotation 
but was willing to keep him as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Orel had a sentimental desire to be here, and we  
wanted him to be here,'' Indians assistant general manager Mark 
Shapiro said. ``Unfortunately, we just didn't have a starting spot 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 11-10, with a 4.41  
ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who has the chance to earn $500,000 in performance  
bonuses with the Mets, has a career record of 190-133, and he 
admits he'd like to win at least 10 more to reach 200 and possibly 
improve his chances of being elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Los Angeles Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major 
league record with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was 
MVP of the NL championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 
in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Mets manager Bobby Valentine, but general 
manager Steve Phillips made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Rise by $5.02B / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds increased by $5.02 billion to $872.89 billion in the 
latest week, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
increased by $5.02 billion to $720.60 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
Tax-exempt fund assets decreased by $2.7 million to $152.29 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds decreased by $605.7  
million to $585.63 billion for the same period. Among institutional 
funds, taxable money market fund assets decreased by $940.3 million 
to $536.39 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds increased by $334.6 
million to $49.24 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.459 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.454 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell to  
4.32 percent in the week ended Tuesday compared with 4.35 percent 
the previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield held steady at 4.35 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.42 percent from 4.44  
percent in the previous week, while the 30-day compounded yield 
fell to 4.44 percent from 4.45 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds  
slipped to 61 days from 62 days during the previous week, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts remained unchanged at 2.15 
percent as of Wednesday, compared with the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.95 percent from 0.96 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield held steady  
at 4.14 percent on six-month certificates of deposit. Yields on 
1-year CDs also remained unchanged at 4.38 percent but rose to 4.47 
percent from 4.45 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs. Yields on 5-year CDs rose 
to 4.61 percent from 4.60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Worker Recalls 15-Hour Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- ``Watch out!''  
</P>
<P>
	It was the only warning Darby Patrick had before the walls of a  
sewer trench collapsed on the 27-year-old construction worker as he 
was installing pipe. He was under 5 feet of dirt, sure he was going 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was an unimaginable 15-hour ordeal for Patrick,  
trapped in the crushing soil and getting colder by the minute. For 
four hours, he could breathe only through a 15-inch pipe he grabbed 
just before the walls gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, in his first interview since the Dec. 14 accident  
in Chattanooga, Tenn., Patrick recalled the terror he felt as 
volunteers worked feverishly to free him. Uncovered first was his 
face, then his head, a shoulder, then an arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was scared to death,'' Patrick said. ``I remember thinking I  
could die any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick spoke while undergoing therapy at the Shepherd Center  
rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta. His left leg was amputated at 
the hip and his right leg suffered serious nerve damage. Kidney, 
liver and respiratory failure left him 28 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
	He now uses a wheelchair and must relearn how to dress, bathe  
and get into and out of bed. A speech therapist is checking to see 
if he suffered any brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	He has nightmares about being trapped underground.  
</P>
<P>
	``It haunts you a lot,'' Patrick said, struggling to find a  
comfortable position in his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick was part of a five-man crew laying pipe along a highway  
when the trench collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first words were, `Darby's gone,''' said Phillip Wills, who  
was operating the backhoe. ``Then we heard him yelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick was completely buried for hours, surviving thanks to the  
pipe until his face was cleared. ``I could barely move a muscle,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers pumped oxygen and medicine to him and he fell asleep,  
alarming the crew members who thought they had lost him for good. 
They talked to keep him awake, mostly asking how he was feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Above ground, a bitter wind whipped through the site and Darby  
felt the cold where he was trapped. He asked for his wife, Julie, 
and for his boss, Wills, but it wasn't safe for them to come close. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapped in blankets, Mrs. Patrick stood on the edge of the  
trench, occasionally returning to a nearby building to pray with 
the Baptist missionary who had stopped to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, Patrick joked with his rescuers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess later I was in shock,'' he said. ``I thought I was  
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he was airlifted to Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga,  
his doctors gave him only a 10 percent chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said when this happened, if anyone can survive, Darby can,''  
said Wills' wife, Betty, who has known Patrick for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a week after the accident, his body began to fail. One  
night, his head filled with fluid and swelled and a nurse said he 
likely would die before morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I lost faith,'' Mrs. Patrick said. ``But I  
wouldn't cry in front of him. I would turn around and wait until I 
left the room, then I started crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Patrick survived, fighting off infections. His doctor has  
set a tentative release date of May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to work again, and he wants to swim in a favorite lake  
near his home, take a vacation and spend time with his 17-month-old 
son, who has been clamoring for his attention. On May 17, he and 
his wife celebrate their second anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick said it was the thoughts of his wife and his child that  
helped sustain him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want my wife to be alone. I didn't want my boy to be  
alone,'' he said. ``I just held on.''

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Wants Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya didn't know it at the time,  
but he didn't need to knock down Ike Quartey in the 12th round of 
their Feb. 13 fight to retain his welterweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	If De La Hoya has his way, he'll know exactly where he stands  
should Oba Carr get that far with him when they meet in May for the 
WBC 147-pound crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that De La Hoya believes knowing the score makes any  
difference in how he fights the last round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always close the show,'' De La Hoya said Thursday. ``The  
fans always remember the last few rounds and that is where I want 
to dominate. Even if I'm ahead 15 points I'm going to go out there 
and try to knock a guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum are pushing the Nevada Athletic  
Commission to allow the scoring of the three ringside judges to be 
posted in the arena at the Mandalay Bay when the fighters meet May 
22. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes in the wake of the disputed draw between  
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in their heavyweight unification 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in New York was a travesty,'' Arum said. ``And  
no one learned until the fight was over that the crime had been 
committed. I say let's watch the crime as it's occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who remained undefeated in 30 fights with his split  
decision over Quartey, said he wants to lead the way for the 
scoring of the ringside judges to be posted after each round of a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the ones who lose will be the judges who are being paid  
off,'' De La Hoya said. ``The fans can't lose. It's going to 
benefit everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has asked the Nevada commission to allow open scoring on a  
trial basis for a May 8 super batamweight title fight between WBC 
champion Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners plan to meet sometime next month to consider the  
request, although some have expressed reservations about a variety 
of scenarios that could occur under open scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to push for open scoring and with my ability and  
what I stand for in boxing, I can do it,'' De La Hoya said. ``You 
expect a good fight and a good decent decision when you go to see a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya might have benefited from open scoring in his fight  
against Quartey. De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card, 
but led by two and one on the other two going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needed to do was outbox Quartey in the final round to  
win. Instead, De La Hoya abandoned all caution and came out and 
knocked Quartey down with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of punches. All three 
judges gave him a two-point round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just instinct,'' De La Hoya said. ``My style isn't to  
survive. It's to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) will defend his WBC title for  
the ninth time against Carr, a Detroit fighter who earned his title 
shot with a win over Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey 
undercard. Also on the card is Floyd Mayweather, who will defend 
his WBC super featherweight title against Goyo Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) has lost his previous two title  
fights, against Quartey and Felix Trinidad and will be a heavy 
underdog against De La Hoya, who may fight Trinidad in a Sept. 18 
megafight if Arum and Don King can get together and agree on a 
price for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's tough to deal with  
Don King. But I'm really pushing for that fight.''

<HEADLINE> Cal Vs. Clemson for the NIT Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The way California coach Ben Braun sees it,  
there are no bad teams playing in late March. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why he knows tonight's National Invitation Tournament  
championship game against Clemson will call for the Golden Bears' 
top performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played one of our better games because we played consistent  
throughout,'' Braun said Wednesday, the day after Cal took control 
early in the second half and beat Pac-10 rival Oregon 85-69 in 
Tuesday night's semifinals. ``This team takes pride in its 
performance and wants to go out on a winning note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Clemson, which blew a 24-point second-half lead, but  
still managed to beat Xavier 79-76 to reach the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're feeling confident right now,'' Clemson first-year coach  
Larry Shyatt said. ``Our older players don't want it to end and the 
younger players are enjoying the ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Tigers (20-14) and Golden Bears (21-11) meet for the  
first time, the winner will come away with its first NIT title. For 
Clemson, it would be the school's first basketball championship in 
60 years. California, meanwhile, has been waiting 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we didn't make the NCAA tournament, we got  
selected for the NIT and decided we would try to go out there and 
win it,'' Tigers guard Terrell McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NIT might be perceived as loser's event, but the finalists  
don't see it that way. A win would be a fitting sendoff for the 
seniors as well as providing a building block for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	For California, there's an even bigger reward for senior  
starters Francisco Elson, Thomas Kilgore, Geno Carlisle and Michael 
Gill. The foursome came to Cal two years ago knowing the school was 
facing NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy for them,'' Braun said. ``They came to our  
program and they came at a tough time. Now they have an opportunity 
to go out winners. This tournament is very important to our program 
and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Golden Bears reached the final 16 of the NCAA  
tournament, but were banned from postseason play last year for an 
alleged illegal payment by former coach Todd Bozeman's staff to a 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one of California's current players had played in a  
postseason game before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After California reversed two regular-season losses to Oregon,  
Elson said: ``We did not want to go out with a loss. We wanted to 
win the championship. We want to keep playing for something. We 
didn't want to finish third or fourth. We just wanted to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson may have finished 5-11 in the Atlantic Coast Conference,  
but winning the NIT would ease the pain of an inconsistent season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the season we weren't having as much fun as we did  
our first three years, and that showed in our play,'' said 
McIntyre, the 5-foot-9 senior who scored 20 points against Xavier. 
``We just want to go out and have fun and that's what we're 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson's only postseason title came 60 years ago when the  
Tigers won the Southern Conference; California won the NCAA 
championship in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier (24-11) plays Oregon (19-12) for third place before the  
NIT title game.

<HEADLINE> Starr Juror Speaks Out on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping from behind the grand jury's wall of  
secrecy, the forewoman in the Monica Lewinsky inquiry said she 
sympathized with President Clinton but would have voted to indict 
him for perjury if prosecutors had asked her to. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Freda Alexander  
described her 18 months on the grand jury as emotionally intense. 
She defended Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr but said she 
sometimes felt sorry for Ms. Lewinsky and presidential secretary 
Betty Currie as they were pressed to testify about the president. 
She portrayed Linda Tripp, the co-worker who turned Ms. Lewinsky in 
to prosecutors, as determined to damage Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors are forbidden by law from disclosing what goes on in the  
grand jury room. But Ms. Alexander, 46, said she felt she could 
talk about the Clinton case because so much of it was made public 
following Starr's report to Congress. She said she might even write 
a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander, whose grand jury service ended last week, said  
she believed Clinton's transgressions were so personal they never 
should have been made public, much less become grounds for 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``His crimes were intensely personal,'' Ms. Alexander said from  
her Washington home. ``You know when your mother says, 'Don't make 
a federal case out of it?' They were making a federal case of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she said Clinton wasn't honest with the grand jury about his  
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She was offended by his assertion 
that ``a reasonable person'' would define sexual relations only as 
intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she would have returned an indictment against Clinton,  
Ms. Alexander said, ``If they had asked if he committed perjury, I 
would say yes.'' But she also said she believes seeking an 
indictment would have been ``overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's a man supposed to do, when they're trying to protect  
their family and not hurt innocent people?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	She believes there wasn't enough evidence for a criminal  
indictment of Clinton for obstructing justice by covering up the 
affair -- the other charge considered in the Senate impeachment 
trial along with perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Ms. Alexander, who is divorced and has two sons in  
their 20s, said it was proper for the grand jury to investigate the 
Lewinsky matter and that Starr was unfairly demonized for doing his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Ken Starr is the devil incarnate. I think it's  
very sad that he's been put in that role,'' Ms. Alexander said. 
Instead, she blamed the independent counsel law for giving too much 
power and unlimited money to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander, who is black, said investigating the president  
was ``very difficult'' for her because she ``had a very high 
regard'' for Clinton for appointing minorities to high-level 
administration jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she believed Ms. Lewinsky paid a high price for  
youthful mistakes. The former White House intern's testimony about 
being confronted by Starr's prosecutors was so moving -- ``there 
were very few dry eyes'' in the room -- that Ms. Alexander gave her 
a hug at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ross, a criminal defense lawyer and expert on grand  
juries, called it ``a little bit of a shock'' that Ms. Alexander 
discussed the case and said the fact that much of the panel's work 
has been disclosed publicly does not necessarily free her from 
adhering to secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress a report and three volumes of supplemental  
information about the investigation, including transcripts of grand 
jury testimony. The House released the information publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors' names are not released by federal courts. Ms.  
Alexander was first identified in USAE, a weekly newspaper covering 
conventions and hotels, which published a story saying she was 
suing a hotel that fired her during her grand jury service. She 
would not comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	While not revealing other grand jurors' reactions, she spoke  
openly about her own impressions of the witnesses and prosecutors: 
</P>
<P>
	--She believes Mrs. Tripp's ``mission was to do as much damage as  
possible to Clinton'' and to gather material for a book. 
</P>
<P>
	--Her biggest objections to the independent counsel's office were  
the lack of minorities on the staff and that female prosecutors 
appeared to have ``secondary roles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Recalling how Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother, broke down  
crying while being questioned about her daughter, Ms. Alexander 
said, ``I hope I never see anything like that again.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia-Upjohn Has New Antibiotic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn is banking on a  
new type of antibiotic to fight bacterial infections that are 
increasingly resistant to existing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But while studies indicate the drug, Zyvox, works well, its  
success in the marketplace may be hurt by doctors who prefer to use 
older therapies first, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. officials say patients would be best  
served if doctors use Zyvox first, especially when other drugs are 
known to fail in fighting certain bacteria. The company expects to 
apply for U.S. approval for Zyvox later this year. If approved, the 
drug would be the first new class of antibiotic on the market in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bacteria have never seen an antibiotic like Zyvox,'' Gary  
Tarpley, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's vice president of discovery research, 
told analysts at a meeting in New York on Thursday. ``It is 
superior to existing drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors say a new antibiotic like Zyvox should be  
reserved for special cases, in part to slow down the time it takes 
the bugs to become resistant to the new drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of argument about how do you best prevent  
resistance. Do you go for the big gun and kill everything or use 
the simplest antibiotics?'' said Trish Perl, the top infection 
control officer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ``People 
don't know which strategy is best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox has some unique properties, Perl said, but she thinks  
doctors may benefit from first using older drugs such as 
penicillin. ``If the patient needs the drug they will get it, but 
do you need to always use a high octane gas for your car even when 
your engine will run fine on low octane?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyvox is considered part of a new class of antibiotics because  
the drug attacks bacteria before the start of the bacterial growth 
cycle, earlier than other antibiotics currently available, the 
company said. The earlier that cycle is interrupted, the quicker 
the drug can restore the patient's health. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug can be administered orally or intravenously.  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities, said Zyvox  
presents a tough challenge for Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's marketers. If 
the drug is used the way the company wants, annual sales would 
easily surpass $1 billion; if the drug is used as a last line of 
defense, annual revenue would be significantly less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug companies come out with new antibiotics every few years but  
because they work similar to drugs already available, bacteria are 
more likely to become resistant to them, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 160 antibiotics are available to fight disease. But drug  
resistance is becoming a major issue in combating tuberculosis or 
certain types of hospital-based staphylococcus infections, for 
example. Many antibiotics no longer have much effect on these 
virulent organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of infectious bacteria becoming immune to all  
available antibiotics has shaken the public health community, which 
now warns doctors that overprescribing of antibiotics can hasten 
the evolution of resistant germs. 
</P>
<P>
	Several drug manufactures are working on developing new types of  
antibiotics. French drug maker Rhone Poulenc Rorer is awaiting 
federal Food and Drug Administration approval for Synercid, which 
also would be a new class of antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bridgewater, N.J.-based Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's new class of  
antibiotic is still likely to face bacterial resistance, but it 
should take the microorganisms a longer time to figure a way to 
beat the drug, Perl said. ``The organisms are smarter than we 
are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Zyvox is used liberally, Perl said, bacteria could develop  
resistance quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn disputes that point, saying that the use of  
antibiotics is not the sole cause of drug resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company feels strongly that Zyvox as an early treatment is  
the appropriate strategy,'' Tarpley said. ``It doesn't seem an 
optimal strategy to use agents that patients know are resistant and 
then switch later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn closed at $59.50, up $1.37 1/2, in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Anti-NATO Protest Rocks Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Chanting ``NATO out of Yugoslavia!'',  
more than 2,000 demonstrators hurled stones and firebombs at the 
U.S. Embassy in Macedonia and tried to storm it Thursday before 
riot police drove them away with tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the protesters charged the U.S. compound, flames swallowed  
three nearby cars until firefighters arrived to extinguish the 
blazes. There were no injuries reported, but the barrage shattered 
embassy windows. 
</P>
<P>
	The siege came hours after Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski  
warned against rising anti-NATO and anti-American sentiment, as the 
Western alliance's air war against neighboring Yugoslavia continued 
for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two biggest problems the country is facing at the moment  
are the inflow of refugees from Kosovo and the emergence of 
anti-NATO and anti-American feelings among the Macedonian public,'' 
Georgievski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy was not the sole target of the demonstrators'  
anger. Hundreds gathered outside the missions other NATO members -- 
including France, Britain and Germany -- before police dispersed 
them with tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain said its embassy was closed because of damage, but that  
none of its staff had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators also marched to a nearby hotel housing officials  
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which 
oversees peace monitors in Kosovo. Waving the flags of Yugoslavia 
and pre-independence Macedonia, the demonstrators damaged a number 
of OSCE vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia has supported the NATO attacks against Yugoslavia, but  
nationalists and members of the Serb minority in this former 
Yugoslav republic, which became independent in 1993, are 
anti-Albanian and sympathetic to Belgrade. Many Macedonians also 
dislike the growing NATO presence in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Many nationalists here fear Macedonia's delicate ethnic balance  
could be affected by the influx of refugees from Kosovo, where 
Albanians make up 90 percent of its population of 2.2 million 
people. The three border posts with Yugoslavia were open Thursday, 
but did little business. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians are thought to make up as much as 40 percent of  
Macedonia's population. Unlike their cousins in Kosovo, they have 
not openly called for autonomy, but many nationalists have espoused 
the hope of one day uniting Albanians spread out in Albania, Kosovo 
and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia says it already has 20,000 refugees from Kosovo and  
can't handle any more. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks Thursday, Georgievski expressed his own  
frustration at the lack of support from the international community 
to assist with the refugees, saying ``they have done nothing to 
make the consequences less severe except for sending moral 
messages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the responsibility for the humanitarian catastrophe in  
Kosovo until now had to be blamed on (Yugoslav President) Slobodan 
Milosevic, now the responsibility will have to be taken by the 
United States and the European Union,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union announced Thursday it would send $2.2 million  
in emergency aid to help refugees -- with most of it going to 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece and Italy also were sending humanitarian aid, including  
foods and medicines.

<HEADLINE> German Sought Fla. Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- A German woman attempted to attack a  
4-year-old girl on the beach and said she came to Florida planning 
to kill someone because the state has the death penalty, according 
to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The child, who was visiting from New York, survived when a  
bystander pulled the girl from the knife-wielding woman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Ursula Lehmann was being held in the Lee County Jail  
without bail on a charge of attempted first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies said Lehmann told them about her death-wish plan,  
saying she headed to the Fort Myers beach on Wednesday in search of 
a victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Erica Roza of Milton, N.Y., was in the water with her 8-year-old  
cousin, Deanna Baker. That's when police said Lehmann spotted Erica 
and headed for her, holding a 10-inch filet knife. She pulled Erica 
into deeper water, telling Deanna ``'If you call the police, I'll 
kill her.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls and other children around them started screaming.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann, 33, started dunking the child under the water about 50  
feet offshore, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's screams alerted their mother, Kelly Roza, and a  
bystander, Gary Angotti, vacationing from Indiana. Angotti swam out 
and pulled the girls away. Other bystanders ran to a nearby 
sheriff's substation and got deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Erica received only small cuts on her chin and thumb.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann, who arrived in Fort Myers on Saturday, told LTU  
International Airways officials she had no money. They helped set 
her up with a German couple in Cape Coral. 
</P>
<P>
	They had no idea that Lehmann was plotting to kill someone in  
order to be convicted, get the death penalty and die in Florida's 
electric chair, said Lee County Sheriff's Lt. James Nygaard.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The state water company closed mains to  
70,000 consumers Thursday to search for the body of a young man 
sucked into a pipe while he swam in a water tower. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson Lopes da Silva and a friend, Tiago Correia, broke into  
the tower to swim on Sunday and were trapped when the water level 
suddenly fell, the company's press office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Correia's body was found Wednesday in a section of pipe half a  
mile from the tower, but Silva's body remained missing, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers made 19 holes in the main and used micro-cameras to  
check curves in the pipe where the body might have become stuck. 
The company announced it will use a ton of chlorine to disinfect 
the pipes after the body is discovered and removed.

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A congressional committee on Thursday  
expelled a legislator accused of murdering a colleague, the first 
step towards criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Talvane Albuquerque, an independent from the northeastern state  
of Alagoas, is accused of killing Ceci Cunha, whom he lost to in 
October elections. He denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	By a vote of 46-1, the committee urged Albuquerque's expulsion.  
The measure must now go before the full house for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Albuquerque took the congressional seat after Cunha was gunned  
down along with her husband, sister-in-law and her sister's 
mother-in-law on Dec. 16 in the state capital of Maceio, 1,033 
miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the constitution protects federal lawmakers from facing  
criminal prosecution while they are in office, Congress must expel 
him before he can face charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of Albuquerque's aides have been arrested and charged in  
the murder.

<P>
	Opposition lawmakers criticized the program, set to start in  
April, claiming it could lead to covert military training of 
Salvadoran soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Ministry denied the allegations, saying the program  
consists of building new bridges, schools and hospitals in rural 
areas damaged by the hurricane, which tore through Central America 
in late October and early November.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The upstart candidate to lead Mexico's ruling  
party abruptly resigned Thursday, claiming party officials wouldn't

</P>
<P>
	Rodolfo Echeverria, the nephew of a former Mexican president,  
registered Monday for the March 30 election for a new president of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party governing council.

<P>
	Echeverria's resignation is seen as a blow to the only other  
candidate, Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez, whose victory is now 
guaranteed but whose legitimacy is already being questioned by many 
members of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Echeverria was backed by the party's old guard, including Manuel  
Bartlett, a former governor of Puebla state who is campaigning for 
the party's nomination to run in next year's presidential 
elections.

<HEADLINE> Pastor Tried for Same-Sex Weddings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- A Methodist minister who presided at  
the ``wedding'' of two gay men went on trial Thursday before a jury 
of 13 pastors in the first test of a church law banning same-sex 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Gregory Dell of Chicago, a pastor for 30 years, could  
be defrocked if found guilty. A verdict is expected Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements, a minister acting as a church prosecutor  
said the ceremony Dell performed last September made ``a mockery of 
church law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Methodists don't obey the laws, ``then strike the word  
`united' from United Methodist,'' the Rev. Stephen C. Williams 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell's attorney, the Rev. Larry Pickens, countered that the  
church has a long history of ministers, including church founder 
John Wesley, who found themselves in the position of breaking 
church law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This, my brothers and sisters, is a case about what we do when  
a pastoral need and a church law conflict,'' Pickens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens said the church is faced with ``theological  
schizophrenia'' -- pastors are told to accept gay and lesbian 
members but not to bless their committed relationships. About a 
third of the members of Dell's church are gay or lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell took the stand as a prosecution witness Thursday afternoon.  
He answered ``yes'' when asked if the paragraph in the church's 
Book of Discipline that banned same-sex unions is binding. Dell is 
expected to testify again as a defense witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell, 53, performed the ceremony for two Chicago men about a  
month after the Methodist church banned same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	More such trials are expected. A bishop in California filed a  
complaint Tuesday against 69 Methodist ministers who gathered at a 
Sacramento, Calif., church in January to bless the union of a 
lesbian couple. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters on both sides of the issue gathered outside the First  
United Methodist Church, where the trial is being held. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's scary. It's invigorating. It's draining,'' said Keith  
Eccarius, one of the two men ``married'' by Dell. ``It's probably 
the most important issue our church has to deal with at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who support the ban agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are already people who've left the church or are  
planning to because of the advertisement of this trial,'' said the 
Rev. Kent Svendsen, a pastor from rural Ashton and a leader in the 
church's ``confessing movement,'' which believes gays can be 
converted to heterosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell attended Duke University's Divinity School with another  
controversial Methodist minister, the Rev. Jimmy Creech of Omaha, 
Neb., who was put on trial in 1998 for performing a lesbian 
``wedding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creech was acquitted. That prompted the Methodist church to  
elevate its guidelines against same-sex marriages to the status of 
church law. Dell is now being tried under that law. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech was not defrocked but has been placed on leave.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Official Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The former public relations director of the  
national black Baptist group pleaded guilty today to two federal 
tax evasion charges six weeks after a jury acquitted her of state 
racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000  
fine, and agreed to pay back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Federal prosecutors dropped 25 other charges, including money 
laundering, extortion and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea came just a week after the Rev. Henry Lyons, Edwards'  
co-defendant and former president of the National Baptist 
Convention USA, resigned his position and reached a plea deal with 
federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In state court late last month, Lyons was convicted of  
racketeering and grand theft for swindling more than $4 million 
from companies seeking to do business with convention members and 
stealing almost $250,000 intended to rebuild burned black churches 
in the South. He faces three to seven years in prison on those 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, his former public relations director and alleged  
mistress, was acquitted of racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had said the two diverted money from the companies  
into secret bank accounts and used it to finance lavish lifestyles 
with expensive homes, diamond jewelry and luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the witness stand during her state trial and told  
jurors the money she spent on the $700,000 home and huge diamond 
rings was income she had earned in her position with the 
convention. But she said she could not recall whether she reported 
those earnings to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wednesday's plea deal, she agreed to make restitution and  
pay the IRS back taxes for 1995 and 1996. The government says her 
unreported income totaled more than $500,000 and she owes nearly 
$200,000 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She also agreed to forfeit the luxury items she and Lyons  
bought. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards' lawyer, David Weisbrod, told reporters she feels  
``some sense of relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection in the federal trial had been scheduled to begin  
April 7. No sentencing date was immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards, of Milwaukee, was convicted in 1993 of stealing  
thousands of dollars from an alternative school for at-risk teens 
in Wisconsin.

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Gail Goestenkors is an emotional coach,  
and she held nothing back when her Duke Blue Devils lost their 
season opener by 30 points to Connecticut in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally shocked, surprised and dismayed by our  
performance,'' she said. ``I was especially surprised by the way my 
seniors were unable to handle the pressure.''

San Jose Arena, an event intended to showcase some of the top

<P>
	``That was the worst game of our season,'' Goestenkors said this  
week. ``I told the players after the game, `Well, now we know how 
bad we can be. We've got the entire rest of the season to find out 
how good we can be.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That tourney, which also included Stanford and Arkansas, began a  
season that ends this weekend with the Women's Final Four at the 
San Jose Arena. Duke is the only one of those four teams making a 
return trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to set our schedule up so that the beginning of our  
journey would be in San Jose and the end of our journey would be in 
San Jose. They've known from Day 1 what that first trip was all 
about. It wasn't the best trip,'' Goestenkors said. ``I think there 
would be nothing more fitting than to play our last game there and 
have it be our best game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke reached the Final Four with a stunning upset of three-time  
defending national champion Tennessee. The Volunteers' loss is one 
of the reasons this weekend might be more notable for who's missing 
than who's at the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Four in the Fall tournament was played, it seemed like  
the beginning to a perfect buildup for the Final Four -- which was 
coming to an area wild about women's hoops and proud to host the 
American Basketball League's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were even relishing a dream Final Four matchup: local  
favorite Stanford, capping a decade of success, against nearly 
unbeatable Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although San Jose remains excited about playing host to the  
games and about the $32 million economic impact the Final Four is 
expected to have on the city, reality turned out to be a lot 
different than the expectations of last autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL folded a few days before Christmas. Fans still grieve  
the loss of a league they thought represented the growing 
opportunities for women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford had a disappointing season that ended in the first  
round of the NCAA tournament, and Tennessee lost 69-63 to Duke in 
the regional finals to miss out on another trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, struggling to get fan support on a campus infatuated with  
its men's basketball team's run to the Final Four, will face 
Georgia in the first semifinal game Friday evening. The nightcap 
will be Louisiana Tech against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue also made a West Coast trip earlier this season, and left  
just as dismayed as Duke. A 73-72 defeat at Stanford in the third 
game of the season remains the Boilermakers' only loss of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors remembers the long trip home from San Jose last  
November, but her more recent memory is of the happy journey home 
after Monday's win over Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful bus ride home,'' she said. ``Lots of  
singing, lots of dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That joyous trip was exactly what her colleague at Duke, men's  
coach Mike Krzyzewski, has always preached about. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's given a lot of advice but all of it has to do with  
enjoying the ride, enjoying the journey,'' Goestenkors said. ``I've 
always set our sights very high, which I think is important. But at 
the same time, he wants you to slow down and enjoy the ride and 
realize what you've accomplished along the way as you're pushing 
forward.''

<HEADLINE> House Approves 2000 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharply split along party lines, the House on  
Thursday ratified a Republican ``budget for the new millennium,'' a 
blueprint designed to showcase support for Social Security, the 
Pentagon and a new round of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued that the GOP-backed tax reductions would favor  
the wealthy at the expense of the long-term health of Medicare and 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on passage was 221-208, and came after a full day of  
debate that centered on priorities for the budget surpluses that 
are forecast for the next several years. All but two Republicans 
voted for the plan. Only four Democrats supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, Senate Republicans were driving toward  
passing a similar budget for the 2000 fiscal year, which begins 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in the House marked a triumph for the new speaker, Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, who had made its passage the top priority of his 
early months as leader of the slender Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., said the GOP prescription ``saves more for  
Social Security and Medicare than the president's budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it ``provides for common-sense tax relief in the  
future. We have the largest surplus in history, which means the 
taxpayers are being overcharged,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement  
describing the measure as a ``series of missed opportunities.'' The 
tax and spending plan did not ``do enough to pay down the debt and 
strengthen Social Security and Medicare,'' he added 
</P>
<P>
	The budget, which sets guidelines for tax and spending bills  
later in the year, would be the first to be written by Congress 
since the government entered a new era of surpluses. And while 
House and Senate plans differed in detail, they had common 
priorities and served as the focus for a fierce partisan debate 
over Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget  
Committee, said the plan could ``not only preserve Social Security 
and Medicare,'' but emphasize defense and education. ``We also 
believe the American people ought to be empowered, the American 
people ought to have more money in their pockets,'' he said, 
referring to almost $800 billion envisioned for tax cuts over the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we project a budget for the new millennium that is  
right in pace'' with what the public wants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a letter from the chief actuarial  
expert at the Social Security agency, who wrote that the House GOP 
plan would do nothing to extend the life of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``They choose the tax cuts over extending the solvency of Social  
Security and Medicare,'' charged Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri. He said a Democratic plan of smaller, targeted tax cuts, 
would be fairer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bewildering mountain of budget statistics, each side found  
fine print to buttress their claim to being the stronger defender 
of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, for example, said they would put aside the entire  
Social Security surplus for debt reduction. They also won a letter 
of praise for their approach to Social Security and Medicare from 
the American Association for Retired Persons, the nation's largest 
advocacy group for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that over 15 years, their plan would set  
aside more money for Social Security and Medicare than the GOP 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the plans presented for debate provided any specific  
changes in Medicare or Social Security. Instead, they earmarked 
hundreds of billions of newly available surplus funds for debt 
reduction, a step designed to strengthen the economy and make it 
easier for the government to pay benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House plan called for $1.74 trillion in spending  
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and forecast a surplus of 
$141 billion. The Senate proposal would spend $1.74 trillion and 
produce a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would cut taxes next year by up to $15 billion and  
by $778 billion over the next decade. While the budget outlined no 
specifics, key Republicans have talked in terms of reducing the 
so-called marriage penalty or reducing tax rates as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, President Clinton's budget, submitted to Congress  
earlier in the year, called for spending of $1.79 trillion and 
would leave an $80 billion surplus. Clinton called for tax cuts 
totaling $81 billion through 2009 -- but he recommended increasing 
tobacco and other taxes by $178 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton would spend $281 billion next year for  
defense, compared with $289 billion by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and  
job training, exceeding the House total by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress,  
so much so that the House buried it, 426-2, with one lawmaker 
voting present. The Senate rejected it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary votes on the House floor, two separate Democratic  
alternatives were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	One called for smaller tax cuts than the GOP plan and more money  
for selected domestic programs. Supporters said it also would 
extend the life of Social Security until 2050 and of Medicare until 
2020. It failed on a vote of 250-173. 
</P>
<P>
	The second, crafted by a group of moderate to conservative  
Democrats, set aside more money than any other alternative for debt 
reduction and had the smallest tax cuts. It was rejected, 295-134. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar debate unfolded in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	There, Republicans rejected an effort by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
D-Mass., to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare, as 
Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans pushed through a measure directing the Finance  
Committee to consider a Medicare reform plan pushed by Sen. John 
Breaux, D-La., chairman of a Medicare commission that recently 
deadlocked. ``Let's quit talking about Medicare,'' said Senate 
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``Let's fix it.''

<HEADLINE>  U.S.: `We Act To Prevent Wider War' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is ready to continue a  
sustained bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen said today, but it could end ``at any time'' if Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic returns to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said all NATO planes had returned safely from the first  
day of strikes, and defense officials discounted reports that 
Yugoslavia's air defenses had hit a U.S. warplane. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more to follow, unless Mr. Milosevic chooses  
peace,'' Cohen told Associated Press Radio in an interview today. 
``This is going to be a long effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jet, spewing smoke, made an  
emergency landing today in Bosnia-Herzegovina, next door to 
Yugoslavia. Army Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said 
the plane was not damaged by Yugoslav air defenses and, in fact, 
had been flying a routine deny-flight mission over Bosnia when it 
developed a problem with its hydraulic pump and made an emergency 
landing today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebojsa Vujovic, charges d'affaires for the Yugoslav Embassy in  
Washington, said the allied strikes had caused no serious damage to 
Yugoslavia's military. ``But we have civilian casualties,'' he said 
on NBC's ``Today'' show, with 10 dead and more than 60 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said those reports were unconfirmed and questioned the  
reliability of information out of Yugoslavia. He added, though, 
that civilian casualties were difficult to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a near-unanimous vote by the House in support of U.S.  
forces participating in the mission, Republican lawmakers voiced 
concern about the U.S. strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a member of the House Republican  
leadership, said today on Fox News that lawmakers of both parties 
``are quite concerned not knowing when we're going to get out of 
there, how we're going to get out of there. I'm not as concerned 
about a time-frame as I am about us being committed to winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican Sen. Bob Dole, who has served Clinton as an  
envoy in the Yugoslav crisis, said the United States and NATO must 
be in for the long haul. If Yugoslavia refuses to yield, Dole told 
ABC News in a phone interview, ``I think we continue, we make it 
more intense,'' and he added that ground forces ``have to be 
somewhere on the table'' if airstrikes don't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton warned that U.S. forces faced grave risks but indicated  
the assault would include no ground troops. ``I do not intend to 
put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. and allied warplanes fought through the night over  
Yugoslavia and readied for a second round of strikes today, 
President Clinton took to the airwaves Wednesday night to try to 
win support from a public largely unaware of the severity of the 
crisis in Kosovo, and uncertain, even, of where the Yugoslav 
province is on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is a small place, but it sits on a major fault line  
between Europe, Asia and the Middle East,'' Clinton said. ``All the 
ingredients for a major war are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although all U.S. and allied warplanes were reported to have  
returned to their bases safely from the initial assault waves, the 
strikes did exact a tangible diplomatic price. Both China and 
Russia, a historic ally of the Serbs, denounced the strikes during 
a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials had no immediate damage assessment from bombs  
and scores of cruise missiles, but Yugoslav television showed 
pictures of flaming structures at Serb military bases and 
ammunition storage sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said NATO forces would continue hitting the Yugoslav  
military until Milosevic relents in a campaign of repression and 
violence against the majority ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav fighters took to the air and engaged NATO planes in  
air-to-air combat, coming out losers in the first engagements. 
Cohen said at least two Yugoslav MiG fighters were shot down by 
NATO planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was ``convinced that the dangers of acting are  
far outweighed by the dangers of not acting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He dwelt mainly on what he said would be the hazards of not  
acting: greater repression by the Yugoslav government against the 
ethnic Albanian minority in Kosovo, a widening conflict as refugees 
streamed into unstable neighboring countries, and the possibility 
of a complete loss of Western credibility if threats made by NATO 
were not carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, however, Americans seemed largely unengaged  
in the campaign that involved hundreds of U.S. and allied warplanes 
and warships in cruise missile and bomb attacks that set Yugoslav 
targets afire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it, the Serbs and who?'' businessman Mike Rahn, 25,  
said during his lunch break in a Phoenix shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton struggled to answer such questions, referring to maps of  
the region that showed the patchwork of national and sub-national 
boundaries, and a measles-like field of red dots showing the scores 
of Kosovo villages already ravaged by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led attack came after months of diplomacy failed to end  
fighting that has killed more than 2,000 people in Kosovo and left 
hundreds of thousands homeless.

<HEADLINE> French Lead in Ice Dance Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The French duo of Marina Anissina and  
Gwendal Peizerat captured the original dance and moved into first 
place of the ice dance event today at the World Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov were  
second but in a virtual tie for first. The decision will go down to 
the final free dance on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Germany were  
third. Even if they win the free dance, if one of the other top two 
couples comes in second, that couple would win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time U.S. champion Michelle Kwan, meanwhile, got a rest  
today as her coach, Frank Carroll, toys with whether to have Kwan 
practice for Friday's short program, the next part of the women's 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the time,'' Carroll said. ``We plan to skate tougher  
... we have some decisions to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan came down with a head cold while flying to the Finnish  
capital and its effects, combined with those of the antibiotics 
she's taking, made it hard to get out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
	She woke up 1 hour, 20 minutes before she went through her  
qualification session, yet hit six triple jumps with grace and 
easily won her group. 
</P>
<P>
	Her main challengers, Maria Butyrskaya and Tatiana Malinina,  
were first and second in their section, with three and four 
triples, respectively. And with nowhere near the polish Kwan had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little tired in my program, but thought, `One thing  
at a time,' '' Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan did not make any errors, but did only a triple-double  
combination and cut down another triple to a double lutz. 
</P>
<P>
	``My jumps seemed solid but I could have done better,'' Kwan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In pairs, China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo had a repertoire of  
powerful throws, lifts and jumps. The music from the movie 
``Mulan'' matched their power, with dynamic drums and fanfares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians skated to a wordless Coloratura Soprano piece,  
delivering a soft, delicate performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Berezhnaya fell on a double axel, it was their only  
error. They quickly swung back into the mood of soft skating, 
featuring elegant lines and extension in lifts, as opposed to the 
Chinese couple's fast-paced series of jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians were rewarded with a string of 5.9s for  
presentation. The best the Chinese could do were four 5.9s for 
technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant a 7-2 advantage for the Russians from the panel of  
nine judges. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 29th gold medal for couples from the former Soviet  
Union or Russia, all since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Third went to Dorota Zagorska and Marius Siudek of Poland, the  
top three positions not changing from Monday's short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the men finish their competition tonight with the  
free skate -- following the original dance to the waltz rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are leading in both events.  
</P>
<P>
	The men's gold medal almost certainly will be decided between  
defending champion Alexei Yagudin and compatriot Yevgeny Plushenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, is currently in  
third, with a slight chance to win. The top two Russians both must 
do poorly enough to allow Stojko and others to beat them in the 
free skate, worth 50 percent of the final score. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov resume competition in the  
ice dance after a day of rest. They won the compulsory portion on 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced in early trading Friday  
following strong gains on Wall Street overnight. The U.S. dollar 
was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 138.23 points,  
or 0.86 percent, to 16,124.27 in the first 30 minutes of morning 
trading. On Thursday, the index had gained 470.57 points, or 3.03 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.08 yen in early trading, up 0.22 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 118.13 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, buying interest from foreign and individual  
investors was strong Friday following the overnight gains in New 
York stocks. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 
up 169.55 points to 9,836.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Market sentiment was also improving with the approach of the new  
fiscal year beginning April 1, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 16.46 points, or 1.31 percent, to 1,272.39. 
The TOPIX gained 22.34 points, or 1.81 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar moved little as Japanese  
investors only adjusted positions in the absence of market-moving 
news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.10 yen, down  
from 128.16 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the new benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.875 percent from Thursday's finish of 
1.880 percent, driving its price up to 99.35 yen from 99.31 yen.

<HEADLINE> Food Network Audience Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- People lined up at 6 a.m. to get seats -- on  
a Saturday morning, no less. Inside, the 2,000-person crowd jumped 
to its feet, cheering and clapping in unison as the music keyed up 
and an announcer shouted, ``Let's get ready to rumble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the cook appeared.  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the whooping fans were assembled for the taping of a show  
by Emeril Lagasse, a gourmet master chef with blue-collar appeal 
who has turned the Food Network into ``Must See TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once a 24-hour outlet for Julia Child reruns, the cable channel  
has become eye-candy for food voyeurs who watch more for 
entertainment than cooking advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a form of vicarious tasting,'' said American studies  
professor Warren Belasco of the University of Maryland-Baltimore 
County. ``It's the vicariousness of watching others cook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Food Network is on the crest of a cooking tidal wave. Its  
audience has more than tripled since it debuted five years ago, 
making stars of its chefs-turned-hosts. The network hawks 
cookbooks, sponsors local food fairs and has built an Internet 
recipe database -- www.foodtv.com -- that gets an estimated 1.2 
million hits per month. 
</P>
<P>
	Other channels are airing more food-related shows too. An  
average of six hours of cooking shows can be seen each day in the 
Philadelphia area and more than double that on the weekends -- not 
including the 24-hour cooking channel. The American Program 
Service, which distributes shows to public television stations, 
carried 43 cooking shows in 1998, up from 28 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The power of TV, I'm just starting to understand. It's  
irrational really, how it can bring cooking to the masses,'' said 
chef Ming Tsai, host of the Food Network's ``East Meets West with 
Ming Tsai.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To see someone roll sushi is so much more instructive than  
describing how to turn 45 degrees, add rice, press down, whatever. 
A picture is worth a thousand words,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food Network isn't about to vie with ``NYPD Blue'' for  
ratings. It averages 90,000 viewers every day, up from 26,000 in 
1995, according to Nielsen Media Research. 
</P>
<P>
	About 199,000 viewers tune in nightly for ``Emeril Live,'' the  
network's No. 1 show. In contrast, the top 10 prime-time shows 
average 11 million to 18 million viewers while the top-rated cable 
shows attract 2.5 million to 5 million viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's niche marketing, and more and more people are very  
comfortable watching these kinds of networks,'' said Nielsen 
spokesman Jack Loftus. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooking shows have come a long way from Julia Child's staid  
how-to demonstrations. The majority stick with her lesson-centered 
formula -- a chef behind a counter acting out the steps of a recipe 
-- but a growing number are aiming for pure entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food Network's ``Taste of Life'' has no host chef but  
travels to different parts of the country to showcase regional 
foods. ``Ready, Set, Cook!'' is a game show pitting two chefs in a 
battle to create a meal with $10 worth of food. 
</P>
<P>
	The most successful is ``Emeril Live,'' which features live  
music, a live audience and showmanship over instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagasse charges up his audience by adding spices with his  
trademark ``Bam'' or adding thick stacks of butter to ``kick it up 
a notch.'' In his thick New England accent, he describes his fish 
fillets on the skillet as ``happy, happy'' and has been known to 
use ``like, 68 cloves of gah-lic'' -- the closest he comes to 
disclosing measurements during the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always watch Emeril,'' said 14-year-old Molly Fornito of  
Southampton, who waited three hours for a seat at a taping of 
``Emeril Live'' in Philadelphia last Saturday. ``I have 
make-believe cooking shows at home, where I pretend I'm a cook like 
Emeril.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it's just for fun, most chefs hope viewers are absorbing  
some of the message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people watch the shows for pure  
entertainment. But you can teach people bigger concepts, about how 
to taste and spice and how to cut,'' said Susan Feniger, co-host of 
the Food Network's ``Too Hot Tamales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it's purely entertainment, they remember stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Minn., Colo. Power Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northern States Power Co. is merging with New  
Century Energies Inc. of Denver in a $4.85 billion deal, creating a 
huge utility company covering 12 Western and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, announced today, comes nearly two years after  
federal regulators scuttled Minneapolis-based NSP's proposed merger 
with Wisconsin Energy Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company, with headquarters in Minneapolis, would have  
revenues of $6.4 billion based on last year's results. A name for 
the new company has not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger combines two well-managed, mid-continent electric  
and gas companies in order to provide a strong platform for 
assuring low-cost, quality service to the region during a time of 
rapid change in the utility industry,'' said James Howard, 
president, chairman and chief executive of NSP. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the merger to yield net cost  
savings of about $1.1 billion in the first 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will serve 3 million electricity customers and  
about 1.5 million natural gas customers in Arizona, Colorado, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will have operations in the United Kingdom, Central  
Europe, Australia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 63, will serve as chairman for the first full year of  
operations. Wayne H. Brunetti, vice chairman, president and chief 
operating officer of New Century, will be president and CEO when 
the deal closes and will take Howard's duties when Howard retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill D. Helton, chairman and CEO New Century, will retire when  
the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The distance between the two companies' service territories is  
likely to present some logistical difficulties, but the lack of 
overlapping territories also is likely to preclude the kind of 
regulatory and consumer concerns that helped derail NSP's deal with 
Wisconsin Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSP-Wisconsin Energy deal was called off in May 1997 after  
the two companies had spent more than two years and $50 million 
planning how they would combine operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of today's deal, New Century shareholders will  
receive 1.55 shares of the merged company's stock for each of their 
shares, while NSP shareholders will get one share of the new 
company for each share. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is  
expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete.

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shipments of foreign steel declined for a  
fourth consecutive month in February and dipped below pre-1998 
levels for the first time since U.S. imports reached record highs, 
the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports from Japan, one of the leading sources of foreign steel,  
were cut in half. However, the two other targets of illegal trade 
complaints from U.S. steel producers, Russia and Brazil, posted 
slight increases in shipments, potentially giving ammunition to 
supporters of legislative quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall imports to the United States were at 2 million metric  
tons, 15 percent below the 1997 monthly average of 2.4 million, 
according to the preliminary statistics released by Commerce. Final 
numbers are due next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports surged last year in the wake of the Asian economic  
crisis that lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipments have been declining since November, when the  
domestic steel industry won a favorable Commerc Department ruling 
that could subject imports from the three countries to tariffs 
retroactive to that month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has pointed to the decline in imports  
as justification for resisting stronger sanctions to curb imports. 
Nevertheless, momentum continues to build for legislation that 
would impose quotas on foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The House overwhelmingly passed the bill last week despite the  
threat of a presidential veto. Senators from steel-producing states 
decided Tuesday to press ahead with the measure despite its 
likelihood of running afoul with international trade agreements 
that restrict the use of quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. industry contends that thousands of layoffs and three  
U.S. company bankruptcies have resulted from the surge in imports, 
which reached record highs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and two unions complained to the federal  
government in September, accusing Japan, Russia and Brazil of 
illegally dumping hot-rolled carbon steel, a widely used product, 
in U.S. markets at prices below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases, awaiting final rulings this summer, appear to have  
reduced shipments of that product from those countries because of 
the threat of retroactive tariffs. In the meantime, some U.S. 
producers have announced price hikes and have begun to rehire 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. industry fears that despite a few months of  
declining numbers, other countries will step in to fill the void on 
hot-rolled steel and that the three countries will simply shift to 
other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian exports went up 17 percent, and shipments from Brazil  
increased 3 percent. Russia has recently reached an agreement with 
the United States to voluntarily curb shipments to avoid tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has been reluctant to grant  
additional sanctions for fear of starting a trade war and cutting 
off foreign markets to exports of other U.S. goods. The matter pits 
the ideals of free trade against the desires of a loyal 
constituency, organized labor.

<HEADLINE> Will Refinery Blasts Raise Gas Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gas prices surged in California following  
last month's deadly explosion at a Tosco refinery, and analysts say 
Thursday's fire at a Chevron plant may well send them higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to go up a lot,'' said Michael Mayer, a  
securities analyst who follows Chevron Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the explosion Thursday afternoon at the  
Chevron plant in Richmond, which sent a huge pillar of black smoke 
across the Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Chevron plant said the refinery would remain  
open, while the unit where the fiery explosion occurred was shut 
down indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery can produce up to 240,000 gallons of crude oil  
daily, said Chevron spokeswoman Dawn Soper. She would not say how 
the unit's closure would impact production there. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I couldn't speculate on anything regarding  
pricing,'' Soper said. With refineries in El Segundo and elsewhere, 
``we don't expect what happened today to have a significant affect 
on our customers including those at the pump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But production already is crippled in the state, with at least  
three other refineries operating at less than 100 percent capacity, 
said Jay McKeeman, executive vice president of the California 
Independent Oil Marketers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Various refinery shutdowns in California mean about 250,000 to  
300,000 gallons a day are cut out of the state's normal daily 
supply of 2 million gallons, according to Chevron spokesman Jack 
Coffey. Tosco's Avon plant alone usually produces 160,000 gallons a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is one in a continuing series of problems,''  
McKeeman said. ``California is a huge petroleum consumer entity, 
(buying) 13 billion gallons of gasoline a year. It needs a lot of 
refining capacity a year to meet that demand. Anytime there's a 
glitch in the system you get a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 23, the day of the blast at the Tosco Avon refinery that  
killed four workers and left another man critically injured, prices 
shot up 16 cents -- to $1.18 a gallon on the West Coast -- before 
sliding back down to about $1.02 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for regular gasoline were about $1.30 a gallon or more in  
the San Francisco Bay area this week, compared to about $1.12 on 
the West Coast overall, according to the U.S. Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	California motorists face unique concerns when buying gas  
because laws require it to be specially formulated and most of what 
they purchase is produced in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't immediately get access to other supplies of fuel,''  
McKeeman said. ``It's going to cost more; there's delays in getting 
conforming fuel in the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how much supply could be affected is an open question,  
McKeeman said. The refineries experiencing various problems -- which 
also include an Arco facility in the Los Angeles area and an Exxon 
site in Benicia -- account for as much as half of the state's fuel 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's true that close to half of the refining capacity in  
the state is at risk, yeah, there's a very definite problem of 
supply shortages,'' McKeeman said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Clash Over NATO Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia called an emergency meeting of the  
U.N. Security Council to demand that NATO stop its airstrikes on 
Yugoslavia. Instead, several countries defended the bombing raids. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Britain, France, The Netherlands, Canada,  
Slovenia, Albania, Bosnia and Germany, speaking on behalf of the 
European Union, backed the NATO strikes as the only option left 
after diplomacy failed to settle the Kosovo dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of  
thousands left homeless in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province where 
government forces have been fighting ethnic Albanian separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	To protest the airstrikes, Russian President Boris Yeltsin  
halted cooperation with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia found some support for its position from  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said force was legitimate but 
that the council should have been involved in any decision to use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some acknowledged Wednesday that the Security Council hadn't  
explicitly authorized the intervention. But they said NATO action 
was necessary given the humanitarian situation in Kosovo and 
Belgrade's opposition to international demands for a settlement 
with the ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``The action being taken is legal,'' British Ambassador Jeremy  
Greenstock told the council. ``It is justified as an exceptional 
measure to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China and India, along with Belarus, backed Moscow. India, which  
rarely asks to speak at council meetings, made an impassioned 
speech, saying anarchy would rule if individual countries or 
regional blocks are allowed to take ``arbitrary and unilateral'' 
action against others. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is particularly disturbing is that both international law  
and the authority of the Security Council are being flouted by 
countries that claim to be champions of the rule of law,'' said 
Indian Ambassador Kamalesh Sharma. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its allies maintain they have authority to  
launch the NATO strikes based on previous Security Council 
resolutions demanding a peaceful settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia's U.N. ambassador, Danilo Turk, acknowledged that the  
council had allowed itself to be sidelined on the Kosovo dispute 
because members couldn't agree on stronger resolutions that 
explicitly spelled out what measures could be taken to enforce U.N. 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true that sometimes force is used without an explicit  
basis in the Security Council resolutions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Pro Soccer League Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A women's professional soccer league could be  
launched in the United States by spring of 2001, depending on the 
success of this summer's Women's World Cup and the 2000 Olympics, 
Alan Rothenberg said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people kind of just expect it,'' said Rothenberg,  
chairman of the board for the Women's World Cup organizing 
committee. ``I'd like to see it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothenberg said he envisions a league featuring between eight  
and 12 teams, stocked with American women and their top 
international counterparts playing during the spring and summer in 
such major markets as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation has formed a committee to look into a  
pro league and is in the process of hiring a consultant to develop 
a business plan. By year's end, the plan should be formulated, 
Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the World Cup needs to be a success for there to be  
any chance of a women's pro league happening,'' said Marla Messing, 
president and CEO of the World Cup organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 280,000 tickets had been sold as of Wednesday to the  
World Cup tournament beginning June 19 at stadiums nationwide. The 
final is July 10 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The keys to launching a women's pro league are money from  
investors and sponsors and a major television contract, Rothenberg 
said. Those same factors applied to Major League Soccer, which 
began in 1996 -- two years after the United States successfully held 
the men's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at how we started MLS, and we couldn't have done that  
if we didn't upfront have the TV commitment, a handful of really 
blue-chip sponsors who signed long-term agreements, and a couple of 
deep-pocketed investors,'' said Rothenberg, who helped found the 
outdoor league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, you've got to make it on your own and the jury is  
still out on how you do that in women's sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the difficulties, he said, is how to market women's  
soccer to sponsors and female consumers, who are the leading buyers 
of many products. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see company after company is kind of looking to figure out  
how to exploit that properly and they're having trouble 
answering,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothenberg said he believes potential investors and sponsors are  
taking a wait-and-see attitude toward a women's pro league, wanting 
to gauge the success of soccer at the World Cup and the Sydney 
Olympics. The same thing occurred after the men's World Cup in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the '99 Women's World Cup is successful, and I'm sure it  
will be, people will be approachable,'' he said. ``And they'll 
probably hang on to their pens and their wallets until Sydney is 
over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rothenberg believes the United States needs its own pro league  
to help the American women remain at the top internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need the international games here and there, but you can't  
rely on a steady diet, espeically when they're international 
friendly games. It's just not the same level of competition,'' he 
said of the U.S. team's current schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Messing agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk to the women they do believe ... the competition  
is getting much closer to where they are and they think it's going 
to surpass them very shortly,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	If MLS, which recently began its fourth season, was further  
along in its development, the league could provide financial 
backing for a women's league, much like the NBA did with the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was five years down the road and the MLS was more firmly  
entrenched, I think it would be a no-brainer because it needs that 
kind of backing,'' Rothenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothenberg believes it's important to move more slowly with the  
women than he did in launching the men's league, which had a more 
proven market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd rather wait and do it right then rush out and then have  
it fall on its face,'' he said, ``because that'll make another 20 
years before anybody wants to try it again.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes for Budget Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans in both houses of Congress pushed  
toward passage Thursday of a ``budget for the new millennium,'' a 
blueprint designed to showcase support for Social Security, the 
Pentagon and a new round of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Outnumbered Democrats countered that the GOP-backed tax  
reductions would favor the wealthy at the expense of the long-term 
health of Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	But as debates unfolded in tandem at both ends of the Capitol,  
Republicans claimed they had the votes to prevail and Democrats did 
not disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect we'll pass it,'' by day's end, said Speaker Dennis  
Hastert of Illinois, facing a critical early test of his leadership 
in a House where Republicans command a narrow, six-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, a final vote was expected by evening, or perhaps  
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget, which sets guidelines for tax and spending bills  
later in the year, would be the first to be written by Congress 
since the government entered a new era of surpluses. And while the 
plans pending in the House and Senate differed in detail, they had 
common priorities and served as the focus for a fierce partisan 
debate over Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget  
Committee, said the plan could ``not only preserve Social Security 
and Medicare,'' but emphasize defense and education. ``We also 
believe the American people ought to be empowered, the American 
people ought to have more money in their pockets,'' he said, 
referring to almost $800 billion envisioned for tax cuts over the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we project a budget for the new millennium that is  
right in pace'' with what the public wants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a letter from the chief actuarial  
expert at the Social Security agency, who wrote that the House GOP 
plan would do nothing to extend the life of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``They choose the tax cuts over extending the solvency of Social  
Security and Medicare,'' charged Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri. He said a Democratic plan of smaller, targeted tax cuts, 
would be fairer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bewildering mountain of budget statistics, each side found  
fine print to buttress their claim to being the stronger defender 
of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, for example, said they would put aside the entire  
Social Security surplus for debt reduction. They also won a letter 
of praise for their approach to Social Security and Medicare from 
the American Association for Retired Persons, the nation's largest 
advocacy group for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that over 15 years, their plan would set  
aside more money for Social Security and Medicare than the GOP 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the plans presented for debate provided any specific  
changes in Medicare or Social Security. Instead, they earmarked 
hundreds of billions of newly available surplus funds for debt 
reduction, a step designed to strengthen the economy and make it 
easier for the government to pay benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House plan called for $1.74 trillion in spending  
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and forecast a surplus of 
$141 billion. The Senate proposal would spend $1.74 trillion and 
produce a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would cut taxes next year by up to $15 billion and  
by $778 billion over the next decade. While the budget outlined no 
specifics, key Republicans have talked in terms of reducing the 
so-called marriage penalty or reducing tax rates as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, President Clinton's budget, submitted to Congress  
earlier in the year, called for spending of $1.79 trillion and 
would leave an $80 billion surplus. Clinton called for tax cuts 
totaling $81 billion through 2009 -- but he recommended increasing 
tobacco and other taxes by $178 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton would spend $281 billion next year for  
defense, compared with $289 billion by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and  
job training, exceeding the House total by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress,  
so much so that the House buried it, 426-2, with one lawmaker 
voting present. The Senate rejected it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In other preliminary votes on the House floor, two separate  
Democratic alternatives faced defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	One, backed by the leadership, called for smaller tax cuts than  
the GOP plan and more money for selected domestic programs. 
Supporters, led by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said it would also 
extend the life of Social Security until 2050 and of Medicare until 
2020. 
</P>
<P>
	The second was crafted by a group of moderate to conservative  
Democrats. In keeping with their historic concern about deficits, 
their plan set aside more money than any other alternative for debt 
reduction and had the smallest tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar debate unfolded in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	There, Republicans rejected an effort by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
D-Mass., to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare, as 
Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans pushed through a measure directing the Finance  
Committee to consider a Medicare reform plan pushed by Sen. John 
Breaux, D-La., chairman of a Medicare commission that recently 
deadlocked. ``Let's quit talking about Medicare,'' said Senate 
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``Let's fix it.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Worries About S&AMP;P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is moving to stem its loss of  
U.S. shareholders amid a growing perception that the newly merged 
automaker is more German than American. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-Chairman Robert J. Eaton told Wall Street analysts this week  
that he recently met with officials in Washington to seek their 
help in persuading Standard &AMP; Poor's to reverse its decision not to 
include DaimlerChrysler in its S&AMP;P 500 index of U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the merger took effect in November, the percentage of  
DaimlerChrysler shareholders in the United States has fallen to 25 
percent from 44 percent. DaimlerChrysler said that change prompted 
S&AMP;P to leave it out of the index. In turn, many large mutual funds 
that track the S&AMP;P 500 unloaded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton revealed the behind-the-scenes lobbying to a small group  
of analysts at a private meeting in New York earlier this week. The 
analysts said Eaton did not identify the Washington officials with 
whom he discussed the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Curtrise Garner said she could  
neither confirm nor deny Eaton's comments to the analysts, but said 
the company was hopeful S&AMP;P would change its policy in light of the 
industry's rapid globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the economy changes and as indexes change, we think it's  
something that probably will be re-evaluated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But S&AMP;P spokesman Bill Jordan said that was unlikely.  
DaimlerChrysler was not included in the S&AMP;P 500 because it is not a 
U.S. company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a German company, it pays taxes in Germany, it's  
incorporated in Germany,'' Jordan said. ``Our long-standing policy 
is that non-U.S. companies will not be added to the S&AMP;P U.S. 
indexes. It's fairly straightforward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts questioned what Eaton hoped to gain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me he said it, but I doubt it's going to  
amount to anything,'' said Gary Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; 
Co. Lapidus did not attend the Eaton briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have been backing off support for DaimlerChrysler  
stock. They complain that news affecting the company's financial 
performance has come out of Germany first with no advance warning 
to Wall Street. The release of its 1998 financial results has come 
slowly in bits and pieces; the final figures won't be released 
until Wednesday, long after GM and Ford have released their 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler stock was trading Thursday at $86.81 1/4 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange, down 20 percent from its high of 
$108.62 1/2 on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton told the analysts that DaimlerChrysler will report full  
first-quarter financial results like an American company on April 
28. American companies typically disclose more detailed financial 
information in a more timely manner than companies operating under 
German law. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Eaton also told them he erred in announcing early  
on that he would retire within three years of the merger and leave 
Juergen Schrempp in sole control. Eaton headed Chrysler Corp. and 
Schrempp was chairman of Daimler-Benz AG before the two companies 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement and subsequent rumors that Eaton may retire  
earlier have added to the perception within DaimlerChrysler's North 
American operations that the Germans are in charge. The defections 
of several top U.S. executives to General Motors Corp. and Ford 
Motor Co. haven't helped. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, an industry expert at the University of Michigan,  
said it's important for DaimlerChrysler to reverse that perception 
and improve morale among U.S. executives who may feel marginalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to head off any more exodus that could occur, and  
there could be more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Randy Johnson To Miss Next Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Randy Johnson will skip his scheduled start  
against the Chicago Cubs in Mesa on Friday because of a slight 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a strain, nothing more than that,''  
Johnson said Thursday. ``I want to be healthy for opening day. 
That's what we're all shooting for -- to give myself a little more 
time to heal up instead of going out there and reaggravating it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will leave the big left-hander with just one  
remaining spring training start -- next Wednesday against the 
Colorado Rockies in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he gets about a seven-inning stint on that Wednesday, we're  
in good shape, right where we want to be,'' Arizona manager Buck 
Showalter said. ``That gives us about eight days from the original 
injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troy Brohawn will start in Johnson's place on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Showalter had considered having Johnson throw some pitches in  
simulated game conditions at the Diamondbacks' training facility on 
Friday, but decided against it. Johnson will play catch on flat 
ground because the injury bothers him only when he's pitching on 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he first felt the injury to his right groin during  
pitcher's fielding practice on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke off the mound to cover first base and I just felt a  
little bit of a twinge,'' Johnson said. ``I tried to do it again 
and I felt it again, so I sat down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When he worked out on the mound Wednesday, he realized there was  
a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got on the mound and threw a few pitches and it felt OK,''  
he said. ``Then I started to put a little effort into it and that's 
when I felt it. As soon as my leg landed and I put some weight on 
it, my leg gave way a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said his arm strength isn't what he wants it to be but  
at least he will be able to throw on flat ground over the coming 
week. The missed game in Mesa will make his final exhibition start 
critical if he is to be ready to make his Diamondbacks debut 
against Kevin Brown on April 5 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without a doubt, it's really important to get the last start  
in simply because it will be my last opportunity to face batters 
and get all my pitches over for strikes right before my opening 
start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said trainer Paul Lessard had assured him he would not  
have chronic groin problems. It's the first groin injury of 
Johnson's career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of a drawback, but what are you going to do?' '' he  
said. ``Being a pitcher and having to run and hit as well, it's 
just a lot of activity. Maybe it's because I'm getting old, I 
guess.''

<HEADLINE> Sprint Long Distance Chief Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Inc. executives are using the  
resignation of the head of the company's long-distance division to 
reshape Sprint's focus on long-distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattie Manuel, 41, who has held the post since February 1998,  
said Thursday that she is leaving Sprint to pursue other interests. 
Manuel joined the company in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``After nearly 20 years in the telecommunications industry, I  
feel it is time to look at new challenges in other arenas,'' Manuel 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald T. LeMay, Sprint's president and chief operating officer,  
said Manuel will not be replaced. Instead, the company will create 
two separate units serving long-distance consumers and business 
customers. Both units will report directly to LeMay, Sprint 
spokesman Bill White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of boundaries determined by technology and regulation,  
we are beginning to position Sprint by markets,'' LeMay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a news report published Thursday suggests Sprint  
could be in for some major changes in its overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement to dissolve the Global One telecommunications  
consortium of Sprint, France Telecom and Germany's Deutsche Telekom 
could come within six weeks, according to a report in Thursday's 
New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One was formed in 1996 to offer large multinational  
corporations complete, integrated telecommunications services 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives close to Global One told the newspaper that Sprint  
chairman William T. Esrey sent a letter three weeks ago to 
executives at Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom that said the 
venture was failing, and decisive moves should be made to resolve 
the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	White on Thursday called the report ``speculative.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe very meaningful progress towards profit is  
happening at Global One,'' White said. ``We're very optimistic 
about its potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday afternoon, the three companies released a statement in  
support of the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint stand by Global  
One and are convinced that the joint venture will achieve the goals 
that have been set. The management staff of Global One is on the 
right path with the restructuring that is now taking place and 
expects to break even by the year 2001,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One has undergone some positive changes in the last year,  
said Anthony Ferrugia, a telecommunications analyst with A.G. 
Edwards in St. Louis. A new executive team led by Gary Forsee, 
former head of Sprint's long-distance operations, has implemented 
rigid cost controls while focusing on integrating the partners' 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been making very good progress,'' Ferrugia said. He said  
he believes the venture will be profitable in the next 12 to 24 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrugia said he doubted reports that Sprint was trying to  
derail its partnership with Deutsche Telekom and French Telecom in 
order to increase its potential as an acquisition target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partnership is the cornerstone of their international  
strategy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Ferrugia said the Sprint's value would not decline if the  
partnership were to dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be no shortage of suitors,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sprint rose $3.50 on the New York Stock Exchange to  
close at $99.50.

<HEADLINE> Colgate To Stop Using Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive Co. has declared an immediate  
moratorium on using animals for testing the safety of its personal 
care products. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium covers a wide range of products designed for  
adults, including deodorants, shampoos, shaving cream and men's and 
women's fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate said in a statement that 98 percent of all internal  
requests for product-safety approval are currently met using 
available data and non-animal alternatives. Continued consultation 
with industry and scientific groups led to additional opportunities 
to reduce animal testing, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that our moratorium on animal testing of adult  
personal care products is a positive step forward, consistent with 
our overriding responsibility to consumer and employee safety,'' 
Colgate said. 
</P>
<P>
	The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals lauded the move,  
saying it was the product of 20 months of discussions with the New 
York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a banner day for animals in laboratories, a big step  
forward for which we applaud Colgate,'' said PETA President Ingrid 
Newkirk.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Ads Feature Noted Artists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pablo Picasso appears to be tightening door  
bolts, Salvador Dali operates a welding torch and Vincent van Gogh 
inspects the instrument panel in new ads for the flagship cars from 
Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the artists as assembly line workers are appearing in  
ads that began running last week for the new S-Class cars from 
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. that went on display this month 
in dealer showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign provides the latest example of how advertisers are  
using the images of deceased celebrities to draw attention to their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, movie images of John Wayne were featured in  
beer ads years after his death and a soft drink commercial featured 
clips of the late Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Cagney. Fred Astaire's 
widow gave permission to an appliance maker to use film that made 
it appear Astaire was dancing with vacuum cleaners as props rather 
than a cane and coat rack. 
</P>
<P>
	Using revered figures can help advertisers strike a bond of  
shared appreciation with potential customers, but it has also been 
criticized as crass exploitation of people no longer able to speak 
for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, Mercedes is drawing from the world of fine art as  
it pitches its top-of-the-line cars, which start at $69,700. The 
S-Class accounted for about 9 percent of the record 170,245 
Mercedes cars sold in the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to convey the meticulous attention to detail and  
craftsmanlike manufacturing skills that go into our vehicles,'' 
said Joe Eberhardt, a marketing executive for the Montvale, 
N.J.-based importer, a division of Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The artists are ``immediately recognizable symbols for what we  
wanted to communicate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 30-second and one-minute versions, Mercedes makes it look  
like the world's best-known artists are working in its assembly 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Film of Picasso's face was superimposed over that of an actor  
who was using a wrench to tighten bolts in the door frame of a new 
car. The same for Andy Warhol, who appears to be observing the 
action from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad uses actors resembling Dali, who poses as a welder, and  
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who pokes around in the engine 
compartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rembrandt van Rijn appears to be inspecting the underside of the  
cars, while van Gogh checks out the instrument panel and Leonardo 
da Vinci drives a finished car away from the assembly line. In each 
case, drawings of their faces done in the artist's style were 
superimposed over actors. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't the first time Mercedes has looked to the past for its  
advertising. In a campaign called ``Born Too Soon,'' it showed 
celebrities like Bing Crosby and Errol Flynn as young men with 
their early Mercedes cars. It has used classic songs in ads like 
Marlene Dietrich's recording of ``Falling in Love Again'' and 
counterculture heroine Janis Joplin's recording of ``Lord Won't You 
Buy Me a Mercedes-Benz?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes is also running a second print and TV ad series that  
show Ernest Hemingway, Jackie Robinson and the Parthenon, 
describing them simply as an author, a ballplayer and a building. 
The S-Class is also shown, identified as a car. ``Sometimes words 
can be hopelessly inadequate,'' the ads say. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials declined to say how much it cost to make or  
run the ads which will run on the NCAA basketball playoffs this 
weekend. They said they secured permission from the estates of the 
artists to use their images. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were produced by Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS before it was fired  
last month over differences with Mercedes-Benz involving management 
of the account and the process of developing advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes has since hired the agency Merkley Newman Harty to  
create its advertising but the new agency's first work is not 
expected until midsummer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrific conclusion to the relationship we have had  
with the client over the past five years,'' said Lee Garfinkel, 
chairman and chief creative officer for Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS.

	NATO Bombs Yugoslavia for 2nd Night  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO launched an aerial bombardment  
on Yugoslavia for a second night today, following through on a 
pledge of a weeks-long campaign if necessary to destroy the 
nation's military forces. Air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade, 
Pristina and elsewhere in Yugoslavia tonight after dozens of NATO 
warplanes took off from Italy. Cruise missiles were launched from 
warships in the Adriatic, NATO said. Last night's attacks 
reportedly killed at least 11 people, injured dozens and delivered 
serious blows to the military infrastructure.

	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Hundreds of demonstrators sympathetic

Embassy today, hours after the prime minister expressed concern 
over rising anti-NATO sentiment. Macedonia borders Yugoslavia, 
where NATO has launched attacks to try to force President Milosevic 
to make peace with ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. 
Macedonian nationalists and members of the Serb minority in the 
former Yugoslav republic, which became independent in 1993, are 
sympathetic to Yugoslavia.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian government today ordered  
the expulsion of all journalists from countries involved in NATO 
airstrikes. However, the federal government of Yugoslavia -- made up 
of Serbia and Montenegro -- later said all journalists are welcome 
to stay as long as they are objective. Hundreds of foreign 
journalists are planning to leave the country, some as soon as 
tonight.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating a murder charge  
today against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who insisted that helping to kill 
a Lou Gehrig's victim was not a crime. Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper 
rejected the prosecution's proposal for an explicit warning against 
``jury nullification'' -- setting aside the law out of sympathy for 
the defendant. In her instructions, she told jurors they must 
follow the law as she gives it. Mercy killing is not an excuse for 
murder, she said.

	Paraguay Impeachment Hearings Begin  
</P>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's Senate today began hearings  
to impeach President Raul Cubas, proceedings hastened by the 
assassination of the vice president. Cubas is accused of abusing 
his powers by freeing former army chief Lino Oviedo from jail in 
August, just months after he was sentenced to 10 years. The Supreme 
Court ordered Cubas to send Oviedo back to prison, but the 
president refused despite pressure from members of the ruling 
Colorado Party led by Vice President Luis Argana. Argana was shot 
as he rode to work Tuesday. The killers remain at large but Cubas 
and Oviedo have been widely blamed for Argana's death.

<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq denounced a U.N. human rights report  
that criticized President Saddam Hussein's regime, saying today 
that the report's author was ``busy inventing lies'' against Iraq. 
The report had accused Saddam's government of eliminating 
practically all human rights and creating a situation that was as 
bad as any regime since World War II. The 21-page report was 
written by the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible for Iraq.

	FDA Lobbied on `Functional Foods'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An advocacy group wants the government to  
regulate labels on ``functional foods,'' such as the split-pea soup 
with St. John's wort that promises to ``give your mood a natural 
lift.'' The Center for Science in the Public Interest says the 
label is misleading because a bowl of soup can't treat depression. 
CSPI is urging the Food and Drug Administration to tighten controls 
over functional foods, saying too many companies are promoting 
unproven ingredients. The agency's food chief says developing a 
policy is a top priority.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets won the bidding war for Orel  
Hershiser, agreeing today to a $2 million, one-year contract. 
Hershiser is a 40-year-old right-hander who went to spring training 
with the Cleveland Indians. A three-time All-Star, he won the 1988 
NL Cy Young Award with the Los Angeles Dodgers after going 23-8 and 
setting a major league record with 59 consecutive scoreless 
innings. Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 11-10, with a 
4.41 ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Reacts to Rising Homicide Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There will be many more men and women in blue  
on the streets of the nation's capital to deal with a recent wave 
of violence, the police chief said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to sit idly by and watch the body count  
rise,'' District of Columbia Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey said in 
response to questions about 12 homicides that occurred in 
Washington between Saturday night and early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killings bring the number of homicides in the district  
between Jan. 1 and early Wednesday to 65, an increase of 17 over 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't appear to be any pattern, though some of them  
appear to be drug- and gang-related,'' Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief said he believes putting more officers on the streets  
will reduce the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few weeks, Ramsey said, he will allow up to 100  
officers a day to work overtime during their days off in high-crime 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated the added overtime would cost the city $3 million.  
The department's overtime budget totals $15 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey did not put any specific limits on the extra policing,  
saying only that it would last as long as necessary.

<HEADLINE> Medical Faculty Dislike HMO's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Just like many of their patients, doctors in training strongly  
dislike HMOs -- mainly because their teachers do, according to a 
survey of medical students and faculty members published today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty well conclude that the students and residents are  
strongly influenced by the faculty culture in medical schools ... 
what's been described by others as a hidden curriculum,'' said Dr. 
Steven Simon, a researcher for the study's sponsors, Harvard 
Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a large 
not-for-profit health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and faculty members ranked traditional fee-for-service  
medicine superior to managed care in most areas, especially in 
allowing access to care, minimizing ethical conflicts and 
preserving the doctor-patient relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, 57 percent said a single-payer health system, such as  
the Canadian government-sponsored insurance, would give the most 
people the best care for a fixed cost. Only 19 percent chose 
fee-for-service, while 22 percent preferred managed care. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
is based on 1997 telephone interviews with 2,162 people affiliated 
with all 121 U.S. medical schools, including medical students, 
residents (recent graduates getting on-the-job training), faculty 
members, deans, department heads and residency training directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among students and residents, 74 percent said faculty members  
teaching primary care gave them a negative opinion of managed care. 
Ninety-six percent said faculty members teaching specialties -- 
where doctors have lost the most income and independence to HMOs -- 
gave them a negative impression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see managed care as not being an altogether evil force,''  
said Molly Conroy, a fourth-year student at University of 
Pennsylvania Medical School in Philadelphia. But she said: ``I know 
that I will have less time to spend with my patients, and that 
bothers me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy, who is from Bronxville, N.Y., said medical school  
faculty members have been the strongest influence on her opinion of 
managed care, but news stories and experiences she and her 
relatives have had with their own HMOs have also been significant 
factors.

<HEADLINE> Cabin Creek Quilts Fights Orvis Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- It is the apparel world's version of  
the big guy and the small fry. 
</P>
<P>
	The small quilting cooperative, Cabin Creek Quilts, has been  
here before, defending its turf in successful fights with Wal-Mart 
and the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Appalachian group is battling Orvis Co. Inc., contending  
the Manchester, Vt.-based company improperly marketed a 
foreign-made quilt as a ``Cabin Creek Quilt'' and ``an Orvis 
exclusive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're tired of this David-and-Goliath stuff,'' co-op manager  
and founder David Thibeault said Wednesday. ``They are playing fast 
and loose with our name, and we're not going to let them get away 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cooperative has about 25 people actively working, and earns  
about $350,000 a year. A productive quilter can complete about one 
quilt a month. 
</P>
<P>
	While Orvis was selling its quilt for $239 for a twin-bed size,  
handmade Cabin Creek Quilts made by West Virginians working out of 
their homes often run in the thousand-dollar range. 
</P>
<P>
	Orvis shipped out an estimated 20 million summer 1999 gift and  
clothing catalogs advertising its quilt, and Thibeault said the 
cooperative wants Orvis to print a half-page clarification in its 
next catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	An Orvis spokesman said the company made ``an honest mistake''  
and has removed the offending article from its Internet order site. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-op has fought repeatedly to protect its name since its  
founding in 1970. Its aggressive approach persuaded Wal-Mart to 
stop using the ``Cobble Creek Quilts'' name on machine-made quilts 
from China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian later made a deal with Cabin Creek to reproduce  
a Smithsonian design and sell it through Lands' End after a fight 
over quilting patterns.

<HEADLINE> Bush Face Federal Fund Quandary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ross Perot did it. Steve Forbes is doing it  
again. Now Texas Gov. George W. Bush is weighing whether to give up 
millions of federal dollars for a presidential campaign so he can 
escape spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a bold move in next year's Republican primaries for  
Bush, who doesn't have a personal fortune like Perot and Forbes. 
He'd have to raise an unprecedented $50 million just to keep pace 
with fellow Republicans who will follow tradition and take the 
federal matching funds. To be able to spend the maximum, they will 
have to raise an estimated $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see how the fund raising goes,'' Bush  
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. ``There's more flexibility within 
the campaign if you do not take matching funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's willingness to consider giving up the federal money shows  
that one of the major legacies of Watergate -- partial public 
financing of presidential primary campaigns in exchange for limits 
on spending -- may be losing its appeal for some candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bush gives up the matching funds for the primary, he  
still would be eligible for full federal funding of the fall 
campaign if he is the GOP nominee, Federal Election Commission 
spokeswoman Sharon Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Bush would be better equipped to fend off  
competition from Forbes, whose self-financed campaign won't be 
bound by spending limits either. 
</P>
<P>
	Political experts say that if anyone can raise $50 million, it  
would be Bush, son of the former president and brother of Florida 
Gov. Jeb Bush, both of whom have their own extensive fund-raising 
networks to augment his. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the fattest Rolodex of anybody,'' Republican political  
consultant Eddie Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
	American University political science professor Candice Nelson  
said bypassing the spending limits won't bother voters in 2000, 
considering that the Democratic and Republican parties raised $260 
million in unregulated ``soft money'' in the 1996 season and spent 
much of it on advertisements that aided their presidential 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actual spending limits were so dwarfed by what was spent  
with soft money that it's not an argument that people would worry 
about,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton considered forgoing federal funds in 1996 but  
ended up taking the money. Forbes spent $42 million, most of it 
from his own pocket, in 1996. Perot didn't seek federal funds for 
primaries or the general election, choosing to bankroll his own 
independent bids for president in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Forbes, the only major party contender who has  
rejected federal matching funds since the system was put in place 
for the 1976 election was former Texas Gov. John Connally in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Within next year's projected spending limit of $40 million,  
candidates can spend only a limited amount in each state. In 1996, 
Forbes spent huge amounts in early-voting states, causing headaches 
for eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit in 2000 is projected to be $1.1 million each in Iowa  
and $669,160 in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing the federal funds would mean Bush, like Forbes, could  
spend more money in key states. After all, Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack 
raised $2.9 million for his gubernatorial campaign last year. 
</P>
<P>
	To reach the $40 million, plus $5 million for overhead and legal  
fees that don't fall under the spending limit, Republican 
consultant Stan Huckaby projects that candidates need to raise just 
over $32 million, to be matched with a bit more than $13 million in 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on the other hand, would have to raise almost $50 million,  
most of it limited by law to checks of $1,000 or less. Because fund 
raising itself is expensive, it would take around $17 million to 
replace the matching funds. The government matches the first $250 
of each individual contribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Could Bush do it? Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	There are at least 50,000 donors who contributed $1,000 to a GOP  
presidential candidate in 1996, according to Huckaby's analysis. 
Bush would have to compete with other Republican candidates for 
their money and draw in new donors, perhaps through the various 
governors and other officials who have lined up to support him. 
</P>
<P>
	``A leading Republican challenger would have the ability to  
raise tremendous amounts of money,'' said Clinton's chief 
fund-raiser in 1996, Terence McAuliffe. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, an endless Bush fund-raising campaign could  
vacuum up millions of dollars otherwise earmarked for Republican 
congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the reasons Clinton agreed to the spending  
limits, McAuliffe said. ``If we go on forever raising money, it 
dries up money that is available for House candidates, Senate 
candidates and others.''

<HEADLINE> Chevron Refinery Explodes in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- An explosion at a Chevron oil refinery  
on the edge of San Francisco Bay on Thursday sent a huge pillar of 
black smoke into the air, forcing people to stay indoors with their 
windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokeswoman Marielle Boortz said all workers at the  
plant were accounted for and there were no injuries. Firefighters 
warned people to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
	A hospital in Richmond, about 10 miles northeast of San  
Francisco, said more than 100 people arrived complaining of 
breathing problems. Other hospitals in the area also reported 
seeing patients complaining of respiratory problems. Three 
firefighters were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Celia Orrick and her four children fled their apartment when  
they heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	They got on a bus to escape the smoke, but had to get off after  
a mile when her baby and 13-year-old son began vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky was pitch black,'' said Marvin Orrick, the son. ``We  
came outside and me and my mom's head started hurting. That's why 
we tried to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Stanton of the Richmond Fire Department said the smoke  
was not considered so toxic that people would drop where they 
stood, but it was a health hazard he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thick, roiling black smoke, visible from San Francisco to the  
east and from Marin County to the northeast drifted over Berkeley 
from the 97-year-old refinery, which processes about 240,000 
barrels of oil a day. The smoke dissipated about two hours after 
the blast and at 5 p.m. the fire was close to being out, according 
to Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people in the area reported having breathing problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Chevron said the explosion, which happened about 2:40 p.m., was  
from a pipe leading from a unit where impurities are removed from 
crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Fall by 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans claiming unemployment  
benefits fell to the lowest sustained level in a quarter century 
while sales of existing homes remained near record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 289,000 Americans filed applications for  
unemployment checks last week, down 10,000 from the week before, 
the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said Americans  
purchased existing homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.02 million in February, down just 0.4 percent from a record 5.04 
million pace in January and the third consecutive month above the 5 
million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the eighth consecutive week of jobless claims below  
300,000, the longest such stretch since 1973. It demonstrates the 
strong demand for labor in the U.S. economy even in the face of the 
nearly two-year-old world economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate survey shows factories have cut 337,000 jobs since  
March 1998, but apparently laid-off workers are finding jobs in 
service industries, which have been hurt less by international 
conditions than export-dependent manufacturing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a flurry of layoff notices late last year, companies  
appear to be managing expenses without widespread layoffs,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser of Bank of America Private Bank in 
Jacksonville, Fla. ``Indeed, many companies are struggling to fill 
various positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private New York-based research  
organization, said its index of help-wanted advertising fell 
slightly in February from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``there is no suggestion that demand for labor will  
slacken,'' said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. ``Tight 
labor market conditions remain firmly in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plentiful supply of jobs is among the factors supporting  
home sales, along with low mortgage rates and high stock prices. At 
mid-morning, the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks had risen 
130 points to 9,797, partly recovering from a 222-point loss on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Home resales last month were strongest in the South, up 4.1  
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.05 million. Sales 
rose 2.8 percent in the Northeast to a rate of 730,000. They fell 
0.9 percent in the West to 1.07 million and 7.8 percent in the 
Midwest to 1.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Realtors' economist James F. Smith said inclement weather  
temporarily depressed sales in parts of the Midwest and West. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no regions of the country that could be described as  
weak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median price of an existing home -- meaning half  
sold for more and half for less -- was $129,300 in February, up 3.9 
percent from a year ago. By region, the median price was $112,100 
in the South, up 1.4 percent; $152,300 in the Northeast, up 4 
percent; $174,800 in the West, up 7.2 percent, and $112,300 in the 
Midwest, up 5.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Missing Atheist's Ex-Manager Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A former office manager for missing atheist  
Madalyn Murray O'Hair has been arrested on a firearms charge, and a 
lawyer says he has been told by a federal prosecutor that the man 
has been implicated in her murder. 
</P>
<P>
	David Roland Waters, 52, was arrested Wednesday by agents from  
the FBI, Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms and charged with being a felon in possession 
of 119 rounds of ammunition, said Daryl Fields, spokesman for the 
U.S. attorney's office in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest Wednesday came as federal agents in Chicago, Fort  
Worth and Michigan questioned three other people about the 
mysterious 1995 disappearance of Mrs. O'Hair, the San Antonio 
Express-News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, said federal officials told him  
Waters was being implicated by others who were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in touch with the assistant U.S. attorney, and he  
said a bunch of people are rolling over on him and implicating him 
in the murder of the O'Hair family,'' Ganne told the Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors declined to discuss the allegation. They  
have not even said whether they think Mrs. O'Hair was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair the founder of American Atheists Inc., first gained  
fame when she took credit for a suit, already filed, that 
ultimately removed the Bible and sponsored prayer from public 
schools in the early 1960s. She would be about 80 now if still 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	She disappeared, along with son Jon Garth Murray and  
granddaughter Robin Murray O'Hair, in September 1995. A hasty note 
was found on their Austin office door telling staffers an emergency 
had arisen. 
</P>
<P>
	All three vanished along with $500,000 in gold coins.  
</P>
<P>
	The family was supposed to attend a protest in New York but  
never made it. A two-year global search by police detectives, 
reporters and investigators proved fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not charged in connection with the O'Hair disappearance,  
Waters for months has been the focus of police investigating the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are kicked back somewhere, very comfortable, and  
having chuckles,'' Waters was quoted as saying last fall about the 
O'Hair family. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those interviewed by police Wednesday was Gary P. Karr of  
Michigan, who served time with Waters in the same penitentiary in 
Illinois more than a decade ago, the Express-News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence indicates Karr came to South Texas from Florida in the  
summer of 1995 and spent part of that fall in San Antonio, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing today, Waters was ordered held without bond at the  
request of prosecutors who cited his criminal record but made no 
mention of Mrs. O'Hair and her family. A search warrant requested 
by a federal grand jury remains sealed. Waters did not enter a plea 
on the firearms charge. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on the firearms charge, he could face up to 10  
years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters was convicted of felony theft in 1994 in Travis County  
and on a state murder charge in Illinois in 1965. He currently is 
on probation after pleading guilty to skimming $54,000 from the 
O'Hair family's atheist organizations.

<HEADLINE> P.R. Firm Tries Formal Fridays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDISON, N.J. (AP) -- A man in a tuxedo looks over some papers. A  
woman in an evening gown sits in a nearby chair, talking on the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	A wedding reception, perhaps, or some fancy soiree? No, it's  
just Friday at the Pollak Agency, a marketing and public relations 
firm where dressing up -- not down -- has become a fashion statement 
that's also good for business. 
</P>
<P>
	They call it Formal Fridays.  
</P>
<P>
	``We get the strangest looks when we go into the deli for  
lunch,'' said art director Charlene DePrizio, clad in a black 
velvet floor-length gown with rhinestones all along the bodice. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal Fridays started about a year ago, the brainchild of  
Alison Pollak, director of media. Tired of having to dress in 
business wear for client presentations while others wore jeans, she 
suggested that all 10 employees at the firm try dressing to the 
hilt one Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought she was crazy, but everyone on staff liked the  
idea,'' said Alan Pollak, chairman of the company and Alison's 
father, who was wearing one of the three tuxedos he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	That one Friday led to another, and another. Along the way, what  
started as merely a fun idea became something of a statement. Some 
clients have started joining in, and the company even landed an 
account -- promoting pate -- from someone who read about Formal 
Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just called up, and said anyone who wears gowns and tuxedos  
knows pate,'' Alison Pollak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vastola, president of Exclusive Toy Products in  
Metuchen, N.J., is another Pollak customer taken with the idea, 
although he hasn't yet donned a tuxedo for meetings at the firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``You certainly remember that agency. It does give you the  
inkling that maybe this group is creative,'' said Vastola, whose 
company makes collectible dolls modeled after famous people such as 
Laurel and Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Formal Fridays are also a statement against what the Pollaks see  
as a business world that has gotten too casual. 
</P>
<P>
	Business casual used to mean not wearing a tie, said Helen  
Pollak, president of the agency, who was wearing a fur coat over 
her gold dress. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden it got to jeans,'' she said. ``Now it's  
reached a point where employers have to counsel employees on what's 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that dressing down has gone too far has been gaining  
popularity, those who watch the workplace say. 
</P>
<P>
	While he hadn't heard of any other companies doing anything  
similar to Pollak, trend analyst Tom Julian said he wasn't 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pendulum is swinging the other way,'' said Julian, with  
the New York-based ad agency Fallon McElligott. ``There is a 
concern that casual goes too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in some company hierarchies, dressing down can make  
some higher-ups ``wonder if they lose a sense of self'' or 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has gotten out of control,'' said Ilene Amiel, an image  
consultant from Scarsdale, N.Y. ``People are coming in looking 
sloppy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Pollak said productivity can suffer in a too-casual  
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mind gets casual,'' he said. ``If you get too casual at  
work, you lose your sharpness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not a problem at Formal Fridays, employees said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I find people are a little more clear in their diction,'' said  
the tuxedo-clad executive vice president, Sal Giacchi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm wearing three-inch heels,'' said Betty Uhler, production  
manager, in a glittery black dress with short sleeves. ``I'm 
walking a little slower, a little nicer. When you dress up, you sit 
up straight, act a little more elegant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every Friday has been formal. One week, the staff all wore  
pajamas. During Valentine's week, they all wore red. 
</P>
<P>
	For the women, Formal Fridays has another bonus -- a chance to  
wear all those fancy dresses that just seem to hang in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have several cocktail dresses that I don't get to wear often  
enough,'' DePrizio said. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be a little disconcerting, though, for those who don't  
expect it. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Pollak remembered a woman at a restaurant who tapped one of  
the tuxedo-clad employees as the group headed toward a table. 
</P>
<P>
	``Waiter,'' she asked, ``can I have a glass of water?''

<HEADLINE>  Microsoft Sends Settlement Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A formal proposal by Microsoft Corp. to settle  
its landmark antitrust case is receiving a cool reception from the 
government, with one official describing it as a ``minimalist 
opening offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which made the overture Wednesday, is refusing to  
accept any restrictions on what new features it can add to its 
dominant Windows operating system software. Experts believe any 
settlement is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, was expected to  
visit Washington today as part of a previously scheduled tour to 
promote his new book. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, attorneys general from the 19 states suing Microsoft  
also are meeting here for their annual conference, and they planned 
today to discuss the company's offer privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said he wants to reach a compromise but called it ``a  
little hard to speculate'' whether a deal is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to settle the thing,'' Gates said Wednesday in New  
York. ``If there's any reasonable way to settle this thing that 
preserves our ability to make Windows a better product, to keep 
supporting the Internet more and more, then we'd love to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who discussed  
Microsoft's proposal with Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, 
described it as ``a minimalist opening offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was far from what anyone in our group would expect to be  
adequate,'' said Lockyer, who hasn't yet read the settlement offer. 
A spokesman for Miller declined to comment. The Justice Department 
also declined to comment on Microsoft's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Any settlement is viewed as unlikely because the two sides  
remain far apart on core issues after almost five months of 
acrimonious courtroom fighting. The trial is tentatively scheduled 
to resume April 12, but both sides consider themselves under orders 
from the judge at least to explore a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The government faces genuine risks as it sits across the table  
from the technology industry's most famous titan. Gates was 
thinking moves ahead of government lawyers in a previous court 
fight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft then proposed agreeing never to require customers of  
its popular Windows software to buy any of its other products. But 
the company's lawyers also considered adding a provision that 
Microsoft would never be blocked from ``developing integrated 
products which offer technological advantages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates ordered his lawyers to remove the last four words, a  
subtle change but one so important that it would return to haunt 
the government years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice accepted the provision as part of a 1995 consent decree,  
and Microsoft later claimed the language allowed it to bundle its 
Internet software into its Windows operating system -- a core 
complaint in the government's current antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, whose software runs roughly 90 percent of the world's  
personal computers, has indicated it would consider changing some 
of its most controversial agreements with the nation's computer 
makers and Internet providers. But it won't accept restrictions on 
what new features it can add to its Windows software, echoing 
Gates' insistence during the 1994 negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft uses its market dominance  
to maintain its monopoly power and to extend its influence into 
emerging areas of technology, such as Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few key principles at stake,'' Gates said  
Wednesday. ``Our ability to innovate our product, our ability to 
support the Internet in the right way and to have integrity in our 
Windows product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An effort to reach a compromise last May broke down, and  
Microsoft already has started to formulate plans to appeal a trial 
verdict.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 44.85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly today on stable  
interest rates and a positive earnings report from Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter and Micron Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
144.85 at 9,811.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 4.99 Wednesday to 9,666.84, declining for the  
fourth straight session amid concerns that first-quarter earnings 
reports would be disappointing. NATO's bombing of targets in Kosovo 
also put a lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks rose as two strong economic reports had no effect  
on bond market interest rates. The Labor Department reported that 
unemployment claims fell last week, and the National Association of 
Realtors said sales of existing homes remained near record high 
levels in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates might have gone up on either of those reports,  
since the numbers could signal an increase in inflation. But the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 5.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also boosted by two earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter posted first-quarter profits of $1.76  
per share, far above the $1.34 expected by analysts. Morgan 
Stanley's shares were up 4 5/8 at 103 and boosted other financial 
services stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose after Wednesday's report from  
semiconductor maker Micron that it had turned a profit in its 
fiscal second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, and its  
stock was down 2 7/16 at 49 9/16. But the rest of the technology 
sector was higher. Dow component IBM was up 2 7/16 at 171 15/16, 
while Dell Computer was up 9/16 at 39 1/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP;  
Co., said that while Micron's results lifted technology stocks and 
the entire market, the overall outlook for earnings and the 
situation in Kosovo are still important concerns. ``I still think 
the market's suspect here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.11 at 1,286.70. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 48.31 at 2,413.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues had a strong 9-to-5 lead on decliners on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 363.86 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace of 346.31 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets relaxed after early anxieties over the attack,  
and made a strong comeback after a generous interest rate cut by 
Sweden. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.68 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.98 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Push $153M in Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a two-week congressional recess set to  
begin this weekend, farm state Democrats began an urgent push 
Thursday for passage of $153 million in emergency money for farm 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of a $1.3 billion supplemental bill that also  
includes aid for Central America. That measure is held up because 
lawmakers are at odds over some cuts Republicans have proposed to 
offset the spending. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has promised to veto that measure, and  
lawmakers are unsure if a compromise can be hammered out before the 
Easter holiday recess begins. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., said it was unlikely the supplemental would be 
passed by Friday. Instead, it will be completed after the recess, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the clock ticking down, Democratic congressional aides said  
late Thursday that Clinton was reviewing whether he could give the 
Agriculture Department the authority to reallocate funds within its 
budget to cover the emergency farm loans without congressional 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting some indications now the White House . . . may  
have a solution that can cover money within the department,'' said 
Mark Halverson, the Senate Agriculture Committee's Democratic 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic senators contended Thursday that farmers can't wait  
any longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to act now,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, the  
Agriculture Committee's top Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't wait another two and a half weeks to do this,'' said  
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``If we don't get this done, a lot of 
farmers are going to go under.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., ``We are just weeks away from  
spring planting. We face a very urgent situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used for direct loans or loan guarantees for  
an estimated 10,000 producers who can't get credit from private 
sources. The Agriculture Department has said a year of extremely 
low prices has led to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can say is Congress needs to act quickly,'' Agriculture  
Secretary Dan Glickman said Thursday. The Farm Service Agency 
offices ``have either run out or are about to run out of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the measure fails to pass before recess, Glickman said,  
``some people will be denied credit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are pushing to have the agriculture portion of the  
emergency bill pulled out so it can be acted upon separately. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lott's spokesman said there were no plans to act on the  
farm aid as a separate measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said that if a separate bill couldn't be passed, he would  
offer a measure that would give Glickman the authority to shift 
money within the agency budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan and other Democrats also pushed an amendment Thursday  
that would lift marketing loan rates and create a price support for 
farmers. The proposal, which would be attached to the fiscal year 
2000 budget resolution, has been pushed by Democrats since the 1996 
farm law, which began phasing out subsidies for farmers. Attempts 
to pass a similar measure failed last year.

<HEADLINE> Dad Convicted in Children's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A father was convicted of second-degree  
murder Thursday for letting his daughter and another baby die in a 
hot, unventilated car while he and a friend searched for arrowheads 
and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Crisp, 24, avoided a first-degree murder conviction in the  
deaths of his daughter, 16-month-old Vicky Crisp, and her cousin, 
4-month-old Sidney Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp huddled with family members and cried after the verdict  
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was to return Friday to recommend a sentence. Each  
conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. 
First-degree murder carries a maximum of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Crisp left the children strapped to their car  
seats for more than 25 hours in April of last year while he and a 
friend searched for arrowheads near Little Flock, in northwest 
Arkansas, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died of heat exhaustion and dehydration after they  
were left for several hours in an unventilated car that reached at 
least 130 degrees. Prosecutors have said the pain was so severe 
that Vicky pulled out her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler's friend, Justin Griffith, 28, pleaded guilty earlier  
this month to manslaughter. He has yet to be sentenced. Griffith 
said he and Crisp didn't plan to look for arrowheads and mushrooms 
for long, but lost track of time because they had taken drugs and 
alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Fall Below 7 Percent / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 7 percent this week for the first 
time in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The average declined to 6.98 percent, down from 7.01 percent the  
previous week and a 10-month high of 7.11 percent two weeks 
earlier. But the rate remains nearly a quarter percentage point 
higher than the 6.74 percent average at the end of January, Freddie 
Mac, the mortgage company, said Thursday. The average had held 
below 7 percent from mid-June of last year through February. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.61 percent this week, down from 6.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.69 percent, down from 5.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged just under 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Labor Market Powers Home Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans are claiming unemployment  
benefits than at any time during the past 25 years, and that 
healthy labor market is helping power near-record home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 289,000 Americans filed applications for  
unemployment checks last week, down 10,000 from the week before, 
the Labor Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the eighth consecutive week of jobless claims below  
300,000, the longest such stretch since 1973, demonstrating strong 
demand for labor in the face of the nearly 2-year-old world 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a flurry of layoff notices late last year, companies  
appear to be managing expenses without widespread layoffs,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser of Bank of America Private Bank in 
Jacksonville, Fla. ``Indeed, many companies are struggling to fill 
various positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said Americans  
purchased existing homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.02 million in February, down just 0.4 percent from a record 5.04 
million pace in January and the third consecutive month above the 5 
million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. manufacturers have cut 337,000 jobs since March  
1998, laid-off workers apparently are finding jobs in service 
industries, which are less affected by international economic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private New York-based research  
organization, said its index of help-wanted advertising fell 
slightly in February from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``there is no suggestion that demand for labor will  
slacken,'' said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. ``Tight 
labor market conditions remain firmly in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a piece of good news for one beleaguered manufacturing  
industry, the Commerce Department said imports of foreign steel 
declined for a fourth consecutive month in February, to 2 million 
metric tons, below pre-1998 levels for the first time since U.S. 
imports reached record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports from Japan, one of the leading sources of foreign steel,  
were cut in half. However, the two other targets of illegal trade 
complaints from U.S. steel producers, Russia and Brazil, posted 
slight increases in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to plentiful jobs, low mortgage rates and high stock  
prices are supporting home sales. The Dow Jones Industrial average 
last week came within a whisker of closing above 10,000 for the 
first time. It then lost 331 points over four sessions before 
rebounding 170 points Thursday, closing at 9,836. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged less than 7  
percent for the eighth consecutive month in February. But they rose 
slightly in March, averaging 6.98 percent this week following three 
consecutive weeks above 7 percent, said Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	That, along with a deceleration in economic growth, should  
dampen home sales somewhat later this year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect existing home sales to moderate,'' said economist  
Robert Barr of Fannie Mae. ``But when we say it's going to 
moderate, we mean it's going to moderate from very strong to 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Home resales last month were highest in the South, up 4.1  
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.05 million. Sales 
rose 2.8 percent in the Northeast to a rate of 730,000. They fell 
0.9 percent in the West to 1.07 million and 7.8 percent in the 
Midwest to 1.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Realtors' economist James F. Smith said inclement weather  
temporarily depressed sales in parts of the Midwest and West. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no regions of the country that could be described as  
weak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median price of an existing home -- meaning half  
sold for more and half for less -- was $129,300 in February, up 3.9 
percent from a year ago. By region, the median price was $112,100 
in the South, up 1.4 percent; $152,300 in the Northeast, up 4 
percent; $174,800 in the West, up 7.2 percent, and $112,300 in the 
Midwest, up 5.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Stick to Routine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Superstition saved Jim O'Brien's  
hair -- sparing everyone else from what could have been a scary 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio State coach had agreed to do a Mr. Clean with the rest  
of the team if it made it to the Final Four. But sometime after the 
Buckeyes' victory over St. John's in the regional final, their 
superstitious side took over. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all said, 'We don't want to change anything. We just want  
to keep the routine, we want to keep what we're doing. We don't 
want to screw anything up. Why mess with it?''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 48-year-old O'Brien ran his fingers through his short,  
graying hair and laughed. He has no intention of changing his 
team's quirky ways. 
</P>
<P>
	So, before Ohio State plays Connecticut on Saturday night in the  
national semifinals at Tropicana Field, rest assured the Buckeyes 
will be listening to Scoonie Penn's boom box, following him on the 
court and letting him take the first practice shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, they will sit in exactly the same order in  
precisely the same seats on the bus to the arena. And in the 
pregame meeting, they will sit in the same configuration before 
O'Brien -- four chairs in a row at the front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it interesting,'' O'Brien said, shaking his head. ``I'm  
not going to get in the way of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the Buckeyes' fire hydrant-sized point guard, argues that  
the team is not superstitious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just been our routine the whole season,'' he said. ``Now  
people are looking for the answer to why we're winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But senior forward Jason Singleton has no doubt a superstitious  
streak runs through the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie took his boom box to Puerto Rico and we won that  
tournament,'' Singleton said. ``He didn't take it to the Big Ten 
tournament and we lost. So we put two and two together and we 
figure we've got to take it to all our NCAA tournament games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn is always the first in the line of Buckeyes going out on  
the court before a game and at halftime, and center Ken Johnson is 
always last. Penn always takes the first shot in warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't end there. Penn, Singleton and Neshaun Coleman -- the  
team's captains -- are the first players in the three-man weave 
drill in practice. Team trainer Mike Bordner always tapes ankles in 
the same order -- right ankles then left, with a tap on the bottom 
of the foot at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordner also has worn the same suit for each NCAA tournament  
game, with the small pins given to each participant arranged in the 
same order on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said many of the team's peculiarities stem from Penn's  
desire for order. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes direction, he likes organization,'' O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the year, to break up the monotony of another  
practice and another repetitious drill, O'Brien decided to shake 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my infinite wisdom I decided, why don't we just have  
shooting games instead and make it a little bit light? Guys can 
just choose up teams and we'll have a little tournament and we'll 
keep it competitive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Penn didn't like it.  
</P>
<P>
	A few practices later, O'Brien asked the team what it wanted to  
do in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie said, 'No shooting games! Let's do our routine and do  
it the same way we always do,''' O'Brien said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn was asked what would happen if he didn't come out first and  
didn't take the first shot in warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing,'' he said. ``But I'm not going to test it.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Deal Subs Nunnally and Fordyce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds traded backup  
outfielder Jon Nunnally to the Boston Red Sox and third-string 
catcher Brook Fordyce to the Chicago White Sox for minor leaguers 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player had minor-league options left and neither fit  
into the club's plans this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Nunnally, the Reds received right-hander Pat  
Flury, a 26-year-old pitcher who has bounced around the minors for 
six years. The White Sox gave up right-hander Jake Meyer, who has 
spent two years in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two years ago, Nunnally was being mentioned as a possible  
cornerstone of the Reds' rebuilding. He and Chris Stynes, who came 
to the Reds in a trade with Kansas City, were the club's hottest 
hitters in the second half of the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nunnally got news of the trade on Thursday, Stynes perched  
himself on a chair nearby and listened with his head down while 
Nunnally talked about his next opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sad, man,'' Stynes said.  
</P>
<P>
	After hitting .318 with 13 homers in only 65 games for the Reds  
in 1997, Nunnally slumped to .207 with seven homers in 74 games 
last season. He also had a falling out with manager Jack McKeon, 
who wanted him to hit to all fields instead of pulling the ball and 
trying for homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunnally, 27, knew there was no place for him in an already  
crowded outfield. He was passed by as the Reds acquired Dmitri 
Young, Greg Vaughn, Mark Sweeney, Mike Cameron and Michael Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy I'm going to a place where I'll have a chance to  
play,'' Nunnally said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds carried Fordyce, 28, on the major league roster as a  
seldom-used third catcher in 1997 because they were afraid they'd 
lose him if they tried to send him to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a solid defensive catcher who has never hit much. He batted  
.208 with one homer in 47 games during 1997 and .253 with three 
homers in 57 games last season as Eddie Taubensee's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds decided to carry Taubensee and Brian Johnson as their  
two catchers this season. Fordyce never complained about his lack 
of playing time -- his biggest role the last two seasons was 
catching ceremonial first pitches before home games -- and hopes to 
have a bigger role in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've been in the big leagues for the last two years,  
but I want to know I can contribute,'' Fordyce said. ``I hope I can 
do that with the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day. I've been patient and hopefully things will  
work out for me for being patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flury throws hard but has struggled with his control. Meyer had  
a 3.16 earned run average and 13 saves in 46 relief appearances for 
Chicago's Class A teams in Hickory and Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he can be a solid setup guy in the big leagues down  
the road,'' general manager Jim Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Colon Signs $9.25M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Something happened in the past two  
weeks that seemed to make the Cleveland Indians' offer of a 
long-term contract more appealing to Bartolo Colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it the Kerry Wood clause.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon, who has been seeking a multiyear deal with the Indians  
for the past two seasons, agreed Thursday to a $9.25 million, 
four-year contract with a club option for 2003 that could make the 
deal worth $15 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon and his agent, Mitch Frankel, wouldn't admit it, but when  
Wood went down with a season-ending elbow injury earlier this 
month, Colon may have decided it was time to finally sign with 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of staying with his original one-year deal -- it would  
have paid him $221,000 in the majors, $153,000 in the minors -- 
Colon gets a $500,000 signing bonus, $500,000 this year, $1 million 
in 2000, $2.5 million in 2001 and $4.5 million in 2002. Cleveland's 
option is at $6 million with a $250,000 buyout, and Colon can earn 
additional money with performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said before, I don't think there's any team in major  
league baseball that would not want to have Bartolo Colon in its 
rotation,'' Indians general manager John Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are hoping Colon, 23, can build on a solid but  
inconsistent first year in the big leagues. His '98 season was 
highlighted by an All-Star appearance and a complete game shutout 
of the New York Yankees in the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a breakout, breakthrough year,'' Hart said.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon finished 14-9 with a 3.71 ERA in 1998, leading the team  
with six complete games and two shutouts while pitching 204 
innings. He earned his first All-Star selection after going 9-4 in 
the first half with a league-best 2.46 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Having never pitched more than 128 innings in a season, he  
struggled in the second half, going 5-5 with a 5.65 ERA in 14 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon's deal is similar to the $9 million, four-year contract  
Jaret Wright signed with the Indians last October. Frankel admitted 
he factored Wright's numbers into his negotiations with the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wright's contract was a barometer,'' Frankel said.  
``It was something to work from. Jaret's contract was relevant but 
it wasn't a hindrance or a help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 22-year-old Wright and Colon, the Indians have two of the  
most promising young pitchers in baseball. By signing both to 
long-term deals, the club is avoiding the possibility of having to 
shell out bigger bucks to either in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Cleveland just has to hope one of them can emerge as a  
bonafide No. 1 starter capable of winning 20 games and carrying the 
team to a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's to a great advantage for this franchise to  
have both Jaret Wright and Bartolo Colon as one-plus pitchers 
signed to through their arbitration years. It's very meaningful and 
certainly a commitment, but we're throwing our lot into these 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, who a few years ago began the trend of signing young  
players to long-term deals, said he isn't worried about any drop 
off in Colon now that he is financially secure for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really works in just the opposite (way),'' Hart said.  
``These young players have things they want to accomplish in the 
game. This is really the first bite out of the apple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colon had little to say during the news conference, deferring to  
his adviser, Carmen Feliciano, and Frankel to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon said the only plans he has made so far with his new  
contract was to build a new home for his parents in the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being from a poor family,'' he said through an interpreter,  
``this means I can help out my wife, my mom, my dad so this means a 
lot to me.''

	NATO Chief: Attack Was a Success  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana  
says initial reports indicate the first phase of air operations 
against Yugoslavia were successful, and NATO's top general says 
they attacks will continue as long as President Slobodan Milosevic 
makes it necessary. ``The strikes were against carefully chosen 
targets,'' Solana told reporters at NATO headquarters today. 

</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia Says 10 Killed, 38 Hurt  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia defiantly absorbed its  
first night of punishment from NATO air power, claiming 10 people 
were killed and 38 wounded overnight in an aerial barrage intended 
to force President Slobodan Milosevic to make peace in Kosovo. The 
army reiterated its defiance after a night of strikes on more than 
50 targets, saying the ``high morale of the units was preserved.'' 
Air raid sirens blared today and the state news agency reported 
more fighting in Kosovo. It was not immediately clear if further 
NATO attacks took place in daylight. 

</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia Boots Foreign Journalists  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian government today ordered  
the expulsion of all foreign journalists from countries involved in 
the NATO airstrikes. A statement faxed to The Associated Press 
said: ``Journalists of foreign public media from the countries that 
took part or allowed their territories to be used in NATO 
aggression on our country will be expelled.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Russia Reverses NATO Decisions  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia appears to be backing away from  
confrontation with the United States and its NATO allies over 
airstrikes on Yugoslavia. President Boris Yeltsin said yesterday 
that Russia was halting cooperation with NATO, recalling its chief 
military envoy and closing its offices at NATO headquarters. 
However, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported today that Russia would 
keep its NATO offices open and apparently would continue to take 
part in alliance programs. Despite its staunch support for 
Yugoslavia, Russia's options are limited. It is no longer a major 
military power, and it desperately wants Western aid to revive its 
shattered economy.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian rested his defense  
without witnesses today after a judge refused to let him call the 
widow and brother of the man he is accused of murdering. Kevorkian 
is accused of killing Thomas Youk, 52, who had Lou Gehrig's 
disease. He claims it was a mercy killing, not first-degree murder. 
He wanted relatives of Youk to take the stand to back his claim but 
the judge ruled that Michigan law doesn't recognize the consent of 
the victim as a defense to murder.

failure to address grievances from the crackdown had created a

ahead of the 10th anniversary of the student-led demonstrations and 
the crackdown that killed hundreds on June 4, 1989.

<HEADLINE> McDougal Forgets Whitewater Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Repeatedly stating ``I don't recall''  
and ``I don't remember,'' Susan McDougal testified Thursday that 
she had forgotten what little she knew in the 1980s about the 
fraudulent land deals at the heart of the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In her second day under cross-examination by one of Kenneth  
Starr's prosecutors, President Clinton's ex-Whitewater partner was 
confronted with information she provided to accountants in 1986 
about the late James McDougal's failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal continued to maintain that she knew little about  
the financial deals. ``I was talking to Jim'' and passing along 
what he said to the accountants, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Her ex-husband had suffered a stroke after federal regulators  
removed him from the S&AMP;L. Accountants were trying to track the 
losses to the institution caused by the McDougals' numerous real 
estate projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors then started to show a videotape to the jury of Mrs.  
McDougal's interview several years ago with ABC in which she talked 
about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	In one out-take, Mrs. McDougal, who had been convicted and  
sentenced before the interview, is asked what is the one thing she 
wants to say after four years of silence in the Whitewater 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joking manner, Mrs. McDougal said ``that I hate'' the  
prosecutors ``and that I want them dead and their children dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of questioning by prosecutor Mark Barrett, Mrs.  
McDougal said more than 40 times that she did not recall various 
business deals. She said her former husband, who died in federal 
prison last year, handled most of the financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't someone who studied business ... but generally I  
agreed with Jim,'' she told the jury in her criminal contempt and 
obstruction trial, which is in its third week. 
</P>
<P>
	James and Susan McDougal were partners with the president and  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Whitewater land 
development project. 
</P>
<P>
	She is on trial for criminal contempt and obstruction of justice  
for refusing to answer questions before a federal grand jury in the 
Whitewater investigation. Mrs. McDougal contends prosecutors were 
pressuring her to give false grand jury testimony to implicate the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Mrs. McDougal testified that she didn't remember  
dealing personally with former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker on a 
proposed shopping center, even though the accountants' written 
summary of her 1986 interview said she dealt with Tucker on the 
project, which was never built. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed shopping center was an important part of the 1996  
fraud case against the McDougals and Tucker, each of whom was 
convicted of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also said she had only a vague recollection of a  
utility company that the McDougals' S&AMP;L sold to a company 
controlled by Tucker. The sale generated a five-figure real estate 
commission in Mrs. McDougal's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal said that such commission checks probably went  
directly to her husband even though they were made out in her name, 
and that she wouldn't have known about them. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility company also was an important focus of the 1996  
Whitewater trial and provided the basis for Tucker's convictions. A 
company he set up never repaid the federally backed $150,000 loan 
that was the down payment for the utility.

<HEADLINE> Final Four Point Guards Make Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Before he ever suited up for Ohio  
State, Scoonie Penn was already laying the groundwork for the 
Buckeyes' first trip to the Final Four in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn sat out last season after transferring to the Big Ten  
school from Boston College, and the 5-foot-10 point guard was 
determined to get ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of going through the motions when there were no games to  
prepare for, he pushed himself in practice and worked himself into 
a position to help the Buckeyes achieve more than many thought 
possible this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to him in terms of `When you come to practice every  
day, you've got to treat it as if that's your game. You've got to 
make this competitive, and you've got to try to win every 
situation.' He was able to do that,'' coach Jim O'Brien recalled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only had seven or eight scholarship players on our team a  
year ago ... Scoonie would play with the other guys, the walk-ons, 
and they would beat our starters. That was the challenge we were 
giving to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he hasn't let up.  
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is in the Final Four for the first time since 1968,  
thanks in no small part to Penn, who averaged 17.1 points and 4.3 
assists to share Big Ten player of the year honors with another 
Final Four point guard, Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a coaching cliche, but he really is somebody who's  
coaching the guys,'' O'Brien said. ``If I just sat there and kept 
my mouth shut, you know things would get done the way you want them 
to be done because of Scoonie's knowledge of what should get 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The point guards for the teams headed to St. Petersburg for  
Saturday's national semifinals were a hot topic of discussion among 
the coaches in a conference call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Penn and Cleaves in leading their teams within two  
victories of a national title are Duke's William Avery and 
Connecticut's Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	``This tournament has as good a (group of) four point guards as  
I've seen in a long time. They all may do different things, but the 
common ground for them is they all run their teams and have the 
respect of the other players,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cleaves and Penn shared the player of the year award in  
their conference, El-Amin has a reputation for doing whatever is 
necessary to help Connecticut win. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski says 
Avery has improved in his first year as a starter as much as any 
point guard he's ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as us coaches think we feel on the sidelines, somebody  
out on the court can feel the pulse of a team and the other team 
and react instinctively to that feel,'' Krzyzewski said of the 
importance of having an accomplished point guard. ``If you have a 
good one, it makes you look great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the floor leaders among the finalists leads his team in  
scoring, but there's no question where the Blue Devils, Buckeyes, 
Huskies and Spartans look for guidance in tight situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very simply, the people who have the ball in their hands the  
most time end up controlling the game. That's kind of a simple 
explanation of why all four of us, I'm sure, are here,'' 
Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly in our case, Khalid has been our energizer. He was  
0-for-12 against Gonzaga and yet down the stretch still was the guy 
who made the difference ... He makes us go, not only physically but 
psychologically. He really truly is the guy the kids turn to for 
energy, for direction, and sometimes for courage. He's that type of 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun looks at Penn, who the Huskies are familiar with from  
his days in the Big East, and sees a lot of El-Amin, and vice 
versa. He said both players have a rare ability to make everyone 
around them better. 
</P>
<P>
	``You call it charisma, you call it energy, you call it  
leadership, you call it competitiveness,'' Calhoun said. ``Those 
are attributes they both have and are able to impart to their 
teammates. That's a very, very unusual characteristic to have, not 
only in sport but in life.''

<HEADLINE> Sprint Long Distance Chief Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Inc. executives are using the  
resignation of the head of the company's long-distance division to 
reshape Sprint's focus on long-distance customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pattie Manuel, 41, who has held the post since February 1998,  
said Thursday that she is leaving Sprint to pursue other interests. 
Manuel joined the company in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``After nearly 20 years in the telecommunications industry, I  
feel it is time to look at new challenges in other arenas,'' Manuel 
said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald T. LeMay, Sprint's president and chief operating officer,  
said Manuel will not be replaced. Instead, the company will create 
two separate units serving long-distance consumers and business 
customers. Both units will report directly to LeMay, Sprint 
spokesman Bill White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of boundaries determined by technology and regulation,  
we are beginning to position Sprint by markets,'' LeMay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a news report published Thursday suggests Sprint  
could be in for some major changes in its overseas operations. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement to dissolve the Global One telecommunications  
consortium of Sprint, France Telecom and Germany's Deutsche Telekom 
could come within six weeks, according to a report in Thursday's 
New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One was formed in 1996 to offer large multinational  
corporations complete, integrated telecommunications services 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives close to Global One told the newspaper that Sprint  
chairman William T. Esrey sent a letter three weeks ago to 
executives at Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom that said the 
venture was failing, and decisive moves should be made to resolve 
the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	White on Thursday called the report ``speculative.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe very meaningful progress towards profit is  
happening at Global One,'' White said. ``We're very optimistic 
about its potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday afternoon, the three companies released a statement in  
support of the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint stand by Global  
One and are convinced that the joint venture will achieve the goals 
that have been set. The management staff of Global One is on the 
right path with the restructuring that is now taking place and 
expects to break even by the year 2001,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Global One has undergone some positive changes in the last year,  
said Anthony Ferrugia, a telecommunications analyst with A.G. 
Edwards in St. Louis. A new executive team led by Gary Forsee, 
former head of Sprint's long-distance operations, has implemented 
rigid cost controls while focusing on integrating the partners' 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been making very good progress,'' Ferrugia said. He said  
he believes the venture will be profitable in the next 12 to 24 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrugia said he doubted reports that Sprint was trying to  
derail its partnership with Deutsche Telekom and French Telecom in 
order to increase its potential as an acquisition target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partnership is the cornerstone of their international  
strategy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Ferrugia said the Sprint's value would not decline if the  
partnership were to dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be no shortage of suitors,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sprint rose $3.50 on the New York Stock Exchange to  
close at $99.50.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Faneuil Adams Jr., who ran a program that  
brought chess to inner-city schools, died Monday of a brain tumor. 
He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	A direct descendant of Samuel Adams, a signer of the Declaration  
of Independence, and Peter Faneuil, for whom Boston's Faneuil Hall 
is named, Adams was one of America's premier patrons and 
aficionados of chess and its top players. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a Bronze Star for his service in World War II and the  
Korean War. Adams worked for the Mobil Corporation for 28 years, 
serving as president of Mobil South Inc. and of affiliates in Japan 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring in 1985, Adams devoted himself to chess, serving  
as president of Chess-in-the-Schools, treasurer of the Manhattan 
Chess Club, and as American delegate to FIDE, the International 
Chess Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Chess-in-the-Schools conducts programs in 160 city schools and  
has sent teams to national and international scholastic 
competitions.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Adm. William F. ``Bush'' Bringle, a World War  
II aviator who worked his way through the ranks of naval air forces 
in the Pacific Fleet and in Europe, died Friday of pneumonia. He 
was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringle was nicknamed ``Bush'' because of his thick head of  
curly hair. His World War II awards included the Navy Cross, the 
Distinguished Flying Cross with five gold stars and the French 
Croix de Guerre. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, as commander of the fledgling Kitty Hawk, Bringle took

	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Bill First, a former newsman who became a  
longtime spokesman for former House Speaker Tom Foley, died Tuesday 
of a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	First served more than 20 years as press spokesman for Foley,  
D-Wash., now U.S. ambassador to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	First served in the Navy in the Philippines during World War II  
and moved to the Northwest in the 1950s where he was a reporter for 
The Spokesman-Review in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>

	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Henry V. Graham, the National Guard  
general in 1963 who told Gov. George C. Wallace that he would have 
to step aside when Wallace made his famous ``stand in the 
schoolhouse door'' in support of segregation, died Sunday at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, a real estate dealer in Birmingham, suffered from  
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the showdown with Wallace at the University of Alabama,  
Graham played several other key roles in the civil rights movement 
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Graham and the National Guard helped calm a white mob  
and avert violence when a group of Freedom Riders arrived at the 
Montgomery bus station.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr., who spent 36 years in the  
Baltimore Orioles' baseball organization as a scout, coach and 
manager, and whose family included future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken 
Jr., and Bill Ripken, who also played with Baltimore, died Thursday 
of lung cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken taught Cal and Bill about baseball while serving as a  
minor league manager. He won 964 games in the minors and was 68-101 
as manager of the Orioles in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Ripken Sr. became the first father ever to manage two  
sons simultaneously in the majors. Cal Jr. was in the middle of a 
major league record consecutive games streak that would extend to 
2,632 games. Bill was the Orioles' second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was fired after the Orioles opened the 1988 season  
with six straight losses in what would ultimately be a record 
21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually returned to his old role as third-base coach and  
maintained the position through the end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. began his career with the Orioles as a catcher with  
the team's Phoenix affiliate in 1957. He ended his playing career 
in 1964 having never reached the major leagues.

	MANATEE, Fla. (AP) -- Birdie Tebbetts, who spent 56 years in  
major league baseball as player, manager and scout, died Wednesday 
of congestive heart failure. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Tebbetts, a four-time All Star, was a catcher from 1936-52 with  
the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Tigers' 1940 team that made it to the  
World Series with a pitching staff that included Schoolboy Rowe, 
Bobo Newsom and Dizzy Trout, and a batting order led by Hank 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1953-1965, he managed the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Braves  
and Cleveland. A heart attack ended his active days in 1965, but in 
1968 he started a scouting career that lasted through 1994.

<HEADLINE> City Divided Over Drag Queen `Nuns' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For years, the Sisters of Perpetual  
Indulgence -- ``nuns'' of a decidedly different order -- have 
sashayed about in habits and glittering makeup to raise money for 
AIDS and gay rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're clashing with Roman Catholics who take offense at  
the day the ``sisters,'' have chosen to celebrate their 20th 
anniversary bash: Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fete has divided a city famous for its tolerance. Catholics  
say it's akin to letting Nazis party on Passover, while the group 
members say it's nothing more than their anniversary date. 
</P>
<P>
	The group and its antics, including the use of outlandish  
pseudonyms such as ``Sister Hellen Wheels'' and ``Sister Reyna 
Terror,'' have long been a staple of San Francisco's colorful 
community. When members sought a permit to close down a block for 
their celebration, the request got unanimous approval from the 
Board of Supervisors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But Catholics protested, and the Archdiocese of San Francisco  
urged parishioners to contact city officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group has been notorious in its mockery, ridicule and  
denigration of the church,'' archdiocese spokesman Maurice Healy 
said Wednesday. ``While we are offended by what they do, we're 
simply asking 'Please don't do it on Easter Sunday, the holiest day 
of the Christian year.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Mayor Willie Brown and two other city officials  
backtracked, asking fellow supervisors to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``That particular day is extraordinarily symbolic to  
Catholics,'' Brown said. ``I would hope that the `sisters' could 
select some other day on which to do their thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Group members say they're not backing down. The party -- with its  
picnic baskets, performances and bonnet contest -- will go on, 
``Sister Ann R. Key,'' one of the few female members, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not everyone does exactly what the Catholic Church does or  
says to do on Easter Sunday,'' she said. ``And it's fine by us if 
other people want to celebrate Easter that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archdiocese, in an editorial to be published Friday in the  
newspaper Catholic San Francisco, is calling for ``calm and clear 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We should resist the tendency to condemn those who disagree  
with us and avoid the temptation to demonize one another,'' reads 
the editorial. ``Indeed, the current issue should not be allowed to 
become a test of wills between the Catholic and gay communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Group members say it's a lot of controversy for a group that  
simply tries to use humor to do good. 
</P>
<P>
	The order came into being in 1979, when a couple of men got  
dressed in the habits they acquired while doing ``The Sound of 
Music'' and went out on Easter Sunday. They wanted to buck the 
image of the macho gay man and instead found a new calling. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1983, the group took on a new role: activism. They founded  
the AIDS candlelight vigil that year, and since have raised funds 
for AIDS, youth and breast cancer groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, there are about 30 active members -- men and women, gay  
and straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of their antics have raised the ire of Catholics, including  
an ``exorcism'' during the pope's visit in 1987 and its ``Condom 
Savior Mass,'' which celebrates ``the Latex Host.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If a group of adolescent men display their prejudice by  
mocking and ridiculing religious women, that is their problem,'' 
Sister Roseanne Murphy, a bona fide Catholic nun, wrote in a 
newspaper editorial this week, calling the board's vote 
``appalling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But members of the group say the whiteface, campy getups,  
outlandish pseudonyms and irreverence bring a measure of hilarity 
to some serious issues in the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can add humor to a situation that has been very painful,''  
``Sister Ann'' said. ``People can be more vulnerable around us when 
I'm a `sister.'''

<HEADLINE> Rubin Warns Congress on Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin warned  
Thursday of adverse consequences in financial markets if Congress 
taps money appropriated for the World Bank and other international 
lending agencies to offset emergency spending for the victims of 
Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	He told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee the move would make  
it more expensive for the World Bank and other international 
agencies to raise money in capital markets for loans because it 
would call into question the collateral for those loans put up by 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves offsets that the House used in passing a  
$1.3 billion emergency spending measure Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	To deal with tight spending caps approved in 1997, the House  
offset part of the emergency bill by revoking $648 million 
previously appropriated as collateral for loans made by the World 
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of a total of $12.5 billion in so-called  
callable capital -- resources the United States has committed to 
international lending agencies, which can use the money as 
collateral for loans they make. 
</P>
<P>
	While the $648 million only would be a small portion of this  
amount, Rubin warned it would establish a dangerous precedent and 
introduce ``serious skittishness'' in financial markets about the 
depth of America's backing to the lending institutions. Heightened 
concern in the markets would raise the cost of borrowing money by 
these agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said World Bank President James Wolfensohn was ``deeply  
disturbed'' about the House bill and its impact on the bank's 
ability to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department also released a letter expressing  
concern from the Bretton Woods Committee, a group of former 
government officials who monitor operations of the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disturbing reports from Wall Street say some bondholders are  
already growing nervous over the threat and are dumping their World 
Bank bonds,'' James Orr, executive director of the group, said in a 
letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has threatened a presidential veto unless the  
House and the Senate come up with different ways to offset the 
emergency spending. The Senate did not follow the House approach of 
tapping World Bank money but it used other offsets the 
administration finds objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Republican Ted  
Stevens of Alaska, told Rubin the administration would have to 
offer its own offsets for the emergency spending. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration is searching for ways to offset the  
emergency spending, Rubin said he believed both the administration 
and Congress would have to find ways to raise the spending caps for 
the budget year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think at the end of the year, the administration and  
Congress will have to find additional resources,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 44.85 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *PM-Wall Street Noon,0456    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly today on stable  
interest rates and a positive earnings report from Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter and Micron Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
144.85 at 9,811.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 4.99 Wednesday to 9,666.84, declining for the  
fourth straight session amid concerns that first-quarter earnings 
reports would be disappointing. NATO's bombing of targets in Kosovo 
also put a lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks rose as two strong economic reports had no effect  
on bond market interest rates. The Labor Department reported that 
unemployment claims fell last week, and the National Association of 
Realtors said sales of existing homes remained near record high 
levels in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates might have gone up on either of those reports,  
since the numbers could signal an increase in inflation. But the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 5.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also boosted by two earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter posted first-quarter profits of $1.76  
per share, far above the $1.34 expected by analysts. Morgan 
Stanley's shares were up 4 5/8 at 103 and boosted other financial

	Technology stocks rose after Wednesday's report from  
semiconductor maker Micron that it had turned a profit in its 
fiscal second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, and its  
stock was down 2 7/16 at 49 9/16. But the rest of the technology 
sector was higher. Dow component IBM was up 2 7/16 at 171 15/16, 
while Dell Computer was up 9/16 at 39 1/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP;  
Co., said that while Micron's results lifted technology stocks and 
the entire market, the overall outlook for earnings and the 
situation in Kosovo are still important concerns. ``I still think 
the market's suspect here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.11 at 1,286.70. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 48.31 at 2,413.59.

<P>
	Advancing issues had a strong 9-to-5 lead on decliners on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 363.86 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace of 346.31 million.

<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets relaxed after early anxieties over the attack,  
and made a strong comeback after a generous interest rate cut by 
Sweden. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.68 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.98 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Duke Aims To Stop Miller Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- They look alike, play alike and sound  
alike. And if there was any lingering doubt about whether Kelly and 
Coco Miller are related, consider this: Each reached 1,000 career 
points in her 57th college game. 
</P>
<P>
	The identical twins, who average a combined 37 points per game  
in the Georgia backcourt, present a double challenge for Duke in 
Friday's first semifinal game at the women's NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching the twins is an incredible experience,'' Duke coach  
Gail Goestenkors said. ``It's an exciting brand of basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly averaged 18.6 points per game this season for the Lady  
Bulldogs, and Coco averaged 18.4. They swapped the team lead for 
scoring six times, with Kelly overtaking her sister by scoring a 
career-high 33 points in Georgia's 89-71 win over Iowa State in the 
Mideast Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our personalities are very similar,'' Kelly said.  
``And we've played together for so long I think that helps a lot on 
the court. We love to play together. We are close. I think it has 
strengthened the bond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 sophomore sisters started playing basketball as 4  
year olds in Rochester, Minn. They are considered the best twins in 
women's basketball since Pam and Paula McGee played at Southern 
California during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia coach Andy Landers has coached three sets of twins, and  
tries to downplay the novelty of coaching such similar players. 
When asked for humorous anecdotes about the twins, such as cases of 
mistaken identity, he was at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to burst your bubble,'' he said. ``I can't tell you  
a lot of funny stories because we've worked hard at treating them 
as individuals. While they look alike, they're not alike. Do they 
have a lot of common bonds? Yes. But I hope everybody on our team 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coco is a slightly better outside shooter. Kelly has more  
rebounds, steals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way that they move is very different,'' Landers said.  
``You can just look across the floor and know who it is, who is 
running or dribbling or shooting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Georgia is in its third Final Four since 1995, the Lady  
Bulldogs have been overshadowed in recent years by Southeastern 
Conference peer Tennessee -- whose run of three straight national 
championships ended with a loss to Duke in the East Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which is playing in its first Final Four, has been  
overshadowed by its men's team -- which is a strong favorite to win 
the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the female Blue Devils have generated relatively  
little enthusiasm back home on a campus infatuated by the men's 
team, Goestenkors said being associated with the men's squad has 
been good for her program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never felt like we were in the shadow of our men's  
program,'' she said. ``I have always felt like our men's basketball 
program casts a light on us and on our entire university. I think 
it is a huge benefit that our men's program is so successful.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Named Top Gospel Artist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Although Michael W. Smith got the lion's  
share of the trophies at the 30th Annual Dove Awards, he steered 
all the glory and praise to his true inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian singer, whose six awards Wednesday included best  
artist, said the main focus should ``be all about glorifying God, 
and that's still my prayer at the end of this show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar sentiments were voiced by Kirk Franklin, whose four  
awards included best contemporary gospel album (``Nu Nation 
Project'') and best urban song (``Revolution.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to reach the people and I want to be pleasing to Him,''  
Franklin said. ``That's all I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dove Awards, handed out by the Gospel Music Association,  
honor Christian music in 43 categories spanning several music 
genres. 
</P>
<P>
	In the major awards, 19-year-old Jaci Valesquez won best female  
vocalist; Jennifer Knapp was named best new artist; and Chris Rice 
was named best male vocalist. Point of Grace won the best group 
Dove Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern gospel veteran Bill Gaither won four awards.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith was also honored as the best record producer and got two  
awards apiece for work on his ``Live the Life'' album and 
``Exodus,'' a multi-artist compilation he produced. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time he had ever won the best artist award.  
</P>
<P>
	``It took my breath away for a moment, but I survived,'' Smith  
said backstage. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances showcased the diversity of Christian music styles.  
Velasquez did a flamenco-flavored number, the Newsboys and dc Talk 
played alternative rock and Franklin and his group Nu Nation did a 
rousing black gospel finale that featured guest singers including 
CeCe Winans. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the GMA once again recognized singer-songwriter Rich  
Mullins posthumously. Mullins, who was named best artist last year 
after dying in a car wreck in September 1997, was voted this year's 
best songwriter and shared an award for best song with co-writer 
Mitch McVicker for ``My Deliverer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just nice to see some respect and honor given to  
Rich,'' said McVicker, who survived the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The GMA consists of 6,000 industry members. The organization was  
founded in 1964 to promote gospel music.

<HEADLINE> Goodwin Named Next United Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines has chosen a company insider to  
succeed Gerald Greenwald as chief executive, helping the carrier 
maintain a steady course as it begins to consider renewing its 
employee ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Goodwin, who just six months ago was appointed UAL  
Corp.'s president and chief operating officer after 32 years with 
the company, now is faced with trying to satisfy both Wall Street 
and the carrier's unions in coming months as the nation's airlines 
struggle to keep costs low and profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	The retiring Greenwald, the former Chrysler Corp. executive who  
brought United an unprecedented five-year era of labor peace, said 
Goodwin was chosen after a five-month search that included 
discussions with a number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Julius Maldutis at CIBC Oppenheimer said United's board  
members likely agreed there was no sense in rocking the boat and 
bringing in an outsider at a key juncture. The majority-employee 
ownership plan is set to expire in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where management-labor conflicts are the  
norm, airlines ... that have labor peace are valued at a premium,'' 
Maldutis said. ``Mr. Goodwin has demonstrated the capability to 
work cooperatively and constructively with organized labor, which 
will help remove the uncertainty about a new (employee 
stock-ownership plan) within the next several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 54, in September replaced John Edwardson as president  
and chief operating officer. Edwardson departed abruptly in the 
face of union opposition to his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were concerned Edwardson would be more inclined to cut  
wages and benefits than Greenwald, and they had been pressing 
company executives to create a search committee to find an outside 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Union opposition to a successor would not necessarily block an  
appointment, but the Machinists union and the Air Line Pilots 
Association own a majority of the stock in UAL and have board 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said Greenwald's successor has tough shoes to  
fill, particularly because the new chief executive will be faced 
with high labor costs, which account for about 35 percent of the 
airline's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main challenges I see ahead are meeting the needs of an  
increasingly sophisticated customer on a global basis and building 
upon the strides we have made already to improve the relationship 
among management, unions and all employees,'' Goodwin said in a 
statement. A spokeswoman said Goodwin was unavailable for further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier faces huge costs in  
coming years as it either unwinds its employee majority ownership 
plan or renegotiates a new one -- a reason the airline's stock has 
lagged despite solid performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin has experience in operations, marketing, finance and  
international work. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts said at the time of Goodwin's appointment  
as president that it was unlikely he would eventually be named 
Greenwald's successor. But in the past few months, Goodwin has 
impressed both pilots and machinists with his knowledge of the 
company and willingness to work with both on all issues. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, America West recently rejected a United takeover  
offer in part because of United's insistence that the deal be 
contingent on its pilots unions' approval.

<HEADLINE> Primestar 500 Track Is Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The D-shaped oval at Texas Motor  
Speedway already was faster than most of NASCAR's speedways before 
it was improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Mayfield owns the current track qualifying record of  
185.906 mph, set last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with speeds on the 1 1/2-mile track expected to reach near 190  
mph, the problems that forced speedway officials to spend $500,000 
on physical changes after the 1997 race and more than $4 million to 
reconfigure the oval following last year's event, had better be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for a difficult situation when you have problems on  
the racetrack because, as fast as we're going, those problems are 
hard to see,'' said Dale Jarrett, one of the favorites for Sunday's 
Primestar 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Two previous Winston Cup races at the track have produced  
several crashes, most of them caused by what was a narrow fourth 
turn and difficult transitions from the turns to the straightaways. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the problems are there, but your job is to go as fast  
as you can,'' said Jarrett, who has finished second and 11th in the 
races in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think those problems are remedied now and we have a much  
better racetrack to race on. The fans are going to enjoy our racing 
more, and the drivers are going to enjoy it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton tested on the track in December and liked what he  
saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that when you started going down into turn one,  
it was like going into a funnel, and the transition from the 
banking on the straightaway to the banking on the corner was 
awkward,'' Burton said. ``It was treacherous, but they've improved 
that a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said turn two never was a problem, but turn four ``was  
difficult because you got to the outside wall very quickly. There 
was a transition problem there, too. So they've fixed that as well. 
Now you can run off turn four and not feel like you're going to hit 
the wall every lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a narrow racetrack,'' Burton added. ``It's still a  
very tight racetrack. I don't see a second groove coming in yet, 
and it's fast. In fact, it's a lot faster than it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other big problem at Texas was with drainage. Last year,  
qualifying was washed away because of water seeping up through the 
track despite sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money spent to fix the track was put into a new  
drainage system. With rain forecast for Sunday, it could be put to 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Goodyear, the exclusive tire supplier for NASCAR's  
top stock car series, says the reconfigured track should not cause 
any tire problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagle tires we're bringing to Texas this year basically  
are the same tread compounds as used in the 1998 race,'' said Tony 
Freund, Goodyear's lead engineer for stock car tire development. 
``But, in line with our general goal to improve riding and 
handling, we have evolved the tire construction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear developed a new right-side tire after Burton tested on  
the reconfigured and repaved track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see a great race with signifcant handling  
improvements,'' Freund said. ``The entry into corners had been 
particularly tricky, but the new configuration in combination with 
the new tires has addressed that situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to whether the track people got it right this time  
will begin to take form Friday when practice and the first round of 
qualifying -- to determine the top 25 drivers in Sunday's 43-car 
field -- is held.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated early  
today, reflecting concern that continued U.S. bombings of Serbian 
targets would jeopardize food aid programs to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A traditional ally of Yugoslavia, Russia has sharply criticized  
NATO attacks on Serbia. The souring relations between the United 
States and Russia could delay or end food donations to the 
cash-starved country. That could leave American farmers in a bind, 
since they have ample supplies and relatively weak global demand to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures also were pressured by a U.S. Census Bureau  
report that showed large soybean oil stocks, while the U.S. 
Agriculture Department reported lackluster export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 2 cents to $2.78 a bushel; May corn  
fell 1 cent to $2.27 a bushel; May oats fell 1/2 cent to $1.16 1/4 a 
bushel; May soybeans fell 3 1/4 cents to $4.84 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle fell .12 cent to 66.50 cents a pound; April  
live cattle fell .07 cent to 71.45 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .25 cent to 43.87 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .02 
cent to 55.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspected of Missing Atheist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A former office manager for missing atheist  
Madalyn Murray O'Hair has been arrested on weapons charges amid 
indications prosecutors suspect Mrs. O'Hair was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	David Roland Waters, 52, was arrested Wednesday and jailed after  
119 rounds of ammunition were found in a search of his apartment 
and car. He was convicted of murder in Illinois in 1965 and is on 
probation for skimming $54,000 from the O'Hair family's atheist 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair vanished with a son and granddaughter 3 1/2 years ago,  
along with $500,000 in gold coins. 
</P>
<P>
	Her disappearance gave rise to speculation that they were  
victims of foul play or that Mrs. O'Hair, who suffered from 
diabetes and would be about 80 now, had gone somewhere to die 
privately so that Christians couldn't pray over her. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not said whether they think Mrs. O'Hair was  
murdered and made no mention of her at Waters' court appearance 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, told reporters that ``there  
are allegations he was somehow involved'' in Mrs. O'Hair's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganne said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gerald Carruth told him:  
``Your client could get the death penalty. ... People are rolling 
over on your client and he better get right with God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carruth wouldn't comment Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Of Mrs. O'Hair's disappearance, Ganne said: ``She's probably  
partying it up with Jimmy Hoffa somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waters was charged with possessing ammunition despite a felony  
record. The warrant used in the search remains sealed. Ganne said 
the bullets belonged to Waters' former girlfriend, who had moved 
out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. O'Hair waged the lawsuit that led to the 1963 U.S. Supreme  
Court decision outlawing organized prayer in public schools.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seek To Limit Restraints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's been three months since Marsha Draheim's  
son died after being restrained by counselors at a treatment center 
for troubled youths in Orefield, Pa. She still wonders why it took 
three adults to restrain a 100-pound teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son was not a big boy,'' said Draheim, who spoke at a  
Capitol news conference Thursday in favor of new legislation to 
restrict the use of restraints on mental health patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not have a history of hurting other people,'' said  
Draheim, who said her son Mark, 14, was restrained after becoming 
upset that he'd been injured by another patient. ``I do not 
understand why three staff were needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was among those highlighted by Democratic lawmakers who  
are proposing to outlaw the use of physical restraints on the 
mentally ill unless necessary to protect the patient or other 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we've got a good chance of passing bipartisan,  
comprehensive legislation to deal with a real tragedy,'' said Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., whose bill would also require better 
training of mental health workers and sanctions against facilities 
that don't comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate bills by Dodd, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and  
Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and Pete 
Stark, D-Calif., all would require mental health facilities to 
report deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports would be available for investigation by the nation's  
protection and advocacy system, a network of mostly nonprofit 
agencies in the states that is federally mandated to provide legal 
representation and advocacy for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills do not provide additional funding for that system to  
conduct investigations, although lawmakers said that could be 
provided once initial standards for use of restraints, and 
reporting requirements, are in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's critical that there's more funding,'' said Gary Gross,  
director of legal services for the National Association of 
Protection &AMP; Advocacy Systems, Inc., which supports the proposed 
restrictions. He said the system already turns away more requests 
than it takes on. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Psychiatric Association, which has not endorsed the  
bills, warned that regulations could place patients, nurses, other 
hospital staff and visitors at greater risk for assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical restraints are ways to restrict a person's movement,  
such as by pinning them to the floor. They may also include the use 
of straitjackets, leather straps, shackles or other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills, which are backed by the Clinton administration but by  
few Republicans, are modeled on existing federal restrictions on 
the use of physical restraints in nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Questioned Over Anthrax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon officials are coming under sharp  
questioning about plans to inoculate 2.4 million members of the 
armed forces against anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why this vaccine?'' Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., asked  
Wednesday at a hearing of the House Government Reform's 
subcommittee on national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 200 service members have refused to take the vaccine. The  
Pentagon has said that 220,000 have been vaccinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anthrax is the primary biological warfare threat faced by U.S.  
forces,'' Sue Bailey, assistance defense secretary for health 
affairs, told the panel. She said the anthrax vaccine was tested by 
the Food and Drug Administration and found safe, a determination 
confirmed by an independent review. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been no long-term side effects reported with the  
FDA-licensed anthrax vaccine,'' which has been in use since 1970, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays said there was a lack of trust in the Pentagon program and  
he said the military's efforts to counter concerns ``seem 
heavy-handed and one-sided, glossing over legitimate concerns about 
the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, minimizing adverse reaction 
reports, and blaming the Internet for fanning dissent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee intends to call the FDA to testify in the next of  
several planned hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will follow it until we are sure medical force protection  
means assuring the long-term health of U.S. forces not just 
short-term mission capability,'' Shays said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Weather Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Weather Channel cannot be held  
responsible for the death of a man who drowned after being thrown 
out of a fishing boat during an unexpected storm, a federal judge 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of Charles Cobb sued the Atlanta-based station for  
$10 million, claiming Cobb relied on a storm-free forecast in June 
1997 when he left his Big Pine Key home on the boating trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the television station said the judge recognized  
the possible free speech restrictions on the media if such a 
lawsuit succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that was not simply a negligence case, but it was a  
case with significant First Amendment issues,'' Stanley Wakshlag 
said Wednesday. ``And the judge obviously shared those concerns in 
his ruling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Weather Channel had information about inclement conditions  
approaching the Florida Keys but did not broadcast it in a timely 
manner, the lawsuit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Paine said holding a forecaster liable  
could expose it to lawsuits by, for example, farmers who lose crops 
to unforeseen conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is well established that mass media broadcasters and  
publishers owe no duty to their general public who may view their 
broadcasts or read their publications,'' Paine wrote. 
</P>

	Robert Lamar Bell, an attorney for Cobb's family, did not return  
a call for comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Owens Corning Can't Bar Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A judge denied a request by Owens Corning on  
Thursday to bar some blacks from suing the former asbestos 
manufacturer, which had argued that blacks have less lung capacity 
than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore Circuit Judge Joseph H.H. Kaplan's ruling reversed a  
guideline he wrote in 1992 about who was eligible to sue for damage 
to their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs, many of them former steelworkers and shipyard  
workers, are trying to prove they have diminished lung capacity 
because of their exposure to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
	The company argued that because blacks score consistently lower  
on tests used to determine lung capacity, they should have to meet 
a higher standard to prove asbestos caused lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But after hearing testimony from medical experts on both sides  
Thursday, Kaplan decided that there was no reason to use a 
different medical standard for whites and blacks, much to the 
surprise of lawyers and courtroom observers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not convinced of the validity of race correction for this  
purpose,'' Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning, a Toledo, Ohio-based company that makes  
fiberglass, stopped manufacturing products containing asbestos in 
1972. Since then, the company has been hit with hundreds of 
thousands of lawsuits from people who worked with products 
containing asbestos and developed a lung disease called asbestosis. 
The disease shrinks the lungs, among other symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the company announced a $1.2 billion settlement,  
resolving about 176,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Kaplan set guidelines to handle 12,000 asbestos cases  
filed in Baltimore alone. The guidelines were intended to set a 
standard on who would be considered sick enough to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote then that lung test results ``shall be corrected for  
race or ethnic origin as appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, plaintiffs attorney Peter T. Nicholl said that out of  
more than 20 asbestos makers being sued in Baltimore, Owens Corning 
is the only one to raise the racial standard as a means of 
excluding defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't apply a different standard to the races,'' Nicholl  
said. ``You're talking about the fundamental right to have access 
to the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning spokeswoman Tricia Ingraham declined to discuss  
the case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul Epstein, a pulmonary specialist with the University of  
Pennsylvania, testified on the company's behalf that scientific 
data shows whites and blacks have different lung capacities. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1991 report by the American Thoracic Society, the  
medical branch of the American Lung Association, blacks 
consistently score lower on pulmonary function tests. The lung 
association declined to comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dr. Stephen Zimmen, a pulmonary specialist in Virginia  
who testified for the plaintiffs, said there are a number of other 
factors more important than race in determining someone's lung 
capacity, such as age, height, gender, socioeconomic conditions and 
nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you what the consensus is in the community I'm  
aware of, and we do not race-correct,'' Zimmen said. ``There's not 
the scientific evidence available to justify that.''

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Wisconsin Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- A van carrying 14 young people selling  
magazine subscriptions door-to-door overturned on a highway today, 
killing six passengers and injuring the others. Witnesses said 
bodies were strewn over the highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims, 16 to 22 years old, had been heading from Appleton  
to Janesville when the accident happened about 12:30 a.m. along 
Interstate 90, 70 miles southwest of Milwaukee, said Sgt. Brad 
Altman of the Wisconsin State Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver apparently lost control of the van, which was going  
at at least 80 mph, Altman said. It veered off the right side of 
the road, came back onto the pavement, then rolled over twice and 
came to rest in the middle of the highway, Altman said. Charges of 
negligent vehicular homicide were pending against the driver, 
Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the weather nor alcohol was a factor, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were thrown from the van. Six were pronounced dead  
at the scene, and six others had critical head injuries. The 
victims were not wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a horrific scene,'' Altman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wichser, a paramedic called to the scene, said he and his  
partner had to drive past the accident scene in the westbound lanes 
to circle back to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went past it and my partner said, `Oh, my God, are those  
all bodies in the road?' And I said, `I believe they are,''' 
Wichser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was just several bodies everywhere,'' Wichser said.  
``There was one person in the van and one person in the squad car 
that had walked away from it and 12 other people laying in the 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The van ended up on its wheels in the road,'' fireman Wayne  
Achterberg said. It had overturned, ``and then of course the bodies 
were strewn all over the roadway for probably 50 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The van, which had no license plates, was one of three carrying  
people who had been selling magazines. The two other vans arrived 
safely at a Janesville motel. 
</P>
<P>
	The young people were selling magazines for an organization  
called Yes, state patrol Lt. Varla Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were from Wisconsin, Colorado, Kentucky, Oklahoma,  
Kansas, Nebraska and West Virginia, Massachusetts and Florida, 
Altman said. Police did not immediately release victims' names or 
what organization they worked for. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsha Martin, a nursing coordinator at Janesville Mercy  
Hospital, said two men and a woman, all in their early 20s, were in 
critical condition, and a 19-year-old woman was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was taken to University Hospital in Madison, and was  
in critical condition, said Kit Soper, a nursing supervisor. Soper 
said two others were taken to two hospitals in Rockford, Ill. Those 
hospitals did not immediately release information on their 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Junior, ARod: Will They Stay or Go? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Junior &AMP; ARod make opposing pitchers  
fearful -- and the Seattle Mariners, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with baseball's best all-around player and its top young  
star, Seattle hasn't made it to the World Series, losing in the 
playoffs in 1995 and '97. 
</P>
<P>
	After two more seasons, Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez will  
both be eligible for free agency, and the consensus is Seattle 
won't spend to keep them both. Because of the uncertainty, this may 
be the most edgy camp in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask a question this spring, and the common response is: ``What  
do you mean by that?'' Angles are scrutinized, answers pondered at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to make their own decisions,'' manager Lou  
Piniella says, ``but certainly being competitive and winning will 
make them want to remain in Seattle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the departure of Randy Johnson last July 31, it's not  
at all certain the Mariners can compete with Texas and Anaheim in 
the AL West. And 1999 might be their last chance. There already is 
speculation Seattle might trade Rodriguez after this season, when 
the Mariners still can get a lot in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to have them both play their entire careers  
here,'' Mariners president Chuck Armstrong says. ``That's what we'd 
like to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may take more than $350 million to keep them both, almost as  
much as the $498 million it is costing to construct Safeco Field, 
the retractable-roof ballpark the Mariners move into July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``This franchise is in Seattle now to stay,'' Piniella says.  
``The stadium is certainly a symbol of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey and Rodriguez are the cornerstones of the club as it  
moves into the new building, the best offensive duo on the same 
team since Oakland's Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, or perhaps even 
Cincinnati's Johnny Bench and Tony Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	At 29, Griffey already has 350 career home runs, including 56 in  
each of the last two seasons, and Hank Aaron's career record of 755 
is within reach. He is a nine-time All-Star and Gold Glove, and 
last year joined Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig as the only players to 
reach 140 RBIs in three straight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, he seems tired of the spotlight. Last year, he  
refused to participate in the All-Star home run contest until 
booing fans at Coors Field changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant questions annoy him. Just asking him what Seattle  
must do to improve this season sets him off. 
</P>
<P>
	``What does last year have to do with this year?'' he responds.  
``This sounds like it's going to be negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After repeated prodding, he says the team must be ``more  
consistent,'' Asked if he must be more consistent, too, Griffey 
answers: ``I guess 140 RBIs isn't enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even an innocuous question, such as how often did he work out  
during the offseason, draws a testy reply. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't lift weights. I don't run. I don't work out. Some  
people don't have to. ... Can't I have a real life like other 
people, live with my kids?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of late, he opens up only with the local beat writers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Mariners shouldn't be concentrating on me right now, they  
shouldn't be concentrating on Alex,'' he told The News Tribune of 
Tacoma in January. ``They've got to get somebody who can get some 
damned outs. I'm signed for two more years. Alex is signed for two 
more years. I'm not going to sign something now -- I don't want to 
be stuck in a situation where we're good one year and not the 
next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey has two seasons left in a $34 million, four-year  
contract, one that made him baseball's highest-paid player when he 
agreed to the extension in January 1996. His agent, Brian Goldberg, 
swapped proposals with the Mariners during spring training and is 
willing to negotiate during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their message to me is every team has parameters, but they had  
the go-ahead from ownership to try and lock up both,'' Goldberg 
says. ``Money is not an issue. He's going to get it no matter 
where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, just 23, has two seasons left in a $10.6 million  
five-year deal and will be eligible for free agency at the 
unusually young age of 25. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a batting title in 1996, became the fourth-youngest  
player to reach 100 career homers and is coming off power bests of 
42 homers and 124 RBIs last season. His agent, Scott Boras, already 
is sending signals that $200 million for 10 years may be the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're two years away, why think about it now?'' says  
Rodriguez, coveted by many large-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Boras said this week that Rodriguez won't even consider an  
extension until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``His primary consideration as to how he thinks about the future  
will depend on the desire of ownership to consistently give his 
club and himself the opportunity to win every year,'' Boras says. 
``One thing he always admired about the Yankees and Dodgers of the 
past was their clubs were always in the thick of things every year. 
When he came to the big leagues in 1995, Seattle was in the hunt 
every year. They have filled that bill with the exception of 1998. 
He just wants to see what happens in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Would Rodriguez tie his decision to Griffey's?  
</P>
<P>
	``Alex and I have never discussed that,'' Boras says. ``Alex  
wants to play with players who give you the opportunity to win. A 
player like Griffey certainly gives you an opportunity to be 
associated with a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, according to consensus opinion, is more likely to stay.  
</P>
<P>
	``As I told the Mariners,'' Goldberg says, ``the two of them  
would like to create a kind of Ruth and Gehrig situation. I know 
the interest is there on both of their ends.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Most Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Thursday as U.S. stocks rose sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.13  
Japanese yen, up from 117.89. The euro was quoted at $1.0826, down 
from $1.0932. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4716 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4645, and 1.5078 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5084. The British 
pound was quoted at $1.6234, down from $1.6353. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is in motion today,'' said Dan Seto, a senior  
economist at Nikko Securities International Inc. ``It's another one 
of those days with good earnings news and the market was able to 
build on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings reported Thursday included those for Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., with an 81 percent surge in profit in quarterly 
profit, and ConAgra Inc., with a 44 percent jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports helped major U.S. stock indices rise, following  
gains at markets in Japan, Germany, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose almost all day, closing  
nearly 170 points higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock watchers had been fearful markets would fall Wednesday  
when NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. But the response on Wall Street 
was muted and Dow fell just 4.99 points that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that reaction didn't materialize, people felt comfortable  
returning to the (stock) market,'' which underpinned the dollar's 
trading, Seto said. ``The dollar improved slightly, but I would not 
characterize it as a major move or a change in trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8067 German 
marks, up from 1.7892; 6.0606 French francs, up from 5.9988; and 
1,788.91 Italian lire, up from 1,769.91.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Wohlers Has Strong Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Mark Wohlers was glowing. So was Atlanta  
Braves manager Bobby Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, whose career was threatened last year by control  
problems, pitched two scoreless innings Thursday night in a 6-1 
loss to the Toronto Blue Jays and looked like the closer who had 97 
saves from 1995-97, including a team-record 39 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out pretty well. It was by far my best outing of the  
spring,'' said Wohlers. ``It's something to build on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers threw 27 pitches, 16 of them strikes, in retiring the  
Blue Jays in order in the eighth and gave up a one-out double to 
Willie Greene in the ninth -- the only runner to reach off the 
right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, in seven appearances this spring, has allowed eight  
hits, five runs, walked six and struck out eight in seven innings 
and lowered his ERA to 7.71. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw an awful lot of strikes, boy,'' said Cox. ``It's been  
an amazing turnaround here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, who injured his side last May and may have returned too  
soon, couldn't find the plate when he returned. He was 0-1 with a 
10.18 ERA with Atlanta, walking 33 in 20.1 innings. At Triple A 
Richmond, he was worse, going 0-3 with a 20.43 ERA, walking 36 in 
12.1 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of spring training, no one could have foreseen that  
Wohlers would be throwing strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows. I don't know what the odds were on something like  
that, but he certainly beat them,'' said Cox. ``He's about as close 
to being back as you can be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Emerging from a small sitting room  
decorated with Byzantine icons, the two clergymen spoke in cautious 
generalities and offered no expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a theological discussion,'' said the leader of the  
Greek Orthodox Church, Archbishop Christodoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	``A very unofficial visit,'' added Cardinal Edward Cassidy, who  
heads a papal council on promoting Christian unity. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mere presence of a senior Vatican envoy in Greece was a  
startling precedent in a nation where Orthodox leaders have long 
encouraged suspicion -- and sometimes even outright antagonism -- 
toward their Roman Catholic counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	With Pope John Paul II planning a May 7-9 trip to Romania -- his  
first to a predominantly Orthodox nation in two decades of 
globetrotting -- Cassidy's March 15 stop in Athens carried a luster 
beyond its historic character. Some reports described Cassidy as 
the highest-level Vatican delegate to visit Greece in centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the short view, it could open some new paths to breach the  
nearly 1,000-year rift between the Vatican and the various Orthodox 
churches, which split over the issue of papal authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger vision, however, touches on the ultimate dream of  
ecumenical crusaders: a deep and solid rapprochement between the 
one billion Roman Catholics and more than 200 million Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece, widely perceived as the spiritual crucible of Orthodoxy,  
has long opposed attempts at reconciliation. But the new archbishop 
relishes publicity and appears inclined toward bold gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Greek Orthodox Church were nudged to make meaningful  
contacts with the Vatican, it could encourage the same from other 
Orthodox churches, including those in Serbia and Russia, some 
religious experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be very significant,'' said the Rev. Ronald  
Roberson, associate director for interreligious affairs at the 
National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington. ``But let's 
not forget there is a lot of hostility toward the Vatican. This 
will be hard to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Greeks -- and Orthodox clergymen -- consider the Vatican an  
imperialistic force out to crush Orthodox traditions and bring 
Eastern Europe and the Balkans under Rome's control. The 
disintegration of the Iron Curtain opened more interplay between 
the faiths, but also heated up the friction. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the Greek Orthodox Church asked the government to sever  
diplomatic ties with the Vatican. The request was turned down, but 
it attracted wide public support and displayed the depth of 
mistrust toward the Holy See. 
</P>
<P>
	Christodoulos' predecessor, Archbishop Seraphim, accused the  
Vatican of trying to ``conquer and dilute the Orthodox 
convictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, Roman Catholics and other non-Orthodox denominations  
worry about restrictions and pressure following a 1997 religion law 
that recognizes the Russian Orthodox Church as the leading faith. 
The Russian Orthodox patriarch, Alexy II, has turned down two 
opportunities to meet the pope and alleged Roman Catholic 
missionaries are trying to convert people in Russia and the 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexy's stance has seriously hobbled the pope's appeals for a  
grand meeting of all the major faiths for the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be those who try to exploit these old  
prejudices, claiming it's in the name of Orthodoxy,'' said Nicholas 
Constas, an assistant professor of theology at the Harvard Divinity 
School. ``This makes it very hard to move beyond the 
traditionalist, anti-Catholic mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some doors have been opened.  
</P>
<P>
	Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, called the ``first among  
equals'' of the Orthodox patriarchs, visited the Vatican in 1995 
and has been a leading promoter of contacts between faiths. But in 
recent years, his attention has been deflected by internal Orthodox 
quarrels, especially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-year-old joint committee of U.S.-based Orthodox and Roman  
Catholic bishops plans its annual session in Greece next year for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece has only about 50,000 Roman Catholics among its more than  
10 million people. But it could finally fit into papal travel 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope has expressed a desire to travel to Jerusalem and other  
sites around the Middle East connected to the Bible. Greece, too, 
features prominently in early Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Bibles were written in ancient Greek and many chapters  
make references to efforts to spread the new doctrine in Greece. 
Biblical scholars say St. John the Divine drafted the Book of 
Revelation on the Aegean island of Patmos. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatican officials say there has been no consideration for a  
possible papal trip to Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy also insisted he didn't even raise the idea during his  
meeting with Christodoulos. ``It never even came into my head to 
discuss that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is highly doubtful the Greek Orthodox synod, or ruling  
council, would even permit a papal visit. But some scholars say the 
pope could sidestep a potential controversy and stop in Greek 
territory under the ecclesiastical control of the ecumenical 
patriarch, such as Patmos and the island of Crete. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the pope can visit Romania and think about visiting Russia,  
why not Greece?'' asked George Moustakis, a professor of religion 
at the American College in Athens. ``This is the time to seize the 
moment.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Attack Trial To Begin in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  
jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating 
gay college student Matthew Shepard to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection process, which began Wednesday, is going on behind  
closed doors. Twenty-nine of 71 potential jurors have been 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to  
lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6. 
Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and 
pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold. 
The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  
not participate in Shepard's beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Holt, a 52-year-old Greek literature professor at the  
University of Wyoming, said he was relieved after being excused

<HEADLINE> NFL QB Kitna's Trading Card Is Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- John Kitna, who may be the Seattle  
Seahawk's starting quarterback in the fall, has the hottest trading 
card in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna's 1997 Pacific Crown Royale rookie card is listed as the  
top card on the ``What's Hot'' list in the April issue of Beckett 
Football, a magazine and price guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must not have made very many of them,'' Kitna said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's partly right. Pacific Trading Cards, based in Lynnwood just  
north of Seattle, was the only card manufacturer to make a rookie 
card for the undrafted quarterback from Central Washington. And it 
produced an extremely limited number. 
</P>
<P>
	But Beckett also said Kitna's value had increased because of the  
hiring of Mike Holmgren as Seahawks coach. Brett Favre of the Green 
Bay Packers and Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers blossomed 
under Holmgren's tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitna's rookie card jumped from off the chart in February to No.  
4 in March and then to No. 1 in April. Its value has increased from 
$2.50 in December to $12 in February to $30 in April.

<HEADLINE> Pappano Joins Royal Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Antonio Pappano has become the youngest musical  
director of the Royal Opera, the prestigious company based at the 
troubled Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappano, 39, the musical director of the Theatre Royal de la  
Monnaie opera house in Brussels, will take over in London from 
Bernard Haitink in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera house has endured a period of financial uncertainty  
and infighting and hopes the new appointment will usher in a new 
era. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappano said Wednesday that the orchestra under Haitink ``has  
attained worldwide renown and I consider myself fortunate to 
inherit such a wonderful instrument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, taking over such an important and vast organization  
will be a tremendous challenge, but it is a challenge that is right 
for me at this time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappano and Sir Anthony Dowell, director of the Royal Ballet,  
will share the role of artistic director of the Royal Opera House, 
home to both the opera and the ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the board's view that two equal artistic leaders, a  
musical director of the Royal Opera and a director of the Royal 
Ballet, will ensure the best creative and performing conditions 
from the companies,'' the Royal Opera House said in a statement.

<HEADLINE>  Fans Turn Out for UConn Send-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- When Helen Partridge got married, she told  
her husband she never wanted to retire to Florida for the winter, 
no matter how cold and dreary it got in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't want to miss any UConn basketball games. Partridge  
wouldn't mind a ticket to St. Petersburg this weekend, either. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, she joined several thousand Huskies fans for an  
old-fashioned pep rally to celebrate the team's first trip to the 
NCAA Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Decked out in navy blue UConn sweat pants and a gray Huskies  
sweatshirt, Partridge shook her blue and white pompom and joined 
the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had known I'd be talking to you, I would have worn my  
UConn earrings,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans, young and old, clapped their hands and  
stomped their feet to the rousing tunes of the pep band. Standing 
ovations greeted the players and coach Jim Calhoun as they came out 
of the locker room onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the best fans in America,'' said Calhoun, his voice  
drowned out by another standing ovation. ``What we're going to 
Florida for is to match you and to bring home the national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Team captains Ricky Moore and Rashamel Jones thanked the fans  
for their support, and said they'd do their best to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the players walked around the court, high-fiving fans  
around the arena as they filed out to a waiting bus, which took 
them to Bradley International Airport and a charter flight to St. 
Petersburg, Fla. They play Ohio State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskies fever extended beyond the Storrs campus to the state  
Capitol, where Sen. Thomas P. Gaffey, a Democrat from Meriden, 
urged the governor to declare Saturday an honorary state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state should recognize the hard work and dedication it  
requires to get to this level of excellence,'' Gaffey said. ``It 
costs the state nothing -- and besides, it's fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Kaplan, 7, is making the trip to Saturday's game with his  
family. Wearing the No. 32 jersey of his favorite player, Richard 
Hamilton, Kaplan said he was confident the Huskies will beat the 
Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever I wear my jersey, they win,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Polk Audio To Go Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Polk Audio Inc., a maker of loudspeaker  
systems, is going private and will delist itself from the American 
Stock Exchange after it buys back outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baltimore-based company is going private primarily because  
of its small stockholder base and low trading activity on the 
exchange, Polk officials said Wednesday. Polk's chief executive 
officer, George Klopfer, also said Asia's economic problems have 
hurt the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sells its home and auto loudspeaker systems directly  
through specialty retailers in the United States, Canada, Britain 
and Germany, and through distributors in about 45 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Polk went public in July 1986. Its shares closed at $11.75  
Wednesday, up 50 cents. The stock hit its 52-week high, $22.50, on 
July 17. Its 52-week low was Feb. 18, when it reached $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors approved a tender offer for up  
to 860,000 shares of Polk's common stock from existing stockholders 
for a purchase price of $12 a share. The buyback will begin Tuesday 
and will expire at midnight April 30, Klopfer said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the tender offer, the company will decide if it should  
enter merger talks or explore other scenarios, Klopfer said.

<HEADLINE> Judging Questioned at World Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Television footage showing two judges  
exchanging glances, making gestures and possibly conversing during 
the pairs competition at the World Figure Skating Championships had 
the event's governing body concerned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There appears to have been some kind of collusion,'' said  
Sally-Anne Stapleford, chairwoman of the International Skating 
Union's technical committee. ``It doesn't look particularly good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The footage was shot by Canadian television at Wednesday night's  
free program, the final event of the pairs competition. 
</P>
<P>
	It shows judges Alfred Korytek of Ukraine and Sviatoslov Babenko  
of Russia appearing to talk and gesture at each other. The Russian 
pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the event in a 
decision that brought hoots from many of the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd favorites had been Shen Xue and Hongbo Zhao of China,  
whose spectacularly athletic performance followed the Russians' 
routine. The video shows Korytek and Babenko glancing at each other 
as the Chinese pair were taking their bows, before the scores were 
announced. Both judges had them first in the free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	ISU rules say ``judges must mark independently and, while  
judging, they are not permitted to converse with one another or to 
indicate errors by action or sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two judges, sitting in adjacent spots, also placed Poland's  
Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek, the program's final skaters, 
lower than Russian pair Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the other seven judges placed the Polish pair third and  
gave the Russian pair fourth or fifth position. 
</P>
<P>
	Korytek was one of the judges in the 1994 Olympics controversy  
centering around Oksana Baiul of Ukraine winning the gold. He also 
is the father of Baiul's first coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current procedures, the competition referee is to submit a  
report within six weeks to the technical committee, which will 
evaluate whether to apply sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Van Crash Kills Six in Wisconsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- A speeding van loaded with 14 young  
people selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door rolled over on a 
highway early Thursday after the driver tried to switch places with 
a passenger, police said. Six people were killed and eight injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The man at the wheel had so many tickets that he was not  
supposed to be driving in Wisconsin, and tried to change places 
with someone else in the van after spotting a police car along the 
side of the road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Jeremy A. Holmes, 20, was treated at St. Anthony  
Medical Center in Rockford, Ill., and was released into police 
custody Thursday night, hospital officials said. Police recommended 
that prosecutors charge him with negligent homicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The salespeople, who were from as far away as Florida and  
Massachusetts and were between the ages of 15 and 25, were heading 
to a Janesville motel where they had been based for two weeks while 
they went on sales outings, said sheriff's Cmdr. Thomas Gehl. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Interstate 90,  
70 miles southwest of Milwaukee. The van had been doing at least 80 
mph and had no license plates, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The van had 15 seat belts, but no one was wearing one. Twelve of  
the victims were thrown onto the highway. Six people were 
critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I arrived, it was far and away the worst scene I'd seen  
in over 19 years of law enforcement,'' Gehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes had a license from Iowa, but Wisconsin had revoked his  
privileges to drive here because of repeated traffic offenses, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened after Holmes sped past Milton police  
Officer John Conger's squad car, which was parked along the 
highway. Conger said he clocked Holmes at 80 mph and was preparing 
to pursue him. 
</P>
<P>
	The van veered off the right side of the road, came back on the  
pavement, then rolled over twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger the driver tried to change places with was among  
the six killed, said Sgt. Brad Altman of the Wisconsin State 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather and alcohol were ruled out as factors in the crash. A  
small amount of marijuana was found in one victim's purse, and 
blood from some victims was sent to a state lab to test for drugs, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The young people were selling magazines for an organization  
called Yes, police said. Investigators said they did not know where 
the group was based. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of magazine order forms for a company called  
Subscriptions Plus Inc. of Bethany, Okla., were strewn around the 
accident scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Bennett, a customer service representative with  
Subscriptions Plus, said Yes sells magazines and Subscriptions Plus 
processes the orders. Bennett said the company had no further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the group members were from Wisconsin, Kansas, Iowa,  
Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado, West Virginia, Nebraska, 
Kentucky and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been staying at the Janesville motel with other  
magazine salespeople who said they had been told by their boss not 
to talk about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	State labor officials were investigating whether child labor  
laws were violated, said Mike Goetzman, a spokesman for the state 
Department of Transportation.

<HEADLINE> Cal Vs. Clemson for the NIT Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The way California coach Ben Braun sees it,  
there are no bad teams playing in late March. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is why he knows tonight's National Invitation Tournament  
championship game against Clemson will call for the Golden Bears' 
top performance of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played one of our better games because we played consistent  
throughout,'' Braun said Wednesday, the day after Cal took control 
early in the second half and beat Pac-10 rival Oregon 85-69 in 
Tuesday night's semifinals. ``This team takes pride in its 
performance and wants to go out on a winning note.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Clemson, which blew a 24-point second-half lead, but  
still managed to beat Xavier 79-76 to reach the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're feeling confident right now,'' Clemson first-year coach  
Larry Shyatt said. ``Our older players don't want it to end and the 
younger players are enjoying the ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Tigers (20-14) and Golden Bears (21-11) meet for the  
first time, the winner will come away with its first NIT title. For 
Clemson, it would be the school's first basketball championship in 
60 years. California, meanwhile, has been waiting 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we didn't make the NCAA tournament, we got  
selected for the NIT and decided we would try to go out there and 
win it,'' Tigers guard Terrell McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NIT might be perceived as loser's event, but the finalists  
don't see it that way. A win would be a fitting sendoff for the 
seniors as well as providing a building block for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	For California, there's an even bigger reward for senior  
starters Francisco Elson, Thomas Kilgore, Geno Carlisle and Michael 
Gill. The foursome came to Cal two years ago knowing the school was 
facing NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy for them,'' Braun said. ``They came to our  
program and they came at a tough time. Now they have an opportunity 
to go out winners. This tournament is very important to our program 
and players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Golden Bears reached the final 16 of the NCAA  
tournament, but were banned from postseason play last year for an 
alleged illegal payment by former coach Todd Bozeman's staff to a 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one of California's current players had played in a  
postseason game before this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After California reversed two regular-season losses to Oregon,  
Elson said: ``We did not want to go out with a loss. We wanted to 
win the championship. We want to keep playing for something. We 
didn't want to finish third or fourth. We just wanted to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson may have finished 5-11 in the Atlantic Coast Conference,  
but winning the NIT would ease the pain of an inconsistent season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout the season we weren't having as much fun as we did  
our first three years, and that showed in our play,'' said 
McIntyre, the 5-foot-9 senior who scored 20 points against Xavier. 
``We just want to go out and have fun and that's what we're 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson's only postseason title came 60 years ago when the  
Tigers won the Southern Conference; California won the NCAA 
championship in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Xavier (24-11) plays Oregon (19-12) for third place before the  
NIT title game.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Internet Sites Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House's anti-drug office announced  
Wednesday two new Internet sites where children and their parents 
can get information about fighting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first site, on ABC's http://www.Freevibe.com, will contain  
drug prevention messages for youngsters ages 10 to 13. The site 
contains graphics, games and interactivity to help viewer 
understand the consequences of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	The second site, on America Onlines' Parents' Durg Resource  
Center, gives advice to parents and adult caregivers of children in 
that age group. The AOL keyword for the site is ``Drug Help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike advertising and traditional media outreach, the  
Internet transcends geographic and economic boundaries and allows 
new communities to come together in an interactive substantive 
way,'' said Gen. Barry McCaffrey of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall As Stocks Surge / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Thursday as a surging stock  
market and other bond options pulled investors away from U.S. 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/4 point,  
or $7.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.58 percent from 5.53 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors headed back into the stock market as the Dow Jones  
industrial average surged 169.55 points to 9,836.39, the Dow's 
first advance in five days. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of other attractive options also appeared on the market  
as Mexico and Citigroup put a total of $3 billion in bonds on sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's five-year notes were particularly enticing as they were  
initially priced at a yield of more than 9.5 percent, nearly double 
that of the comparable U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in price occurred even as American-led U.S. forces  
launched a second day of air attacks against Yugoslavia. Investors 
usually seek bonds as a haven during U.S. military action because 
of concern that the fighting could drive down stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/16 and 1/8 point, while intermediate Treasury 
securities fell between 1/4 and 13/32 point from Wednesday, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.6 
points to 1,282.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.50 percent, while  
the discount rose .02 percentage point to 4.39 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.54 percent, as the discount rose .02 percentage point 
to 4.38 percent. One-year yields were 4.73 percent, while the 
discount rose .04 percentage point to 4.51 percent from late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from 4.94 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 1/4 to 124 25/32. The average yield to 
maturity was rose to 5.19 percent from 5.18 percent on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Set To Sign With Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets won the bidding war for Orel  
Hershiser, agreeing today to a $2 million, one-year contract, The 
Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, a 40-year-old right-hander who went to spring  
training with Cleveland, also was sought by the Chicago Cubs, 
Atlanta Braves, Florida Marlins and Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing was to be announced by the Mets this afternoon,  
according to several baseball officials, all speaking on the 
condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent pitcher Hideo  
Nomo outright to the minors. If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A 
Norfolk, the team would save Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he 
does report, the Mets will probably place Nomo on unconditional 
release waivers next Wednesday and give him only 45 days' 
termination pay, $719,262. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract  
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. But Indians manager 
Mike Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 11-10, with a 4.41  
ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser has a career record of 190-133, and he admits he'd  
like to win at least 10 more to reach 200 and possibly improve his 
chances of being elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Los Angeles Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major 
league record with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was 
MVP of the NL championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 
in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Mets manager Bobby Valentine, but general 
manager Steve Phillips made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine appeared to be upset at the demotion, saying he had  
told his players not to worry about their performance in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.

<HEADLINE> Dad Convicted in Children's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A father has been convicted of  
second-degree murder for letting his daughter and another baby die 
in an unventilated car while he and a friend searched for 
arrowheads and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Crisp, 24, avoided a first-degree murder conviction in the  
deaths of his daughter, 16-month-old Vicky Crisp, and her cousin, 
4-month-old Sidney Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp huddled with family members and cried after the verdict  
was announced Thursday. Jurors were to return today to recommend a 
sentence for Crisp, who faces up to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Crisp left the children strapped to their car  
seats for several hours last April while he and a friend searched 
for arrowheads near Little Flock, in northwest Arkansas, prosecutor 
Brad Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died of heat exhaustion and dehydration after they  
were left in the car that reached at least 130 degrees. Prosecutors 
have said the pain was so severe that Vicky pulled out her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp's friend, Justin Griffith, 28, pleaded guilty earlier this  
month to manslaughter. He has yet to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith said he and Crisp didn't plan to look for arrowheads  
and mushrooms for long, but lost track of time because they had 
taken drugs and alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Exec Charged With Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A tobacco company executive admitted on  
Thursday that he helped smugglers sell nearly $700 million worth of 
cigarettes on the Canadian black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Thompson, a former R.J. Reynolds executive, pleaded  
guilty in U.S. District Court in Syracuse to money laundering 
charges. He could face up to seven years in prison. A sentencing 
date has not been set, said U.S. Attorney Thomas Maroney. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 51, of Tecumseh, Ontario, was the first tobacco  
industry executive charged in the federal government's four-year 
investigation into tobacco and alcohol smuggling through the St. 
Regis Mohawk Reservation in northern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A former R.J. Reynolds marketing executive, Thompson arranged to  
have the company's Canadian-brand cigarettes, Export A's, exported 
to smugglers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Niagara Falls men -- Larry V. Miller and Lewis and Robert  
Tavano -- were eventually convicted of masterminding the smuggling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers avoided paying excise taxes to the United States  
by telling customs agents that the Canadian cigarettes they were 
carrying were being brought into the country for export to Russia. 
Instead, they were shipped to the St. Regis reservation and 
smuggled across the St. Lawrence River back into Canada, thus 
cheating the Canadian government of taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen people already have been convicted in the case and are  
awaiting sentencing. In December, Northern Brands International, an 
R.J. Reynolds subsidiary, admitted helping the smugglers and paid 
$15 million in fines and forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was placed on leave after the company began an internal  
investigation into Northern Brands, and Adam Bryan-Brown, a 
Reynolds spokesman, said the allegations against Thompson run 
``completely contrary'' to corporate policy.

<HEADLINE> Texas Drowning Raises Safety Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	You're on one of those amusement park rides that simulates white  
water rafting or a fast ride down a log chute. Then the improbable 
happens -- the boat tips or someone stands and topples out. 
</P>
<P>
	When people wind up in the water, it's highly unlikely that  
anyone running the ride will have medical training, access to a 
lifeguard or even a simple flotation device ready to toss. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, employees will probably shut down the ride, keep  
visitors (and themselves) out of the water and wait for park 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the response at Six Flags Over Texas on Sunday when a  
raft carrying a dozen people flipped, leaving one woman dead and 10 
others hospitalized. Several bystanders described jumping into the 
4-foot-deep water as park employees stayed on the side and ordered 
them to keep out. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was confusion and chaos. People running the ride didn't  
appear to have a procedure or a plan,'' said Wendy Crown, a dive 
instructor who tried to resuscitate the 28-year-old Arkansas woman 
who later died. ``Waiting for a paramedic? That's not a plan. You 
don't have the luxury of time in a drowning incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics stationed at the Arlington, Texas, park came within  
minutes, officials said. They are the only ones Six Flags requires 
to be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation -- something not even 
the state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Flags is still investigating the incident, including what  
caused the boat to tip, the park's response and whether having a 
lifeguard on hand would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, inspectors, safety consultants and industry  
groups say Six Flags' response was appropriate, standard and legal. 
They also say that serious problems on the rides are unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was the first time someone wound up in the water  
since the ride opened in 1983, and several industry veterans said 
they couldn't remember a similar incident anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	An official at O.D. Hopkins Inc., one of the biggest makers of  
the approximately 100 river rapid rides in parks worldwide, said he 
knew of less than 10 incidents in company history when someone had 
fallen into the water. No one was seriously injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would a lifeguard had helped? I can't speculate. That's like  
saying if airplane passengers had parachutes, would it help,'' said 
Jim Glover, a salesman at the Penacook, N.H.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dodson, an Ohio ride inspector and vice president of the  
National Association of Amusement Ride Safety Officials, said he 
doesn't think it's essential to have someone with water safety 
training operate rides just because there's water involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this for 14 years and we've really had no  
trouble like this, but I guess there are always unforeseen things 
that can happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike wave pools, slides or ``slow river'' rides where people  
float along a lazy channel of water, park-goers aren't expected 
during raft or flume rides to be in the water or even get very wet. 
</P>
<P>
	Park-based paramedics can get to the scene relatively quickly  
during such rare events, Dodson said, and it's not safe for 
bystanders or employees to jump in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employees didn't know what caused the thing to flip. And  
maybe there was electricity in the water. Then you have a bunch of 
electrocuted people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amusement park rides are certified by the state, and  
certification requirements vary. Most states do not require a 
lifeguard for such ``secondary water contact'' rides or that 
someone in the park have water safety training, consultants said. 
Texas does not require safety training of any kind, but parks must 
have $1 million worth of insurance on each ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramount Parks, which has water rides at all five of its  
facilities, trains employees in water safety, including CPR, and 
keeps life jackets on site to throw in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look to go above and beyond the standards to make sure we  
provide the safest possible experience for our guests,'' said 
Paramount spokeswoman Susan Lomax, who declined to comment on the 
Six Flags incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal requirements aside, some in the industry speculate that  
the Six Flags incident may result in more parks hiring lifeguards, 
or at least warning visitors that no lifeguards are on duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not an expectation of going into the water, so there  
needs to be some notification that there isn't anyone trained 
there,'' said Reggie James of Consumers Union in Austin, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Gays Want Bathhouse Rules Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fifteen years after San Francisco cracked  
down on bathhouses in order to block the spread of AIDS, some gay 
men say its time for the city to reverse its policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage in the epidemic people know how to protect  
themselves,'' said Act-Up spokesman Michael Bellefountaine, who met 
with health officials Wednesday. ``We need to start modifying our 
behavior in relation to the epidemic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco logged an estimated 8,000 new HIV infections  
annually in the early 1980s, prompting the then-health director to 
order the bathhouses closed because of concerns they were fostering 
the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge refused, but imposed stringent regulations aimed  
at preventing unsafe sex in the facilities. About 15 city 
bathhouses closed when owners decided they couldn't profit under 
the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of HIV infections have plummeted since then, with  
about 500 new cases annually in the city. Still, unprotected sex 
among gay men is on the rise, said Dr. Mitchell Katz, director of 
San Francisco's Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``If HIV were eradicated, there wouldn't be a concern about HIV  
transmission,'' he said, adding there are no plans by the 
department to reconsider its policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend no studies prove that bathhouses help spread  
HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, and that the current rules 
discriminate against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's restraint of trade, it's violation of civil liberties,  
it's bad science and it's homophobic,'' said Jonathan Klein, a gay 
activist. ``What it really seems to be pandering to is the 
anti-AIDS rhetoric of the early 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz rejected the accusation.  
</P>
<P>
	``None of our rules are targeted towards individuals,'' he said.  
``They only have to do with the environment and only apply to 
moneymaking businesses.''

<HEADLINE> Bouchard Satisfied With Expos' Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUEBEC (AP) -- In a turnaround, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard  
said Thursday the provincial government may help the Montreal Expos 
by providing up to $5.3 million a year to cover interest on a $66 
million loan to be used for stadium construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will it work? We'll see, but there is a business plan,''  
Bouchard said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The provincial government breathed new life into the financially  
troubled Expos on Wednesday by announcing it would look at 
providing up to $8 million per year to cover interest on a 
$100-million stadium loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expos still need to raise several million through the sale  
of seat licenses for their proposed $115 ballpark and complete the 
process of buying out managing general partner Claude Brochu and 
bringing in new investors. 
</P>
<P>
	They hope to have the new stadium built by 2002 season. The  
deadline set by commissioner Bud Selig for financing to be in place 
already has passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have heavy tasks to fulfill,'' Bouchard said. ``They've  
taken a lot on their shoulders. ``We'll see if they can fulfill 
them. We hope they can do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bouchard and finance minister Bernard Landry met with Expos  
chairman Jacques Menard on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Landry said money could be made available to the team from funds  
budgeted for promoting tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not affect the government's financial balance,'' said  
Bouchard. ``We're working within already defined areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's contribution was based on a study by Montreal  
economist Pierre Fortin that said the Expos bring about $10 million 
in tourism to the city each year. That figure has been disputed by 
other economists.

<HEADLINE> Law Curbs Nursing Home Evictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a law Thursday that  
will protect current nursing home residents from being evicted or 
forced to move solely because they rely on Medicaid to pay their 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law closes a legal loophole that allows nursing homes to  
evict their most vulnerable residents. It puts patients ahead of 
profits,'' said Rep. Mike Bilirakis, R-Fla., a sponsor of the 
bipartisan legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately Thursday, Vice President Al Gore announced that the  
administration will seek additional legislation this year to ``help 
ensure that funds designed to help our nation's elderly, poor and 
disabled are not siphoned away by con artists and the 
unscrupulous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among new powers the administration wants is the ability, during  
an investigation, to halt arrangements in which doctors are 
suspected of getting financial rewards to send Medicaid and 
Medicare patients for unnecessary tests or to certain facilities 
for care. If an illegal kickback scheme is uncovered, the 
administration wants new fines of up to $50,000 for those involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the White House will also ask Congress to direct the  
United States Sentencing Commission to study whether current 
punishments for those who defraud federal health care programs are 
stringent enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The nursing home protections Clinton signed Thursday easily  
passed Congress this month. Democrats and Republicans were eager to 
respond to a highly publicized attempt last year by one of the 
nation's largest nursing home operators, Vencor Inc., to remove 
Medicaid patients from some of its homes in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	Public criticism and pressure from government regulators caused  
Vencor to reconsider. But many lawmakers wanted a law that would 
prevent any such actions by nursing home operators in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law would not force nursing homes to accept Medicaid  
patients. However, homes that choose to stop taking new Medicaid 
patients would be barred from evicting or transferring those 
Medicaid patients they already have. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, homes that choose not to accept Medicaid  
patients would have to notify any new residents able to pay their 
own way at first that they might have to move if they eventually 
run out of money and need to rely on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans think of Medicaid as providing health insurance  
to poor families and children. But two-thirds of elderly nursing 
home patients also count on the program to help pay for their care. 
</P>
<P>
	With nursing home costs averaging $40,000 a year, about half of  
the senior citizens who initially pay their own way must turn to 
Medicaid within three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Vencor and nursing home industry groups supported the new law  
but have asked Congress also to look into the fairness of Medicaid 
rates, saying inadequate payments are at the root of some problems 
residents face.

	NATO Hits Range of Yugoslav Targets  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark said today  
that more than 40 targets were struck in the first day of strikes 
against Yugoslavia yesterday. Scores of U.S. cruise missiles and 
radar-evading bombers, leading the NATO attacks, struck Serb air 
defenses, power grids, arms factories, airports, barracks and 
command-and-control centers. Clark said the targets included some 
facilities ``associated with the Yugoslav military and ministerial 
police forces.'' The airstrikes were expected to continue tonight 
and possibly for weeks.

	Fighting Rages in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Authorities said today that 10  
people were killed and 60 wounded in NATO attacks intended to force 
President Slobodan Milosevic to make peace in Kosovo. Fighting 
raged in numerous parts of Kosovo today as ethnic Albanian rebels, 
encouraged by NATO raids, launched attacks against police and 
soldiers, the government's Tanjug news agency said. The guerrillas 
killed two Serb police, Tanjug reported. The Albanian-run Kosovo 
Information Center said Serb police killed a senior member of 
ethnic Albanian leader Rugova's political party. An ethnic Albanian 
union leader was also killed.

	Serb Govt. Expels Foreign Reporters

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian government today ordered  
the expulsion of foreign journalists from countries involved in 
NATO airstrikes. But the federal government of Yugoslavia -- made up 
of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro -- said all journalists 
are welcome to stay, as long as they are objective. The 
contradicting messages reflected the power struggle among relative 
moderates and radicals in top government ranks. Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic was likely to decide whether foreign reporters 
could stay.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating a murder charge  
today against Dr. Jack Kevorkian after a prosecutor told them the 
euthanasia crusader killed Thomas Youk ``like a medical hitman in 
the night.'' Kevorkian, who was acting as his own attorney, 
insisted that his helping to kill the Lou Gehrig's victim was not a 
crime. The trial that began Monday raced toward a conclusion today 
as Kevorkian rested without calling witnesses. Youk, 52, died in 
September, and a tape of his death was seen on ``60 Minutes.''

	FDA Functional Food Rules Sought

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An advocacy group is urging the government to  
tighten controls over ``functional foods,'' which add drug-like 
ingredients to boost healthfulness. For example, a split pea soup 
that contains the antidepressant herb St. John's wort claims to 
``give your mood a natural lift.'' However, the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest says a bowl of soup won't treat clinical 
depression. Some functional foods do work, but the group says too 
many companies tout unproven ingredients or make misleading health 
claims.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Deliberations Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jurors began deliberating a murder charge  
today against Dr. Jack Kevorkian after a prosecutor told them the 
euthanasia crusader killed Thomas Youk ``like a medical hitman in 
the night with a bag of poison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who was acting as his own attorney, likened himself  
to civil rights heroes Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King, 
and insisted that his helping to kill the Lou Gehrig's victim was 
not a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial that began only Monday raced toward a conclusion today  
as Kevorkian rested his defense without calling witnesses. Youk, 
52, died last September, and a tape of his death was later seen on 
``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the presence of the jury, Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper  
rejected the prosecution's proposal for an explicit warning to 
jurors against so-called ``jury nullification'' -- setting aside the 
law out of sympathy for the defendant. In her instructions before 
the deliberations began, she simply told the jurors they must 
follow the law as she gives it. Mercy killing is not an excuse for 
murder, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a  
controlled substance. Cooper told jurors they also could consider 
convicting him of second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	After about an hour of deliberations, the jurors sent the judge  
a note asking to see the videotape of Youk's death and to have a 
legal dictionary. Cooper turned them down on the latter request, 
telling them they could not do their own legal research. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard closing arguments this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be hard for you to disregard Tom Youk's medical  
condition when you look at the video tapes back in the jury room 
... but his medical condition is not what is at issue here,'' 
Oakland County Assistant Prosecutor John Skrzynski said. ``The law 
does not look at the victim and say, `Does the victim have a 
quality of life that's worth protecting?' 
</P>
<P>
	``The law protects everyone,'' he said. ``The law applies to  
everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian did acknowledge, ``Thomas Youk's death was a result of  
my action.'' But in his closing argument Kevorkian said there is no 
conclusive proof that he intended to kill Youk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only I know what really happened,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian reminded jurors of the actions of Parks and King, both  
of whom went to jail. He said that acts like registering to vote or 
drinking beer once were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not  
crimes. This may be one of them. That's for you to decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look at me,'' Kevorkian told the 12 jurors and two  
alternates. ``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a 
murderer? ... If you do, then you must convict. And then, take the 
harsh judgment of history, and the harsher judgment of your 
children and grandchildren if they ever come to need that precious 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's closing argument was repeatedly interrupted by  
Skrzynski's objections. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rebuttal after Kevorkian's argument ended, Skrzynski  
sharply lashed out at Kevorkian and efforts to portray him as 
compassionate and caring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came like a medical hitman in the night with a bag of  
poison to do his job,'' Skrzynski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian filed a motion Wednesday asking Cooper to allow Youk's  
widow and brother to take the stand to back his claim that the 
death last September was a mercy killing, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutors contended in their response that the statements  
between relatives and Kevorkian made on the day Youk died were 
planned with the knowledge they may be useful as a criminal 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an event orchestrated by defendant to push his own  
public agenda,'' the prosecutors' brief said. ``Here, the 
statements made by defendant to Tom Youk's family members were the 
epitome of self-serving declarations, which defendant prepared and 
intended to be used at his future trial, and are not admissible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Cooper sided with the prosecution. Kevorkian then told  
her he would have no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old retired pathologist could get life in prison in  
Youk's death by lethal injection, which was videotaped and shown on 
``60 Minutes'' and was also shown to the jury. He also is charged 
with illegal used of drugs used in the death. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
deaths since 1990. He has been tried four times on assisted suicide 
charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's brief, filed Wednesday, contends that Youk's widow,  
Melody, and Youk's brother Terry should be allowed to testify that 
they wanted Kevorkian to end Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (the judge) has to let us talk about intent. It's the key  
to the case,'' said David Gorosh, a legal adviser to Kevorkian who 
helped him write the brief. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial on Tuesday, Cooper told Kevorkian, who is  
acting as his own lawyer, that he couldn't elicit the testimony 
because Michigan law doesn't recognize the consent of the victim as 
a defense to murder.

<HEADLINE> Herbal-Infertility Link Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have uncovered a new worry about  
some of the most popular herbal remedies: the possibility that they 
could cause infertility, or genetically damage sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women who are pregnant or trying to conceive carefully  
avoid taking prescription and even over-the-counter medications for 
fear they could endanger their chances of a healthy pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But herbs and other dietary supplements are advertised as  
``natural,'' with the implication that they're safe, non-drug 
remedies. In fact, many powerful prescription drugs were derived 
from plants, and many of the herbs sold in health-food stores and 
supermarkets also can have powerful, medicine-like actions -- and 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study by researchers at Loma Linda University suggests  
that the side effects of some of popular herbs -- St. John's wort, 
echinacea and ginkgo -- could include blocking conception. The study 
also uncovered suggestions of genetic damage to sperm, raising 
questions of whether such changes could cause problems for a 
resulting baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The test-tube study is not proof that couples trying to conceive  
should avoid taking herbs. Indeed, lead researcher Dr. Richard 
Ondrizek stressed that laboratory research doesn't always 
accurately predict what happens in humans. Nobody has ever tested 
actual herb users to see if the products concentrate in their sperm 
or eggs -- the key to knowing if there's any risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``this is a very important study that could provide  
important information to patients suffering from infertility,'' 
said Alan H. DeCherney, editor of Fertility and Sterility, the 
journal that published the herb study this month. 
</P>
<P>
	An infertility specialist says the study reinforces warnings he  
already gives couples to avoid such products while trying to 
conceive, because it's better to be safe than sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do tell folks to stop taking them when they're doing  
fertility treatment,'' said Dr. Eric Widra of Georgetown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients constantly ask him if ``there isn't something I could  
go to the health food store and get that's going to help me,'' he 
said. ``They think natural is good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even aside from the herbs now being questioned, some herbal  
products contain hormones like estrogen that raise fertility 
questions, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
	And some herbs have been used for centuries to cause abortions.  
</P>
<P>
	The Loma Linda researchers subjected four herbs to fertility  
testing similar to the testing that medications undergo, mixing 
them with human sperm and hamster eggs. Tested were St. John's 
wort, which treats mild depression; echinacea, purported to 
strengthen the immune system and fight colds; ginkgo, a purported 
memory enhancer; and saw palmetto, which can treat older men's 
enlarged prostates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Loma Linda testing, only saw palmetto did not damage  
sperm or eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's wort completely blocked the ability of sperm to  
penetrate eggs, and echinacea and ginkgo reduced that ability. Eggs 
treated with ginkgo ``were visibly degenerated,'' the researchers 
reported. Echinacea and St. John's wort caused DNA changes reducing 
sperm viability. And sperm treated with St. John's wort showed a 
mutation of a gene called BRCA1, a mutation that when found in 
grown women is associated with an increased risk of breast and 
ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Loma Linda researchers used doses that are a fraction of those  
recommended on the herbs' labels. But because no one knows if the 
herbs that Americans swallow actually wind up in their sperm or 
eggs, more research must be done to see if these herbs really could 
impede fertility. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's most important about this study is it illustrates  
something that gets lost in the discussion of herbal 
preparations,'' Widra said. ``Despite an apparent high degree of 
willingness among people to try these things, there's very little 
science to back up their safety.''

<HEADLINE>  Weiss Gets Medal, Not Quad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michael Weiss didn't get one of the  
seven quads landed in a record-setting jumping performance. He did 
get a bronze medal at the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	With seven skaters completing the four revolution jump Thursday  
night, Alexei Yagudin used the quad to create the difference 
between him and Yevgeny Plushenko. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Weiss gained a bronze medal behind the two  
Russians in the men's event. Meanwhile, Michelle Kwan, feeling 
healthier than early in the week, prepared for today's women's 
short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin unleashed a flawless quad, not only landing it firmly,  
but with flair. Then he knocked off an array of triples in one of 
the most difficult programs ever done at worlds. The program 
included two taxing triple-triple combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko missed his quad when he needed it the most, although  
he did eight triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin received a 6.0 for technical merit from one judge. The  
rest, for technique and presentation, were 5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season was so much harder than last season,'' Yagudin  
said. ``It's so much harder to win a world title or a European 
title again than to win it the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's won both, twice -- he captured his second European title  
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss grazed the ice with his free leg on his quad attempt, not  
getting credit for it. Another American, Tim Goebel, completed the 
first quad salchow-triple toe loop in a world championship and came 
in 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the program is all about the whole program, not just  
about the one quad jump,'' Weiss said. ``I wanted to make sure I 
hit all seven or eight other triples and I really wanted to focus 
in on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did, nailing seven good triples to gain scores between 5.6  
and 5.8 to edge Stojko, the three-time world champion from Canada 
who has yet to come back completely from a torn groin muscle. He 
landed one quad, but missed another and only had five triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss was consistent through Monday's qualifications, Tuesday's  
short program and Thursday's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to focus on what you need to do in order to get that  
medal. I wanted to do three solid programs. I knew it would take 
pacing, and I did that,'' he said. ``I saved a great performance 
for the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan needs to pace herself over the next two days, fighting a  
cold since arriving in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	But she didn't skip Thursday's practice, as previously expected  
to do. The defending champion showed the assurance and consistency 
that occasionally had been missing earlier in the week. She 
repeatedly landed the triple lutz that she unexpectedly turned into 
a double during the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to practice because it would be an opportunity to  
go over some things,'' coach Frank Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance, Russian titleholders Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov were second, but in a virtual tie for the lead. The 
winner will be decided in the free dance tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov could have virtually wrapped up the  
title with a win in the original dance portion, worth 30 percent of 
the total scoring. However, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of 
France won the OD, edging the defending world champs five judges to 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	They skated to a flowing waltz with changing rhythms to music  
from a Russian movie, showing more emotion than the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov had more speed to the drinking song from  
La Traviata, sung by Luciano Pavarotti, but lacked the closeness of 
Anissina and Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were third. Even if  
they win the free dance, if one of the other top two couples comes 
in second, that couple would win the title.

<HEADLINE> FDA Panel To Reassess Diabetes Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- A 16-month debate over the safety of a  
diabetes drug taken by 750,000 Americans is coming to a head, as 
scientists review just how dangerous Rezulin is to diabetics who 
hope the novel medicine will control their disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin has sharply divided the diabetes community.  
</P>
<P>
	Some patients and doctors call it invaluable. Of all the  
medications sold for type 2, or so-called adult onset, diabetes, 
Rezulin is the only one that targets the underlying cause of the 
disease. It has helped patients who have failed other therapies, 
and thus are at higher risk of serious diabetes complications. 
</P>
<P>
	But other specialists have stopped prescribing Rezulin because  
it can attack some patients' livers, causing toxicity that can kill 
or require a liver transplant to survive. On Monday, Britain ruled 
that Rezulin was too dangerous to sell in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration long has warned patients of the  
risk, and urges that they get repeated, rigorous liver tests to 
catch early signs of damage. For many such patients, stopping 
Rezulin can reverse liver damage, FDA drug chief Dr. Janet Woodcock 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But what prompted the FDA to call a highly unusual safety  
meeting today was the alarming finding that a few patients who took 
all those precautions still died -- from severe liver toxicity that 
arose just weeks after they had passed a liver test. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be a residual risk that can't be managed. The  
question is, 'How high is that risk?''' Woodcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of scientific advisers to the FDA will hear from  
defenders of Rezulin, as well as to those who want it banned. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is under intense scrutiny because some of the  
scientists have conducted research funded at least indirectly by 
its manufacturer, Warner-Lambert Inc. And this same panel 
enthusiastically backed Rezulin's initial approval in December 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	One opponent of the drug, consumer advocate Dr. Sidney Wolfe of  
Public Citizen, contends that ill-informed doctors are using 
Rezulin in ways that worsen the risk. How? By prescribing Rezulin 
to patients who are supposed to try less risky therapies first, and 
by not properly conducting the liver tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of people who are dead from this drug, and in  
most cases I think they're people who could have responded to 
something else,'' Wolfe says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of Rezulin outweigh the risks,'' Warner-Lambert  
insists. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has spent months investigating more than 100 reports of  
problems among Rezulin users to sift out which patients' liver 
toxicity Rezulin actually could have caused -- and which diabetics 
may have become ill or died for totally unrelated reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert says 28 deaths and seven liver transplants have  
been linked directly to Rezulin. The company even plans to ask 
FDA's advisers to allow more diabetics to use Rezulin, by letting 
the drug be combined with older diabetes therapies. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Rezulin's harshest critics don't expect the advisory group  
to take the drastic step of recommending that Rezulin be banned. 
But it has many options, from taking no action to recommending much 
stricter safety steps that could hinder how often doctors prescribe 
Rezulin. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA typically follows its advisers' recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of the outcome of today's hearing, experts expect  
Rezulin sales could soon drop off dramatically because two new 
drugs that promise Rezulin's benefit without the liver risk are 
awaiting FDA approval. FDA advisers will examine SmithKline 
Beecham's Avandia and Takeda Pharmaceuticals' Actos next month, and 
they could begin selling by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 million people have type 2, or adult-onset, diabetes.  
Their bodies' natural insulin gradually loses its ability to 
convert blood sugar into energy. Insulin and other medicines can 
help control many patients' blood sugar, but an estimated 1 million 
diabetics need additional help. Uncontrolled diabetes leads to 
kidney damage, blindness, heart disease and other complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Rezulin, known chemically as troglitazone, was widely hailed as  
the first drug to attack this underlying diabetes trigger by 
somehow resensitizing the body to insulin. Many patients need fewer 
daily insulin injections; some have even been able to quit insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA has been issuing escalating warnings about the liver  
side effects since November 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Weiss Gets Medal, Not Quad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Michael Weiss didn't get one of the  
seven quads landed in a record-setting jumping performance. He did 
get a bronze medal at the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	With seven skaters completing the four revolution jump Thursday  
night, Alexei Yagudin used the quad to create the difference 
between him and Yevgeny Plushenko. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Weiss gained a bronze medal behind the two  
Russians in the men's event. Meanwhile, Michelle Kwan, feeling 
healthier than early in the week, prepared for today's women's 
short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin unleashed a flawless quad, not only landing it firmly,  
but with flair. Then he knocked off an array of triples in one of 
the most difficult programs ever done at worlds. The program 
included two taxing triple-triple combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	Plushenko missed his quad when he needed it the most, although  
he did eight triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin received a 6.0 for technical merit from one judge. The  
rest, for technique and presentation, were 5.8s and 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season was so much harder than last season,'' Yagudin  
said. ``It's so much harder to win a world title or a European 
title again than to win it the first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's won both, twice -- he captured his second European title  
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss grazed the ice with his free leg on his quad attempt, not  
getting credit for it. Another American, Tim Goebel, completed the 
first quad salchow-triple toe loop in a world championship and came 
in 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the program is all about the whole program, not just  
about the one quad jump,'' Weiss said. ``I wanted to make sure I 
hit all seven or eight other triples and I really wanted to focus 
in on those.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did, nailing seven good triples to gain scores between 5.6  
and 5.8 to edge Stojko, the three-time world champion from Canada 
who has yet to come back completely from a torn groin muscle. He 
landed one quad, but missed another and only had five triples. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss was consistent through Monday's qualifications, Tuesday's  
short program and Thursday's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to focus on what you need to do in order to get that  
medal. I wanted to do three solid programs. I knew it would take 
pacing, and I did that,'' he said. ``I saved a great performance 
for the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan needs to pace herself over the next two days, fighting a  
cold since arriving in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	But she didn't skip Thursday's practice, as previously expected  
to do. The defending champion showed the assurance and consistency 
that occasionally had been missing earlier in the week. She 
repeatedly landed the triple lutz that she unexpectedly turned into 
a double during the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to practice because it would be an opportunity to  
go over some things,'' coach Frank Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance, Russian titleholders Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov were second, but in a virtual tie for the lead. The 
winner will be decided in the free dance tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov could have virtually wrapped up the  
title with a win in the original dance portion, worth 30 percent of 
the total scoring. However, Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of 
France won the OD, edging the defending world champs five judges to 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	They skated to a flowing waltz with changing rhythms to music  
from a Russian movie, showing more emotion than the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov had more speed to the drinking song from  
La Traviata, sung by Luciano Pavarotti, but lacked the closeness of 
Anissina and Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were third. Even if  
they win the free dance, if one of the other top two couples comes 
in second, that couple would win the title.

<HEADLINE> FDA Lobbied on `Functional Foods' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foods touted for their additions of new  
ingredients to boost their healthfulness are filling supermarket 
shelves, like the split-pea soup with the herb St. John's wort to 
``give your mood a natural lift,'' or the carrot cake with 
heart-healthy fiber. 
</P>
<P>
	But such foods are drawing the ire of consumer advocates who say  
a bowl of soup doesn't treat depression and fiber can't counter the 
cake's fat to make it healthful. 
</P>
<P>
	So the advocacy Center for Science in the Public Interest urged  
the government Thursday to tighten controls over these ``functional 
foods,'' saying too many companies are promoting unproven 
ingredients and making misleading health claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is a mishmash of products that confuses consumers --  
and could backfire by casting doubt on true functional foods that 
do have scientifically proven ingredients, the group contends. 
</P>
<P>
	``While functional foods hold much promise, without effective  
regulation, they may merely become the snake oil of the next 
century,'' CSPI director Michael Jacobson wrote to Food and Drug 
Administration Commissioner Jane Henney. 
</P>
<P>
	Functional foods are not a new concept. One of the first was  
calcium-fortified orange juice, which gives people who hate milk 
just as much bone-healthy calcium per glass as milk. U.S. breakfast 
cereals are fortified with vitamins and minerals; some provide an 
entire day's supply in one bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Functional foods have become a booming industry, estimated to  
bring in $15 billion this year. Yet the FDA has no policy 
determining just what foods qualify, FDA food chief Joseph Levitt 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing such a policy is a top priority that FDA hopes to  
complete this year, Levitt said. This is ``an area of enormous 
public interest'' that will require setting boundaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Food companies were indignant at CSPI's charges.  
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Kellogg's carrot cake contains fat ``does not  
negate the beneficial properties'' of the psyllium fiber added to 
it, said Gene Grabowski of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, 
which represents brand-name manufacturers of functional foods. 
``These are foods that have met scientific tests of safety and 
nutrition, and we think it's irresponsible to say they're bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hain Food Group's line of ``Kitchen Prescription'' soups  
contain such ingredients as St. John's wort. The soups do not claim 
to ``offer therapeutic benefits,'' said Vice President Ellen 
Deutsch. But ``there is a consumer group that desires to consume 
St. John's wort. We are making it available in a good-tasting 
product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The functional-food confusion centers on two issues:  
</P>
<P>
	--What health claims companies can legitimately make. The FDA  
strictly limits which ingredients have enough scientific proof to 
claim they help prevent or treat disease -- and only allows such a 
claim in a food that is healthy overall. But the law allows more 
vague health claims of how a food supports bodily ``structure or 
function.'' Some companies interpret that to mean they can say a 
food ``promotes a healthy heart'' without showing proof, as long as 
they do not say it actually ``reduces the risk of heart disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--How to regulate foods with added dietary supplements such as  
herbs or amino acids. The FDA must declare new foods safe before 
Americans buy them, but Congress lets dietary supplements sell 
without any FDA finding that they are safe or effective. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA did set one boundary on functional foods in December,  
ordering McNeil Pharmaceuticals to prove that its much-hyped 
Benecol cholesterol-lowering margarine is safe before it begins 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeil had argued that Benecol was not a new food, just a  
dietary supplement -- it is made from an ingredient in trees -- and 
thus did not require FDA approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA cited a law that says dietary supplements cannot  
masquerade as foods. Benecol looks and tastes like regular 
margarine and will be sold in supermarkets next to the butter. 
</P>
<P>
	McNeil now is awaiting FDA approval of Benecol.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Pulls Plug on Josta Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pepsi-Cola Co. is pulling the plug on Josta, its  
soft drink with guarana launched less than two years ago amid hopes 
that the brand could generate $500 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Josta was marketed as an invigorating beverage that contained  
caffeine and the Brazilian guarana berry, which Amazon tribes have 
used for years as a stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeff Brown, a spokesman for the nation's second biggest soft  
drink company, said Thursday that Pepsi would end sales of Josta 
after March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guarana is a great niche opportunity, but it is not a big  
enough brand for us to go forward with,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to say how much Pepsi spent on the brand or what  
level of sales Josta achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi, whose brands accounted for 31.4 percent of the $56.4  
billion in sales in the U.S. soft drink market last year, launched 
Josta nationally in July 1997 after two years of market tests. 
</P>
<P>
	While it didn't call its new drink an aphrodisiac, its  
advertising hinted that the drink had hidden powers. 
</P>
<P>
	An introductory television spot for the beverage showed two  
elderly men lamenting that they had to turn down two Swedish nurses 
for a weekend in Paris. Another ad depicted a grandfather confiding 
to his grandson that he regretted his youthful failure to ``chase 
women'' and ``party till dawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said lessons gleaned from marketing Josta have helped the  
company in last fall's launch of Pepsi One, which it hopes will 
expand the market for sugarless colas.

<HEADLINE> Analysts: Boeing Unlikely To Suffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Industry analysts believe a federal finding that  
a flawed rudder system led to two fatal crashes of Boeing 737s is 
unlikely to hurt Boeing in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential impact on Boeing, short of grounding the  
aircraft or requiring a whole new tail section be put on every 
aircraft, would be minimal,'' said Paul Nesbit, analyst at JSA 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board conclusion ``is  
certainly not good news and it could conceivably have some 
influence on future sales,'' he said Wednesday. ``However, the 
record of that aircraft is an enviable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is this is not going to have a great big impact,''  
agreed Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen &AMP; Co. ``Boeing and the 
whole industry are safety conscious -- it's not like they are trying 
to run away from problems like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing contends the 737 is one of the safest airplanes in the  
sky, having carried more than 5 billion passengers on 77 million 
flights during the past three decades. The plane is the world's 
most popular commercial jet, with 3,300 in service. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB on Wednesday concluded two days of hearings into the  
cause of the 1994 crash of USAir Flight 427 near Pittsburgh. It 
directed Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration, which both 
contend the rudder problems are being eliminated, to work together 
to devise further improvements for the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB findings came at a time when Boeing is recovering from  
billions of dollars in losses resulting from production snarls 
after its 1997 purchase of McDonnell Douglas. It still is laying 
off thousands of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The board decided that a jammed hydraulic valve that controls a  
plane's rudder led to crashes near Pittsburgh in 1994 and Colorado 
Springs, Colo., in 1991 and was responsible for the problems on a 
1996 flight in which pilots struggled to maintain control as they 
landed in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In 34 findings of fact, the board declared that 737s do not have  
a rudder control system that is ``reliably redundant'' because the 
two existing control systems merge in a single hydraulic valve, 
known as the power control unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said it believes it has corrected the problem with  
modifications now being made to early models of the twinjet. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charles Higgins, Boeing vice president of airplane safety  
and airworthiness, said the company would work with the FAA and 
outside experts to launch a new round of testing and research to 
determine what more might be done to improve rudder safety. Boeing 
is to report back to the NTSB in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing argues the 737 is one of the safest airplanes in the sky,  
having carried more than 5 billion passengers on 77 million flights 
during the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, there have been five fatal accidents involving 737s  
among U.S. airlines, the NTSB says. There are 3,100 of the jets in 
use worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no finer airplane in the air,'' said John Nance, an  
aviation analyst and author who also is a 737 airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Nance said he was disappointed at the NTSB ruling. He said he  
supports further study of the rudder system, but is leery of a 
major retrofit to the 737 fleet. ``You run the risk of introducing 
a new problem in a new design,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Training that pilots now receive to handle similar emergencies  
may do as much or more to prevent a reoccurrence of the USAir 
crash, Nance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higgins declined to estimate what the new research and any  
additional modifications might cost Boeing and the airline 
industry. To date, he said, the investigation and 737 changes have 
cost Boeing and its suppliers about $130 million, and the airlines 
$20 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not that big of a deal,'' said von Rumohr. He and  
Nesbit said Boeing has contingency funds to handle such expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Boeing's commercial airplane division has  
suffered from snarled production lines, delayed deliveries and the 
expense of merging with McDonnell Douglas. Company officials say 
they have gotten a handle on the problems, and all of Boeing 
managed a profit of $1.1 billion on revenue of $56.2 billion in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NYC Union Official Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former top staff member in New York's largest  
union of city workers has pleaded guilty to helping rig a 1995 
contract ratification vote and to stealing thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Shaplo, former assistant to District Council 37's associate  
director, pleaded guilty Wednesday to grand larceny and a scheme to 
defraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaplo, 70, admitted to a role in rigging the citywide  
ratification vote of Local 1549 to guarantee approval of a proposed 
contract. The local represents city clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaplo said he and others had extra ballots printed, marked the  
ballots in favor of the contract and added these ballots to the 
tally. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was approved and is now in force.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaplo also said that he and two other union officials, Joseph  
DeCanio and Bessie Jamison, inflated invoices for the purchase of 
turkeys to be distributed to union members. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to be sentenced to up to six years in prison and  
ordered to repay $80,000 to the union representing 120,000 city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Jamison, 62, pleaded  
guilty in December to third-degree grand larceny in the turkey 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	DeCanio, 68, pleaded guilty to charges related to the turkey  
scheme and the vote rigging.

<HEADLINE> National Guard Gen. Graham Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Henry V. Graham, the National Guard  
general in 1963 who told Gov. George C. Wallace that he would have 
to step aside when Wallace made his famous ``stand in the 
schoolhouse door'' in support of segregation, has died at 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, a real estate dealer in Birmingham, suffered from  
Parkinson's disease. He died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham played several key roles in the civil rights movement in  
Alabama in the 1960s. As a general in the National Guard, Graham 
was the federal representative who informed Wallace that he would 
have to allow two black students to enter the University of Alabama 
in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Graham and the National Guard helped calm a white mob  
and avert violence when a group of Freedom Riders arrived at the 
Montgomery bus station. 
</P>
<P>
	He also commanded the National Guardsmen who escorted  
voting-rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, following 
the ``Bloody Sunday'' confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	E. Culpepper Clark, author of a 1993 book about the University  
of Alabama confrontation, said Graham was the perfect choice to 
handle the emotionally charged events of the civil rights era. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very cool,'' Clark said. ``He was a person of very even  
disposition, moderate and progressive views and a real civic 
leader. All of those things combined made him the man for the 
moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, two sons, two daughters and eight  
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Congress Condemns Cuba Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted 98-0 on Thursday to call on  
the Clinton administration to seek international condemnation of 
Cuba's human rights record at an upcoming meeting of the U.N. Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a similar resolution earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
	The resolution denounces recent suppression of political  
dissidents and demands that Fidel Castro's government release all 
political prisoners, legalize political parties and schedule free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just over a year ago, Pope John Paul II traveled to Cuba and  
asked Fidel Castro to open up to the world,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, 
D-Fla., the prime sponsor. ``Castro's response was to launch one of 
the most regressive crackdowns of his 40-year reign of terror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is nonbinding on the administration.  
</P>
<P>
	Both chambers of Congress recently passed a similarly worded  
resolution condemning human rights abuses in China.

<HEADLINE>  Officials: New Air Strikes Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States is ready to continue a  
sustained bombing campaign in Yugoslavia indefinitely, top U.S. 
defense officials said today, and there was no sign that Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic would do the one thing that could end 
it quickly: return to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more to follow, unless Mr. Milosevic chooses  
peace,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told Associated Press 
Radio in an interview today. ``This is going to be a long effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior defense officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said a second round of air strikes would begin within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton began another round of  
briefings by national security adviser Sandy Berger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful that our crews returned home safely after  
their work last night and I'm very grateful that the United States 
Congress has expressed support for them,'' Clinton told reporters 
before the meeting. ``I want to say again that our purpose here is 
to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe or a wider war. Our objective 
is to make it clear that Serbia must either choose peace or we will 
limit its ability to make war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he believed airstrikes alone would be sufficient to  
reach his goals, and that NATO ground troops would not be needed to 
protect the Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can create a situation in which we have limited  
their ability to make war and thereby increase the prospects that 
they can protect themselves better,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said ``ample diplomatic  
channels'' remain open to Milosevic if he wishes to signal a 
readiness to discuss peace. Removing Milosevic from power, Lockhart 
said, ``is not one of the objectives of the campaign right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stark statement of what may lie ahead for Yugoslavia, U.S.  
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces, described 
an allied air campaign that would continue as long as necessary to 
prevent Yugoslav aggression against Albanians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to systematically and progressively attack,  
disrupt, degrade, devastate and ultimately, unless President 
Milosevic complies with the demands of the international community, 
we're going to destroy his forces,'' Clark said today at a news 
conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. ``In that 
respect, the operation will be just as long and difficult as 
President Milosevic requires it to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Observing that the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade had not been  
struck, Clark nevertheless underscored that for Milosevic and his 
military ``there is no sanctuary'' within Yugoslavia from NATO 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a near-unanimous vote by the House in support of U.S.  
forces participating in the mission, Republican lawmakers voiced 
concern about the U.S. strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a member of the House Republican  
leadership, said today on Fox News that lawmakers of both parties 
``are quite concerned not knowing when we're going to get out of 
there, how we're going to get out of there. I'm not as concerned 
about a time-frame as I am about us being committed to winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Republican Sen. Bob Dole, who has served President  
Clinton as an envoy in the Yugoslav crisis, said the United States 
and NATO must be in for the long haul. If Yugoslavia refuses to 
yield, Dole told ABC News in a phone interview, ``I think we 
continue, we make it more intense,'' and he added that ground 
forces ``have to be somewhere on the table'' if airstrikes don't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised address Wednesday night, Clinton  
warned that U.S. forces faced grave risks but indicated the assault 
would include no ground troops. ``I do not intend to put our troops 
in Kosovo to fight a war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is a small place, but it sits on a major fault line  
between Europe, Asia and the Middle East,'' Clinton said. ``All the 
ingredients for a major war are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although all U.S. and allied warplanes were reported to have  
returned to their bases safely from the initial assault waves, the 
strikes did exact a tangible diplomatic price. Both China and 
Russia, a historic ally of the Serbs, denounced the strikes during 
a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials had no immediate damage assessment from bombs  
and scores of cruise missiles, but Yugoslav television showed 
pictures of flaming structures at Serb military bases and 
ammunition storage sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said NATO forces would continue hitting the Yugoslav  
military until Milosevic relents in a campaign of repression and 
violence against the majority ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav fighters took to the air and engaged NATO planes in  
air-to-air combat, coming out losers in the first engagements. 
Clark said three Yugoslav MiG fighters were shot down by NATO 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he had been  
told by military briefers that NATO planes downed four MiG-29s, the 
most sophisticated opposing fighter that allied planes could face, 
and destroyed two more on the ground. Before the strikes began, 
Yugoslavia had a force of 15 MiG 29s and 64 older-model fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, Americans seemed largely unengaged in the  
campaign that involved hundreds of U.S. and allied warplanes and 
warships in cruise missile and bomb attacks that set Yugoslav 
targets afire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it, the Serbs and who?'' businessman Mike Rahn, 25,  
said during his lunch break in a Phoenix shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton struggled to answer such questions, referring to maps of  
the region that showed the patchwork of national and sub-national 
boundaries, and a measles-like field of red dots showing the scores 
of Kosovo villages already ravaged by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led attack came after months of diplomacy failed to end  
fighting that has killed more than 2,000 people in Kosovo and left 
hundreds of thousands homeless.

Clinton as an envoy in the Yugoslav crisis, said the United States 
and NATO must be in for the long haul. If Yugoslavia refuses to 
yield, Dole told ABC News in a phone interview, ``I think we 
continue, we make it more intense,'' and he added that ground 
forces ``have to be somewhere on the table'' if airstrikes don't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised address Wednesday night, Clinton  
warned that U.S. forces faced grave risks but indicated the assault 
would include no ground troops. ``I do not intend to put our troops 
in Kosovo to fight a war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kosovo is a small place, but it sits on a major fault line  
between Europe, Asia and the Middle East,'' Clinton said. ``All the 
ingredients for a major war are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although all U.S. and allied warplanes were reported to have  
returned to their bases safely from the initial assault waves, the 
strikes did exact a tangible diplomatic price. Both China and 
Russia, a historic ally of the Serbs, denounced the strikes during 
a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense officials had no immediate damage assessment from bombs  
and scores of cruise missiles, but Yugoslav television showed 
pictures of flaming structures at Serb military bases and 
ammunition storage sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said NATO forces would continue hitting the Yugoslav  
military until Milosevic relents in a campaign of repression and 
violence against the majority ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav fighters took to the air and engaged NATO planes in  
air-to-air combat, coming out losers in the first engagements. 
Clark said three Yugoslav MiG fighters were shot down by NATO 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he had been  
told by military briefers that NATO planes downed four MiG-29s, the 
most sophisticated opposing fighter that allied planes could face, 
and destroyed two more on the ground. Before the strikes began, 
Yugoslavia had a force of 15 MiG 29s and 64 older-model fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, Americans seemed largely unengaged in the  
campaign that involved hundreds of U.S. and allied warplanes and 
warships in cruise missile and bomb attacks that set Yugoslav 
targets afire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it, the Serbs and who?'' businessman Mike Rahn, 25,  
said during his lunch break in a Phoenix shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton struggled to answer such questions, referring to maps of  
the region that showed the patchwork of national and sub-national 
boundaries, and a measles-like field of red dots showing the scores 
of Kosovo villages already ravaged by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led attack came after months of diplomacy failed to end  
fighting that has killed more than 2,000 people in Kosovo and left 
hundreds of thousands homeless.

<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mark Hendrickson signed a 10-day  
contract with the New Jersey Nets Thursday in an effort to bolster 
their injury-depleted front line. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Scott Burrell (ankle) and center Jim McIlvaine  
(shoulder) were placed on the injured list earlier this week, and 
another reserve, center Rony Seikaly, has played only five games 
because of a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick in 1996, Hendrickson appeared in 29  
games with Philadelphia as a rookie and played in 48 games last

<HEADLINE> Cher Says She Believes in Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cher's latest hit single asks whether you  
``believe in life after love.'' Her answer: YES! 
</P>
<P>
	``I've experienced it. It's been a long time,'' she says in the  
latest issue of Rolling Stone. ``I've never been alone this long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While her song extols some of the upside of being single, Cher  
concedes there is a downside: ``There's not someone who tells you 
how adorable you are and rubs your head and goes into a crowded 
press conference and stands at the back and winks at you so that 
you think, `I can get through this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher, who won an Academy Award for 1987's ``Moonstruck,'' is  
returning to the big screen this spring, co-starring in Franco 
Ziffirelli's ``Tea With Mussolini'' with Judi Dench, Joan Plowright 
and Maggie Smith.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya Seeks Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If Oscar De La Hoya has his way, he and Oba  
Carr will know on May 22 exactly how their fight stands at the end 
of each round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was information he could have used the last time he fought,  
when De La Hoya went all out in the 12th round against Ike Quartey 
even though he was leading at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the scoring mattered to De La Hoya at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I'm ahead 15 points, I'm going to go all out in the  
last round,'' De La Hoya said. ``I always close the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum are pushing the Nevada Athletic  
Commission to allow the scoring of the three ringside judges to be 
posted in the arena at the Mandalay Bay when he defends his WBC 
welterweight title against Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes in the wake of the disputed draw between  
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in their heavyweight unification 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in New York was a travesty,'' Arum said. ``And  
no one learned until the fight was over that the crime had been 
committed. I say let's watch the crime as it's occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who remained undefeated in 30 fights with his split  
decision over Quartey, said he wants to lead the way for the 
scoring of the ringside judges to be posted after each round of a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the ones who lose will be the judges who are being paid  
off,'' De La Hoya said. ``The fans can't lose. It's going to 
benefit everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has asked the Nevada commission to allow open scoring on a  
trial basis for a May 8 super bantamweight title fight between WBC 
champion Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough. If that is successful, 
Arum says, he wants it used for the De La Hoya-Carr fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners plan to meet sometime next month to consider the  
request, although some have expressed reservations about a variety 
of scenarios that could occur under open scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to push for open scoring and with my ability and  
what I stand for in boxing, I can do it,'' De La Hoya said. ``You 
expect a good fight and a good decent decision when you go to see a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya might have benefited from open scoring in his fight  
against Quartey. De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card, 
but led by two and one on the other two going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needed to do was outbox Quartey in the final round to  
win. Instead, De La Hoya abandoned all caution and came out and 
knocked Quartey down with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of punches. All three 
judges gave him a two-point round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just instinct,'' De La Hoya said. ``My style isn't to  
survive. It's to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) will defend his WBC title for  
the ninth time against Carr, a Detroit fighter who earned his title 
shot with a win over Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey 
undercard. Also on the card is Floyd Mayweather, who will defend 
his WBC super featherweight title against Goyo Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) has lost his previous two title  
fights, against Quartey and Felix Trinidad and will be a heavy 
underdog against De La Hoya, who might fight Trinidad on Sept. 18 
if Arum and Don King can get together and agree on a price for the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's tough to deal with  
Don King. But I'm really pushing for that fight.''

	NATO Launches New Yugoslavia Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Air raid sirens sounded throughout  
Yugoslavia tonight after dozens of NATO warplanes took off from 
bases in Italy and four warships in the Adriatic Sea launched 
Tomahawk cruise missiles on the second day of the offensive. 
``We're going to systematically and progressively attack, disrupt, 
degrade, devastate and ultimately -- unless President Milosevic 
complies with the demands of the international community -- we're 
going to destroy these forces and their facilities and support,'' 
said NATO commander Wesley Clark. But there was no hint that the 
initial assault was causing President Slobodan Milosevic to rethink 
his refusal to end his offensive against ethnic Albanian 
separatists in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	Fighting Reported Across Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- New fighting flared across Kosovo  
today, with Serbs and ethnic Albanians accusing each other of 
instigating attacks after the launch of NATO airstrikes. Separatist 
rebels attacked government forces in northern and central Kosovo, 
killing two Serb policemen in Lubozda, the Yugoslav government news 
agency Tanjug said. An ethnic Albanian rebel commander said Serb 
police and Yugoslav soldiers were rounding up civilians and burning 
houses in the province. 

</P>
<P>
	House Approves 2000 Budget Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House tonight ratified a Republican  
``budget for the new millennium,'' a blueprint designed to showcase 
support for Social Security, the Pentagon and a new round of tax 
cuts. The 221-208 vote was sharply split along party lines with 
Democrats arguing that the tax reductions would favor the wealthy 
at the expense of the long-term health of Medicare and Social 
Security. Across the Capitol, Senate Republicans were driving 
toward passing a similar budget for 2000.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers who killed an unarmed  
African immigrant in a barrage of bullets were indicted today on 
charges of second-degree murder, a source close to the case said. 
Amadou Diallo, 22, was killed Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his Bronx 
apartment building when the officers fired 41 bullets at him, 
hitting him 19 times. The killing has unleashed a wave of protests 
against police brutality, and the indictments come after days of 
protests outside police headquarters.

acknowledged that Thomas Youk's death ``was a result of my 
action,'' but he said there is no conclusive proof that he intended 
to kill the 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. In his 
closing statement, Kevorkian all but asked jurors to disregard a 
law he considers unjust. ``There are certain acts that by sheer 
common sense are not crimes,'' he said. Kevorkian could get life in 
prison if convicted.

plaintiffs, many of them former steelworkers and shipyard workers, 
are trying to prove they have diminished lung capacity because of 
their exposure to asbestos. The company argued that because blacks 
score consistently lower on tests used to determine lung capacity, 
they should have to meet a higher standard to prove asbestos caused 
lung damage.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bracing for a second day of NATO  
attacks, Yugoslav authorities today said 10 people were killed and 
38 wounded in the thundering waves of strikes intended to force a 
peace pact with rebels in Kosovo. The army reiterated its defiance 
after a night of strikes on more than 50 targets, saying the ``high 
morale of the units was preserved.'' The army statement did not

standard NATO procedure landed safely at the airport. A NATO 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the planes were 
American. No details on when and where the plane was damaged were 
immediately available. NATO launched a series of widespread missile 
and air strikes on neighboring Yugoslavia last night.

Yugoslavia. Instead, Moscow called for an urgent U.N. Security 
Council vote today to stop NATO attacks. A Russian call for a 
council meeting yesterday failed to halt the bombings. When the 
attacks began yesterday, Yeltsin said Russia was halting 
cooperation with NATO and pulling out of the alliance's Partnership

foods' healthfulness. While some functional foods do work, too many

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Exec Charged With Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A tobacco company executive has admitted  
to helping smugglers sell nearly $700 million worth of cigarettes 
on the Canadian black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Thompson, a former R.J. Reynolds executive, pleaded  
guilty in U.S. District Court to money laundering charges Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He could face up to seven years in prison. A sentencing date has  
not been set, U.S. Attorney Thomas Maroney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 51, of Tecumseh, Ontario, was the first tobacco  
industry executive charged in the federal government's four-year 
investigation into tobacco and alcohol smuggling through the St. 
Regis Mohawk Reservation in northern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Thompson arranged to have the company's  
Canadian-brand cigarettes, Export A's, exported to smugglers in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Niagara Falls men -- Larry V. Miller and Lewis and Robert  
Tavano -- were eventually convicted of masterminding the smuggling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The smugglers avoided paying excise taxes to the United States  
by telling customs agents that the Canadian cigarettes they were 
carrying were being brought into the country for export to Russia. 
Instead, they were shipped to the St. Regis reservation and 
smuggled across the St. Lawrence River back into Canada, thus 
cheating the Canadian government of taxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen people already have been convicted in the case and are  
awaiting sentencing. In December, Northern Brands International, an 
R.J. Reynolds subsidiary, admitted helping the smugglers and paid 
$15 million in fines and forfeitures. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was placed on leave after the company began an internal  
investigation into Northern Brands, and Adam Bryan-Brown, a 
Reynolds spokesman, said the allegations against Thompson run 
``completely contrary'' to corporate policy.

October or November. There are, however, serious negotiations to be 
held before it happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's better than a 50 percent chance it will be made,''  
said Dino Duva, president of Main Events, who with Panos Eliades of 
Britain promotes Lewis, also of Britain. ``But a rematch is not 
made, I can tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship between  
Lewis and Holyfield on March 13 in Madison Square Garden isn't 
deserving of rematch on its merits. The decision of a draw in a 
bout that Lewis clearly won, however, will sell a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid several investigations of the decision, including a grand  
jury probe in Manhattan, Don King, the primary promoter of March 13 
fight, recently announced that the two fighters have agreed to 
purses of $15 million each. Holyfield made $20 million and Lewis 
$10 million for the draw, which drew 21,284 fans paying $11 million 
and also reportedly had 1.2 million buys at $49.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
	King made at least $10 million. A rematch would not be set up  
for King to make that much. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be parity across the board,'' Duva said.  
</P>
<P>
	``No deal has been made with King for television,'' said Lou  
DiBella, senior vice president of HBO sports. ``No deal has been 
made for the site and no deal has been made for the date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King said both fighters would like the rematch in September, but  
HBO has a Sept. 18 date for a pay-per-view show featuring Oscar De 
La Hoya of Sept. 18. De La Hoya, the WBC welterweight champion, is 
a major pay-per-view attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The date has to be selected,'' DiBella said. ``It will not  
conflict with De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the fight probably will be held after September.  
</P>
<P>
	Frank Malone, Lewis' manager, has talked about the fight being  
held in Britain,, but Duva said, ``Logistically, it has to be in 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duva noted it would get more publicity here and also the time  
difference favors the United States. Pay-per-view matches always 
start around 11:30 in the East. That would be 4:30 a.m. in Britain. 
A fight in Britain also would be outdoors, adding the risk of rain. 
Rainouts cannot exist in the world of pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem Las Vegas beckons the rematch.  
</P>
<P>
	Selecting a date and a site are the easy part.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made a deal for the first fight knowing it was unfavorable  
to us because we wanted to get a unified champion,'' Di Bella said. 
``We got the short end of the stick, and there still is no 
undisputed champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we negotiated a deal for the first fight, circumstances  
were different,'' Duva said. Holyfield, the WBA and IBF champion, 
was much more popular in the United States than Lewis, the WBC 
champion, who generally was looked on as a challenger. The 
``robbery'' has boosted Lewis' popularity on this side of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Duva said the next fight will need parity, ``financial as well  
as non-financial. On behalf of Lennox, it would be very difficult 
if not impossible to accept King as the lead promoter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the rematch should be a Duva-Eliades-King  
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	While controversy is as much a part of boxing as gloves, DiBella  
wants to guard against suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the public is comfortable with how the  
fight is administered,'' DiBella said. That means the selection of 
payment of the judges and referee. The three sanctioning bodies 
each selected a judge for the first fight, and the New York 
commission selected referee Arthur Mercante Jr., who did a good 
job. The officials were paid by the promoter, King, which is the 
custom in boxing.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya Seeks Open Scoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- If Oscar De La Hoya has his way, he and Oba  
Carr will know on May 22 exactly how their fight stands at the end 
of each round. 
</P>
<P>
	It was information he could have used the last time he fought,  
when De La Hoya went all out in the 12th round against Ike Quartey 
even though he was leading at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the scoring mattered to De La Hoya at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I'm ahead 15 points, I'm going to go all out in the  
last round,'' De La Hoya said. ``I always close the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya and promoter Bob Arum are pushing the Nevada Athletic  
Commission to allow the scoring of the three ringside judges to be 
posted in the arena at the Mandalay Bay when he defends his WBC 
welterweight title against Carr. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes in the wake of the disputed draw between  
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis in their heavyweight unification 
title fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in New York was a travesty,'' Arum said. ``And  
no one learned until the fight was over that the crime had been 
committed. I say let's watch the crime as it's occurring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who remained undefeated in 30 fights with his split  
decision over Quartey, said he wants to lead the way for the 
scoring of the ringside judges to be posted after each round of a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the ones who lose will be the judges who are being paid  
off,'' De La Hoya said. ``The fans can't lose. It's going to 
benefit everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arum has asked the Nevada commission to allow open scoring on a  
trial basis for a May 8 super bantamweight title fight between WBC 
champion Erik Morales and Wayne McCullough. If that is successful, 
Arum says, he wants it used for the De La Hoya-Carr fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners plan to meet sometime next month to consider the  
request, although some have expressed reservations about a variety 
of scenarios that could occur under open scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to push for open scoring and with my ability and  
what I stand for in boxing, I can do it,'' De La Hoya said. ``You 
expect a good fight and a good decent decision when you go to see a 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya might have benefited from open scoring in his fight  
against Quartey. De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card, 
but led by two and one on the other two going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needed to do was outbox Quartey in the final round to  
win. Instead, De La Hoya abandoned all caution and came out and 
knocked Quartey down with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of punches. All three 
judges gave him a two-point round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just instinct,'' De La Hoya said. ``My style isn't to  
survive. It's to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya (30-0, 24 knockouts) will defend his WBC title for  
the ninth time against Carr, a Detroit fighter who earned his title 
shot with a win over Frankie Randall on the De La Hoya-Quartey 
undercard. Also on the card is Floyd Mayweather, who will defend 
his WBC super featherweight title against Goyo Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr (48-2-1, 28 knockouts) has lost his previous two title  
fights, against Quartey and Felix Trinidad and will be a heavy 
underdog against De La Hoya, who might fight Trinidad on Sept. 18 
if Arum and Don King can get together and agree on a price for the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will happen,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's tough to deal with  
Don King. But I'm really pushing for that fight.''

<HEADLINE> German Woman Held in Knife Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A knife-wielding German woman  
intent on being executed in Florida's electric chair tried to drown 
a 4-year-old girl but was thwarted by a bystander, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Ursula Lehmann, 33, of Berlin, was jailed without bond  
Thursday after being charged with attempted murder. The judge 
ordered a mental evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been involved in hostage negotiations and all kinds of  
different things ... but I've never had a situation where someone 
wanted to go through the full extent of the criminal justice 
system,'' sheriff's Lt. James Nygaard said. ``That's a new one on 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Ms. Lehmann wanted to kill someone in Florida so she  
could be convicted of murder and get the death penalty. Germany has 
no death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Erica Roza, 4, suffered only minor cuts on her chin and thumb  
after being attacked Wednesday. She was visiting the beach with her 
family from New York, floating in a plastic inner tube, when Ms. 
Lehmann, wielding a 10-inch knife, grabbed Erica and told her 
cousin, ``If you call the police, I'll kill her,'' Nygaard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls and other children around them started screaming. Ms.  
Lehmann tried to dunk the child about 50 feet offshore, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's screams alerted the girl's mother, Kelly Roza,  
and bystander Gary Angotti, vacationing from Arlington Heights, 
Ill. Other bystanders ran to a nearby sheriff's substation and got 
deputies as Angotti swam out and pulled the girls away from Ms. 
Lehmann, police said.

<HEADLINE> Huskies' El-Amin Gets Them Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Maybe it's the way he motivates.  
Maybe it's the way he mouths off. Either way, Connecticut point 
guard Khalid El-Amin finds a way to get people going. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually it's his team, sometimes it's not. That is the essence  
of El-Amin, a complex young man running a complex system. 
</P>
<P>
	Need a leader? A motivational speaker? An agitator and  
irritator? He's one and the same, sometimes all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like our Energizer bunny,'' teammate Richard Hamilton  
said of El-Amin, who will be one of the most closely watched 
players during college basketball's most-watched weekend. ``He gets 
everybody involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin should be in his element in the Final Four, especially  
in the Huskies' semifinal game Saturday against Ohio State. Both 
teams run similar three-guard offenses in which the shooting guard 
is the leading scorer but the ball-handling guard -- for Ohio State, 
it's Scoonie Penn -- is the creator. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to control the atmosphere and point them in the  
right direction,'' El-Amin said of the Huskies (32-2), the only 
team besides Duke to be No. 1 ranked this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, he doesn't mind pointing the way even when the  
situation calls more for a follower than a leader. 
</P>
<P>
	He proved that on his recruiting visit to UConn, one still cited  
by teammates as proof of his intensity -- or is it ego? 
</P>
<P>
	Upon arriving on campus, he eschewed the normal niceties --  
campus tour, handshakes with the faculty, a nightclub visit -- and 
asked to scrimmage with the varsity players. He immediately chose 
up sides and directed the workout, a serious violation of protocol 
for a high school senior. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been the Huskies' unquestioned leader ever since, even if  
Hamilton is an All-America and forward Kevin Freeman was the Big 
East tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been something very special,'' coach Jim Calhoun said.  
``For the past two years we've won 64 games and, not by accident, 
Khalid joined our team two years ago to make that happen. He makes 
us go, not only physically but psychologically. He's the guy the 
kids turn to for direction, sometimes for courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin proved that when he went 0-for-12 from the field in the  
West Regional final against Gonzaga, yet still had enough presence 
to hand out four assists, go 5-of-6 from the free throw line and 
get three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says a lot about us that he could go 0-for-12 and we still  
won,'' Calhoun said of El-Amin, who averages 13.7 points and 3.8 
assists. ``It also says a lot about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also says something about El-Amin that he has managed to  
focus enough attention and energy on basketball to succeed, even 
while leading an off-court life that is anything but ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
	He is only 19, yet has been married for three years. His wife,  
Jessica, recently gave birth to a son, but he also has a 2-year-old 
son by another woman. Still, he is highly religious; his father, 
Charles, is a leader in the Orthodox Muslim faith. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road, El-Amin is taunted not only about his uncommon  
background but his weight and eating habits; he is only 5-foot-10, 
yet weighs 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pittsburgh, he answered the home fans' game-long taunts by  
jumping on the scorer's table and flashing the No. 1 sign after the 
Huskies rallied from five points down in the final nine seconds to 
win. At Virginia, fans waved pizza boxes at him and asked if Pizza 
Hut should make an on-court delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Freeman is expected to play Saturday despite an ear  
infection that wasn't serious enough to keep him off the team plane 
Wednesday night. The Huskies worked out Thursday at a community 
college and will practice Friday at Tropicana Field.

<HEADLINE> Disney To Pay Comic Character $9.3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. must pay $9.3 million  
for failing to adequately promote and merchandise a cuddly European 
comic-book character called Marsupilami. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a  
judge's decision that Disney had broken its promise to make 
Marsupilami a star on network television and in store merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney failed to produce 13 promised half-hour animated films  
starring the character, never even asked networks to show such 
films, used junior and inexperienced executives for the 
merchandising campaign, and bungled the campaign by starting it 
when no Marsupilami animation was being shown on network 
television, the court said in a 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's mistakes were far from innocent, the court said. It  
cited an internal company memo in October 1992 that said Disney had 
no time for a proper Marsupilami campaign because ``hot 
properties'' like Aladdin and the Little Mermaid were a higher 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie of Los Angeles  
awarded Marsu, the character's parent company, about $8.4 million 
for lost profits and $900,000 in attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsupilami is a yellow and black long-tailed animal, described  
by its creator as a cross between a mouse and a marsupial. It's 
featured in French-language comic books in France, Belgium and 
Germany. Without television exposure, it generated up to $1.2 
million in 1989, the year before Marsu signed a contract giving 
Disney exclusive worldwide rights, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract required Disney to promote Marsupilami in the  
United States with the half-hour films, network exposure, and an 
extensive merchandising campaign. Disney promised Marsu at least $2 
million a year but said it expected significantly higher revenues; 
the payments totaled $5.5 million before Disney canceled the 
contract in 1994, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than producing the half-hour films, Disney persuaded  
Marsu in 1991 to accept a slower release of shorter animations. 
Disney said the strategy was the only way to get the films on the 
air, but failed to reveal that it had never asked any network to 
show the longer animations, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said Disney remained bound by its promise to produce  
the 30-minute films by December 1993, missed that deadline, and 
failed to enforce merchandising guarantees from other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Cardozo, a lawyer for Disney, did not return a telephone  
call seeking comment. In a hearing earlier this month, he argued 
that Marsu's problems stemmed from its own inflated ideas about how 
much money could be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Glaser, lawyer for Marsu, also was unavailable for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Marsu vs. Disney, 97-56547.

<HEADLINE> Tomato Glut Hurts Grower, Consumer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Florida once supplied most of the  
nation's fresh tomatoes, but growers are dropping out fast, 
defeated by competition from Mexico and an abundant domestic 
harvest that makes the fruit a money-losing venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the price that growers receive plummets, most large  
supermarkets aren't lowering prices to consumers, a situation that 
may soon get scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year I see farmers going broke or quit. Every year,''  
said Robert Borek, a second-generation farmer from Homestead, near 
Miami, who is contemplating getting rid of his 250 acres of 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Borek's tomato crop used to account for half the income on his  
1,500 acre farm. ``My only two choices are to quit or to stay in 
this thing till I go bankrupt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Jonas of the Florida Tomato Committee, a growers group,  
said before the North American Free Trade Agreement opened the 
market to cheap Mexican tomatoes, Florida had 320 tomato farmers. 
Now it's less than 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers say the flood of cheap fruit from Mexico was exacerbated  
by this year's favorable growing weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growing in both Florida and in Mexico has been ideal this  
year. We've just had too many tomatoes,'' said Jonas ``It has 
occurred in the past, but way back. It's just very unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, the average price paid to farmers was 22 cents  
a pound, down from 28 cents last week, said Bob Blankenship, an 
economics researcher for the state agriculture commissioner. The 
Florida Tomato Committee estimates that 28 cents to 32 cents per 
pound is the break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
	NAFTA, passed in 1994, has long been a bone of contention for  
Florida tomato farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheap land and abundant water, in addition to growers who don't  
have to pay for Social Security, worker's compensation, or 
unemployment benefits, makes the playing field uneven, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida supplied 65 percent of the tomatoes consumed in the  
United States before NAFTA, compared with Mexico's 35 percent 
market share, Jonas said. Now, Florida supplies only about 35 
percent of tomatoes sold in supermarkets, with 65 percent coming 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Florida growers settled antidumping lawsuits  
challenging Mexico's low tomato prices with an agreement that set a 
floor price for both Mexican and U.S. growers of $5.25 for a 
25-pound box, or 21 cents a pound -- not enough to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	And, there is no limit on the amount of tomatoes Mexico can  
export to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials have been told the U.S. Department of Commerce  
is investigating whether Mexico is again dumping cheap tomatoes in 
the U.S. market. A spokesman for the department who declined to be 
identified said the department is not investigating, but continues 
to monitor for dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the Confederation of Agricultural Associations of the  
State of Sinaloa in Mexico weren't returned Thursday. Sinaloa is 
the largest tomato producing region in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the situation, supermarket prices for tomatoes are  
stable or even higher, said Blankenship. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, for instance, the retail price went up from $1.48 to  
$1.52 a pound last week. ``We're puzzled why that would be 
happening,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional representatives have asked the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture to step in. Annette Clauson, an economist with the 
department, said Thursday it is considering whether to open an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Clerc, a spokesman for the big southern supermarket chain  
Winn-Dixie Stores Inc., sought to explain the disparity. ``There 
are a lot of steps in between the field and the product packaged 
and offered for sale in the supermarket. Our objective is to be 
competitively priced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the problem is that large supermarket chains are buying  
each other out, Blankenship, the state economist, suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are fewer buyers because of consolidation. There's less  
competition, and that's one of the overall things when you're 
looking at what impact this may be having not only on fruits and 
vegetables .. but all grocery items.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While consumers aren't seeing lower prices, they do get one perk  
from the current oversupply: higher quality. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida farmers for the last three to four weeks have harvested  
only the best quality tomatoes, an effort that artificially limits 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Borek estimated that about 60 percent of his crop would be  
harvested, with the rest left to rot on the vines.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Oriole Game by Invite Only </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Only people invited by the Cuban government will  
be able to attend Sunday's exhibition game between the Baltimore 
Orioles and a national Cuban team. 
</P>
<P>
	Grumbling began even before the rumors were confirmed Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't be fair,'' a 21-year-old fan of the hometown  
Industriales who gave his name only as Camilo said Wednesday night 
at a raucous playoff game at the Latinoamericano stadium. ``We are 
the true fans. We come for every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, before it was announced by Cuba's  
government-controlled media, the news was spreading throughout 
government workplaces, schools, parks, and along Havana's famous 
seawall, the Malecon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no sale of tickets at the stadium,'' Reinaldo  
Calviac, director of the International Press Center, said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there are massive events like this it is not possible  
that the entire public goes. Everything must be by invitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate information on exactly who would be  
invited, but authorities said it was likely that the invitations 
would go to members of organizations such as government schools and 
sports clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city as baseball-mad as Havana, such invitations will be  
highly coveted. 
</P>
<P>
	The rustic Latinoamericano stadium built in 1946, where Sunday's  
game will be played, holds only 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who will be allowed in on game day are about 600  
journalists accredited for the event, including more than 400 
foreigners, about 320 of them working for U.S. media. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in attendance will be a group of 100 Baltimore area  
students - including 15 inner-city boys from a Baltimore Jesuit 
middle school, who arrived in Havana Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first time in 40 years that a major league team  
has played in Cuba. Big leaguers used to come to the island 
regularly before the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is only an exhibition game, Cuban officials are  
downplaying its importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important game, the most interesting games right now  
in Cuba are our playoff games,'' Industriales coach Juan Gomez said 
Wednesday night before his team beat Isla de Juventud and earned a 
spot in the final, to be held after Sunday's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most important thing: to be national champion.''

<HEADLINE> Panel: Ease Campaign Fund Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign contribution limits that haven't been  
changed since they were imposed in 1974 contribute to public 
cynicism toward government, a retired Republican senator said in 
urging a Senate panel to ease the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said the limits are  
``antiquated'' and must be raised to account for inflation. They 
remain at $1,000 for donations from individuals and $5,000 for 
contributions from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Coats said Wednesday that the constant hunt for money takes  
lawmakers away from the job of governing, which reduces public 
confidence in elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing the limits, he argued, would free lawmakers to focus  
on issues and legislation since they would be able to raise money 
from fewer sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Demaris Miller, a Republican who lost a bid to unseat Rep. Jim  
Moran, D-Va., told the panel that she favors eliminating limits on 
contributions from individuals, or at least increasing them to the 
level imposed on political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
	She said existing limits put challengers at a disadvantage.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the 1974 law is an example of good intentions gone  
bad,'' she said before describing her difficulties raising money 
and getting her message out to voters. ``I was seriously 
constrained by this 25-year-old ... fund-raising limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Christopher Dodd of  
Connecticut, expressed skepticism about assertions that lawmakers 
would willingly limit their fund-raising should contribution limits 
be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view the problem as too much money in the system, not too  
little,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said higher limits could increase cynicism among those  
who can't afford to donate large sums. ``I'm deeply worried about 
that,'' Dodd said. ``We've got to be careful that they don't feel 
further disenfranchised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., however, noted that even President  
Clinton, among other officials, has said the limits should be 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House passed a major campaign finance bill that  
would have banned ``soft money'' -- unlimited and unregulated 
donations to political parties. The bill, reintroduced by Reps. 
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., also would 
have limited issue advertising and expanded disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure supported by a majority of the Senate failed  
to reach a final vote in that chamber last year and also has been 
reintroduced by its sponsors, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and 
Russell Feingold, D-Wis.

<HEADLINE>  Buckeyes Rely On Supporting Cast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Some teams are good at recognizing  
the open man. Others are good at recognizing a changing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State got where it is -- the Final Four against Connecticut  
on Saturday -- by recognizing its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an egoless collection of guys for the most part,''  
coach Jim O'Brien said. ``Everyone has an ego, but it has never 
been a problem with these guys to understand who the marquee 
players are. That's a tribute to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those marquee players are Michael Redd and Scoonie Penn. They're  
1-2 on the team in scoring, postseason honors and garnering 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Ohio State to keep playing beyond Saturday night, it  
must continue to get solid contributions from a supporting cast 
that opponents don't recognize until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to offer something,'' is the way forward Jason  
Singleton puts it. 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare to find a team where players' roles are so clearly  
defined. 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Mop-up Man    	
</P>
<P>
	Singleton -- called the ``Robin'' of the team by Penn -- seldom  
wanders far from the basket on offense, unless it's to set a pick 
or to set up a teammate with a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a 15-foot jumper he hit earlier in the season, the  
6-foot-5 senior said he couldn't remember ever shooting that far 
from the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost always draws the toughest defensive assignment from  
the opposing front line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie and Michael are front stage and he's the guy handling  
the curtains,'' backup forward George Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
                          *The Shot Blocker    	
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, during an 8-22 season, the Buckeyes were forced to  
play zone every game because they couldn't keep up with fast point 
guards, and Ken Johnson was constantly in foul trouble, trying to 
block every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Penn, who sat out his transfer year from Boston  
College, has shored up the perimeter defense. And Johnson, a 6-11 
junior, has picked his spots and has been a major factor in Ohio 
State's remarkable turnaround to a 27-8 record. In the South 
Regional final win over St. John's, he blocked seven shots and had 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the St. John's game, he played out of his mind. He played  
the best game of his whole life,'' Penn said. ``If he wasn't doing 
the things he's doing, we wouldn't be here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Defender    	
</P>
<P>
	How many other teams dramatically change their starting lineup  
after 31 games? That's what O'Brien did when he inserted freshman 
Brian Brown in place of Jon Sanderson before the NCAA first-round 
game with Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown handles the ball, allowing Penn and Redd to scissor  
through picks for open shots or beat defenders backdoor. He also 
guards the top perimeter threat, shielding the Buckeyes' big two 
from foul trouble and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie and Mike, they've been carrying this team all season  
long offensively,'' Brown said. ``But Scoonie and Mike couldn't be 
here without us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Minutemen    	
</P>
<P>
	When O'Brien needs someone to muscle the other team's big man,  
he can call on the broad-shouldered Sanderson. If the offense is 
stagnant, he brings in 6-7 junior-college transfer Reese. Senior 
Neshaun Coleman is the team's 3-point specialist and freshman Boban 
Savovic spells the guards and has broken open a couple of games 
with perimeter shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	All have pluses and also minuses. Finding the right combination  
is a strange balancing act for O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a collection of guys who do a couple of things pretty  
well and have some limitations,'' he said. ``Where you have a gain, 
sometimes you have a loss. So you just have to keep weighing the 
trades.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Internet Stock Firm Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese brokerage,  
said Friday it plans to set up a new company specializing in 
Internet stock trading, a burgeoning business in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new firm is to start operations Oct. 1, when stock brokerage  
commissions in Japan are completely liberalized, a Nikko spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikko spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused  
to discuss other details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai financial daily said the new firm, tentatively  
called ``Nikko Online Securities,'' will be set up by May, with 
half of its capital owned by Nikko Securities group and the 
remaining 50 percent by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure the security and reliability of the online system,  
Nikko will team up with a systems development firm operated by 
Timothy McCarthy, former president of U.S.-based Charles Schwab 
Corp., the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese electronics giant Sony Corp. also said Friday it will  
invest in an Internet brokerage service, 
</P>
<P>
	Sony will take a 50 percent stake in a joint venture to be set  
up with Oki Matsumoto, an adviser at Goldman Sachs and Co., as 
early as next month, a Sony spokesman said. The joint venture 
between Sony and Matsumoto is to start in October. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Daiwa Securities Co., another major Japanese  
brokerage, announced it and seven other U.S. and Japanese companies 
have jointly established an online brokerage service firm 
specializing in Japanese securities. 
</P>
<P>
	That Tokyo-based joint venture, DLJdirect SFG Securities Inc.,  
is to begin operations in June. The seven other firms joining the 
venture include DLJdirect Inc., a major U.S. online brokerage firm 
and four Sumitomo group companies.

<HEADLINE> USDA Unveils Child Food Pyramid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The much-used food guide pyramid with pictures  
of broccoli and bread has been updated with a jazzed-up version for 
kids, complete with soccer-playing children and colorful pictures 
of ice cream, cereal and peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of an effort by the Agriculture Department to improve  
children's eating habits by making healthy eating seem fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, surrounded by more than two  
dozen preschoolers, said the new version is intended for youngsters 
from ages 2 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutritional advice does not differ from the original food  
pyramid. But the new guide features bright colors and graphics of 
children exercising, foods they like to eat and materials they can 
understand -- for example, simplified food group names, as well as 
shortened and single numbers for servings rather than a range of 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the milk group, of which children are recommended  
to have two servings daily, shows a glass of milk with yogurt, 
pudding, ice cream and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	The fruit group, which also recommends two servings, shows a  
picture of strawberries, an apple, a fruit cup and a boxed fruit 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key message of the children's pyramid is variety,''  
Glickman said. ``There are no 'good' foods or 'bad' foods. 
Healthful diets depend on choosing a wide variety of foods of all 
types: grains, vegetables, fruits, meat and dairy products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original food pyramid, released in 1992, has a black  
background and features terms like dry beans and fats and oils. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's pyramid comes at a time when 20 percent of  
American children are categorized as obese, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of nutritional guidelines for kids to follow when  
they're young so they can keep going down that road as they get 
older,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department hopes companies, many of which now use the  
original pyramid on cartons of cereal and other foods, also will 
feature the children's pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the department's endorsement of the new design, some  
activists questioned whether the children's pyramid would send the 
wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indirectly I think it does recommend hamburgers and ice cream  
and higher fat by showing them in the pyramid as the ideal diet,'' 
said Margo Wooten, senior scientist with the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest. ``Why not clearly mark the milk as 1 percent 
milk?''

<HEADLINE> Source: NY Cops Charged in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers who killed an unarmed  
African immigrant in a barrage of bullets were indicted Thursday on 
charges of second-degree murder, a source close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments come after days of protests outside police  
headquarters that brought hundreds of disorderly conduct arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who has knowledge of the still-sealed indictment,  
spoke to The Associated Press on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers -- Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and  
Richard Murphy -- were indicted on second-degree murder charges and 
some were indicted on lesser charges, according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, 22, was killed Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his  
Bronx apartment building when the officers fired 41 bullets at him, 
hitting him 19 times. An attorney has said the officers had thought 
Diallo was reaching for a gun, but later discovered he was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the officers have spoken publicly about the case and  
their lawyers said they declined to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has unleashed a wave of protests against police  
brutality and angered critics who say police officers target and 
harass black and Hispanic people. The four officers involved in the 
shooting are white; Diallo, who was from Guinea, was black. 
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks, more than 800 people have been arrested,  
including former Mayor David Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel, rabbis, 
lawyers, labor leaders and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, the lawyer for Officer Carroll, said neither he  
nor his client had been notified of the indictment. Police declined 
to comment publicly Thursday.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Worries About S&AMP;P </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is moving to stem its loss of  
U.S. shareholders amid a growing perception that the newly merged 
automaker is more German than American. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-Chairman Robert J. Eaton told Wall Street analysts this week  
that he recently met with officials in Washington to seek their 
help in persuading Standard &AMP; Poor's to reverse its decision not to 
include DaimlerChrysler in its S&AMP;P 500 index of U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the merger took effect in November, the percentage of  
DaimlerChrysler shareholders in the United States has fallen to 25 
percent from 44 percent. DaimlerChrysler said that change prompted 
S&AMP;P to leave it out of the index. In turn, many large mutual funds 
that track the S&AMP;P 500 unloaded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton revealed the behind-the-scenes lobbying to a small group  
of analysts at a private meeting in New York earlier this week. The 
analysts said Eaton did not identify the Washington officials with 
whom he discussed the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Curtrise Garner said she could  
neither confirm nor deny Eaton's comments to the analysts, but said 
the company was hopeful S&AMP;P would change its policy in light of the 
industry's rapid globalization. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the economy changes and as indexes change, we think it's  
something that probably will be re-evaluated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But S&AMP;P spokesman Bill Jordan said that was unlikely.  
DaimlerChrysler was not included in the S&AMP;P 500 because it is not a 
U.S. company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a German company, it pays taxes in Germany, it's  
incorporated in Germany,'' Jordan said. ``Our long-standing policy 
is that non-U.S. companies will not be added to the S&AMP;P U.S. 
indexes. It's fairly straightforward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts questioned what Eaton hoped to gain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise me he said it, but I doubt it's going to  
amount to anything,'' said Gary Lapidus of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; 
Co. Lapidus did not attend the Eaton briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have been backing off support for DaimlerChrysler  
stock. They complain that news affecting the company's financial 
performance has come out of Germany first with no advance warning 
to Wall Street. The release of its 1998 financial results has come 
slowly in bits and pieces; the final figures won't be released 
until Wednesday, long after GM and Ford have released their 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler stock closed Thursday up $3 at $87.87 1/2 a share  
on the New York Stock Exchange, down 19 percent from its high of 
$108.62 1/2 on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton told the analysts that DaimlerChrysler will report full  
first-quarter financial results like an American company on April 
28. American companies typically disclose more detailed financial 
information in a more timely manner than companies operating under 
German law. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Eaton also told them he erred in announcing early  
on that he would retire within three years of the merger and leave 
Juergen Schrempp in sole control. Eaton headed Chrysler Corp. and 
Schrempp was chairman of Daimler-Benz AG before the two companies 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement and subsequent rumors that Eaton may retire  
earlier have added to the perception within DaimlerChrysler's North 
American operations that the Germans are in charge. The defections 
of several top U.S. executives to General Motors Corp. and Ford 
Motor Co. haven't helped. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, an industry expert at the University of Michigan,  
said it's important for DaimlerChrysler to reverse that perception 
and improve morale among U.S. executives who may feel marginalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to head off any more exodus that could occur, and  
there could be more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Park Service To Study Microbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A judge ordered the National Park Service  
to study the environmental impact of allowing biotech researchers 
to use microbes from Yellowstone's hot springs for commercial 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ordered  
the environmental study Wednesday. David Burna, a Park Service 
spokesman, said Thursday the agency will not appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Diversa, a San Diego biotechnology firm that farms hot springs  
microbes for industrial uses, agreed to pay Yellowstone $175,000 
over five years, plus an undisclosed percentage of whatever 
commercial profits grow from its microbe research. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the agreement ``marks the first time in history  
that an American national park would stand to gain financially from 
scientific discoveries made within its borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge noted that other microbe research has led to products  
ranging from paint strippers to cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellowstone is a particularly fertile field for such research,  
the judge said, because it is home to 80 percent of the world's 
geysers and more than half of its thermal features. Microbes that 
can live in such an environment are more likely to also survive hot 
industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract between the government and Diversa  
remain secret. That secrecy is being challenged in a separate suit 
by the groups that sued to demand the environmental considerations. 
They argue that federal law prohibits any natural resources -- from 
minerals to pine cones -- from being removed from national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellowstone Superintendent Mike Finley said the ruling will  
deprive the park of needed money.

<HEADLINE> Senators Want To Cut Co. SEC Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators of both parties want to help  
companies by cutting the fees they pay the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, most of which end up in the government's general 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt on Wednesday endorsed the idea, which  
has backing from Wall Street and political traction at a time of a 
big federal budget surplus, now at an estimated $111 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As the stock market has boomed, the SEC has collected in fees  
from publicly traded companies and the securities industry nearly 
five times what the market watchdog agency needs to operate. For 
the current fiscal year, the SEC is expected to take in $1.52 
billion in securities registration, transaction and other fees, 
while its operating budget is only $337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., chairman of the Senate Banking  
subcommittee on securities, and Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., the 
panel's vice chairman, both called the excess fees ``a backdoor 
tax'' on companies trying to raise capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The government should ``give money back to the taxpayers,''  
Bunning said at Wednesday's subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., another panel member, said the  
fees ``were not meant to be a tax.'' With record numbers of 
Americans investing in stocks, he said, ``It is unfair to keep the 
fees at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the full Banking  
Committee, also criticized the excess fees but noted in a statement 
that there is no ``clear consensus on how to fix the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levitt testified that the SEC has tried to reduce the fees by,  
for example, eliminating fees for certain types of disclosure 
forms. On Tuesday, the agency agreed to eliminate transaction fees 
on some over-the-counter stock trades -- a change Levitt said would 
save companies an estimated $15 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he added, ``These actions just begin to scratch the  
surface. ... We've got to force costs down'' to make the U.S. 
securities industry more competitive in the global market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association,  
said the excess fees ``drain capital from the private markets, 
removing it at the very beginning of the capital-raising process, 
and diverting it into the U.S. Treasury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is real capital that could be used to fund new  
businesses, to build plants, to create jobs and to add to the 
national wealth,'' Lackritz testified.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Pray at Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of Muslim  
pilgrims piled into -- and on top of -- buses on their way to a 
ritual of solemnity, prayer and reflection today, a key part of the 
annual hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	From midday until after sunset, pilgrims will stand praying and  
reflecting on their lives at Mount Arafat, where Mohammed, Islam's 
chief prophet, gave his last sermon 14 centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some two million pilgrims swathed in simple white robes made  
their way Thursday to the plain of Mina, six miles north of Mecca, 
where Mount Arafat is located. Some walked, others held tightly to 
the roofs of crowded buses. The hajj chant of ``Here I am, oh 
Almighty, here I am'' reverberated across Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ritual takes place on Islam's holy day, Friday, for  
the first time since 1994, giving this year's hajj the status of a 
``greater pilgrimage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around 1.2 million Saudis are participating in this year's hajj,  
the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which involves performing set 
rituals over a series of days. All able-bodied Muslims are required 
to perform the hajj at least once if they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saudi official said Thursday that fewer foreigners have come  
this year, attributing the drop to economic troubles in southeast 
Asia and among oil producing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic and political turmoil has reduced the number of  
pilgrims from Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the 
world, from 230,000 last year to 70,000, according to the official, 
who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has been hit hard by the Asian economic meltdown,  
which devalued currencies and caused widespread unemployment. The 
crisis also led to political turbulence and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilgrims in neighboring Persian Gulf states also were believed  
to be staying home because of slumping international oil prices, 
the official said. Specific figures, however, were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were more than enough pilgrims to create traffic  
jams that turned a 15-minute trip into a 90-minute crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	All over the streets, volunteer coordinators and police called  
out, ``Yalla, ya hajj'' -- ``Hurry up, pilgrim!'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 45,000 personnel have been mobilized to deal with the  
pilgrims, including security troops, caterers and medical teams. 
</P>
<P>
	A million prepared meals will be sold at 1,500 centers, and 35  
bakeries will prepare about 5 million loaves of bread daily, said 
Mohammed Hussein Qaroub, a Trade Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
	Walkways have been widened, many covered to provide shade.  
Phone, mail and telex services are also available. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saudis also have prepared for disasters. More than 27,000  
fireproof tents have been set up, part of a $640 million project 
that will be completed by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, fire tore through a sprawling, overcrowded tent city at  
Mina, trapping and killing more than 340 pilgrims and injuring 
1,500. A stampede last year killed 180 pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the world's high-ranking officials performing the hajj  
this year are Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Aslan Maskhadov, president of 
Russia's breakaway Chechnya region.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Air Lines Grounded by FAA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal regulators ordered Kiwi  
International Air Lines to stop flying Wednesday, saying the tiny 
discount carrier was ``unable or unwilling'' to fly with top safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration also ordered the  
Newark-based carrier, which filed for bankruptcy Tuesday, to 
surrender its operating certificate and cancel its six-city flight 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kiwi is unable or unwilling to provide service with the  
highest possible degree of safety,'' the FAA said in a letter to 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Kiwi's planes were in ``unairworthy condition,''  
that it failed to adequately maintain aircraft and could not 
operate safely without constant monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcy lawyers told a judge the airline would meet Thursday  
with the FAA to try to get it to rescind the order. The airline 
also has 10 days to appeal the FAA's decision to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's grounding of Kiwi comes a day after the U.S.  
Department of Transportation threatened to shut down the airline in 
three weeks if it didn't come up with a better management plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Kiwi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,  
declaring nearly $11 million in debt, and said Pan American 
Airlines Inc., the former commercial airline that now flies 
charters, would give it $3 million to allow it to fly its current 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella on Wednesday  
scheduled a Monday hearing on Pan Am's petition to buy Kiwi's 
assets. Pan Am, which bases seven planes in Portsmouth, N.H., 
remains ``very interested'' in acquiring Kiwi, Kiwi CEO Gene 
Gillespie said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi planned to meet Thursday with the FAA to try to get it to  
rescind the order, company spokesman Rob Kulat said. The airline 
also has 10 days to appeal the FAA's decision to the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi pilot Robert Link said he was not surprised by the  
grounding, blaming a series of poor managers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is we were undercapitalized from day one  
and therefore we were handicapped,'' Link said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the FAA revoked Kiwi's flight certificate,  
although the airline has had three other shutdowns in its short 
life, which Kiwi maintained stemmed from paperwork disputes with 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent one came during the winter of 1996 after the  
airline entered its first bankruptcy. It resumed scheduled flights 
in January 1997 while still under Chapter 11 protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA increased its surveillance of the strapped airline early  
this year, spokesman Jim Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its letter to Kiwi, the FAA said Kiwi was operating with only  
three planes; the airline had said it was working with four. The 
company two of the five Boeing 727 planes it lists as available are 
out of service, one because of the company's failure to pay for 
maintenance and the other because of its repossession by a British 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said high management turnover has affected the  
safety of Kiwi's operations. Seven managers at the airline have 
resigned in the past two months, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi failed to notice an excessive oil leak in one of its  
planes' engines and failed twice to repair it properly, the FAA 
said. It also flew eight flights in March on a plane that had a 
leak in its exhaust duct that was scorching a panel on one of its 
wings, the agency said. FAA inspectors notified Kiwi of the leak 
but the airline failed to repair it, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi then repaired the leak and declared the plane ready for  
service, but the FAA found that the leak remained, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi spokesman Rob Kulat said the problems the FAA listed are  
minor and not unusual for most airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We maintain a perfect safety record,'' Kulat said. ``We've  
flown over 8 million people without incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Newark International Airport on Wednesday, passenger Laura  
Kennedy learned that her 5:50 p.m. flight to Orlando and West Palm 
Beach, Fla., was canceled. Kennedy, 22, said she had driven five 
hours from Elmira, N.Y., to catch the flight, which originally had 
been scheduled to leave at 11:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stuck,'' said Kennedy. ``I had no idea there was even an  
issue with Kiwi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines has agreed to allow Kiwi ticketholders to  
fly standby until April 1. Confirmed tickets can be purchased at a 
discount fare, Continental said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi has struggled since its founding in 1992 by airline  
employees who had lost their jobs at other carriers, mostly Pan Am 
and Eastern. The founders chose the name of a flightless bird for 
their upstart enterprise to symbolize the loss of their wings at 
their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak, the airline had 1,200 employees, 15 leased jets and  
flew 65 flights a day. It now employs 500 and flies out of Newark, 
Orlando, Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., and San Juan and Aguadilla, 
Puerto Rico. The airline recently pulled out of Atlanta, Boston, 
Chicago and Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi filed for bankruptcy in September 1996, declaring $20  
million in debt. It was resurrected a year later by Baltimore 
physician Charles Edwards, who bought the airline for $16.5 million 
and took majority ownership of the company from the employees.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Colon Signs $9.25M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Something happened in the past two  
weeks that seemed to make the Cleveland Indians' offer of a 
long-term contract more appealing to Bartolo Colon. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it the Kerry Wood clause.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon, who has been seeking a multiyear deal with the Indians  
for the past two seasons, agreed Thursday to a $9.25 million, 
four-year contract with a club option for 2003 that could make the 
deal worth $15 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon and his agent, Mitch Frankel, wouldn't admit it, but when  
Wood went down with a season-ending elbow injury earlier this 
month, Colon may have decided it was time to finally sign with 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of staying with his original one-year deal -- it would  
have paid him $221,000 in the majors, $153,000 in the minors -- 
Colon gets a $500,000 signing bonus, $500,000 this year, $1 million 
in 2000, $2.5 million in 2001 and $4.5 million in 2002. Cleveland's 
option is at $6 million with a $250,000 buyout, and Colon can earn 
additional money with performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said before, I don't think there's any team in major  
league baseball that would not want to have Bartolo Colon in its 
rotation,'' Indians general manager John Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians are hoping Colon, 23, can build on a solid but  
inconsistent first year in the big leagues. His '98 season was 
highlighted by an All-Star appearance and a complete game shutout 
of the New York Yankees in the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a breakout, breakthrough year,'' Hart said.  
</P>
<P>
	Colon finished 14-9 with a 3.71 ERA in 1998, leading the team  
with six complete games and two shutouts while pitching 204 
innings. He earned his first All-Star selection after going 9-4 in 
the first half with a league-best 2.46 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Having never pitched more than 128 innings in a season, he  
struggled in the second half, going 5-5 with a 5.65 ERA in 14 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon's deal is similar to the $9 million, four-year contract  
Jaret Wright signed with the Indians last October. Frankel admitted 
he factored Wright's numbers into his negotiations with the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Wright's contract was a barometer,'' Frankel said.  
``It was something to work from. Jaret's contract was relevant but 
it wasn't a hindrance or a help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 22-year-old Wright and Colon, the Indians have two of the  
most promising young pitchers in baseball. By signing both to 
long-term deals, the club is avoiding the possibility of having to 
shell out bigger bucks to either in salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Cleveland just has to hope one of them can emerge as a  
bonafide No. 1 starter capable of winning 20 games and carrying the 
team to a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's to a great advantage for this franchise to  
have both Jaret Wright and Bartolo Colon as one-plus pitchers 
signed to through their arbitration years. It's very meaningful and 
certainly a commitment, but we're throwing our lot into these 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, who a few years ago began the trend of signing young  
players to long-term deals, said he isn't worried about any drop 
off in Colon now that he is financially secure for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really works in just the opposite (way),'' Hart said.  
``These young players have things they want to accomplish in the 
game. This is really the first bite out of the apple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colon had little to say during the news conference, deferring to  
his adviser, Carmen Feliciano, and Frankel to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon said the only plans he has made so far with his new  
contract was to build a new home for his parents in the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being from a poor family,'' he said through an interpreter,  
``this means I can help out my wife, my mom, my dad so this means a 
lot to me.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Retail Chain To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Daiei Inc., Japan's largest retail chain operator,  
announced Thursday that it will slash 3,000 jobs and scuttle 
unprofitable operations this year in a far-reaching restructuring 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be accomplished through a freeze on hiring and  
early retirement, Daiei President Tadasu Toba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has 16,000 people working at the parent company and  
6,000 parent employees on loan to affiliated units. 
</P>
<P>
	The major supermarket chain will shut down 20 stores and sell  
off several money-losing ventures, including the Ala Moana Center 
shopping mall in Honolulu, in order to concentrate on its core 
retail business. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the reorganization, Daiei hopes to post a parent pretax  
profit of 20 billion yen ($170 million) by fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Daiei also said it will not make dividend payments for this  
fiscal year, which ends March 31. The company lowered its 
unconsolidated net profit estimate for fiscal 1998 to $8.6 million 
from $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Supermarket sales in Japan have fallen sharply since the  
government raised the national consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 
percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Firms Explore Sea Rocket Launches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If all goes as planned, a rocket carrying a  
five-ton dummy satellite will lift off from a floating launch pad 
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean this weekend as the commercial 
space race heads to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The test from a converted oil drilling platform represents a  
critical challenge for an international consortium seeking 
lucrative contracts to launch the next generation of communications 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch site at the equator about 1,400 miles south of Hawaii  
provides a key advantage over land-based liftoffs: The Earth spins 
faster at the equator, giving rockets a boost in reaching orbit 
that allows them to carry heavier payloads. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of a commercial launch pad at sea is not new, but no  
one has done it before. If successful, the Sea Launch Co. project 
will pay off for American aerospace giant Boeing Co. and 
international partners from Russia, Ukraine and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a bold but risky venture,'' said Jon Kutler, president  
of the aerospace investment bank Quarterdeck Investment Partners. 
He said Boeing might consider pulling out of the program if 
Saturday's test fails. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch has contracts for 16 launches and expects to conduct  
its first commercial launch in August or September. Officials hope 
for six to 12 liftoffs a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite launches cost up to $60 million, said Paul Nisbet, an  
aerospace analyst with JSA Research. Sea Launch President Allen 
Ashby has said only that the company expects its prices to be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The $500 million project is huge: a drilling platform was  
converted into the Odyssey launch pad and loaded with 3,000 tons of 
automated rocket handling equipment; a 650-foot-long ship, Sea 
Launch Commander, was built to serve as a floating rocket assembly 
plant and mission control; and Boeing built a port that includes a 
satellite processing facility at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The payoff could be huge as well. With the explosion of  
space-based telecommunications, satellite manufacturers are looking 
for launch capacity, and Sea Launch is in position to fill the gap 
years ahead of other projects aimed at developing commercial launch 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those projects are Lockheed Martin's VentureStar, a  
reusable ship to haul cargo into space, and Rotary Rocket Co.'s 
Roton, a manned ship that goes up like a rocket and lands like a 
helicopter using rotor blades deployed during re-entry.

<HEADLINE> Mich. OKs Detroit School Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- In hopes of turning around Detroit's  
failing schools, the Michigan Legislature approved a plan Thursday 
to replace the city's elected school board with a panel appointed 
by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, similar to what has been done in Chicago,  
Cleveland and other cities, went to Gov. John Engler, who said he 
would sign it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor proposed the takeover, arguing that an  
appointed board could make the hard decisions needed to deal with 
Detroit's poor test scores, high dropout rate and crumbling school 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the children of Detroit a chance to get a good  
education,'' said Senate Majority Leader Dan DeGrow, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan has caused deep divisions in Detroit, where hundreds of  
parents spoke out against the plan. Many were outraged that a white 
governor and mostly white Legislature would try to oust a school 
board elected by a city that is 75 percent black. Mayor Dennis 
Archer is black. 
</P>
<P>
	A Detroit Democrat, Rep. Keith Stallworth, warned the bill could  
cause civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The polarization you are creating here, you cannot run from,''  
he said. ``We've got a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 31-7 to approve the bill after the House passed  
it 66-43. 
</P>
<P>
	The 180,000-student school system had a dropout rate of 26.4  
percent in 1997, and the four-year graduation rate is a dismal 29.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Settling on the takeover plan took weeks of debate and  
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer would appoint six members of the seven-person school  
board. The seventh member would be the Engler-appointed state 
school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	The board would run the schools for at least five years, at  
which point the public could hold a referendum on the setup.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Buying of blue-chip issues led the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index made a moderate rebound today as the dollar 
edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 470.57  
points, or 3.03 percent, closing at 15,986.04. The index had shed a 
total of 863.31 points in the previous two days, including 
Wednesday's 503.63-point loss, or 3.14 percent, its second-largest 
fall this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 117.86 yen, up 0.14  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but marginally lower than its late 
New York level of 117.89 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo share prices rallied amid continued strong foreign buying  
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was overheated recently from a technical  
perspective, but the drop over the previous two days eased those 
worries,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, general manager of the equity 
division at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's gains were led by blue-chip electronics issues,  
including Sony, Fujitsu and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 663  
million shares, compared with Wednesday's turnover of 685 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered retreaters 911 to 303, with 105 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 22.34 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1,255.93. 
The TOPIX lost 30.12 points, or 2.38 percent, the previous day. 
</P>

	In currency dealings, the dollar inched up against the yen as  
U.S. players covered short, or oversold positions, although trading

<HEADLINE> Washington St. Names Graham Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Paul Graham, hired Thursday as men's  
basketball coach at Washington State, said he's intent on turning 
around a losing program and making Pullman ``the toughest place to 
play'' in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham, an assistant at Oklahoma State under Eddie Sutton since  
1993, replaces Kevin Eastman, who resigned March 10 after a third 
straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for this challenge -- and it is a challenge,''  
Graham, 48, said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's aware Washington State has a reputation for being a  
hard place to coach, in part due to the difficulty of attracting 
and keeping recruits in remote Pullman, population 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation isn't entirely unfamiliar for Graham. Under  
Sutton, he developed a reputation for luring strong recruits to 
Stillwater, Okla. -- also a small town. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot like Pullman,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want this place to be the toughest place to play in this  
league,'' he said. ``We have to make it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expects Washington State to be competitive in his  
first year -- a year after the Cougars went 10-19 and finished in 
the Pac-10 cellar -- he responded, ``It better be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham's first head coaching job follows assistants jobs at  
Oklahoma State, New Mexico (1991-92) and Southern Methodist 
(1982-88). 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this as an opportunity for me to fulfill my dream,''  
said Graham, who used the word ``excited'' four times during the 
news conference to describe his mood. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Rick Dickson said Graham has a five-year  
contract with an annual base salary of $125,000, plus unspecified 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates for the post included Oregon assistant Don  
Newman, Kentucky assistant George Felton, Utah assistant Donny 
Daniels, UCLA assistant Jim Saia and Cal State-Northridge head 
coach Bobby Braswell. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga coach Dan Monson discussed the vacancy with Dickson  
before taking his name out of consideration. Monson led the 
Bulldogs to the NCAA tournament's regional finals before losing to 
Connecticut on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Paul Graham, I believe we have found the person who is the  
absolute best fit for Washington State,'' said Dickson, who became 
acquainted with Graham while athletic director at Tulsa in the 
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard over and over again how highly regarded he is in  
the coaching fraternity across the country.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Governor Bans Fuel Additive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday banned the  
fuel additive MTBE, calling the controversial compound a 
``significant risk to California's environment'' but giving the 
petrochemical industry until 2002 to eliminate its use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic governor ordered the removal to begin  
immediately. He urged the federal government to waive its 
requirement that California use oxygenates such as MTBE to cut 
air-pollution emissions, saying the state can meet federal 
clean-air rules without using them. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said his review of university studies, hearings by state  
regulators and scientific findings persuaded him that ``there is, 
on balance, a significant risk to California's environment 
associated with the continued use of MTBE in gasoline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a spokesman for the major petroleum trade association,  
the Western States Petroleum Association, said his group favored a 
ban phased in over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is an additive designed to  
make gasoline burn cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal research shows that the compound causes tumors in rats  
and may do so in humans. A University of California study showed 
that the additive has affected at least 10,000 groundwater sites 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The gradual phaseout is intended to give the providers of  
alternatives to MTBE, such as ethanol, time to gear up production. 
Davis ordered state agencies to study the health effects of ethanol 
and other oxygenates and report back to him. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the federal government required MTBE to be added to  
gasoline sold in the nation's smoggiest urban areas. In California, 
that means in cities containing about 70 percent of the population. 
In those areas, MTBE comprises about 11 percent of each gallon of 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	MTBE is burned by most of California's 22.5 million cars and  
trucks, and 400,000 motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists contend the health risks outweigh MTBE's  
importance as an air-pollution fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	The manufacturers of MTBE say the potential health hazards have  
not been resolved, and say that an immediate halt to its use would 
cost the petrochemical industry hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the country, Maine Gov. Angus King has asked to be  
let out of the federal program requiring the use of MTBE, citing 
its potential health threat.

<HEADLINE> Asia Fuels ConAgra's Earnings' Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- ConAgra Inc.'s earnings climbed 44 percent in  
the latest quarter due to a resurgence in Asian exports of 
refrigerated foods such as Butterball turkey and Parkay margarine. 
</P>
<P>
	The food company earned $171.4 million, or 36 cents per share,  
in the three months ended Feb. 28, up from $118.9 million, or 28 
cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales increased by 4.1 percent in its third fiscal quarter to  
$5.69 million from $5.46 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Thursday were a penny better than the 35  
cents a share average that analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But ConAgra stock fell $2.68 3/4 a share to $27 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing demand for ConAgra's refrigerated products, mainly in  
Asia, was credited for driving the earnings growth, said Bruce 
Rohde, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the refrigerated foods segment, including fresh and  
processed meats, cheeses and table spreads, increased by 8 percent 
during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's acquisition of three Nabisco tablespreads businesses  
from Nabisco contributed to the strong operating profit growth, 
Rohde said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those acquisitions include the successful Parkay, Blue Bonnet  
and Fleischmann's tablespreads brands and the fat-free, 
cholesterol-free egg product Egg Beaters. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, ConAgra earned $499.7 million, or  
$1.05 a share, up from $454.4 million, or 96 cents a share, a year 
ago. Revenue rose to $18.58 billion from $18.28 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE>  Yugoslavia Says 10 Killed, 38 Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia defiantly absorbed its  
first night of punishment from NATO air power, claiming 10 people 
were killed and 38 wounded overnight in an aerial barrage intended 
to force President Slobodan Milosevic to make peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The army reiterated its defiance after a night of strikes on  
more than 50 targets, saying the ``high morale of the units was 
preserved.'' Milosevic congratulated Yugoslav military commands for 
their ``brave resistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air raid sirens blared today and the state news agency reported  
more fighting in Kosovo. It was not immediately clear if further 
NATO attacks took place in daylight after a night of cruise missile 
and bombing strikes on military airports and other targets. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a NATO F-15 jet fighter spewing white smoke made a  
successful emergency landing at Sarajevo's airport around midday. 
Without elaborating, a NATO source said on condition of anonymity 
that the plane and another undamaged jet fighter accompanying it 
were American. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment on whether the plane had been involved in  
the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav Defense Ministry in a statement today called the  
NATO attacks an ``unprecedented criminal act'' that support ethnic 
Albanian ``terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes were NATO's first attack on a sovereign country  
in the 50 years since the Western alliance was formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials promised further strikes, saying the campaign  
would end only when Milosevic's military had been crippled or if he 
capitulated and agreed to the peace deal already accepted by the 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said on France's Europe 1  
radio the first phase of the bombings likely would continue ``for 
several days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The objective is to curb the capacity of Milosevic's army to  
repress the Kosovo Albanians,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin 
Cook told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``When that stops, the 
military action will stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But violence was unrelenting. The Tanjug state news agency  
reported that Kosovo Liberation Army rebels ``encouraged and 
supported by last night's criminal activities,'' attacked 
government forces in Kosovo around Podujevo, Kosovska Mitrovica, 
Suva Reka, Drenica and Orahovac. The report could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kosovo capital, Pristina, witnesses said the office of  
ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova was vandalized. 
Windows and doors were smashed and smoke drifted out windows, 
indicating the office had been burned the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	Just north of the city, a tire shop smoldered and its roof was  
missing after a missile strike the previous night that missed a 
nearby military barracks, the largest in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses saw smoke rising from a military airfield north of  
Belgrade after air raid sirens sounded at mid-morning today in the 
capital, along with the Serbian town of Kragujevac and Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, dozens lined up in front of a basement bomb shelter  
in the center of Belgrade, prepared to rush inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Kragujevac, a major military-industrial center, was dark after  
an explosion early today, the private news agency Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Belgrade was quiet, with most shops closed and little  
indication of any military attack. Schools and airports also were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent and state-run papers in the Yugoslav capital  
reported the NATO bombing killed an undetermined number of women 
and children, including family members of Yugoslav Army officers 
living in military buildings because they were refugees from past 
wars in Bosnia and Croatia. A NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium, 
would not comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The army statement did not specify if the casualties were  
civilians or military, and also added that one soldier was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, commander of Yugoslav troops in  
Kosovo, had called the impact of the overnight NATO attack 
``minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian General Staff in Moscow said NATO attacks badly  
damaged five military airfields, two factories, a communications 
center, several barracks, and a police training base. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristina was without electricity and water all night, although  
power was restored at about dawn today. The center of the city was 
virtually deserted today, with all shops and stores closed. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said today they were assessing the damage from  
the airstrikes. Aircraft of eight NATO nations struck military 
bases, factories and air defenses with cruise missiles and 
aircraft, including the U.S. B-2 stealth bombers, making their 
combat debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Some two dozen journalists were arrested as they tried to watch  
the assault from the roof of a Belgrade hotel. All but one 
eventually were released. A reporter from The Washington Post also 
was arrested early today in his hotel room, and a hotel clerk told 
the newspaper that police said the journalist would be expelled 
from the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO attack came after months of diplomacy failed to end  
fighting that has killed more than 2,000 people and made refugees 
of hundreds of thousands in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province where 90 
percent of the people are ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen innocent people taken from their homes, forced to  
kneel in the dirt and sprayed by bullets,'' President Clinton said 
in a nationally broadcast speech. ``By acting now, we are upholding 
our values, protecting our interests and advancing the cause of 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosova Press, the press agency of ethnic Albanian rebels, said  
Serb forces set fire to a large portion of the northern city of 
Podujevo Wednesday night. Telephone communication to the region was 
cut off. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials also cited the need to prevent the possible  
spread of conflict in the region, perhaps from instability caused 
by ethnic Albanian refugees. Turkey reported today that 1,300 
Kosovo refugees had arrived in the previous three days. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the  
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, an army military barracks in 
Danilovgrad was ablaze after being hit. Officials said at least one 
soldier was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Albania, cheered the strikes and offered ``all  
facilities'' to NATO forces, Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said. 
Information Minister Musa Ulqini said Serb forces fired mortars 
across the border early this morning, slightly damaging three 
houses in a village in the Tropoja region. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia insisted on an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security  
Council, where it was joined Wednesday by China in condemning the 
NATO action. But President Boris Yeltsin backed away from initial 
threats of using force against NATO, saying: ``Morally we are above 
America.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat, Soybeans Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures rose sharply Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid hopes the Clinton administration will approve 
exports to Iran, Libya and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, energy and coffee futures also advanced  
strongly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybeans jumped in late trading on talk that the  
Clinton administration once again is considering at least granting 
a one-time exemption to a ban on agricultural exports to countries 
that have been accused of sponsoring terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in past weeks has denied such reports,  
leading to some skepticism about the new talk, but market 
participants were leery of being caught short if the rumor proved 
true. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, in particular, would benefit from sharply increased sales  
to Iran, should President Clinton grant a one-time exemption to a 
17-year ban on exports to that country. Exporters are seeking the 
exemption to ship 2 million metric tons of wheat, 400,000 tons of 
corn, an unspecified amount of soybean meal and oil and other 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated the administration would be more likely  
now than ever to grant exemptions as it seeks to help out farmers, 
who have seen asking prices for their crops tumble amid a supply 
glut and weak global demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were supported by remarks from U.S.  
Agriculture Department Secretary Dan Glickman, who said he expects 
food donations to Russia to take place despite NATO airstrikes 
against Russia's ally, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn's gains were limited late as the rally prompted a wave of  
farmer selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 12 3/4 cents to $2.92 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.29 3/4 a bushel; May oats rose 3 1/4 cents to 
$1.20 a bushel; May soybeans rose 11 1/4 cents to $4.99 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures erased early losses and finished higher on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange, with the seesawing prices reflecting 
continued uncertainty about whether oil producers will keep their 
word and cut output. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico a day earlier has defaulted on several U.S. contracts,  
which many market participants said showed a newfound commitment to 
boosting oil prices out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts have said it will take months to actually determine  
whether the major producers, who account for more than two-thirds 
of the world's supply are meeting commitments to cut some 2.1 
million barrels daily from world markets.

<HEADLINE> Renault, Nissan Set To Sign Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Renault Chairman Louis Schweitzer arrived in Japan  
Thursday to sign a deal with Nissan Motor Co. that includes his 
company taking a 35 percent stake in the ailing Japanese carmaker, 
news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer will sign the $5 billion (600 billion yen) deal on  
Saturday afternoon in Tokyo, after Nissan's board of directors 
meets here to discuss Renault's offer, the Nihon Keizai newspaper 
reported without citing sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer arrived in Tokyo Thursday, according to the Kyodo  
News agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan and Renault spokesmen refused to comment on the reports  
or confirm if Schweitzer had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault made a formal offer to Nissan to buy a stake on March  
16, after talks between Japan's second-largest automaker and 
Germany's DaimlerChrysler broke down. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has sought a foreign partner to help it write off an  
estimated $18 billion in debt and return to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a symbol of Japan's industrial might, Nissan has shown a  
loss five of the last six years. The company's own forecast shows 
it losing another quarter of a billion dollars this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Renault will dispatch one of its vice  
presidents to assume Nissan's No. 2 spot and guide the company's 
restructuring efforts, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa will take a seat  
on Renault's board, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 30 to 40 higher-ranking Renault employees will also head  
to Tokyo to help oversee a clean up of Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that overhaul, Nissan will cut the size of its board  
of directors in half from the current 37 members, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its stake in Nissan, Renault will also take possession  
of about 22 percent of Nissan Diesel, a truckmaker subsidiary, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen a wave of big multinational tie-ups in  
the auto industry. Ford said in January it was buying the passenger 
car operations of Volvo AB, Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler Corp. 
last year and General Motors Corp. is negotiating with Saab 
Automobile AB to buy the half of Saab that it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks No. 7 in the world in production of cars and trucks  
and Renault is eleventh, according to industry analysts at Ward's 
Automotive International.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Friday morning following  
strong gains on Wall Street. The dollar edged higher against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 33.23 points, or 0.21 percent,  
to finish the morning session at 16,019.27. On Thursday, the index 
rose 470.57 points, or 3.03 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.26 yen at late morning, up 0.40 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its level of 118.13 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, buying interest from foreign and individual  
investors was strong early Friday following a 169.55 point gain in 
the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow closed Thursday at 
9,836.39. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said, however, that profit-taking and position  
adjustment among investors ahead of the weekend were capping the 
market's upside. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 4.66 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,260.59. The 
TOPIX posted a 22.34 point, or 1.81 percent, gain the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar moved in a narrow range as  
Japanese investors only adjusted positions in the absence of 
market-moving news, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.34 yen, up from  
128.16 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.865  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.880 percent, driving its price 
up to 99.44 yen from 99.31 yen.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Export Talk / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose sharply in late  
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hope for 
renewed export ties to Iran, Libya and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk that the Clinton administration once again is considering  
lifting a ban on agricultural exports to those countries, which 
have been accused of sponsoring terrorism, swept the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in the past has denied such reports, leading  
to some skepticism about the new talk, but market participants were 
leery of being caught short if the rumor proved true. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices also were supported by remarks from U.S.  
Agriculture Department Secretary Dan Glickman, who said he expects 
food donations to Russia to take place despite NATO airstrikes 
against Russia's ally, Yugoslavia. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ron Howard Wins El Nino Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- El Nino forced Ron Howard and his family out  
of a rental home. Now, a jury has awarded the director for the 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, his wife Cheryl and Imagine Entertainment were awarded  
$605,000 in damages Monday in their countersuit against Jeff 
Greene, a Malibu real estate investor and landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	The Howards and their four children moved into the rental in  
December 1997, during his work on the upcoming movie ``EDtv.'' But 
they had to move out the next month because of massive leaks and 
flooding during El Nino-driven storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene sued for breach of contract, attempting to collect rent  
for the entire term of the lease. Howard and Imagine countersued 
and won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron and Cheryl Howard are very appreciative of the jury's  
careful consideration of the issues raised at the trial,'' said 
Imagine's attorney Kurt Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said Imagine will return to court to seek an additional  
award of attorneys' fees and costs. Greene's telephone number was 
not listed.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Appoints New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines' parent company on Thursday named  
a company insider as chief executive, keeping a veteran at the helm 
as the airline begins to consider renewing its employee ownership 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Goodwin, who just six months ago was appointed UAL  
Corp.'s president and chief executive after 32 years with the 
company, now is faced with trying to satisfy both Wall Street and 
the carrier's unions in coming months as the nation's airlines 
struggle to keep costs low and profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	Retiring Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald Greenwald, the  
former Chrysler Corp. executive who brought United an unprecedented 
five-year era of labor peace, said Goodwin was chosen after a 
five-month search that included discussions with a number of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we proceeded, it became clear to us that Jim was the  
template against which we were measuring everyone else. He emerged 
as the gold standard,'' Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Julius Maldutis at CIBC Oppenheimer said United's board  
members likely agreed there was no sense in rocking the boat and 
bringing in an outsider at a key juncture. The majority-employee 
ownership plan is set to expire in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where management-labor conflicts are the  
norm, airlines ... that have labor peace are valued at a premium,'' 
Maldutis said. ``Mr. Goodwin has demonstrated the capability to 
work cooperatively and constructively with organized labor, which 
will help remove the uncertainty about a new (employee stock 
ownership plan) within the next several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently liked the choice; shares of UAL rose  
$3.31 1/4, or 4.5 percent, to close at $76.81 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 54, in September replaced John Edwardson as president  
and chief operating officer. Edwardson departed abruptly in the 
face of union opposition to his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were concerned Edwardson would be more inclined to cut  
wages and benefits than Greenwald, and they had been pressing 
company executives to create a search committee to find an outside 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Union opposition to a successor would not necessarily block an  
appointment, but the Machinists union and the Air Line Pilots 
Association own a majority of the stock in UAL and have board 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said Greenwald's successor has tough shoes to  
fill, particularly since the new chief executive will be faced with 
high labor costs, which account for about 35 percent of the 
airline's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main challenges I see ahead are meeting the needs of an  
increasingly sophisticated customer on a global basis and building 
upon the strides we have made already to improve the relationship 
among management, unions and all employees,'' Goodwin said in a 
statement. A spokeswoman said Goodwin would be unavailable for 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier faces huge costs in  
coming years as it either unwinds its employee majority ownership 
plan or renegotiates a new one -- a reason the airline's stock has 
lagged despite solid performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin has experience in operations, marketing, finance and  
international work. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts said at the time of Goodwin's appointment  
as president that it was unlikely he would eventually be named 
Greenwald's successor. But in the past few months, Goodwin has 
impressed both pilots and machinists with his knowledge of the 
company and willingness to work with both on all issues. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, America West recently rejected a United takeover  
offer in part because of United's insistence that the deal be 
contingent on its pilots unions' approval.

	Jobless Claims Fall by 10,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans claiming unemployment  
benefits fell last week, sinking to the lowest sustained level in a 
quarter century despite world economic turmoil that's battered U.S. 
manufacturers. A seasonally adjusted 289,000 Americans filed 
applications for unemployment checks, down 10,000 from the week 
before, the Labor Department said today. It was the eighth 
consecutive week of claims below the 300,000 mark, the longest such 
stretch since 1973, demonstrating the strong demand for labor in 
the U.S. economy. A separate survey shows factories have cut 
337,000 jobs since March 1998, but apparently laid-off workers are 
finding jobs in service industries.

	Feds To End Cable Rate Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is getting out of the business  
of trying to hold down Americans' monthly cable TV bills. During 
the past several years, even with that regulation, rates rose 
sharply. Starting March 31, the Federal Communications Commission, 
following the directive of a 1996 law, will stop regulating most 
cable TV services. Specifically, it will lift federal price 
controls for the expanded basic services that include many popular 
cable TV channels, such as Discovery, CNN, MTV and ESPN. The most 
basic level of service, meanwhile, which includes mostly broadcast 
TV channels and a few cable networks, will continue to be 
regulated. So will prices for set-top boxes and remote controls.

	CBS Plans Expansion of Web Biz  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. will soon announce further  
Internet-related investments, hoping to further extend its brand 
name online and take advantage of Wall Street's hunger for Internet 
stocks. Chief executive Mel Karmazin told an entertainment industry 
conference yesterday that the company would announce deals in 
coming months, but would not elaborate on when or where the 
investments might come. ``We are committed to being one of the 
biggest players in the Internet business,'' Karmazin said. CBS 
already owns lucrative stakes in MarketWatch.com Inc. and 
SportsLine USA Inc., which use the CBS name on their popular 
financial news and sports Web sites.

	Microsoft Makes Settlement Offer  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A formal proposal by Microsoft Corp. to settle  
its landmark antitrust case is receiving a cool reception from the 
government, with one official describing it as a ``minimalist 
opening offer.'' Microsoft, which made the overture yesterday, is 
refusing to accept any restrictions on what new features it can add 
to its dominant Windows operating system software. Experts believe 
any settlement is unlikely. The company's chairman, Bill Gates, was 
expected to visit Washington today as part of a previously 
scheduled tour to promote his new book. Gates said he wants to 
reach a compromise but called it ``a little hard to speculate'' 
whether a deal is likely.

Hong Kong, shares rebounded, with the blue-chip Hang Seng Index

refrained from placing any big bets. The Dow Jones industrial 
average fell 4.99 to 9,666.84 after trading in a narrow range all 
day. Worries that earnings wouldn't meet expectations sent the Dow 
218.68 lower on Tuesday, giving the blue-chip index its 
second-biggest point loss this year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

fell sharply Tuesday on earnings jitters, rose 2 13/16 to 38 1/2. 
Microsoft rose 4 11/16 to 171 1/4, and Intel climbed 4 11/16 to 119 1/4, 
also in Nasdaq trading. Dow component IBM gained 4 1/8 to 169 1/2. 
America Online dropped 3 7/8 to 117 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The online service provider announced it will cut up to 20 percent 
of Netscape's staff following its acquisition of the software

<HEADLINE> Colgate To Stop Using Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive Co. has declared an immediate  
moratorium on using animals for testing the safety of its personal 
care products. 
</P>
<P>
	The moratorium covers a wide range of products designed for  
adults, including deodorants, shampoos, shaving cream and men's and 
women's fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate said in a statement that 98 percent of all internal  
requests for product-safety approval are currently met using 
available data and non-animal alternatives. Continued consultation 
with industry and scientific groups led to additional opportunities 
to reduce animal testing, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that our moratorium on animal testing of adult  
personal care products is a positive step forward, consistent with 
our overriding responsibility to consumer and employee safety,'' 
Colgate said. 
</P>
<P>
	The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals lauded the move,  
saying it was the product of 20 months of discussions with the New 
York-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a banner day for animals in laboratories, a big step  
forward for which we applaud Colgate,'' said PETA President Ingrid 
Newkirk.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Seeks Relatives Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo DT103    	
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The judge in Jack Kevorkian's trial has  
been asked to decide whether the retired pathologist can call as 
witnesses two relatives of the man he is accused of murdering. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian filed a motion Wednesday asking Judge Jessica Cooper  
to allow relatives of Thomas Youk to take the stand to back his 
claim that the death of the 52-year-old victim of Lou Gehrig's 
disease was a mercy killing, not first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued the statements made on the day Youk died were  
purposely designed to support Kevorkian's defense at a future 
criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an event orchestrated by defendant to push his own  
public agenda,'' prosecutors argued in court documents. ``Here, the 
statements made by defendant to Tom Youk's family members were the 
epitome of self-serving declarations, which defendant prepared and 
intended to be used at his future trial, and are not admissible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was to decide the question before the trial resumes  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's brief contends that Youk's wife, Melody, and Youk's  
brother Terry should be allowed to testify that they wanted 
Kevorkian to end Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``She (the judge) has to let us talk about intent. It's the key  
to the case,'' said David Gorosh, a legal adviser to Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial on Tuesday, Cooper told Kevorkian, who is  
acting as his own lawyer, that he couldn't elicit the testimony 
because Michigan law doesn't recognize the consent of the victim as 
a defense to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian ``still persists in trying to give flesh to this  
argument that he did this as a mercy killing with the consent of 
the person who died,'' prosecutor John Skrzynski said. ``That's not 
a defense here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-year-old Kevorkian could get life in prison if he is  
convicted in the lethal-injection death of Youk, which was shown on 
``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
deaths since 1990. He has been tried four times on assisted suicide 
charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Another Estrogen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women are getting another choice for estrogen  
therapy: a drug called Cenestin that derives a mix of estrogens 
from soy and yam plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved Duramed  
Pharmaceuticals' Cenestin late Wednesday as a treatment for 
menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. 
</P>
<P>
	Menopausal women already can buy a variety of types of estrogen,  
from pills to patches to creams, natural or synthetic. The 
top-selling brand is Wyeth-Ayerst's oral Premarin, a mix of 
estrogens derived from the urine of pregnant horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cenestin has attracted attention because Duramed originally  
sought to sell it as a generic Premarin. Wyeth-Ayerst waged an 
intense battle to persuade the FDA to block generic competition, 
and won. So Duramed did an additional study of Cenestin and asked 
the FDA to approve it as a competing brand-name estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
	Many estrogens sold also have FDA certification that they help  
prevent bone-destroying osteoporosis. Cincinnati-based Duramed has 
not finished its research to prove that effect for Cenestin, but 
plans to seek FDA approval of that additional benefit later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would not reveal a price. Cenestin will be available  
by prescription in about three months.

<HEADLINE> Cheever Seeking 2nd 1999 IRL Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Eddie Cheever Jr. doesn't plan to finish another  
race out of touch with his crew. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened on Jan. 24, when Cheever drove the last 60  
miles of the Indy 200 in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., without a radio. 
He held on to win the first Indy Racing League event of the season, 
but took the checkered flag believing he finished second to Scott 
Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something that's easily ironed out, but it should not  
have happened,'' he said. ``That could lose you a 500, and that 
type of thing has to not occur. There were two other little things 
that happened -- there was something with the clutch, and the 
computer on the fuel did not read down to a tenth of 1 percent, as 
it should have. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were little things, and they never came to anybody's  
attention, but those things have to be gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The radio now has a backup system, chief mechanic Owen Snyder  
III and his team have gone over the Aurora-powered Dallaras in 
minute detail, and Cheever is zeroed in on a second straight 
victory at the MCI WorldCom 200 Sunday at Phoenix International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	If Cheever, who won last year's Indianapolis 500, is in a  
groove, it's one with a puzzling rough spot. 
</P>
<P>
	A great finisher, he has been a middling qualifier throughout  
his Pep Boys IRL career. The flaw has forced him to start in the 
middle of the pack and work his way into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	He has started 23 consecutive IRL races, but has never won a  
pole. He started 17th at the Indy 500 and 13th two months ago in 
Florida. Last year in Phoenix, Cheever qualified 20th and, 
characteristically, finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a frustrating trend for the 41-year-old driver, who started  
more Formula One races (132) than any other American before 
crossing over to CART and then the IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we would prefer to start higher.'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Cheever, one of three owner-drivers in the IRL, is riding a  
fine line between going all out in Phoenix and May 1 in Charlotte, 
N.C., and saving something special for Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever leaves no doubt about his desire to repeat there.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm after the driving title, and you have to maximize every  
chance, but you also have to make sure you don't deplete your 
resources, both human and financial,'' he said. ``Our camp is 
almost divided between winning Indy and winning as many as we can. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the end of the world if you don't win in Phoenix, but  
it's the end of the world if you don't win the 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharp, who outdueled Tony Stewart through 10 caution flags to  
win last year at Phoenix, also figures to be a strong contender. He 
won the pole at Walt Disney World Speedway in January and led 103 
laps before finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a good 10 or 12 cars, I think, that have a chance of  
winning in Phoenix, so you really have to hope from the moment you 
roll out on the racetrack that you find the speed you need and make 
the right changes in the cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Series 1998 driving champion Kenny Brack and teammate Billy  
Boat, who was third at Phoenix last year, also are entered, along 
with Stephan Gregoire and Jeff Ward, the Nos. 4 and 5 finishers on 
the tricky, one-mile oval.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves 2000 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax relief. Bolstering Social Security and  
Medicare. More education and defense spending. President Clinton 
and Republicans in Congress emphasize the same issues in their 
budgets, but there's a wide chasm on major details. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite intense partisan debate Thursday in Congress, lawmakers  
of both parties were optimistic some of the gaps can be bridged in 
this new era of projected budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody pretty much agrees on where it ought to go,'' said  
Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. ``The difference is on how much goes 
where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after the House passed its version of the GOP  
budget, 221-208, the Senate put the finishing touches Thursday 
night on a similar plan, 55-44. Both votes broke mostly along party 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were triumphant, particularly in the House, where  
new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., made passage of the budget his 
first major priority while dealing with a slender 11-seat edge over 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert said the GOP prescription actually saves more than  
Clinton proposed over 10 years for Social Security and Medicare, 
both of which are in danger of insolvency as baby boomers age, and 
provides an unspecified tax cut of nearly $800 billion, far more 
than the president's targeted tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the largest surplus in history, which means the  
taxpayers are being overcharged,'' the speaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton was quick to criticize the proposals as ``a series  
of missed opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While this budget marks a reversal from last year's failed  
effort by Republicans to drain the entire surplus for a tax cut, it 
still does not do enough to pay down the debt and strengthen Social 
Security and Medicare,'' the president said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Their exchange mirrored the debate that echoed through both  
sides of the Capitol all day Thursday. House and Senate Republicans 
will meet later this spring to produce a compromise budget, which 
sets tax and spending guidelines that will be filled in later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House plan for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1,  
calls for $1.74 trillion in spending and forecasts a surplus of 
$141 billion. The Senate proposal projects spending of $1.74 
trillion and a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to cut taxes next year by up to $15 billion and  
by $778 billion over the next decade. While the budget outlines no 
specifics, Republicans have talked of such relief as eliminating 
the so-called marriage penalty, cutting income tax rates broadly 
and eliminating inheritance taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Clinton's budget, submitted to Congress earlier in  
the year, envisions spending of $1.79 trillion and would leave an 
$80 billion surplus. Clinton wants tax cuts totaling $81 billion 
through 2009, but he recommended increasing tobacco and other taxes 
by $178 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton would spend $281 billion next year for  
defense, compared with $289 billion by Republicans. Senate 
Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and job 
training, exceeding the House total by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress,  
so little that the House buried it, 426-2, with one lawmaker voting 
present. The Senate rejected it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Democratic alternatives were rejected in the House.  
</P>
<P>
	One called for smaller tax cuts than the GOP plan and more money  
for selected domestic programs. Supporters said it also would 
extend the life of Social Security until 2050 and of Medicare until 
2020. It failed on a vote of 250-173. 
</P>
<P>
	The second, crafted by a group of moderate to conservative  
Democrats, set aside more money than any other alternative for debt 
reduction and had the smallest tax cuts. It was rejected, 295-134. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans defeated an effort by Sen. Edward  
Kennedy, D-Mass., to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for 
Medicare, as Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans pushed through a measure directing the Senate  
Finance Committee to consider a Medicare reform plan pushed by Sen. 
John Breaux, D-La., chairman of a Medicare commission that recently 
deadlocked. ``Let's quit talking about Medicare,'' said Senate 
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``Let's fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One modest bipartisan victory came when Jeffords and Sen.  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., won approval of a measure that would 
reduce the tax cut by $10 billion over 10 years to provide child 
care grants that could aid 750,000 more children.

<HEADLINE> La. Tech Has Small-Town Tenacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- It says something that, in a town of  
some 20,000 citizens, more than 8,000 would show up to watch the 
Louisiana Tech women's basketball team play Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened in Ruston, La., on Nov. 30 when the Lady  
Techsters took the court against the Lady Vols. Even though 
Tennessee won 92-73, it didn't dampen the small-town pride in a 
team that is a perennial big-time contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech doesn't have the profile of a Duke, Connecticut  
or Tennessee. It is a school of just 9,667 students in a tiny rural 
town where alcohol isn't sold and there's no shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Louisiana Tech has something many schools envy: Tradition.  
</P>
<P>
	There are those old-fashioned short-sleeved jerseys,  
distinguished alumnae like Teresa Weatherspoon and Venus Lacy, and 
the fact coach Leon Barmore is a native son. But mostly Louisiana 
Tech's tradition is based on its success. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Techsters have been to the Final Four 10 times in the  
18 years the NCAA has governed the event. They won the national 
championship in 1982 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad I am a part of that,'' senior forward Amanda  
Wilson said. ``It's a great honor. ... And I want to keep that 
tradition going so that the people who come after me say, `I want 
to do what Amanda Wilson did.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has certainly done her share. She's led the Lady  
Techsters (30-2) with 16.5 points and eight rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson credits Barmore not only for her achievements but for  
everything Louisiana Tech has become. His 87.0 winning percentage, 
based on a career record of 489-73, is the best in college 
basketball, men's or women's. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore's teams are known for speed, defense and athleticism.  
Despite the evolution in the women's game over the years, Barmore's 
teams have consistently stayed ahead of the curve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the early years when I started there were two teams  
that played defense: It was the University of Tennessee and it was 
Louisiana Tech,'' he said. ``I didn't see anybody else in the game 
guarding anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their final game of this season, the Lady Techsters beat New  
Orleans 97-57 for their 700th victory as a program -- becoming just 
the second women's Division I team to do so. Louisiana Tech is 
706-119 in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (788-203) is the only other team with as many  
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 12-0 in the Sun Belt Conference this season, the  
Lady Techsters cruised through the first rounds of the NCAA 
tournament, eventually beating UCLA 88-62 to advance to the Final 
Four. They'll play top-ranked Purdue in a semifinal game Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt that the hometown fans will be watching.  
Women's basketball is king in Ruston. In addition to attracting 
nearly half the town's population for the November game against 
Tennessee, the women's basketball program has accomplished the rare 
feat of overshadowing the men. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a story that former Louisiana Tech player Karl Malone  
used to beg fans to stick around in the days when the women's games 
were played before the men's. 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore says that Louisiana Tech's success is a combination of  
the players, the school, the rabid fans, that ever-present 
tradition and those small-town values of hard work and faith. He 
wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (Ruston) is made up of churches and parking meters and we  
have those two things more than anything else,'' he said. ``But 
what would you rather have? Too many churches or too many bars? 
I'll tell you what, I'll take what we have.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers Help Winston Cup Driver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- An unlikely visitor is using the Carolina  
Panthers' training center this week. He's 5-foot-8, 165 pounds, 
never played football and isn't keen on lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
	What sets Bobby Labonte apart, however, is that he can cover 40  
yards in well under a second. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte, who is recovering from a broken shoulder, came to the  
NFL team in response to Panthers owner Jerry Richardson's offer to 
do what he could to help the region's large Winston Cup racing 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	In Labonte's case, that means taking advantage of the  
sophisticated equipment and the knowledge of a staff that deals 
with high-speed collisions on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since fracturing his right scapula last Friday in a crash during  
a practice session at Darlington, S.C., Labonte has been spending 
several hours each day working with Al Shuford, one of the 
Panthers' trainers. The results have been impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first five days after the injury, he made as much  
progress as it would take most people three weeks to make,'' 
Shuford said. ``He's done everything that we've asked him to do, 
regardless of the hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte has plenty at stake. He finished a career-best sixth in  
the 1998 Winston Cup standings, and he was in second place in this 
year's driver rankings heading into Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuford already had gone home from work Friday night and was  
relaxing, watching a sports report on television, when he saw 
footage of Labonte's violent crash into a concrete retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three minutes later, the phone rang,'' Shuford said. ``It was  
Bobby, and he said, `I need your help.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuford drove to Darlington early the next morning to begin  
working with Labonte, a winner of seven Winston Cup races and who 
isn't unfamiliar with broken shoulders. Labonte fractured his left 
scapula four years ago, when the treatment was basically limited to 
treating it with ice and telling him to tough it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al and everyone with the Panthers have been a huge help,''  
Labonte said. ``What I'm doing now is a whole lot better. I can't 
even begin to compare the two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Shuford did was treat the pain and try to  
eliminate as much muscle spasm activity as possible. Then he and 
Labonte worked on rigging a padding system that would allow Labonte 
to at least try to start the race so he could collect the Winston 
Cup points. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuford drove back to Charlotte Saturday night to get more  
equipment, and when he returned Sunday, they went back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never got in the car until it was time to race,'' Shuford  
said. ``When he finally got strapped in, I leaned in and told him, 
`You can't do any more damage. Just get out there and get in a 
groove.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The original goal was for Labonte to drive one lap, come in and  
turn the car over to relief driver Matt Kenseth. Labonte ended up 
staying out for 45, and when he finally got out of the car, the 
first thing he did was give Shuford a big hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth drove the car to a 10th-place finish, meaning that  
Labonte, who came to Darlington 32 points off the Winston Cup lead, 
actually cut his deficit to 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte has spent several hours each day this week at Ericsson  
Stadium, getting electric stimulus, heat and warm water treatments 
and working with Shuford to strengthen and improve flexibility in 
the joint. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuford spent several hours Wednesday and Thursday at Joe Gibbs  
Racing's suburban Huntersville complex, developing a system of 
padding in the seat of Labonte's car for this weekend's race in 
Fort Worth, Texas. Shuford brought along everything from NFL 
shoulder pads to hard plastic plates and various types of foam, and 
he, Labonte and the driver's crew painstakingly tried numerous 
combinations until finding the most comfortable one. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte is even entertaining thoughts of driving the entire  
500-mile race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stay in the car, but if it's not practical, I'm  
fortunate to have Matt standing by,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't 
even be thinking about this if it wasn't for Al.''

<HEADLINE> Reporters' Jailings, Deaths Decried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At least 118 journalists were in prison in 25  
countries at the end of 1998, and 24 others were allegedly killed 
during the year doing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by the Committee to Protect Journalists details 500  
attacks allegedly aimed at intimidating reporters, editors, 
correspondents and their news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``With more countries wielding insult laws and criminal libel  
statutes to muzzle expression, more journalists than ever face a 
stark choice: Exercise self-censorship or risk going to jail for 
hard-hitting reporting,'' said Ann K. Cooper, CPJ's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	The 400-page report, ``Attacks on the Press in 1998,'' analyzed  
journalists' working conditions in 118 countries. CPJ is a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to safeguarding press freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most dangerous areas for members of the media were the  
Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone. In the latter 
country, a producer for Associated Press Television News was killed 
and two of his colleagues were wounded in January. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fifth consecutive year, Turkey led the list of nations  
imprisoning journalists -- 27 in 1998. Most were jailed for 
reporting on Turkey's conflict with the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Turkish Embassy in Washington did not  
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, CPJ reported that 26 journalists had been killed, most  
of them victims of political assassination, and at least 129 were 
being held in 24 countries.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Final Four Has Familiar Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Final Four coaches are no  
strangers to each other, and three of the teams have been here 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's at least one first for the tournament's championship  
weekend: Florida as host. Not that Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, Michigan 
State's Tom Izzo and all the players and other coaches will be 
enjoying the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropicana Field has a domed roof that leaked the last time an  
NCCA tournament game was held there, when Duke blew a 17-point, 
second-half lead to Kentucky in the South Regional last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils plan a different ending this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Duke (36-1), the team to beat since the field of 64 was  
announced, enters its semifinal against Michigan State on Saturday 
with a 31-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4), meanwhile, have won 22 in a row, but  
perhaps their biggest accomplishment was losing by just six points 
(73-67) to Duke in December in the Great Eight. It was one of only 
two times the Blue Devils won by fewer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're a much different team than they were the first  
time,'' Izzo said. ``I don't mean with personnel or anything. Elton 
Brand didn't play well against us the first time, I don't know if 
it was us or them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane Battier has raised his game a couple of levels and Corey  
Maggette is raising his level a lot,'' he added. ``I think we're a 
different team and I think we're a lot better than we were then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, the only coach of the four who's been here before,  
said both teams are better than the first time they played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly Michigan State has great rebounding and they really  
move the ball down the court and get good shots,'' said Krzyzewski, 
trying to become the fourth coach to win at least three national 
championships. ``They're a tough team to defend because they not 
only get a good shot but they go after it if they miss. They're as 
good at that as anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut-Ohio State matchup in the first semifinal also  
features some history. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches Jim Calhoun of Connecticut and Jim O'Brien of Ohio State  
have faced each other 23 times in their careers. Calhoun won 20 of 
those games, including the last 18. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien is in his second season at Ohio State after being at  
Boston College for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim got the job at UConn about a month after I got the job at  
Boston College and here we are,'' O'Brien said. ``We find ourselves 
getting into the Final Four at exactly the same time, the first 
time for each of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly took different routes to get there.  
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (32-2), playing in its first Final Four, was No. 2  
in the preseason poll, spent 10 weeks at No. 1 and was never lower 
than fourth the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8) was coming off an 8-22 season and wasn't even  
in the Top 25 until January and only cracked the Top 10 for one 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes' turnaround coincided with Scoonie Penn's arrival  
on the team. The point guard had to sit out last year after 
transferring from Boston College, where he had played for O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn's matchup against Huskies point guard Khalid El-Amin will  
surely be one of the most intriguing of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both have that special ingredient, you can call it  
charisma, energy, leadership, you can call it competitiveness,'' 
Calhoun said. ``They both are able to have all the great attributes 
they have and then impart it to their teammates.''

<HEADLINE> Futurama: A 30th Century 'Simpsons' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the year 3000, where ``talking head'' is  
a literal term, the national slogan is the repressive ``You gotta 
do what you gotta do'' and suicide booths are a street corner 
staple. 
</P>
<P>
	You're not laughing now, but you will be: This is the world of  
``Futurama,'' a wickedly funny animated series from Matt Groening, 
creator of ``The Simpsons.'' It debuts 8:30 p.m. EST Sunday on Fox, 
and moves to a regular Tuesday 8:30 p.m. slot on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	There it becomes part of an all-animated lineup that includes  
``King of the Hill'' and ``The PJs,'' underscoring the rise of 
cartoons in network prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Like ``The Simpsons,'' the new series (co-produced by David X.  
Cohen of longtime ``Simpsons'' service) pokes fun at the foibles of 
people and society. But it also feasts, lovingly, on the cliches of 
science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Let others drool in anticipation of the forthcoming ``Star  
Wars'' prequel. Force, schmorce; we'll happily settle for the 
adventures of Fry and his buddies: Leela, the one-eyed 
intergalactic babe and Bender, a robot with an attitude and a 
drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after ``The Simpsons'' began, we finally have another  
vehicle for the Groening blend of visual and verbal wit and 
juvenile slapstick that guarantees entertainment for the entire 
20th century (and beyond) family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' opens in present-day New York City, where we meet  
Fry, a slacker with a crummy pizza-delivery job and an unfaithful 
girlfriend. ``I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life,'' he 
mutters. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly gets to shed it after stumbling into the Applied  
Cryogenics office (company motto: ``No power failures since 
1997''). A thousand years whiz by in a clever sequence, and our 
hero emerges as a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, New Yorkers are still rude. Bosses haven't gotten any  
better than Mr. Burns. But a millennium does make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumatic tubes are the high-tech subway system. For just 25  
cents you can check out at any one of the convenient ``Stop and 
Drop'' locations, ``America's favorite suicide booth since 2008.'' 
Spacecraft are home-kit stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world still has Richard Nixon to kick around: The heads  
of movers, shakers and celebrities of the past are preserved in 
museums to share their wisdom. (Look for a quick glimpse of 
Groening's mug, perched next to Barbra Streisand's.) 
</P>
<P>
	This clever device allows ``Futurama'' to use ``The Simpsons''  
trick of scattering celebrities throughout its stories. The 
tete-a-tete guest voices on the first episode are Leonard Nimoy and 
Dick Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Fry is delighted with the change in scenery. But he  
soon rebels at the rigidity of this brave new world: Tests have 
shown his greatest potential is as a delivery boy, so he must be 
implanted with a chip that is a permanent job sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	That sets up the conflict that will carry Fry, Leela and Bender  
into adventures on Earth and distant planets, and it promises to be 
a wild ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented voices behind the cartoon figures are Billy West  
(Fry and other characters); Katey Sagal (Leela) and John DiMaggio 
(Bender and others). West has done extensive animation voice work, 
including both TV's Ren and Stimpy and Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in 
the film ``Space Jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (Peg Bundy on ``Married ... With Children'') proves a  
natural as a voice-over artist, as does DiMaggio, a comic whose 
acting credits include a recurring role on ``Chicago Hope'' as 
resident Sean Underhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening, a longtime sci-fi buff, calls the future a natural  
subject for animation, one ignored since 1962-63's ``The Jetsons.'' 
That series failed to take satiric advantage of the turf; the 
pedigree of ``Futurama,'' and its timing, ensures against that. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' and all the other science  
fiction that's out there, it's fun to be able to comment on it in a 
witty way,'' Groening said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to suggest a viewer must be steeped in the wisdom  
of Obi-Wan or Mr. Spock to enjoy ``Futurama''; many of the sci-fi 
references are familiar enough to be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, one of the joys of Groening's work is that viewers can  
search out the sly comedic references or just enjoy the ones that 
smack you in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to reward people for paying attention. If you just  
watch the way most people watch TV, the show will go by and it will 
be fine,'' said Groening. ``But if you want, there's more to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of sly, Groening notes that he has been criticized for  
providing questionable role models in ``The Simpsons.'' 
Underachieving Bart, beer-swilling Homer and other characters have 
come under attack since the show's debut. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, most of the unseemly behavior seems to be the  
province of Bender the robot -- who, Groening reasons, can't really 
be deemed a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like wishful, 30th-century thinking.  
</P>

	NATO: 3 Yugoslav Fighters Destroyed  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme  
commander, said today that the allied operation against Yugoslavia 
``will be just as long and difficult as President Milosevic wants 
it to be.'' In NATO's first damage assessment today, Clark said 
allied aircraft had ``destroyed'' three Yugoslav jet fighters. He 
said the planes were among the ``most modern and capable'' in 
Yugoslavia's inventory. The Yugoslav Defense Ministry in a 
statement today called the NATO attacks an ``unprecedented criminal 
act'' that support ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''

	Yugoslavia Says 10 Killed, 38 Hurt  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Authorities said today that 10  
people were killed and 38 wounded in an aerial barrage intended to 
force President Slobodan Milosevic to make peace in Kosovo. The 
Yugoslav army reiterated its defiance after a night of strikes on 
more than 50 targets, saying the ``high morale of the units was 
preserved.'' Milosevic congratulated military commands for their 
``brave resistance.'' Air raid sirens blared today and the state 
news agency reported more fighting in Kosovo.

<P>
	Yugoslavia Expels Foreign Reporters  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The Serbian government today ordered  
the expulsion of all foreign journalists from countries involved in 
NATO airstrikes. The order was issued ``because they, by their 
reporting from the territory of the Republic of Serbia, 
strengthened the aggressive acts of NATO forces aimed at violent 
destruction of ... the territorial integrity of Serbia and 
Yugoslavia,'' said a statement signed by Information Minister 
Alexander Vucic. In a related development, all but one of two dozen 
foreign journalists detained by police while watching airstrikes 
were released.

	Kevorkian Rests Without Witnesses  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian rested his defense  
without witnesses today after a judge refused to hear testimony 
from relatives of the man he is accused of murdering. Kevorkian 
wanted relatives of Thomas Youk, who had Lou Gehrig's disease, to 
back his claim that the death was a mercy killing. But prosecutors 
contended that statements between relatives and Kevorkian made 
before Youk died were planned with the knowledge they may be useful 
as a criminal defense. Earlier in the trial, the judge told 
Kevorkian, who is acting as his own lawyer, that Michigan law 
doesn't recognize consent as a defense to murder.

	AGs To Consider Microsoft Offer  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys general from the 19 states suing  
Microsoft plan today to discuss the formal proposal the company has 
made to settle its landmark antitrust case. The proposal, which was 
submitted yesterday, is receiving a cool reception from the 
government. Any settlement is viewed as unlikely because the two 
sides remain far apart on core issues after almost five months of 
courtroom fighting. The trial is tentatively scheduled to resume 
April 12, but both sides consider themselves under orders from the 
judge at least to explore a settlement.

	Tourists Can View Titanic Wreckage  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Tours to see the remains of the Titanic are  
legal as long as they don't interfere with the company that owns 
exclusive rights to the shipwreck, an appeals court ruled. The 4th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday unanimously reversed a 
ruling that R.M.S. Titanic Inc.'s exclusive rights include viewing 
and photographing the wreckage, which is about 400 miles off 
Newfoundland. The attorney for Deep Ocean Expeditions Ltd. said 
tours to the site, 2 1/2 miles under the Atlantic Ocean, should begin

104.89 points to 9,771.73 in the first 20 minutes of trading today.

place.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 44.85 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *PM-Wall Street Noon,0456    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly today on stable  
interest rates and a positive earnings report from Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter and Micron Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
144.85 at 9,811.69. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 4.99 Wednesday to 9,666.84, declining for the  
fourth straight session amid concerns that first-quarter earnings 
reports would be disappointing. NATO's bombing of targets in Kosovo 
also put a lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks rose as two strong economic reports had no effect  
on bond market interest rates. The Labor Department reported that 
unemployment claims fell last week, and the National Association of 
Realtors said sales of existing homes remained near record high 
levels in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest rates might have gone up on either of those reports,  
since the numbers could signal an increase in inflation. But the 
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 5.53 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market was also boosted by two earnings reports.  
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter posted first-quarter profits of $1.76  
per share, far above the $1.34 expected by analysts. Morgan 
Stanley's shares were up 4 5/8 at 103 and boosted other financial 
services stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose after Wednesday's report from  
semiconductor maker Micron that it had turned a profit in its 
fiscal second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, and its  
stock was down 2 7/16 at 49 9/16. But the rest of the technology 
sector was higher. Dow component IBM was up 2 7/16 at 171 15/16, 
while Dell Computer was up 9/16 at 39 1/16 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP;  
Co., said that while Micron's results lifted technology stocks and 
the entire market, the overall outlook for earnings and the 
situation in Kosovo are still important concerns. ``I still think 
the market's suspect here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.11 at 1,286.70. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 48.31 at 2,413.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues had a strong 9-to-5 lead on decliners on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 363.86 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace of 346.31 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets relaxed after early anxieties over the attack,  
and made a strong comeback after a generous interest rate cut by 
Sweden. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.68 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.98 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Garth's Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- How it went for Garth Brooks on Thursday at  
spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks didn't take batting practice or play  
against the Seattle Mariners. Brooks was a little tired, and 
manager Bruce Bochy told him that sometimes it's good to pass up BP 
for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Fans are starting to recognize situations in which  
Bochy might use Brooks as a pinch-hitter, such as with the bases 
loaded and none out in the eighth. Alas, the singing cowboy sat. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``Did you hear the people chanting for him?''  
Bochy said. ``It's unbelievable. I told Garth, mabye he could do a 
celebrity jog around the field so people could see him.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Stock Rises on Internet News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. will soon announce further  
Internet-related investments, hoping to further extend its brand 
name online and take advantage of Wall Street's hunger for Internet 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Mel Karmazin told an entertainment industry  
conference Wednesday that the company would announce deals in 
coming months, but would not elaborate on when or where the 
investments might come. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to being one of the biggest players in the  
Internet business,'' Karmazin said. He added that it is a remote 
possibility that CBS could someday spin off its Internet holdings 
into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS already owns lucrative stakes in MarketWatch.com Inc. and  
SportsLine USA Inc., which use the CBS name on their popular 
financial news and sports Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	MarketWatch.com stock soared as high as $130 when it went public  
in January but has fallen since to just below $67. Despite the 
decline, however, the money-losing company has been blessed with a 
market value of $784 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SportsLine stock has more than quadrupled since its IPO in  
November 1997, now trading near $44. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinton Vickers, a broadcasting analyst with ING Barings Furman  
Selz, said CBS has previously indicated a desire to boost its 
online holdings but has not made it clear which companies it might 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd expect they would do deals similar to SportsLine and  
MarketWatch, where they take an equity stake without having to put 
up much money,'' Vickers said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and other big media companies have been more rapidly  
embracing the Internet to promote their TV shows, movies and music, 
while developing new sources of advertising revenue and electronic 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, CBS replaced ABC as the exclusive broadcast news  
provider to America Online, the world's largest Internet service 
provider, in a key move to increase its online visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, rival NBC announced it would buy a minority  
stake in ValueVision, the third largest home-shopping cable 
network, trying to boost its electronic commerce business. ABC and 
ESPN owner Walt Disney Co. two months ago launched the Go Network, 
a Web site it is heavily promoting across its networks. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its broadcast network, CBS owns a huge collection  
of radio and TV stations, an outdoor advertising business and the 
Nashville Network and Country Music Television cable networks.

<HEADLINE> Help-Wanted Ads Declined in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Help-wanted advertising in the nation's major  
newspapers declined slightly in February, but demand for jobs still 
remains strong, according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private business research group, said  
its monthly advertising index dipped to 93 last month, down from an 
adjusted 94 in January. The index, based on 100, was 92 in February 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no suggestion that demand for labor will slacken.  
Tight labor market conditions remain firmly in place,'' said 
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein predicted that consumer spending will remain strong,  
helping create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The regions with the largest declines in help-wanted ads last  
month were the Middle Atlantic, which includes New York and 
Pennsylvania; Pacific, which includes California and Washington; 
and East South Central, which includes Alabama, Tennessee and 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest gainers were the East North Central; which includes  
Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin; and New England, 
which includes Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
employment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. It is used as a non-governmental gauge of changes in local, 
regional and national job supply.

<HEADLINE> INS Officer Denies Smuggling Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An immigration officer accused of having an affair  
with an illegal immigrant and smuggling him from Canada into the 
United States says the man made up the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Jesmer, a 12-year veteran of the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service, pleaded innocent Wednesday in U.S. District 
Court to charges that she knowingly and recklessly transported an 
illegal alien into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Jesmer, 34, began a romantic affair in 1996 with  
Jose Cabral-Simas while he was a prisoner under her supervision at 
an INS processing center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	After Cabral-Simas was convicted on drug charges and deported to  
his native Portugal, the two allegedly arranged a rendezvous in 
Montreal. They crossed into the United States in August and 
traveled to Jesmer's home north of Boston, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense lawyer Charles Balliro denied that his client had a  
romantic relationship with Cabral-Simas, who lived in New Bedford 
as a legal permanent resident for nearly 20 years before his 
conviction for drug distribution in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was arrested and then concocted a story,'' Balliro said.  
``This is a three-time loser -- a convicted drug dealer, (who) gets 
deported, and then breaks federal law to get back into the country. 
We believe his testimony is not credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Balliro also said the government's case was circumstantial, with  
no physical evidence linking Jesmer to a border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabral-Simas pleaded guilty this month to one count of illegal  
re-entry into the country. He was released on bail pending 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesmer remains employed by the INS and is free on personal  
recognizance, Balliro said.

<HEADLINE> Florida Wildfires Erupting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Blinding smoke hampered firefighters'  
efforts today to contain a blaze that has charred more than 1,000 
acres in northern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really can't do much with it,'' said Peggy Cane, a duty  
officer with Florida's Division of Forestry. ``The smoke's coming 
right back on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although firefighters had mostly contained the blaze, which has  
burned about 1,050 acres midway between Gainesville and 
Tallahassee, the smoke inversion made it difficult for them to see, 
Ms. Cane said. 
</P>
<P>
	In southwest Florida, 1,400 acres in Cape Coral burned before  
firefighters brought it under control during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first, we thought it was just a brush fire,'' said resident  
Jeff Santella. ``Next thing I know, I see the flames. What a mess. 
It burned right to our property line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santella said he and four other families removed valuables and  
pets from their threatened homes. The fire burned within the city 
limits, mostly on land slated for future subdivisions. No injuries 
or damaged buildings were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Already this year 1,650 wildfires have burned about 35,000  
acres. The state agriculture department estimates more than 500 
were set. Ten firefighters have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford announced a statewide  
effort today to hunt down the arsonists. He said the department is 
shifting resources so that every available agent will be out trying 
to stop arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
	But with tinderboxlike conditions throughout the state, new  
fires are popping up easily, said Gene Madden, state forestry 
division spokesman. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Athlete Speaks About Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGEDALE, Tenn. (AP) -- The University of Kentucky football  
player who was driving the car in which two friends died still 
blames himself for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mental and emotional scars will last forever,'' Jason  
Watts said Thursday in his first public comments since the accident 
Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident Nov. 15 killed teammate Arthur Steinmetz, 19, and  
Eastern Kentucky student Scott Brock, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I literally see my buddies dying in my arms because of me,''  
Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, 21, of Ovieda, Fla., faces a July 19 trial on two counts  
of second-degree manslaughter and a count of wanton endangerment. 
He is scheduled for a court appearance Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose to speak about the crash to students at Southern  
Adventist University, about 18 miles north of Chattanooga, as part 
of the school's drug and alcohol awareness week. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who was Kentucky's starting center, said he hoped someone  
will learn from his tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all because of a stupid mistake,'' he said. ``Drinking  
beers and getting behind the wheel is something that could've been 
avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who has been dismissed from the Kentucky team, spent  
Saturday night drinking with his friends. The celebration was 
fueled by Kentucky's 55-17 Senior Day victory over Vanderbilt, 
which earned the Wildcats a berth in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But by early morning, they became bored and decided to hunt  
deer. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was driving his truck on U.S. 27 when it slipped off the  
roadway as he passed a car, clipped a mailbox and blew out a back 
tire. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men said nothing to each other, knowing they were  
about to crash, Watts said. The truck flipped, throwing all three 
out of the vehicle. Watts went through the windshield, bending his 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to, he went first to Brock who gave him a  
half-smile before dying. He then tried to shake awake Steinmetz, 
only to have him die in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of my poor judgment, my two buddies were gone,'' said  
a soft-spoken Watts. ``When you think about it, I should've been 
the first one to go. Getting in that car that night was a 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his friends dead, Watts said he wanted to die as well and  
even tried holding his breath in the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hospital, his blood alcohol content tested 1 1/2 times the  
legal limit. He had a 12-inch gash on his right arm that wound up 
requiring surgery several times. He also had cuts on his left 
shoulder and back that required stitches and staples in addition to 
injured ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts had been in trouble before while drinking.  
</P>
<P>
	He shot then-teammate Omar Smith in the buttocks as they handled  
a rifle outside the house they shared in 1997, and had a blood 
alcohol level of 0.129 percent two hours after the shooting. He was 
charged with unlawful discharge of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	He met with the Brock family before leaving the hospital in  
Lexington and was shocked that they greeted him with a hug and 
forgave him for his part in the crash. He finally spoke with the 
Steinmetz family recently and was again surprised that they also 
forgave him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You almost want them to be mad at you because it will make the  
guilt easier,'' Watts said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said even his friends on the offensive line pointed out that  
he should have been the first person killed. But he told the 
audience that he feels he is now living three lives -- his own and 
for his dead friends. 
</P>
<P>
	He dreams nightly about the crash and figures he is lucky to  
sleep three or four hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rough, but it's nowhere near as rough as it is on the  
families,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Can View Titanic Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Tours to gawk at the remains of the Titanic  
are legal as long as they don't interfere with the company that 
owns exclusive rights to the famous shipwreck, an appeals court has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday unanimously  
reversed a judge's ruling that R.M.S. Titanic Inc.'s exclusive 
rights include viewing and photographing the wreckage in 
international waters, about 400 miles off Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote that ``a property right does not  
normally include the right to exclude viewing and photographing of 
the property when it is located in a public place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In June, U.S. District Judge Calvitt Clarke Jr. ruled against  
plans by a British company, Deep Ocean Expeditions Ltd., to ferry 
about 60 tourists to the Titanic site. Clarke said the expedition 
would devalue RMST's rights and encourage other would-be 
sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke's decision was challenged by Deep Ocean Expeditions and  
Christopher Haver, a Phoenix businessman who wanted to participate 
in one of the expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think our position has been completely vindicated,'' said  
Alex Blanton, attorney for Haver and Deep Ocean Expeditions. 
``Basically, the court's conclusion was our position from day 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	R.M.S. Titanic lawyer F. Bradford Stillman said no decision has  
been made on whether to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the adventure-seekers who signed up for Deep Ocean's  
dives last summer dropped out after Clarke barred them. But last 
September, about a dozen defied the judge's order and made the dive 
anyway, becoming the first tourists to view the ship 2 1/2 miles under 
the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect there will be more this summer,'' Blanton said.  
``This will open the door to Deep Ocean Expeditions, which proposed 
this type of expedition to start with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie ``Titanic,'' which won the 1998 Academy Award for best  
picture, included footage of the shipwreck shot by director James 
Cameron and his crew before Clarke's ruling.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Issues Travel Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department advises U.S. citizens not  
to travel to Liberia because of its political instability and to 
consider carefully whether to travel to Indonesia because of 
political demonstrations there. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory issued Wednesday pointed to frequent demonstrations  
and civil unrest, sometimes resulting in violence, in various parts 
of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	It cautioned U.S. citizens already there ``to exercise prudence  
and common sense,'' avoiding situations that could turn violent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Liberia, the department cited ill-trained and armed  
government security personnel as a potential danger. It noted 
continuing rebel activity along the Sierra Leone-Liberia border and 
discouraged travel anywhere in Liberia after dark. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also announced an outbreak of Japanese  
encephalitis in Malaysia that principally affects people who have 
come into contact with pigs or live near big farms.

<HEADLINE> Cleaves, Izzo Have Special Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- One is from a blue-collar city. The  
other is from a small town on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	But the different backgrounds of point guard Mateen Cleaves and  
coach Tom Izzo never got in the way. Their bond has helped Michigan 
State get to the Final Four for the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves grew up in Flint, Mich., a tough city known for making  
cars and trucks. Izzo is from Iron Mountain, where his boyhood pal 
was San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Cleaves and Izzo are a perfect fit.  
</P>
<P>
	Izzo seems to know when to push, when to be hard, when to ease  
off. Cleaves, whose play energizes the team, sometimes strays. But 
he's smart enough to know he has a safety net in Izzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can call him up at three in the morning,'' Cleaves said. ``I  
can just say, `I can't sleep right now, I need somebody to talk 
to.' And that's the kind of guy he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the three years Cleaves has played for the Spartans, he and  
Izzo have found a way to become friends. They are active in 
community affairs in East Lansing. They feed the homeless together, 
visit children in hospitals, and drive out to counsel young 
offenders in a prison near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's helped me grow up as a person,'' Cleaves said.  
</P>
<P>
	Of course, it might not work if Cleaves couldn't play. Or if  
Izzo couldn't coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mateen is my best player,'' Izzo said. ``But he's also our  
hardest worker, which I think is something all coaches hope for. 
He's my best practice player. He's a guy that comes to practice 
every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans (33-4), who play top-ranked Duke (36-1) on Saturday  
night at Tropicana Field, are easily the least glamorous team in 
the Final Four. They have taken winning ugly to new highs -- or, 
more accurately, new lows. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Cleaves doesn't always bring his ``A'' offensive  
game. But he's the best defender on the team, and he's always in 
command, even when he can't find his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look at some of the guards we've had, Mateen could be  
head and shoulders above a lot of those guys as far as defense,'' 
Izzo said. ``That doesn't mean total game. 
</P>
<P>
	``And he's got an attitude, that he finds a way to make shots or  
get the ball in the right people's hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo is sometimes accused of being soft on Cleaves. He admits  
there might be some truth to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect where he came from, and he respects where I came  
from,'' Izzo said. ``I went from this small town and have found a 
way to buck the odds and make it here. He's come from this tough 
environment, where a lot of kids don't make it and don't survive, 
and he's finding a way to make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, I think there's some similarities there. We're both kind  
of fighters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo cannot imagine his team without Cleaves, easily the  
Spartans' most charismatic point guard since Magic Johnson guided 
them to the national championship in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' Izzo said. ``We've got a melting pot on our  
team, guys from big cities, guys from rural areas. But for some 
reason, they all gravitate to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him one day, `You know, you're the Pied Piper. Don't  
ever walk off a cliff because the guys will follow you.' It's 
amazing.''

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Senior PGA Tour golfer Jerry McGee was resting  
Thursday after surgery to remove a malignant tumor in his neck and

</P>
<P>
	McGee, 55, was operated on Wednesday at the Montefiore Cancer  
Institute at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Forbes Criticizes Gore in New Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes, in an early sign of how  
aggressively he will spend his money in the presidential campaign, 
is accusing Vice President Al Gore of ``hiding while his liberal 
friends do his dirty work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation airs this weekend in radio ads running in Iowa  
and in New Hampshire, first states on the route to the 2000 
nominations. The spots are a rapid response to TV ads produced this 
week by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action 
League. 
</P>
<P>
	The group labeled Texas Gov. George W. Bush ``anti-choice,'' its  
ads flashing a picture of Forbes and Bush and asking, ``Which 
Republican presidential hopeful said, 'I will do everything in my 
power to restrict abortions?''' 
</P>
<P>
	The answer was Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes does not object to being associated with the idea of  
restricting abortion. Indeed, the suggestion could help him court 
social conservatives who were cool to his 1996 presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	What he objects to is the fact that the NARAL ads were promoted  
by longtime Gore aide and adviser Marla Romash, who is now a 
private consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next time you see an ad attacking me -- ask Vice President  
Gore why he's hiding while his liberal friends do his dirty work,'' 
Forbes says in his new ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the NARAL ad didn't portray Forbes in a negative light,  
his advisers said it was a broadside against Republicans by Gore 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than coincidental that Gore's poll numbers are down  
and they've got a left-wing group popping out advertising ... 
against various potential and existing candidates,'' said Forbes 
strategist Bill Dal Col. 
</P>
<P>
	By responding to NARAL, Forbes hopes to show primary voters that  
he will lead attacks against Gore and make abortion an issue in 
battleground states. 
</P>
<P>
	NARAL spokesman Stephen Gaskill said Romash's ties to Gore had  
nothing to do with her hiring. Romash, who may have a role in 
Gore's campaign in the future, is not on his payroll now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an independent businesswoman and I'm pro-choice,'' she  
said. Gore spokesman Roger Salazar said, ``We want to thank Steve 
Forbes for writing an ad informing everybody about Al Gore's 
pro-choice position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither camp broke its bank to pay for the ads. NARAL spent  
about $11,000 in New Hampshire and $12,000 in Iowa. Allies of 
Forbes say he spent twice as much in Iowa and about the same as 
NARAL in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only current Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley, has appointed a former aide of House Minority Leader 
Dick Gephardt to run his campaign in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley selected Mark Longabaugh as national coordinator for New  
Hampshire just 10 days after Gephardt endorsed Gore for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Longabaugh, 40, directed Gephardt's 1988 unsuccessful  
presidential campaign in New Hampshire and the successful 1992 
Clinton-Gore campaign in Ohio, his native state. He lost his own 
bid for the House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Political pilgrimages to the Texas governor's mansion continued  
Thursday, with 30 elected Republican officials from Massachusetts, 
Maryland, Ohio and California stopping by for lunch with Bush. An 
Ohio party leader said Bush would make a better president than his 
own state's favorite son, Rep. John Kasich. 
</P>
<P>
	``John's a great guy, but ... it's going to be pretty difficult  
to go from Congress directly to the presidency,'' said Alex R. 
Arshinkoff, GOP chairman of Summit County, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Harris, spokesman for the Ohio congressman, said, ``I'm  
sure if we looked across Texas, we'd find people who support 
John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is an early favorite for the GOP nomination, but Kasich is  
a tireless campaigner working hard in the early battleground 
states, while Bush remains in Austin with his state Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Minn., Colo. Power Firms To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northern States Power Co. is merging with New  
Century Energies Inc. of Denver in a stock swap that values New 
Century at $4.66 billion, creating a huge utility company serving 
12 Western and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	But both companies' stocks fell Thursday as investors were  
unsettled by the fact that the deal could take up to 18 months to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very long lead time in order to finish the merger is  
obviously what investors are reacting to,'' said Danielle Seitz, an 
analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes nearly two years after federal regulators  
scuttled Minneapolis-based NSP's proposed merger with Wisconsin 
Energy Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company, which will be headquartered in Minneapolis,  
would have revenues of $6.4 billion based on last year's results. A 
name for the new company has yet to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger combines two well-managed, mid-continent electric  
and gas companies in order to provide a strong platform for 
assuring low-cost, quality service to the region during a time of 
rapid change in the utility industry,'' said James Howard, 
president, chairman and chief executive of NSP. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard and New Century President Wayne Brunetti said consumers  
would benefit from the deal, but analysts had mixed views. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know for a fact that New Century Energies has been chomping  
at the bit to do a deal. We knew they wanted to be bigger. Well, it 
does that for them. What else it does, I don't know,'' said Michael 
Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the deal initially sent New Century stock higher, but it  
reversed course and fell $2.18 3/4, or 5.7 percent, to close at $36.50 
on the New York Stock Exchange. NSP shares fell $1.06 1/4, or 3.9 
percent, to $26.18 3/4 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the merger to yield net cost  
savings of about $1.1 billion in the first 10 years by eliminating 
redundancies and certain operations. 
</P>
<P>
	No major job cuts or changes at individual plants are planned.  
Howard said each company's annual 6 percent attrition rate should 
cover any job reductions necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will serve 3 million electricity customers and  
about 1.5 million natural gas customers in Arizona, Colorado, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will have operations in the United Kingdom, Central  
Europe, Australia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 63, will serve as chairman for the first full year of  
operations. Brunetti will be president and CEO when the deal closes 
and will take Howard's duties when Howard retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill D. Helton, chairman and CEO of New Century, will retire  
when the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The distance between the two companies' service territories is  
likely to present some logistical difficulties. While their power 
grids are not connected, Howard said the company is confident they 
can be linked. 
</P>
<P>
	And the lack of overlapping territories also is likely to  
preclude the kind of regulatory and consumer concerns that helped 
derail NSP's deal with Wisconsin Energy in May 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	New Century was formed when Public Service Company of Colorado  
and Southwestern Public Service Company merged in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, New Century shareholders will receive  
1.55 shares of the merged company's stock for each of their shares. 
NSP shareholders will get one share of the new company for each 
share of NSP, whose current market value is $4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Committee OKs Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday  
approved one of several bills before Congress aimed at averting 
lawsuits related to Y2K computer breakdowns. But the Republican 
sponsor said supporters must overcome Democratic resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that no Y2K bill that is not bipartisan is going to  
pass,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said before the committee of 
which he is chairman voted 10-7 in favor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Democrat to vote for the measure was Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., a co-sponsor with Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hatch-Feinstein bill would establish a 90-day grace period  
so companies could fix computer problems before suits go forward. 
It would encourage alternatives to lawsuits and put limits on class 
action suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would cap punitive damages at three times  
compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is greater; if a small 
business is involved, it is whichever is less. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and most Democrats say they support  
efforts to encourage companies to update their computers to avoid 
needless and costly suits. But they have expressed concern about 
stripping consumers and other wronged parties of their legal right 
to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,  
said the bill would reward irresponsible parties who do not address 
the Y2K problem. The measure ``remains a wish list for special 
interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation,'' 
Leahy contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., used a straight  
party-line vote to move a similar bill through the Commerce 
Committee he leads. Another bill has also been introduced in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch quoted the much-cited figure of $1 trillion as the  
estimate for litigation over Year 2000 computer problems unless 
steps are taken to block frivolous suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about it, this super-litigation threat is  
real, and if it substantially interferes with the computer 
industry's ongoing Y2K repair efforts, the consequences for America 
could be dire,'' Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein said 20 percent of America's high-tech jobs are in  
California and lawsuits would ``essentially take down companies and 
cost many jobs.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Breedlove Sets Sights on 800 mph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Craig Breedlove knows he's facing what is  
likely to be his last chance to reclaim the world land speed record 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite two disappointing seasons and a year's hiatus from  
the barren playa of the Black Rock Desert, Breedlove said Thursday 
he's hopeful 1999 will be his year to rocket past Mach 1 and into 
the record books at 800 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our third year out,'' Breedlove said. ``It's a  
situation where we have to have all our ducks in line and be ready 
to bring home the bacon this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't get another shot at it, certainly with this  
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 62, Breedlove acknowledged a sense of urgency in the quest to  
go ever faster that has dominated his life. He has held five land 
speed records over the decades and was the first to break 400, 500 
and 600 mph on land. 
</P>
<P>
	It is those accomplishments that keep pushing him to new limits.  
</P>
<P>
	``I started it,'' he said. ``It seemed like a good idea at the  
time. You make a commitment to sponsors and other people. ... I'm 
in for the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the standard has been in British hands since October 1983,  
when Richard Noble streaked across the desert 100 miles north of 
Reno at 633.47 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Noble handed over the keys to Andy Green, his  
35-year-old protege from the Royal Air Force. Green topped 700 mph 
in Thrust SSC, and then, at 763.035 mph, exceeded Mach 1 on Oct. 
15, 1997, becoming the first person to officially break the sound 
barrier on land. 
</P>
<P>
	While Noble and Green basked in the international limelight,  
Breedlove, who was racing on the desert during the same time, 
struggled to reach a peak speed of 636 mph, barely exceeding 
Noble's mark of 13 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a second year of disappointments for Breedlove. In 1996  
he had a series of runs in his jet-engined Spirit of America that 
peaked at 677 mph before the desert wind sent the car skidding on 
its side. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeated financially, emotionally deflated, Breedlove took last  
year off to regroup. Now, with the backing of his primary sponsor 
Shell Oil and support sponsors Autozone/Duralast Batteries, Ford 
and Speedvision Network, he said he's ready to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	To claim another spot in the record book, Breedlove must hit 770  
mph, or 1 percent faster than the existing mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to somehow snag that 800,'' Breedlove said. ``The  
sound barrier is a great milestone and something Andy will have 
forever. We're looking for the next increment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove said his team has been working on modifications  
designed to make Spirit of America faster and more stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheel base has been lengthened and the rear axle is being  
widened to improve stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is also working on a compression system to keep desert  
grit from building up in the wheels, a problem that dogged the team 
in previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we haven't had this car supersonic yet,'' Breedlove  
said, noting that it's difficult to predict how it will handle at 
such speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that data from computer testing looks promising.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think our preparation is there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove has applied to use the Black Rock Desert from Sept. 7  
through Nov. 30.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Nuclear Waste Site Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- After 25 years, hundreds of studies and  
countless hearings and protests, the government's first nuclear 
waste depository was poised to open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Energy loaded a truck with radioactive waste  
Wednesday and prepared to send it to the underground dump in 
southern New Mexico's salt beds. It was delayed by fog early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tractor-trailer is carrying three huge stainless steel  
containers. It is supposed to head down a high mountain plateau on 
a 270-mile trip from Los Alamos National Laboratory, birthplace of 
the atomic bomb, to the $1.8 billion Waste Isolation Pilot Plant 
near Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
	The load would be the first to be stored in the nation's nuclear  
waste repository. 
</P>
<P>
	Excavated in ancient salt beds nearly half a mile below the  
surface, the plant will contain protective clothing, gloves, tools 
and other materials contaminated with plutonium during the nation's 
weapons work. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court on Wednesday denied an effort by a group  
of environmentalists to block the shipments pending a state permit 
for the repository. Two last-ditch court bids to halt shipments 
were also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving forward,'' said Anne Elliott, a spokeswoman for  
the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Over its 30-year life, the plant is expected to hold about  
37,000 shipments, largely from federal sites in California, 
Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, 
South Carolina and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department maintains everything possible has been  
done to ensure the plant's safety. Critics contend brine pockets 
make the site unsuitable since brine could allow radioactivity to 
migrate back to the surface.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Meeting Black Pols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photo NYR101    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has begun meeting with  
black political rivals nearly two months after the police shooting 
death of an unarmed African immigrant. He said today he hopes to 
widen the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, who has been criticized for refusing to sit down with  
elected black officials and community leaders, met with Manhattan 
Borough President C. Virginia Fields for the first time Wednesday 
and is planning to meet with state Comptroller H. Carl McCall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what I did is to try to explain, why I have, as best  
as I can, tried to express my sensitivity, my concern, my regret 
over this situation -- and at the same time not allow a police 
department to be defamed in the way in which it was being 
defamed,'' the mayor said after the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir has also begun meeting with  
black leaders including the Rev. Calvin Butts, who once called the 
mayor a racist. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani and the Police Department have been under fire since  
the Feb. 4 killing of Amadou Diallo. Four white officers looking 
for a rape suspect fired 41 bullets at the black Guinean immigrant, 
hitting him 19 times while he stood outside his Bronx home. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have been on desk duty while a Bronx grand jury  
decides if they should be charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who last week accused Fields of applying a ``race  
overlay'' to many issues, said today on Fox television's ``Good Day 
New York'' that in the past he has denied meetings to anyone he 
thought was playing a ``political positioning game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that position has not changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll meet with the people that I believe are in good faith,  
where we can have the kind of mutual exchange,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hourlong meeting, Fields said she pointed out ``ways  
in which I felt that he has not shown the level of sensitivity and 
understanding and it has not served to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor promised to meet with a group of black civic leaders  
as early as Friday, though the list was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests began early this month and have grown to include actors  
and a widening group of activists. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 212 people were arrested at police headquarters in  
the 12th and biggest day yet of demonstrations. At least 15 rabbis 
and a dozen rabbinical students were arrested, as was a group of 17 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir is also under fire for attending Sunday's Academy Awards  
ceremony in Los Angeles as a guest of Revlon executive George 
Fellows. Safir has asked for an investigation into whether the trip 
violated city ethics rules.

<HEADLINE> Rice Extract Lowers Cholesterol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A rice extract criticized by government  
officials because it closely resembles a prescription medicine has 
been shown to be a powerful means of lowering cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of one of the first two U.S. studies of the  
substance, called Cholestin, were presented Thursday in Orlando at 
a medical conference sponsored by the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed that people with mildly elevated levels can drop their  
cholesterol about 35 points by taking four capsules of Cholestin a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin is made from red yeast that has been fermented on  
rice. Its chief ingredient is a naturally occurring form of 
lovastatin, a prescription cholesterol-lowering medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin's introduction in 1997 blurred the already fuzzy line  
between food supplements, which can be sold without a prescription, 
and drugs that require approval of the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA declared Cholestin to be an unapproved drug and  
attempted to block its sale. Cholestin's manufacturer, Pharmanex 
Inc. of Simi Valley, Calif., sued and won. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a federal judge in Salt Lake City ruled that  
Cholestin fits the definition of a dietary supplement and can stay 
on the market. The FDA has not said whether it will challenge that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, all of the data on Cholestin's health effects have  
come from China, where the rice extract has been used for centuries 
as a spice in such foods as Peking duck. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Dr. David Heber of the University of California at  
Los Angeles published a report in the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition on 83 volunteers. He found that eight weeks of Cholestin 
lowered their cholesterol an average of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study was directed by Dr. James Rippe of Tufts  
University School of Medicine in Boston and found similar results. 
Doctors in 12 medical practices across the country put 233 people 
on Cholestin for eight weeks. Their cholesterol levels fell from an 
average of 242 to 206. 
</P>
<P>
	Both studies were financed by Pharmanex, and both Heber and  
Rippe are members of the company's medical advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a promising new development worthy of further  
research,'' said Dr. Thomas Pearson of the University of Rochester, 
speaking for the heart association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he cautioned against going on Cholestin without getting  
a doctor's advice. ``This should be integrated into the overall 
care plan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovastatin, sold by Merck Inc. as Mevacor, was the first of a  
powerful new class of cholesterol-lowering medicines known as 
statins. The smallest lovastatin pill on the market is 10 
milligrams, while a daily four-pill regimen of Cholestin adds up to 
5 milligrams of lovastatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin can be bought without a prescription, but the price is  
similar to Mevacor. A month's supply of Cholestin costs about $30. 
A month of 40 milligram Mevacor pills costs about $150. But these 
pills can be cut into four pieces, bringing a 10 milligram-a-day 
dose down to $37 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rippe said many people may prefer Cholestin because it is  
a natural rather than synthetic form of the drug, and it offers one 
more option for those who need to lower their cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying, `Eat a cheeseburger for lunch and than take  
Cholestin,''' he said. ``It should be used in conjunction with 
exercise, diet and weight reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmanex's sponsorship of scientific research to back up its  
health claims is relatively unusual among supplement makers. 
Another study nearing completion will look at the effects of 
Cholestin when eaten in a twice-daily power bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently was bought by Nu Skin International of  
Provo, Utah. Nu Skin is withdrawing the supplement from chain 
drugstores and will sell it exclusively through mail order and 
independent pharmacies.

<HEADLINE> Fan Injured Tumbling Over Railing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A 35-year-old man trying to catch a promotional  
T-shirt tumbled over a stadium railing and fell about 20 feet 
Thursday, striking his head and leaving a pool of blood on a 
rubber-covered cement runway. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Slown of Phoenix, who had taken a day off from his job at  
an auto parts store to attend Oakland's spring training game 
against the Chicago White Sox, was hurt between the fifth and sixth 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland catcher A.J. Hinch was sitting near the runway, which  
leads to the A's clubhouse, and summoned team trainers. A's coach 
Bob Alejo phoned from the clubhouse for paramedics, who ran through 
the stadium and across the field during the game to tend to the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Slown was taken to Scottsdale Memorial Hospital. A nursing  
supervisor said he was under evaluation and could not give a 
condition report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really unfortunate,'' Hinch said. ``He kind of leaned  
over the railing, rolled and fell on his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Slown was trying to catch a T-shirt that a  
promotional crew had sent into the stands with a large sling shot. 
The game wasn't delayed during the episode but the runway to the 
A's clubhouse was closed for about 20 minutes while medical 
personnel stabilized the injured man, put him on a gurney and 
wheeled him to a waiting ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting those shirts into the stands. He went over  
to get it and went right over the railing,'' said Slown's father, 
Bob, who was at the game with his son. 
</P>
<P>
	A's marketing officials declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Yagudin Wins Men's Skating Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Alexei Yagudin won the men's title for  
the second time Thursday at the World Figure Skating Championships 
with a routine that had emotion and power. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kwan also skated Thursday, but only in practice for  
Friday's short program. She had considered taking Thursday off, but 
came to the first of the day's two practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat won  
the original dance and moved into first place of the ice dance 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the night belonged to Yagudin, becoming world champion  
for the second time, only a week after turning 19. 
</P>
<P>
	He landed a quadruple jump and eight triples, all secure and  
leaving no doubt about them to music from ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ended the routine with a triumphant arm-raise, then kneeled  
down and kissed the ice. He buried his face in his hands as he left 
the ice to wait for his scores -- which included a rare 6.0 for 
technical merit. The rest were 5.8s or 5.9s. 
</P>
<P>
	Backstage, he sat in a corner and wept again, the emotion of a  
long competitive season, in which he also got his second 
consecutive European championship, coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Second was compatriot Yevgeny Plushenko, who held a slim lead  
entering the final free program worth 50 percent of the final 
score. He also did eight triples but faltered on his quad attempt, 
two-footing it and putting a hand down. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin easily beat Plushenko on all nine judges' ballots.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weiss, who had been fourth coming into the final,  
finished third. He beat three-time champion Elvis Stojko of Canada, 
who had begun the final in third. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Goebel, another American, did a quadruple salchow-triple toe  
loop combination, becoming the first to do that combination at the 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan was assured and consistent in practice.  
</P>
<P>
	She repeatedly landed the triple lutz that she had unexpectedly  
turned into a double during the previous day's qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Frank Carroll said Kwan was recovering from the head cold  
that had been bothering her earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to practice because it would be an opportunity to  
go over some things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ice dance, Russian titleholders Angelika Krylova and Oleg  
Ovsiannikov were second but in a virtual tie with the leaders. The 
decision will come down to the final free dance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov could have virtually wrapped up the  
title with a win in the original dance portion, worth 30 percent of 
the total scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	However Anissina and Peizerat won the dance on a 5-4 decision  
over the defending champions. When the scores went up, both shouted 
with joy and hugged each other as if they had won. 
</P>
<P>
	It was good enough to push them back into contention.  
</P>
<P>
	They skated to a flowing waltz with changing rhythms to music  
from a Russian movie, showing more emotion than the defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Krylova and Ovsiannikov had more speed to the drinking song from  
La Traviata, sung by Luciano Pavarotti, but lacked the closeness of 
Anissina and Peizerat. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Shae-Lynn Bourne and Germany's Victor Kraatz were  
third. Even if they win the free dance, if one of the top two 
couples comes in second, that couple would win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	If the French win the ice dance, it will be the first loss by a  
Russian or former Soviet couple in the ice dance since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Brewers' Vina Hearing Trade Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Instead of enjoying his newfound status as the  
National League's best second baseman, Fernando Vina is troubled by 
trade talk. 
</P>
<P>
	So vexed is Vina that he's not so sure he can be happy if he  
doesn't get dealt away from Milwaukee soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Uh ... you know ... I don't know if I could be super  
comfortable, you know what I mean?'' the Brewers' All-Star said. 
``I'm just going to play and play hard the way I know how because I 
have no other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vina, nicknamed ``The Mayor'' because he shakes everybody's hand  
and yes, probably even kisses babies, on his way in and out of 
ballparks, isn't his usual jovial self this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Not after his winter of discontent.  
</P>
<P>
	Vina spent much of the offseason anxiously waiting to be dealt  
to a new club. At one point, he called Brewers general manager Sal 
Bando and told him to ``pull the trigger'' on a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But one by one, the deals fell apart. Atlanta, Baltimore,  
Cleveland, the New York Mets, Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers insist they've never shopped Vina around, that he's  
simply the target of teams who come calling, especially because the 
Brewers have Mark Loretta and Ron Belliard waiting to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
	Vina's value skyrocketed after he set career-highs in 10  
categories last season, adding a .387 on-base percentage to go with 
his .986 fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Vina wanted to enter spring training with a commitment from the  
Brewers or another team but so far he has neither. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough to be in limbo and that's the bottom line,'' Vina  
said. ``I don't care if you work at McDonald's, you're a 
construction worker or you're a major league baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Vina's hopes were raised and wrecked again when the  
St. Louis Cardinals released Carlos Baerga and sent a scout to see 
him play. He doubled twice on Monday but aggravated tendinitis in 
his right knee, which will keep him out of action at least until 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the Cardinals lost pitching ace Matt Morris for the  
season with an injured elbow, becoming reluctant to part with young 
right-handed pitchers Manny Aybar or Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball's in the Cardinals' court,'' Bando said. ``They might  
be trying to find another pitcher so they can make this deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando insists he'd rather not trade Vina, but he needs another  
right-handed starter because the only one he has now is Steve 
Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this uncertainty has left Vina without his usual pep.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always want to be happy and upbeat,'' Vina said. ``It's just  
that so many things have gone on this whole winter. It's kind of 
tough to feel comfortable. It kind of puts you in a sour frame of 
mind. You can't walk around here in the clubhouse like you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody's noticed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been a grind for him,'' manager Phil Garner said.  
``He's a little less than spry. But we didn't shop him around. 
Other teams look at us and they see our depth, too. I fear when we 
say we have other second basemen, Fernando looks at it as he's 
expendable. He's not. Defensively and offensively, there's not 
another second baseman in the National League who's better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Garner and Bando say Vina shouldn't need a commitment or a  
pep talk to snap out of his funk, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just part of the game. You've got to learn to live with  
it,'' Bando said. ``I think it's been a distraction for him. 
Fernando's the type of guy whose emotions he wears on his sleeves. 
But I was not the one to banter his name out there, nor was I the 
guy that's trying to trade him. It's just that he's the guy that 
people ask for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said all along, I'd prefer not to trade him,'' Bando  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Vina's not traded, the Brewers hope he can at least reproduce  
his spectacular season if not his smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball should be your getaway,'' Garner said. ``You should  
be saying, `Man, am I glad to be on the field because this is 
heaven right now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it hasn't been for Vina so far.

<HEADLINE> Texas, Virginia Execute Two Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 44-year-old man was executed by  
injection Thursday night for the abduction, rape, shooting and 
drowning of an Austin college student more than 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, a 57-year-old man was executed by injection for  
arranging a murder to collect on a $100,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Texas case, Charles Rector was arrested while wearing  
jeans that belonged to 22-year-old victim Carolyn Kay Davis and 
carrying her jewelry, and a gun found in his car was linked to the 
bullet in her head. 
</P>
<P>
	He proclaimed his innocence until the end. While strapped to the  
gurney, he turned to Ms. Davis' relatives and said: ``I'll say this 
to the family -- I did not kill your daughter. Take it the way you 
want. I'm sorry for the pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of two men arrested with Rector for Ms. Davis' killing told  
police that they followed her home after Rector spotted her driving 
a new car and said she had money, and all three ambushed her at her 
apartment door. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the other two suspects escaped before trial and was  
killed during a robbery. The other man was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jarratt, Va., David Lee Fisher was executed for hiring  
another man to kill 18-year-old David William Wilkey while all 
three were on a hunting trip in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkey was shot in the back with a 12-gauge shotgun. Fisher --  
who had taken out an insurance policy on Wilkey a few months 
earlier -- contended Bobby Brice Mulligan acted on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulligan confessed to the murder-for-hire and was sentenced to  
life in prison.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian's Fate in Jury's Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The jury at Jack Kevorkian's murder trial  
began deliberating Thursday after the suicide doctor compared 
himself to civil rights heroes Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks 
and all but asked the jurors to disregard a law he considers 
unjust. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain acts that by sheer common sense are not  
crimes,'' Kevorkian, acting as his own lawyer, said during closing 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John Skrzynski said Kevorkian should not be allowed  
to ``make a political statement'' with the lethal injection he gave 
to Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. Youk's 
videotaped death aired on ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that any better than murder for hire? Is that any different  
than murdering somebody for money?'' the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for about six hours before adjourning for  
the day. They were to return Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski attacked the notion of Kevorkian as a man of  
compassion, and said the doctor ``came like a medical hitman in the 
night with a bag of poison to do his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor also referred to the horrors of Nazi Germany to  
rebut Kevorkia's claim that euthanasia is acceptable, perhaps even 
noble. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 11 million souls buried in Europe that can tell you  
that when you make euthanasia a state policy, some catastrophic 
things can evolve from that,'' Skrzynski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, 70, could get life in prison if convicted. He has  
been tried four times on assisted suicide charges, with three 
acquittals and one mistrial. This is the first time he has stood 
trial on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
suicides since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jessica Cooper told the jurors they could consider  
convicting Kevorkian of second-degree murder or involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	She rejected the prosecution's request for an explicit warning  
to the jurors against ``jury nullification'' -- setting aside the 
law out of sympathy for the defendant. Instead, she simply told the 
jurors that they must follow the law and that mercy killing is not 
an excuse for murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury began deliberating shortly after noon, after Kevorkian  
rested his case without calling any witnesses. The judge barred him 
from calling Youk's widow and brother to the stand, ruling that 
testimony about Kevorkian's intent and Youk's consent are 
irrelevant in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour into their deliberations, the jurors sent the judge a  
note asking to see the videotape and a legal dictionary. Cooper 
told them they could not have the dictionary and could not do their 
own legal research. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a closing statement peppered with the prosecutor's  
objections, Kevorkian reminded jurors of the actions of King and 
Mrs. Parks during the civil rights movement and noted that acts 
such as drinking beer or registering to vote were once illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Words on paper do not necessarily create crimes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He warned the jurors that if they convict him, they will face  
``the harsh judgment of history, and the harsher judgment of your 
children and grandchildren if they ever come to need that precious 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian argued that his intent was not to kill Youk but to  
ease his suffering, and that he was doing what Youk wanted him to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	He also apologized for any inconvenience caused by his  
inexperience in court: ``If I looked inept I was -- in law. But I'm 
articulate in English.''

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania Rep. To Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., said Thursday he would  
seek his party's nomination in 2000 for the Senate seat now held by 
Republican Rick Santorum. 
</P>
<P>
	Santorum plans to run for a second six-year term, aides have  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klink filed papers Thursday with the Federal Election Commission  
transferring more than $200,000 from his House campaign account for 
use in his Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Klink joins a crowded Democratic field that includes two former  
members of Congress, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Peter 
Kostmayer, state Sen. Allyson Schwartz and former state Labor and 
Industry Secretary Tom Foley. 
</P>
<P>
	Klink, a former television anchorman first elected to the House  
in 1992, believe he is the best candidate to unseat Santorum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not willing to allow Rick Santorum and his extreme  
right-wing ties and voting record to continue to represent 
Pennsylvania,'' Klink said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In choosing Santorum over Democratic incumbent Harris Wofford in  
1994, Pennsylvania voters departed from their past practice of 
electing moderates to statewide offices. Santorum holds 
conservative positions on most issues, although he has shown signs 
of moderation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the Commerce Committee, Klink has been active in  
resisting environmental regulations that he considers harmful to 
businesses in his district. He opposes abortion but generally votes 
with his party on labor and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	John Brabender, Santorum's media consultant, predicted the  
senator ultimately would win a second term based on his record on 
overhauling welfare and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Klink estimates he would need to raise $10 million to be  
competitive. He raised nearly $1 million for last year's House 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Strongest Explosion Ever Observed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It happened a long time ago in a place far,  
far away, but a gamma ray burst detected in January was the most 
powerful explosion ever observed, releasing in just seconds an 
energy wave equal to billions of years of light from thousands of 
suns. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of studies published today in the journal Science  
and next month in Nature, a team of international researchers say 
the explosion occurred 9 billion light-years from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Just what caused the explosion is still a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is probably something to do with massive stars,'' said S.  
George Djorgovski, a California Institute of Technology astronomer 
who is co-author of a study in Nature. ``The real truth is, we 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gamma ray burst was detected by Italian and U.S. science  
satellites that sent an alert to a network of ground instruments 
and telescopes. Within seconds, telescopes focused on the area of 
the sky where the burst originated and captured views in visible 
light. Later, more powerful telescopes photographed the explosion's 
afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert enabled astronomers, for the first time in history, to  
capture optical views of a gamma ray burst event as the detection 
was underway. Analyzing this light helped the scientists determine 
that the burst happened so far away that it took 9 billion years 
for the light to reach Earth. Light travels about 6 trillion miles 
a year in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said an analysis of light and other energy spewing  
from the explosion suggests that for a very brief instant the 
explosion was more luminous and energetic than the whole rest of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the gamma rays were emitted equally in all directions,  
their energy would correspond to 10,000 times the energy emitted by 
our sun over its entire lifetime of about 5 billion years,'' he 
said in an interview. ``Yet the burst last only a few tens of 
seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there is some evidence the energy was detected  
as a concentrated beam that was pointed at the Earth. A beam would 
give an impression of greater energy in the explosion, just as a 
flashlight beam focused on one spot appears to be brighter than an 
uncovered bulb that scatters the same amount of light in all 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the gamma ray energy were sent out in a beam, said  
Djorgovski, that would reduce the energy estimate only by a factor 
of 10 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would still be the most powerful explosion ever observed,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gamma ray bursts were discovered in 1967, but the phenomenon  
remains mysterious. The bursts occur randomly across the sky 
several hundred times a year, lasting for only a few milliseconds 
to a few minutes. Because of the short duration, large telescopes 
in the past could not be focused in time to catch optical views. 
The satellite alert system now makes that possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Djorgovski said there have been more than 150 theories proposed  
to explain gamma ray bursts. The two leading ideas, he said, both 
involve massive stars. One theory proposes that the burst occurs 
when two massive stars merge and form a black hole. Another theory 
proposes that the energy eruption comes from a hypersupernova, a 
stellar explosion much larger than that of an ordinary supernova. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is perfectly possible that the source is even stranger and  
more unusual,'' said Djorgovski, ``but the circumstantial evidence 
suggests it involves massive stars.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton's Kosovo Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's address to the nation Wednesday  
night about airstrikes against Yugoslavia, as transcribed by the 
Federal Document Clearinghouse: 
</P>
<P>
	My fellow Americans, today our armed forces joined our NATO  
allies in airstrikes against Serbian forces responsible for the 
brutality in Kosovo. We have acted with resolve for several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	We act to protect thousands of innocent people in Kosovo from a  
mounting military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	We act to prevent a wider war, to defuse a powder keg at the  
heart of Europe, that has exploded twice before in this century 
with catastrophic results. 
</P>
<P>
	We act to stand united with our allies for peace.  
</P>
<P>
	By acting now, we are upholding our values, protecting our  
interests, and advancing the cause of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight I want to speak with you about the tragedy in Kosovo and  
why it matters to America that we work with our allies to end it. 
</P>
<P>
	First, let me explain what it is that we are responding to.  
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, in the middle of south eastern 
Europe and about 160 miles east of Italy. That's less than the 
distance between Washington and New York, and only about 70 miles 
north of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Its people are mostly ethnic Albanian and mostly Muslim.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1989 Serbia's leader Slobodan Milosevic, the same leader who  
started the wars in Bosnia and Croatia, and moved against Slovenia 
in the last decade, stripped Kosovo of the constitutional autonomy 
it's people enjoyed, thus denying them their right to speak their 
language, run their schools, shape their daily lives. For years, 
Kosovar's struggled peacefully to get their rights back. When 
President Milosevic sent his troops and police to crush them, the 
struggle grew violent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, our diplomacy, backed by the threat of force from our  
NATO alliance, stopped the fighting for awhile, and rescued tens of 
thousands of people from freezing and starvation in the hills where 
they had fled to save their lives. And last month, with our allies 
and Russia, we proposed a peace agreement to end the fighting for 
good. The Kosovar leaders signed that agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though it does not give them all they want, even though  
their people were still being savaged, they saw that a just peace 
is better than a long and unwinable war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbian leaders, on the other hand, refused even to discuss  
key elements of the peace agreement. As the Kosovars were saying 
yes to peace, Serbia stationed 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo 
in preparation for a major offensive and in clear violation of the 
commitments they had made. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they've started moving from village to village, shelling  
civilians and torching their houses. We've seen innocent people 
taken from their homes, forced to kneel in the dirt and sprayed 
with bullets. Kosovar men dragged from their families, fathers and 
sons together, lined up, and shot in cold blood. This is not war in 
the traditional sense. It is an attack by tanks and artillery on a 
largely defenseless people, whose leaders already have agreed to 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative. It is also important  
to America's national interests. Take a look at this map. Kosovo is 
a small place, but it sits on a major fault line between Europe, 
Asia, and the Middle East, at the meeting place of Islam and both 
the Western and Orthodox branches of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south are our allies, Greece and Turkey. To the north,  
our new democratic allies in Central Europe. And all around Kosovo, 
there are other small countries, struggling with their own economic 
and political challenges, countries that could be overthrown by a 
large new wave of refugees from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	All the ingredients for a major war are there. Ancient  
grievances, struggling democracies and in the center of it all, a 
dictator in Serbia who has done nothing since the Cold War ended, 
but start new wars and pour gasoline on the flames of ethnic and 
religious division. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarajevo, the capital of neighboring Bosnia, is where World War  
I began. World War II and the Holocaust engulfed this region. In 
both wars Europe was slow to recognize the dangers, and the United 
States waited even longer to enter the conflicts. Just imagine if 
leaders back then had acted wisely and early enough, how many lives 
could have been saved? How many Americans would not have had to 
die? 
</P>
<P>
	We learned some of the same lessons in Bosnia just a few years  
ago. The world did not act early enough to stop that war either. 
And let's not forget what happened. Innocent people herded into 
concentration camps, children gunned down by snipers on their way 
to school, soccer fields and parks turned into cemeteries. A 
quarter of a million people killed, not because of anything they 
had done, but because of who they were. Two million Bosnians became 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	This was genocide in the heart of Europe, not in 1945, but in  
1995. Not in some grainy newsreel from our parents' and 
grandparents' time, but in our own time, testing our humanity and 
our resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, many people believed nothing could be done to end  
the bloodshed in Bosnia. They said, ``Well, that's just the way 
those people in the Balkans are.'' But when we and our allies 
joined with courageous Bosnians to stand up to the aggressors, we 
helped to end the war. We learned that in the Balkans, inaction in 
the face of brutality, simply invites brutality. But firmness can 
stop armies and save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	We must apply that lesson in Kosovo, before what happened in  
Bosnia, happens there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last few months, we have done everything we possibly  
could to solve this problem peacefully. Secretary Albright has 
worked tirelessly for a negotiated agreement. Mr. Milosevic has 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, I sent Ambassador Dick Holbrooke to Serbia to make  
clear to him again on behalf of the United States and our NATO 
allies that he must honor his own commitments and stop his 
repression or face military action. Again, he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, we and our 18 NATO allies agreed to do what we said we  
would do, what we must do to restore the peace. Our mission is 
clear -- to demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's purpose so that 
the Serbian leaders understand the imperative of reversing course, 
to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in 
Kosovo and, if necessary, to seriously damage the Serbian 
military's capacity to harm the people of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, if President Milosevic will not make peace, we will  
limit his ability to make war. 
</P>
<P>
	Now I want to be clear with you, there are risks in this  
military action -- risk to our pilots and the people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia's air defenses are strong. It could decide to intensify  
its assault on Kosovo, or to seek to harm us or our allies 
elsewhere. If it does, we will deliver a forceful response. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopefully, Mr. Milosevic will realize his present course is  
self-destructive and unsustainable. If he decides to accept the 
peace agreement and demilitarize Kosovo, NATO has agreed to help to 
implement it with a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO's invited to do so, our troops should take part in that  
mission to keep the peace, but I do not intend to put our troops in 
Kosovo to fight a war. 
</P>
<P>
	Do our interests in Kosovo justify the dangers to our armed  
forces? I thought long and hard about that question. I am convinced 
that the dangers of acting are far outweighed by the dangers of not 
acting -- dangerous to defenseless people and to our national 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	If we and our allies were to allow this war to continue with no  
response, President Milosevic would read our hesitation as a 
license to kill. There would be many massacres, tens of thousands 
refugees, victims crying our for revenge. Right now, our firmness 
is the only hope the people of Kosovo have to be able to live in 
their own country, without having to fear for their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember, we asked them to accept peace and they did. We asked  
them to promise to lay down their arms and they agreed. We pledged 
that we, the United States and the other 18 nations of NATO would 
stick by them if they did the right thing. We cannot let them down 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine what would happen if we and our allies instead decided  
just to look the other way as these people were massacred on NATO's 
doorstep. That would discredit NATO, the cornerstone on which our 
security has rested for 50 years now. 
</P>
<P>
	We must also remember that this is a conflict with no natural  
national boundaries. Let me ask you to look again at a map. The red 
dots are towns the Serbs have attacked. The arrows show the 
movement of refugees north, east and south. Already, this movement 
is threatening the young democracy in Macedonia, which has its own 
Albanian minority and a Turkish minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Serbian forces have made forays into Albania from which  
Kosovars have drawn support. Albania has a Greek minority. Let a 
fire burn here in this area, and the flames will spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, key U.S. allies could be drawn into a wider conflict  
-- a war we would be forced to confront later, only at far greater 
risk and greater cost. 
</P>
<P>
	I have a responsibility as president to deal with problems such  
as this before they do permanent harm to our national interests. 
America has a responsibility to stand with our allies when they are 
trying to save innocent lives and preserve peace, freedom and 
stability in Europe. That is what we are doing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	If we've learned anything from the century drawing to a close,  
it is that if America is going to be prosperous and secure, we need 
a Europe that is prosperous, secure, undivided and free. 
</P>
<P>
	We need a Europe that is coming together, not falling apart. A  
Europe that shares our values, and shares the burdens of 
leadership. That is the foundation on which the security of our 
children will depend. That is why I have supported the political 
and economic unification of Europe. That is why we brought Poland, 
Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, and redefined its 
mission. And reached out to Russia and Ukraine for new 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Now what are the challenges to that vision of a peaceful,  
secure, united, stable Europe? The challenge of strengthening a 
partnership with a democratic Russia, that despite our 
disagreements, is a constructive partner in the work of building 
peace. The challenge of resolving the tensions between Greece and 
Turkey, and building bridges with the Islamic world. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, the challenge of ending instability in the Balkans,  
so that these bitter, ethnic problems in Europe are resolved by the 
force of argument, not the force of bombs. So that future 
generations of Americans do not have to cross the Atlantic to fight 
another terrible war. It is this challenge that we and our allies 
are facing in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why we have acted now -- because we care about saving  
innocent lives, because we have an interest in avoiding an even 
crueler and costlier war and because our children need and deserve 
a peaceful, stable, free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Our thoughts and prayers tonight must be with the men and women  
of our armed forces, who are undertaking this mission for the sake 
of our values and our children's future. 
</P>
<P>
	May God bless them, and may God bless America.

<HEADLINE> Hasek Flies to Germany for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek flew to Munich, Germany, to  
see a specialist about the groin injury that kept the Buffalo 
Sabres goalie out of 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said the visit was strictly precautionary and unrelated  
to the back injury that forced Hasek to miss Wednesday night's 2-1 
loss to the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>

	Hasek heard about the doctor from a friend, tennis player Petr  
Korda. He is expected back in Buffalo on Friday and could play 
against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek suffered the strained groin Feb. 17 and was sidelined a

<HEADLINE> Marine's Charges Stand in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C (AP) -- A judge refused Thursday to dismiss  
obstruction of justice charges against a Marine navigator whose jet 
clipped an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Alvin Keller said there was sufficient evidence to proceed  
with the court-martial of Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, 
N.Y. The proceeding was scheduled to resume Monday. It was not 
clear when jury selection would begin. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer is accused of destroying a videotape that he shot  
before the EA-6B Prowler hit the cable near Cavalese in the Italian 
Alps on Feb. 3, 1998. He is the second crew member to be tried in 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	A military jury on March 4 acquitted the jet's pilot, Capt.  
Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., of manslaughter and 
other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	During his trial, Ashby said Schweitzer filmed the early part of  
their training flight. After they landed, he gave the tape to 
Schweitzer and never saw it again, Ashby testified. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing for dismissal, defense lawyers said the aviators  
couldn't have known a criminal inquiry would be started when they 
landed after the accident and couldn't have conspired to block one. 
</P>
<P>
	``No pilot in the Marine Corps in 30 years has ever gone to a  
criminal trial'' over an air mishap, argued Navy Lt. Kathryn Clune, 
representing Schweitzer. ``There was no intent to obstruct a 
criminal proceeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Maj. Daniel Daugherty said the defense argument was  
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had just screwed up a $50 million airplane,'' Daugherty  
said. ``To say the only thing aviators think about when they screw 
up an aircraft is an administrative mishap board ... defies common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter counts against Schweitzer were dismissed after the  
acquittal. Both men still face charges of obstruction of justice 
and conspiracy to obstruct justice because of the videotape's 
disappearance. If convicted, Schweitzer could be sentenced to 10 
years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Woman Held in Cyanide Mailings Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman awaiting trial on charges she mailed  
cyanide packets disguised as nutritional supplements to people 
around the country died Thursday at a federal medical facility in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Schoonover, 50, had been found to be terminally ill with  
cancer after her arrest in California and was sent to the Federal 
Medical Center on Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas. In 
September, doctors said she had only six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schoonover case sent a scare across the nation last August  
when she was arrested outside the post office in Marina del Rey, 
where she had allegedly stuffed cyanide packets attached to health 
supplement brochures into 100 envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said Schoonover was wearing rubber gloves, holding a  
container marked with a skull and crossbones and scooping a 
substance from the container into envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no known deaths from cyanide mailings.  
</P>
<P>
	In a van where Ms. Schoonover was living, authorities found two  
``hit lists'' naming individuals apparently targeted to receive the 
cyanide packets, postal inspectors said.

<HEADLINE> Nonviolent Prisoners Tops 1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Get-tough crime-fighting policies such as  
mandatory minimum sentences and ``three strikes, you're out'' laws 
helped drive the number of nonviolent inmates in American jails and 
prisons above 1 million last year, a group that opposes minimum 
sentences says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Wednesday from the liberal-oriented Justice Policy  
Institute concluded that since 1978, the number of criminals 
entering jail or prison for violent offenses doubled, while those 
entering incarceration for nonviolent convictions tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	The study follows a Justice Department report earlier this month  
that showed the country's prison and jail population overall rose 
to about 1.8 million by the middle of last year -- its highest level 
ever and double the number from 12 years before. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberal institute used the recent Justice Department  
statistics to calculate the national breakdown of violent and 
nonviolent prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department study did not break down violent and  
nonviolent prisoners in the same way. But a department 
statistician, Allen J. Beck, did not quibble with the Justice 
Policy Institute's calculation that the nonviolent population has 
topped 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck did note that the most dramatic growth in all prison  
populations peaked several years ago, and that the latter 1990s 
have been marked by relative stability. ``The story is a lot more 
complex,'' than a simple breakdown of violent and nonviolent 
inmates suggests, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another problem is that here are some fairly serious offenses  
that are considered nonviolent -- burglary, arson and drug 
trafficking for example -- that reasonable people would consider 
very serious offenses,'' Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department statistics from mid-1998 show 74 percent of  
local jail inmates, 53 percent of state prison inmates, and 88 
percent of federal prisoners ``were imprisoned for offenses which 
involved neither harm nor the threat of harm to a victim,'' the 
Justice Policy Institute's report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimates that at the end of 1998, there were 440,088  
nonviolent jail inmates, 639,280 nonviolent state prison inmates 
and 106,090 nonviolent federal prisoners for a national total of 
1,185,458 nonviolent prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls 1998 the first full year the nonviolent prison  
population was above 1 million, but its authors noted that the 
total has hovered near 1 million for several years, and may have 
actually passed that mark late in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., cited the study as he pushed for  
legislation eliminating mandatory five-year penalties for crack 
cocaine crimes and an end to the sentencing disparity between 
offenses for crack and powder cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Breedlove Sets Sights on 800 mph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Craig Breedlove knows he's facing what is  
likely to be his last chance to reclaim the world land speed record 
for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And despite two disappointing seasons and a year's hiatus from  
the barren playa of the Black Rock Desert, Breedlove said Thursday 
he's hopeful 1999 will be his year to rocket past Mach 1 and into 
the record books at 800 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our third year out,'' Breedlove said. ``It's a  
situation where we have to have all our ducks in line and be ready 
to bring home the bacon this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't get another shot at it, certainly with this  
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 62, Breedlove acknowledged a sense of urgency in the quest to  
go ever faster that has dominated his life. He has held five land 
speed records over the decades and was the first to break 400, 500 
and 600 mph on land. 
</P>
<P>
	It is those accomplishments that keep pushing him to new limits.  
</P>
<P>
	``I started it,'' he said. ``It seemed like a good idea at the  
time. You make a commitment to sponsors and other people. ... I'm 
in for the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the standard has been in British hands since October 1983,  
when Richard Noble streaked across the desert 100 miles north of 
Reno at 633.47 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Noble handed over the keys to Andy Green, his  
35-year-old protege from the Royal Air Force. Green topped 700 mph 
in Thrust SSC, and then, at 763.035 mph, exceeded Mach 1 on Oct. 
15, 1997, becoming the first person to officially break the sound 
barrier on land. 
</P>
<P>
	While Noble and Green basked in the international limelight,  
Breedlove, who was racing on the desert during the same time, 
struggled to reach a peak speed of 636 mph, barely exceeding 
Noble's mark of 13 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a second year of disappointments for Breedlove. In 1996  
he had a series of runs in his jet-engined Spirit of America that 
peaked at 677 mph before the desert wind sent the car skidding on 
its side. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeated financially, emotionally deflated, Breedlove took last  
year off to regroup. Now, with the backing of his primary sponsor 
Shell Oil and support sponsors Autozone/Duralast Batteries, Ford 
and Speedvision Network, he said he's ready to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	To claim another spot in the record book, Breedlove must hit 770  
mph, or 1 percent faster than the existing mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to somehow snag that 800,'' Breedlove said. ``The  
sound barrier is a great milestone and something Andy will have 
forever. We're looking for the next increment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove said his team has been working on modifications  
designed to make Spirit of America faster and more stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The wheel base has been lengthened and the rear axle is being  
widened to improve stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is also working on a compression system to keep desert  
grit from building up in the wheels, a problem that dogged the team 
in previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we haven't had this car supersonic yet,'' Breedlove  
said, noting that it's difficult to predict how it will handle at 
such speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that data from computer testing looks promising.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think our preparation is there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove has applied to use the Black Rock Desert from Sept. 7  
through Nov. 30.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson, Qualcomm End Squabble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two pioneers of wireless communications have  
resolved a patent dispute that stood in the way of clearer, quicker 
connections for calling, sending data and going online. 
</P>
<P>
	Averting a costly and time-consuming trial that was due to start  
next month, Qualcomm Inc. of California and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden 
agreed on a common set of standards for the next generation of the 
digital technology known as code division multiple access, or CDMA. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Qualcomm introduced CDMA in the late 1970s, Ericsson  
had alleged that the latest version violated some of its patents 
for wireless technology. 
</P>
<P>
	CDMA has never dominated the world market for wireless  
technology, but the new version is expected to supplant the global 
system for mobile communications, or GSM, as the most popular 
format. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the companies hold considerable sway in the market, the  
U.N. agency that adopts standards for global communications has 
been delaying its decision on the issue since the battle began in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, many mobile phone makers and service providers had  
been hoping Qualcomm and Ericsson would overcome their differences, 
clearing the path for improved voice communications and the type of 
rapid data transmission needed for wireless Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the huge appeal of those services, ``the total number  
of wireless subscribers is expected to surpass 1 billion in a few 
years,'' said Qualcomm Chief Executive Irwin Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	With Thursday's truce in place, mobile phones and other devices  
based on the new technology should hit the market by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wireless cellular carriers want (the new technology) because  
it will mean equipment that has greater voice and data capacity,'' 
attracting new customers and fueling more usage, said David Toung, 
an industry analyst at Argus Research of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the companies hailed their agreement as ``a historic event  
for the wireless industry,'' Toung said the deal was more a matter 
of corporate common sense than a major breakthrough for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Litigation is costly,'' said David Toung, an industry analyst  
at Argus Research of New York. ``They each decided that they can 
make more money by making phones than by going to court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors embraced the deal, boosting shares of both companies  
by more than 10 percent in Thursday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. Qualcomm rose $11.06 1/4 to $98.43 3/4 a share, while Ericsson's 
U.S. shares rose $2.25 to $23.31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of Thursday's deal, the companies will share the  
technologies in question with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Ericsson will buy Qualcomm's wireless equipment operations  
in San Diego, Calif., and Boulder, Colo., for an undisclosed price. 
Jacobs said the business has several hundred million dollars in 
annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale also will allow Qualcomm to focus on making wireless  
phones and the computer chips that make them work, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nokia, the Finnish company that has emerged as the world's  
biggest mobile phone maker, and No. 2 Motorola both make handsets 
based on CDMA, but No. 3 Ericcson does not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can now move into an estimated $9 billion market in this  
year alone when it comes to infrastructure and we are also 
aggressively interested in pursuing the CDMA handset market,'' said 
Sven-Christer Nilsson, chief executive of Ericcson, estimating 
there will be 16 million CDMA units by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Twins Offer Seats for $1.22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- In the best season-ticket deal in the majors,  
the Minnesota Twins are offering $99 full-season packages that 
include an autographed Kirby Puckett bat for every pair of seats. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 of the $99 season tickets have been sold since they  
went on sale two weeks ago, and the Twins expect another 200-300 to 
go before the April 6 home opener against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is it a heck of a deal with the bat, but more  
importantly it crosses all financial guidelines in terms of 
people's ability to become a full-time season-ticket holder for 
this baseball team,'' team spokesman Dave St. Peter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tickets are for upper deck general admission seats that  
regularly sell for $4 per game. The cost of a seat with the 
season-ticket deal is $1.22 per game. It is the cheapest 81-game 
season ticket in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins offered $83 season tickets three years ago, but the  
addition of a bat signed by Puckett makes this year's promotion 
more enticing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the bat is maybe the clincher for some people, I think  
having a full season ticket is still probably the primary force 
behind people buying these things,'' St. Peter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins are doing whatever they can to attract fans for a  
season in which they drastically have cut the payroll. They appear 
to be on the way to a seventh consecutive losing season with a team 
that will be stocked with rookies and inexperienced players. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Metrodome also has become a tough sell in this era of  
showy new ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were in Jacobs Field (in Cleveland) we wouldn't have to  
do this,'' St. Peter said. ``But let's face reality, we're not. We 
need to be creative.''

<HEADLINE> Paraguay Impeachment Hearings Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's Senate today began hearings  
to impeach President Raul Cubas, proceedings hastened by the 
assassination of the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators read opening statements and laid out the accusations  
against the president, who was represented by two of his lawyers. 
It wasn't clear when the Senate would vote; impeachment requires a 
two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas is accused of abusing his powers by freeing former army  
chief Lino Oviedo, his ally and mentor. Oviedo was released from 
jail in August, just months after he was sentenced to 10 years for 
attempting to oust then-President Juan Wasmosy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ordered Cubas to send Oviedo back to prison,  
but the president refused, despite pressure from members of the 
ruling Colorado Party led by Vice President Luis Argana. 
</P>
<P>
	Argana was killed when three men opened fire on his car as he  
rode to work Tuesday. The killers remain at large but Cubas and 
Oviedo have been widely blamed for Argana's death. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the lower house of Congress voted overwhelmingly  
to charge Cubas with misconduct and begin a judicial process that 
could lead to his ouster. The vote, similar to an impeachment vote 
in the U.S. Congress, set up the trial that began today in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to defuse tension, Cubas ordered Oviedo's arrest  
Wednesday. Oviedo denied he was under arrest, and it was unclear 
whether he would go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Juan Carlos Galaverna of the Colorado Party called the  
arrest ``a trick by Cubas, who is trying to fool us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Congress, students and opposition members cheered the  
vote to impeach Cubas. Rodrigo Gonzalez, a 19-year-old student, 
said, ``Our country deserves a better government, and I'm certain 
Cubas will be voted down by the senators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Argana's coffin was carried by motorcade to  
tributes at Colorado Party headquarters and the Congress before 
burial in an Asuncion cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners waved flags and chanted slogans to demand Cubas'  
resignation. Cubas did not attend any of the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton strongly condemned the ``brutal  
murder, which occurred against the backdrop of continued political 
turmoil'' in Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Paraguay, which returned to democracy in 1989 after 35 years of  
military dictatorship, is struggling with political infighting, a 
deepening economic crisis and rising unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Cal Ripken Sr. Dies of Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken Sr., whose contributions to the  
Baltimore Orioles extend well beyond fathering and tutoring one of 
the best players in the history of the franchise, died Thursday of 
lung cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken died around 4:15 p.m. EST at Johns Hopkins Oncology  
Center with his family by his bedside. Ripken spent 36 years in the 
Orioles organization as a player, scout, coach and manager. He also 
found time to raise a family that included future Hall of Famer Cal 
Ripken Jr., a star with the Orioles since 1982, and former major 
league infielder Bill Ripken, who also played in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always talk about the Oriole Way. Cal Ripken Sr. was the  
one who indoctrinated every one of us who came in,'' said Baltimore 
manager Ray Miller, who served under Ripken as a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. had leathered skin and a gruff voice, characteristics  
at least partially attributable to the fact that he was a heavy 
smoker. Back in the days when smoking on the field wasn't taboo, he 
often cupped a filterless cigarette in his palm while watching 
batting practice or in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken taught Cal and Bill about baseball while serving as a  
minor league manager. He won 964 games in the minors and was 68-101 
as manager of the Orioles in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal Sr. played an important role in many of the successes of  
the Orioles. Players at all levels of development benefited from 
his vast knowledge of the game and his teaching skills,'' 
then-general manager Roland Hemond said after Ripken was relieved 
of his duties as Baltimore's third base coach in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was offered another job within the organization but  
instead went into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Ripken Sr. became the first father ever to manage two  
sons simultaneously in the majors. Cal was the midst of a major 
league record consecutive games streak that would extend to 2,632 
games. Bill was the Orioles' second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. was fired after the Orioles opened the 1988 season  
with six straight losses in what would be ultimately a record 
21-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually returned to his old role as third-base coach and  
maintained the position through the end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles have lost someone who meant a lot to this  
organization for a very long time,'' general manager Frank Wren 
said in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where the team is holding spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. began his career with the Orioles as a catcher with  
the team's Phoenix affiliate in 1957. He ended his undistinguished 
playing career in 1964, having never reached the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-plus years in the Baltimore farm system is the longest  
tenure of any minor league manager in Oriole history. During that 
time, Ripken Sr. worked odd jobs over the winter because baseball 
didn't pay him enough to support a family of six. 
</P>
<P>
	He often brought his boys to the ballpark but left most of the  
development of the family's four children to their mother, Vi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just as if their father was a truck driver -- he was  
away from home a lot, and you just had to live with it,'' Vi Ripken 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I resented baseball for taking away my father,'' Cal Jr. once  
said. ``Baseball didn't allow him to spend much time with me when I 
was growing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They made up for lost time when Cal Jr. joined the team in 1981  
and Bill come aboard in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Cal Sr. downplayed his unique baseball association  
with his boys. But he said it would be something he would look back 
at fondly after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just happen to be in the same business at the same place,''  
Ripken said in 1992. ``Maybe years from now, when I'm reflecting 
upon things in my rocking chair, I'll smile about all this. But for 
now they're just a second baseman and a shortstop on this 
ballclub.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Jr., who left spring training on Tuesday to be with his  
father, viewed his father as the inspiration for his incredible 
consecutive games streak. 
</P>
<P>
	When young Cal was 16, his dad hooked a snowplow to a tractor in  
an effort to help clear the neighborhood. The tractor stalled, and 
when Cal Sr. tried to get it going, a crank flew off and hit him in 
the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal Sr. pressed an oily rag to his head in an effort to stop the  
bleeding while his scared son got him into the family car. But 
instead of driving to a hospital, Cal Sr. told his son to drive 
home. There, Cal Jr. watched his dad put on some butterfly 
bandages, then saw him head back to the plow to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I get the feeling that things are a little low, that I  
need a little motivation to work on my hitting, I visualize the 
tractor-crank story. That pushes me,'' Cal Ripken said in the midst 
of his streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of that story more than any other. Sometimes I'm  
beating my head against the wall and not getting any results at the 
plate, and I'm wondering if my effort is worth it all. That story 
sums it all up for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife and his two major league player sons,  
survivors include daughter Ellen, son Fred and six grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Lucas Helps Fund Digital Studio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Star Wars'' director George Lucas donated  
$1.5 million to create a new digital studio at his alma mater, the 
University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility, located in USC's new Robert Zemeckis Center for  
Digital Arts, will be named after late director Akira Kurosawa, 
known for such films as ``Ran,'' ``Rashomon'' and ``The Seven 
Samurai.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kurosawa was one of film's true greats,'' Lucas said  
Wednesday. ``His ability to transform a vision into a powerful work 
of art is unparalleled. So it seemed appropriate to name the new 
digital stage after him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, we pay tribute to Kurosawa while at the same time  
inspiring students to break new ground the way he did.''

<HEADLINE> Ga. Lawmakers OK Anti-Sprawl Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia lawmakers have approved the creation of a  
new state agency aimed at controlling air pollution and traffic in 
the fast-growing Atlanta region. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill establishing the Georgia Regional Transportation  
Authority, a top priority of Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes, is ready 
for the governor's signature after winning final approval from the 
Legislature on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traffic and air quality will not improve tomorrow,'' Barnes  
said. ``But if we push forward and insist on regional cooperation, 
I believe GRTA will provide the mechanism for fixing this 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency would have the power to build and operate mass  
transportation in counties that violate federal clean-air 
standards. It would also have veto power over road projects and 
major developments, such as shopping malls, in polluting areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Local governments that refuse to cooperate would lose state  
funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The action was prompted by concern over pollution and sprawl in  
Atlanta, where the population in the region has doubled in the last 
three decades to 3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes made the transportation authority his top agenda item,  
saying traffic and pollution threaten not just metro Atlanta but 
also the wealth the area pumps into the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The authority would initially have jurisdiction over 13 counties  
in metro Atlanta that are violating federal pollution limits. State 
officials predict 11 more counties in the Augusta, Columbus and 
Macon areas could be added to the list by the summer of 2000.

<HEADLINE>  Duke Seeks Success in San Jose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Gail Goestenkors is an emotional coach,  
and she held nothing back when her Duke Blue Devils lost their 
season opener by 30 points to Connecticut in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was totally shocked, surprised and dismayed by our  
performance,'' she said. ``I was especially surprised by the way my 
seniors were unable to handle the pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That 104-74 loss came in the Four in the Fall tournament at the  
San Jose Arena, an event intended to showcase some of the top 
women's teams in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the worst game of our season,'' Goestenkors said this  
week. ``I told the players after the game, `Well, now we know how 
bad we can be. We've got the entire rest of the season to find out 
how good we can be.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That tourney, which also included Stanford and Arkansas, began a  
season that ends this weekend with the Women's Final Four at the 
San Jose Arena. Duke is the only one of those four teams making a 
return trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to set our schedule up so that the beginning of our  
journey would be in San Jose and the end of our journey would be in 
San Jose. They've known from Day 1 what that first trip was all 
about. It wasn't the best trip,'' Goestenkors said. ``I think there 
would be nothing more fitting than to play our last game there and 
have it be our best game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke reached the Final Four with a stunning upset of three-time  
defending national champion Tennessee. The Volunteers' loss is one 
of the reasons this weekend might be more notable for who's missing 
than who's at the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Four in the Fall tournament was played, it seemed like  
the beginning to a perfect buildup for the Final Four -- which was 
coming to an area wild about women's hoops and proud to host the 
American Basketball League's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans were even relishing a dream Final Four matchup: local  
favorite Stanford, capping a decade of success, against nearly 
unbeatable Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Although San Jose remains excited about playing host to the  
games and about the $32 million economic impact the Final Four is 
expected to have on the city, reality turned out to be a lot 
different than the expectations of last autumn. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL folded a few days before Christmas. Fans still grieve  
the loss of a league they thought represented the growing 
opportunities for women athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford had a disappointing season that ended in the first  
round of the NCAA tournament, and Tennessee lost 69-63 to Duke in 
the regional finals to miss out on another trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, struggling to get fan support on a campus infatuated with  
its men's basketball team's run to the Final Four, will face 
Georgia in the first semifinal game Friday evening. The nightcap 
will be Louisiana Tech against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue also made a West Coast trip earlier this season, and left  
just as dismayed as Duke. A 73-72 defeat at Stanford in the third 
game of the season remains the Boilermakers' only loss of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors remembers the long trip home from San Jose last  
November, but her more recent memory is of the happy journey home 
after Monday's win over Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a wonderful bus ride home,'' she said. ``Lots of  
singing, lots of dancing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That joyous trip was exactly what her colleague at Duke, men's  
coach Mike Krzyzewski, has always preached about. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's given a lot of advice but all of it has to do with  
enjoying the ride, enjoying the journey,'' Goestenkors said. ``I've 
always set our sights very high, which I think is important. But at 
the same time, he wants you to slow down and enjoy the ride and 
realize what you've accomplished along the way as you're pushing 
forward.''

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Backs Campaign Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Unz, the software millionaire who  
shook up California schools with a ballot measure that effectively 
ended bilingual education, is trying to do the same thing to 
politics by limiting campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Called the Voters' Bill of Rights, the catchall ballot measure  
would restrict political contributions and spending in this 
big-money state, where candidates in last year's governor's race 
spent $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	It would ban corporate donations, provide limited public  
matching funds for campaigns, boost disclosure requirements, limit 
legislators' salaries and turn the task of redrawing district lines 
over to an independent commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a very corrupt election and campaign system in  
California and that hurts everyone in the state,'' Unz said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who was an unsuccessful  
Republican candidate for governor in 1994, has joined with Democrat 
Tony Miller, a former acting secretary of state and twice 
unsuccessful candidate for statewide office, to try to put the 
measure on the March 2000 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The unlikely collaborators planned to unveil the initiative  
formally on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this passes, it will set an example for not only other  
states but for the Congress,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice since 1988, California voters have approved similar --  
though less far-reaching -- initiatives to bolster campaign 
disclosure requirements and curb the role of big money in politics. 
But the measures have been overturned by or tied up in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Unz said his initiative was carefully drawn to stand up to court  
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-made millionaire won passage of Proposition 227 on  
bilingual education last year with little more than a fax machine, 
two paid helpers and about $750,000 of his own money.

<HEADLINE> Congress Differs on Kosovo Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While supporting U.S. troops in the Balkans,  
members of Congress differ on what course U.S. policy should take 
next. Sen. Jesse Helms, for example, proposes to make removal of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic official U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina Republican, who is chairman of the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, would earmark $100 million for that 
purpose, using some of the money for insurgents and some of it to 
increase Radio Free Europe broadcasts into Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are individuals and organizations in Serbia that can be  
a force for democratic change in that country. Milosevic is not the 
only option,'' Helms said in a Senate speech . 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, also sponsored by Sens. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,  
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and John McCain, R-Ariz., is similar to a 
measure passed late last year -- and signed by President Clinton -- 
setting aside about $100 million to support groups that are trying 
to topple Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Joseph Lieberman,  
D-Conn., introduced legislation to earmark $25 million to arm the 
Kosovars to defend themselves against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be enough to arm 10 battalions of 1,000 soldiers each  
with machine guns, grenade launchers, rifles and other equipment 
for up to 18 months, McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Albanian-speaking Kosovars had agreed to disarm  
under the peace agreement they signed in Paris, it makes sense now 
to help them to defend themselves, particularly if NATO airstrikes 
don't end Serbia's offensive in Kosovo, the two senators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, said Lieberman, ``There is no support in Congress  
for introducing forces on the ground in Kosovo to make the peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, said he thought both the Helms proposal and the 
McConnell-Lieberman bill were bad ideas. ``We should not be 
injecting such ideas in the middle of a military operation,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Haiti Appoints New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haiti's president created a  
government by decree today, a move aimed at ending nearly two years 
of political impasse and regaining the confidence of the United 
States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government will be able to organize elections in a  
country where allegations of fraudulent vote-counting and rigged 
ballots have prompted most parties to boycott the electoral 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Many major political parties objected to Rene Preval's move as  
dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is 95 percent within the sphere of influence of  
Preval'' and former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said Claude 
Roumain. He is the leader of one of five opposition parties that 
signed a March 6 pact approving the formation of a new government 
and provisional electoral council. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the parties has members in the new 15-member Cabinet.  
Nor does the Struggling People's Organization party, which held a 
majority in the previous Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet includes two ministers from the former  
government, Finance Minister Fred Joseph and Foreign Relations 
Minister Fritz Longchamps, and four who were ministers under 
Aristide, Preval's mentor and predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti has been without an effective government since June 1997,  
when Premier Rosny Smarth of the Struggling People's Organization 
resigned, charging Preval helped rig April elections to favor 
Aristide candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Smarth's party demanded new elections and a new electoral  
council, and rejected three of Preval's choices for premier to try 
to force him to act on their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Preval dissolved the Parliament by decree on Jan. 11,  
saying legislators' terms had expired, and appointed Premier 
Jacques-Edouard Alexis premier by decree. Under the constitution, 
Parliament is supposed to ratify the president's choice of a prime 
minister who is answerable to the Parliament, which can fire him. 
Now, he answers to Preval. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissed legislators have appealed to the international  
community not to recognize what Rep. Vasco Thernalan, former 
president of the Chamber of Deputies, called Alexis' ``de facto 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Preval has created a government that stands on no legal  
basis,'' former independent Sen. Samuel Madistin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United Nations and the United States, the main  
international players in Haiti who have been embarrassed by the 
unraveling of their project to build democracy in the Caribbean 
nation, likely will welcome today's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	International approval would unblock millions of dollars in  
much-needed foreign aid for Haiti, one of the poorest countries in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors scared away by the crisis likely will take a  
wait-and-see attitude. Most political parties have said they would 
boycott elections because they were not consulted about members of 
a new provisional electoral council that Preval appointed March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	They say they fear elections again will be rigged to ensure a  
victory for Aristide and his Lavalas Family Party. Legislative 
elections likely will be held this year. A presidential election is 
scheduled in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Preval was Aristide's premier in September 1991, when the army  
staged a bloody coup. Three years later, 20,000 U.S. troops 
intervened to restore the democratically elected government. 
Aristide backed Preval in 1995 elections because the constitution 
bars presidents from running for consecutive terms.

<HEADLINE> Maytag Introduces New Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- At a time when more and more Americans are  
relying on microwaves to prepare quick meals, Maytag Corp. is 
betting there are enough die-hard cooks who want a stove with two 
conventional ovens in their kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Thursday introduced a free-standing,  
standard-size, electric range with double ovens and a premium price 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranges typically feature a cooktop surface over a large oven  
with a drawer underneath for storage. Maytag's new Gemini range, 
named after the Zodiac sign for twins, has a cooktop surface, a 
large, standard-sized oven on the bottom and another independent, 
but smaller oven above that. 
</P>
<P>
	Both ovens can broil and bake and are self-cleaning. The upper  
oven also has an automatic setting to keep food warm after it is 
prepared and can act as a toaster oven. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gemini, which will be available in white, black and brushed  
chrome, will range in price from $1,399 to $1,499, depending on 
color, when it reaches stores in July. That is about double the 
$500 to $700 price tag of a single-oven range, but is below the 
cost of buying and installing a double-oven unit that is built into 
a wall, according to Maytag. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 85 percent of U.S. homes and more than nine out of 10  
homes in Canada have conventional, free-standing stoves with single 
ovens, said Bill Beer, president of Maytag's appliance unit. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Gemini is being billed as another time-saving idea for  
busy families, Beer concedes some people rely on a microwave or 
simply do not cook and may never want two ovens. But for those who 
do cook, Maytag hopes the Gemini will be a must-have item that will 
help encourage customers to upgrade appliances instead of waiting 
to replace them when they wear out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just going into people's homes and seeing the problems they  
encounter and the frustrations is what really gave us the idea,'' 
he said in an interview in advance of the product's introduction at 
a New York news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not provide details on how much it cost to  
develop the new range, but said it has invested $50 million over 
the last three years to come up with new products and revamp its 
line of kitchen appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Maytag chairman Leonard Hadley sees the Gemini as an example of  
the innovation required by today's competitive appliance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadley said the Gemini borrows from trends in Europe, where  
double ovens are more common than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's kitchen appliance brands are Maytag, Jenn-Air,  
Magic Chef and Performa by Maytag. It also owns the Hoover brand 
and makes Dixie-Narco vending machines.

<HEADLINE>  Haiti Appoints New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haiti's president created a  
government by decree today, a move aimed at ending nearly two years 
of political impasse and regaining the confidence of the United 
States and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new government will be able to organize elections in a  
country where allegations of fraudulent vote-counting and rigged 
ballots have prompted most parties to boycott the electoral 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Many major political parties objected to Rene Preval's move as  
dictatorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is 95 percent within the sphere of influence of  
Preval'' and former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said Claude 
Roumain. He is the leader of one of five opposition parties that 
signed a March 6 pact approving the formation of a new government 
and provisional electoral council. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the parties has members in the new 15-member Cabinet.  
Nor does the Struggling People's Organization party, which held a 
majority in the previous Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Cabinet includes two ministers from the former  
government, Finance Minister Fred Joseph and Foreign Relations 
Minister Fritz Longchamps, and four who were ministers under 
Aristide, Preval's mentor and predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti has been without an effective government since June 1997,  
when Premier Rosny Smarth of the Struggling People's Organization 
resigned, charging Preval helped rig April elections to favor 
Aristide candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Smarth's party demanded new elections and a new electoral  
council, and rejected three of Preval's choices for premier to try 
to force him to act on their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Preval dissolved the Parliament by decree on Jan. 11,  
saying legislators' terms had expired, and appointed Premier 
Jacques-Edouard Alexis premier by decree. Under the constitution, 
Parliament is supposed to ratify the president's choice of a prime 
minister who is answerable to the Parliament, which can fire him. 
Now, he answers to Preval. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissed legislators have appealed to the international  
community not to recognize what Rep. Vasco Thernalan, former 
president of the Chamber of Deputies, called Alexis' ``de facto 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Preval has created a government that stands on no legal  
basis,'' former independent Sen. Samuel Madistin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the United Nations and the United States, the main  
international players in Haiti who have been embarrassed by the 
unraveling of their project to build democracy in the Caribbean 
nation, likely will welcome today's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	International approval would unblock millions of dollars in  
much-needed foreign aid for Haiti, one of the poorest countries in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors scared away by the crisis likely will take a  
wait-and-see attitude. Most political parties have said they would 
boycott elections because they were not consulted about members of 
a new provisional electoral council that Preval appointed March 16. 
</P>
<P>
	They say they fear elections again will be rigged to ensure a  
victory for Aristide and his Lavalas Family Party. Legislative 
elections likely will be held this year. A presidential election is 
scheduled in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Preval was Aristide's premier in September 1991, when the army  
staged a bloody coup. Three years later, 20,000 U.S. troops 
intervened to restore the democratically elected government. 
Aristide backed Preval in 1995 elections because the constitution 
bars presidents from running for consecutive terms.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The nation's first Roman Catholic cathedral is  
to be restored and promoted as a national treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be the symbol of religious freedom in our land and  
our world, just as the U.S. Capitol is a symbol of political 
freedom in our land and our world,'' said Cardinal William H. 
Keeler, who is leading the restoration effort for the Basilica of 
the Assumption. 
</P>
<P>
	The Basilica of the Assumption Historic Trust plans to promote  
the cathedral as a national treasure -- the ``mother church'' of 
Catholicism in the United States. It was designed by Benjamin Henry 
Latrobe, architect of the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyer Blinder Belle of New York, which restored Grand Centeral  
Terminal and part of Ellis Island, and John G. Waite Associates of 
Albany, N.Y., which restored Mount Vernon and Monticello, are the

<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Charleston County Council violated the  
Constitution when it posted the Ten Commandments outside its 
chambers, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	R. Markley Dennis Jr. said the Constitution ``bans governments  
from appearing to take a position on questions of religious 
belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Sam Howell said the county would not appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an important ruling that sends a clear message that  
government cannot endorse religion by endorsing the Ten 
Commandments,'' said Ayesha Khan, an attorney for the Americans 
United for the Separation of Church and State. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, along with the American Civil Liberties Union,  
represented a group of local residents who sued the county after 
the plaque went up in May 1997.

	DENVER (AP) -- After two years of debate, First Plymouth  
Congregational Church has agreed to sanction same-sex marriages and 
to form a support group for homosexuals. It also undertakes not to 
discriminate against gays in church employment. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,400 members, First Plymouth is one of the largest in the  
United Church of Christ to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a big step down the road of compassion and  
justice,'' said the Rev. Scott Landis, the church's senior 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Church of Christ allows its regional units to  
determine whether their churches can ordain gays and whether 
ministers can officiate at same sex unions. Nationally, 273 of its 
6,100 congregations have voted affirmatively.

</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- St. John Vianney Theological Seminary will open in  
the fall to accommodate a growing number of men studying for 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
	The new seminary will be one of only 25 worldwide affiliated  
with the 200-year-old Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. Its 
scheduled opening comes four years after finances and plunging 
enrollment forced St. Thomas Seminary to close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Sam Aquila, secretary for Catholic education, will  
become rector. There will be 25 full- and part-time faculty 
members, including priests, members of religious orders and lay 
persons, Aquila said. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John will offer a six-year program to prepare students for  
priesthood. Initially about 50 seminarians will be housed on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Charles J. Chaput said 68 men from the Denver  
archdiocese are studying for the priesthood outside Colorado 
because no local training is available. In 1995, there were 29 
students from the archdiocese, which covers northern Colorado.

 *Creech calls for change    	
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Rev. Jimmy Creech says churches face upheaval  
if they continue to deny full rights to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	If the greater church resists, ``some new form of church is  
going to be born,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creech, who was denied a congregation after performing a lesbian  
wedding, spoke to the Asbury United Church on its third anniversary 
as a ``reconciling congregation'' open to anyone regardless of 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is times like these, that change is possible,'' he said,  
``and this is when God does God's work best, by using chaos to 
bring new things into being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creech praised Asbury as ``a vision of what the church is to be  
and is becoming -- an open and inclusive congregation where there 
are no barriers and no one is excluded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creech, 29, was suspended by his bishop after he performed a  
same-sex ceremony in 1997 at First United Methodist Church in 
Omaha, Neb. He was acquitted by the church's judicial council of 
charges he disobeyed the order and discipline of the denomination, 
but was not assigned another church. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that happens is how we selectively choose  
Scripture to validate our prejudices, validate that which we want 
to enforce,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports into the United States dropped  
below pre-1998 levels in February in the strongest sign yet that 
the U.S. industry's misfortunes may be easing, the Commerce 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments from Japan, one of the leading sources of foreign  
steel, were cut in half last month, compared with January. Imports 
of hot-rolled carbon steel, the chief subject of domestic 
producers' trade complaints, dropped 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now absolutely clear that Japan has not caused any  
injury to the U.S. steel industry,'' said Fujio Ono, a Japanese 
steel executive who heads the Japan Steel Information Center. 
``There is simply no justification for import restrictions of any 
kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total steel imports into the United States were at 2 million  
metric tons, 15 percent below the 1997 monthly average of 2.4 
million, according to the preliminary statistics released by the 
Commerce Department. Final numbers are due next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, February's declines -- the fourth consecutive month of  
reductions -- are not likely to end pressure for legislative quotas 
to curb low-priced steel imports blamed for thousands of layoffs 
and three U.S. company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must guard against being overly optimistic that these lower  
import levels will hold,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., 
chief sponsor of a Senate steel quota bill. ``If we back down now, 
there is every reason to believe that our trading partners will 
seize the opening and dramatically increase steel dumping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two other targets of complaints from U.S. steel producers,  
Russia and Brazil, posted slight increases in shipments in 
February. Russian shipments went up 17 percent, and steel products 
from Brazil increased 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has recently reached agreements with the United States to  
voluntarily curb shipments to avoid tariffs, but the deals have yet 
to take effect and have been criticized by the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil both face steel tariffs following Commerce's  
preliminary finding that they had illegally dumped hot-rolled 
carbon steel, a widely used product, in U.S. markets at prices 
below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports surged last year in the wake of the Asian economic  
crisis that lowered demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipments have been declining since November, when Commerce  
ruled that steel tariffs against Japan and Russia could be made 
retroactive to that month. Any tariffs against Brazil would go back 
to February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has pointed to the decline in imports  
as justification for resisting stronger sanctions, and Commerce 
Secretary William Daley said the latest numbers show that ``the 
administration's aggressive strategy ... is working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. industry considers President Clinton's response  
weak. Domestic producers fear that other countries will step in to 
fill the void on hot-rolled steel and that the targets of the 
dumping cases will simply shift to other products. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a quota bill last week with a lopsided 289-141  
vote despite the threat of a presidential veto. Senators from 
steel-producing states decided Tuesday to press ahead with the 
measure despite its likelihood of running afoul international trade 
agreements that restrict the use of quotas.

<HEADLINE> Source: NY Cops Charged in Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers who killed an unarmed  
African immigrant in a barrage of bullets were indicted Thursday on 
charges of second-degree murder, a source close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments come after days of protests outside police  
headquarters that brought hundreds of disorderly conduct arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who has knowledge of the still-sealed indictment,  
spoke to The Associated Press on condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers -- Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and  
Richard Murphy -- were indicted on second-degree murder charges and 
some were indicted on lesser charges, according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, 22, was killed Feb. 4 in the vestibule of his  
Bronx apartment building when the officers fired 41 bullets at him, 
hitting him 19 times. An attorney has said the officers -- who were 
looking for a rape suspect -- had thought Diallo was reaching for a 
gun, but later discovered the street vendor was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the officers have spoken publicly about the case and  
their lawyers said they declined to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, second-degree murder is used in most homicide cases  
and implies a degree of intent to commit a felony. It carries a 
maximum prison sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Police declined to comment Thursday evening. A spokesman for the  
Bronx district attorney also did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, the lawyer for Carroll, said neither he nor his  
client had been notified of the indictment, but added he was not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sure as I was that he was going to be indicted, that's how  
sure I am that he's going to be acquitted,'' Kornberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the other three officers did not comment, noting  
that they had yet to be contacted by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing has unleashed a wave of protests against alleged  
police brutality and angered critics who say police officers target 
and harass blacks and Hispanics. The four officers involved in the 
shooting are white; Diallo, who was from the West African county of 
Guinea, was black. 
</P>
<P>
	In three weeks, more than 800 people have been arrested,  
including former Mayor David Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel, rabbis, 
lawyers, labor leaders and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is also under investigation by the Justice  
Department's civil rights division.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Favored To Win Swim Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Although defending champion Stanford is  
favored in a bid for its ninth NCAA men's swimming and diving 
championship this week, the outcome is expected to be a lot closer 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford won last year's championship with 599 points to  
second-place Auburn's 394 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Auburn head the list of top contenders in the  
three-day competition that begins Thursday at the Indiana 
University Natatorium. Southern Cal and Tennessee are also among 
Stanford's major challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year we have the youngest team I've had in the 11 years  
I've been at Tennessee,'' said Volunteers coach John Trembley, who 
lost nine seniors from the team that placed fourth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Trembley anticipates a close battle among the five schools.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say that any one of the teams here could win the  
championship,'' Trembley said in reference to the five who attended 
the pre-meet news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers will depend on a team dominated by underclassmen  
as they seek a fourth consecutive finish in the top five. The group 
is topped by sophomore Michael Gilliam, who finished sixth in the 
100 backstroke as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of senior leadership,'' said Gilliam, who this  
year joined his father and brother in the list of Southeastern 
Conference swimmers who have won championships in the backstroke 
for Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	USC coach Mark Schubert is hoping the Trojans start competing  
here with momentum from the Pac-10 Championships, which Stanford 
won for the 18th consecutive year. The Cardinal finished less than 
eight points ahead of archrival California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team probably swam as well at the Pac-10 Championships as  
we have over the last six years and we got third,'' Schubert said. 
``We've got good sophomores and freshmen, particularly sophomore 
sprinters ... who have given us the best relay teams we've had in 
five or six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas will also depend heavily on underclassmen.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably the youngest team I've ever had, perhaps one of  
the most talented,'' said Texas coach Eddie Reese, who has won six 
NCAA titles and finished in the top five 19 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meet puts a different slant on things,'' Reese said.  
``When you walk out on that deck ... and they get that first heat 
of the 200 free relay up there (the opening event), it gets a 
little bit tougher. It is a great opportunity to find out who your 
fighters are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal have dominated the sport this decade with four  
championships since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford's bid will be led by senior Tate Blahnik, who edged  
world champion Lenny Kruzelburg of USC for the 200 backstroke 
championship last year. Other defending champions competing include 
Arizona's Ryk Neethling, who claimed the 200, 500 and 1,650 
freestyle events last year, and Florida State's Brendon Dedekind in 
the 50 free.

	``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  
Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as 
Henderson's trial opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  
brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in  
the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual questioning of potential jurors continued today  
behind closed doors. Officials said about 30 people would be 
questioned. Outside the courthouse, clearly marked protest areas 
were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Henderson and McKinney are accused of first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in an attack that led to demands 
for stronger hate-crime laws around the country. McKinney's trial 
is scheduled for August. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs asked prospective jurors not to punish his client for the  
sake of redeeming this small town's image in the eyes of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel  
guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he said. ``The 
press wants us to think that we are somehow responsible for what 
went on October 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha told the potential jurors that Shepard  
was ``not the same as you and I'' but that every individual should 
be treated equally under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  
convicted. Authorities said the pair pretended to be homosexual and 
lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a downtown bar before 
they beat him and then left him lashed to a fence in a remote area 
east of town. The University of Wyoming student died five days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, remained mostly impassive during the  
first day of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 15 of 71 prospective jurors in the first  
pool had been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the session, Skaggs put his arm around Henderson and told  
the jurors: ``This is not a defendant, not a person, but a real 
live living human being. Can all of you give him a fair shot?''

<HEADLINE>  Microsoft Sends Settlement Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A formal proposal by Microsoft Corp. to settle  
its landmark antitrust case is receiving a cool reception from the 
government, with one official describing it as a ``minimalist 
opening offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which made the overture Wednesday, is refusing to  
accept any restrictions on what new features it can add to its 
dominant Windows operating system software. Experts believe any 
settlement is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, was expected to  
visit Washington today as part of a previously scheduled tour to 
promote his new book. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, attorneys general from the 19 states suing Microsoft  
also are meeting here for their annual conference, and they planned 
today to discuss the company's offer privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates said he wants to reach a compromise but called it ``a  
little hard to speculate'' whether a deal is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to settle the thing,'' Gates said Wednesday in New  
York. ``If there's any reasonable way to settle this thing that 
preserves our ability to make Windows a better product, to keep 
supporting the Internet more and more, then we'd love to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who discussed  
Microsoft's proposal with Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, 
described it as ``a minimalist opening offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was far from what anyone in our group would expect to be  
adequate,'' said Lockyer, who hasn't yet read the settlement offer. 
A spokesman for Miller declined to comment. The Justice Department 
also declined to comment on Microsoft's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Any settlement is viewed as unlikely because the two sides  
remain far apart on core issues after almost five months of 
acrimonious courtroom fighting. The trial is tentatively scheduled 
to resume April 12, but both sides consider themselves under orders 
from the judge at least to explore a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The government faces genuine risks as it sits across the table  
from the technology industry's most famous titan. Gates was 
thinking moves ahead of government lawyers in a previous court 
fight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft then proposed agreeing never to require customers of  
its popular Windows software to buy any of its other products. But 
the company's lawyers also considered adding a provision that 
Microsoft would never be blocked from ``developing integrated 
products which offer technological advantages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates ordered his lawyers to remove the last four words, a  
subtle change but one so important that it would return to haunt 
the government years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice accepted the provision as part of a 1995 consent decree,  
and Microsoft later claimed the language allowed it to bundle its 
Internet software into its Windows operating system -- a core 
complaint in the government's current antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, whose software runs roughly 90 percent of the world's  
personal computers, has indicated it would consider changing some 
of its most controversial agreements with the nation's computer 
makers and Internet providers. But it won't accept restrictions on 
what new features it can add to its Windows software, echoing 
Gates' insistence during the 1994 negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Microsoft uses its market dominance  
to maintain its monopoly power and to extend its influence into 
emerging areas of technology, such as Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a few key principles at stake,'' Gates said  
Wednesday. ``Our ability to innovate our product, our ability to 
support the Internet in the right way and to have integrity in our 
Windows product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An effort to reach a compromise last May broke down, and  
Microsoft already has started to formulate plans to appeal a trial 
verdict.

<HEADLINE> Deer DNA Used To Nab Poacher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rapists and murderers aren't the  
only ones who can get tripped up by DNA evidence. Wildlife 
officials used deer DNA to catch a poacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Bernard York, 38, pleaded guilty Wednesday to illegally  
possessing meat from two whitetail does. The meat was found in his 
pickup truck Dec. 21 at a wildlife area where the taking of female 
deer is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	York had claimed the meat came from a buck. But researchers at  
the University of Florida analyzed DNA from the meat to determine 
the species, sex and geographic location of the deer. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time genetic analysis was used to convict a  
poacher in Florida, said Maj. Jim Ries of the state Game and Fresh 
Water Fish Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	York was fined $1,661 and his hunting license suspended for  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could've beat it if I had taken it further,'' he said. ``I  
didn't have the time and money. I was in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. It's embarrassing.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Confirms Global Bond Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Finance officials confirmed Thursday that  
Mexico has placed $1 billion in global bonds on international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonds mature in six years and offer an annual interest rate  
of 9.75 percent, or 4.45 percentage points over U.S. Treasury 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This price is a result of the improved perception that foreign  
investors have of Mexico's economic prospects,'' the Finance 
Secretariat said in a statement. It said the rate of interest was 
more than a percentage point below that offered on a similar bond 
placement Mexico made in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the bond placement would allow the  
government ``to continue with the prudent management of its 
external public debt'' and ``confirms the public sector's access to 
external financing sources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funds obtained will be used to refinance maturing debt  
obligations.

<HEADLINE> NSP, New Century To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Northern States Power Co. is merging with New  
Century Energies Inc. of Denver in a $4.85 billion deal, creating a 
huge utility company covering 12 Western and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, announced today, comes nearly two years after  
federal regulators scuttled Minneapolis-based NSP's proposed merger 
with Wisconsin Energy Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company, with headquarters in Minneapolis, would have  
revenues of $6.4 billion based on last year's results. A name for 
the new company has not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This merger combines two well-managed, mid-continent electric  
and gas companies in order to provide a strong platform for 
assuring low-cost, quality service to the region during a time of 
rapid change in the utility industry,'' said James Howard, 
president, chairman and chief executive of NSP. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said they expect the merger to yield net cost  
savings of about $1.1 billion in the first 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will serve 3 million electricity customers and  
about 1.5 million natural gas customers in Arizona, Colorado, 
Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will have operations in the United Kingdom, Central  
Europe, Australia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 63, will serve as chairman for the first full year of  
operations. Wayne H. Brunetti, vice chairman, president and chief 
operating officer of New Century, will be president and CEO when 
the deal closes and will take Howard's duties when Howard retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill D. Helton, chairman and CEO New Century, will retire when  
the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The distance between the two companies' service territories is  
likely to present some logistical difficulties, but the lack of 
overlapping territories also is likely to preclude the kind of 
regulatory and consumer concerns that helped derail NSP's deal with 
Wisconsin Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSP-Wisconsin Energy deal was called off in May 1997 after  
the two companies had spent more than two years and $50 million 
planning how they would combine operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of today's deal, New Century shareholders will  
receive 1.55 shares of the merged company's stock for each of their 
shares, while NSP shareholders will get one share of the new 
company for each share. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is  
expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete.

<HEADLINE> Rice Extract Lowers Cholesterol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A rice extract that was unsuccessfully  
challenged by the government because it closely resembles a 
prescription medicine has been shown to be a powerful means of 
lowering cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of one of the first two U.S. studies of the  
substance, called Cholestin, were presented Thursday in Orlando at 
a medical conference sponsored by the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	It showed that people with mildly elevated levels can drop their  
cholesterol about 35 points by taking four capsules of Cholestin a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin is made from red yeast that has been fermented on  
rice. Its chief ingredient is a naturally occurring form of 
lovastatin, a prescription cholesterol-lowering medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin's introduction in 1997 blurred the already fuzzy line  
between food supplements, which can be sold without a prescription, 
and drugs that require approval of the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA declared Cholestin to be an unapproved drug and  
attempted to block its sale. Cholestin's manufacturer, Pharmanex 
Inc. of Simi Valley, Calif., sued and won. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a federal judge in Salt Lake City ruled that  
Cholestin fits the definition of a dietary supplement and can stay 
on the market. The FDA has not said whether it will challenge that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, all of the data on Cholestin's health effects have  
come from China, where the rice extract has been used for centuries 
as a spice in such foods as Peking duck. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Dr. David Heber of the University of California at  
Los Angeles published a report in the American Journal of Clinical 
Nutrition on 83 volunteers. He found that eight weeks of Cholestin 
lowered their cholesterol an average of 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study was directed by Dr. James Rippe of Tufts  
University School of Medicine in Boston and found similar results. 
Doctors in 12 medical practices across the country put 233 people 
on Cholestin for eight weeks. Their cholesterol levels fell from an 
average of 242 to 206. 
</P>
<P>
	Both studies were financed by Pharmanex, and both Heber and  
Rippe are members of the company's medical advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a promising new development worthy of further  
research,'' said Dr. Thomas A. Pearson of the University of 
Rochester, speaking for the heart association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he cautioned against going on Cholestin without getting  
a doctor's advice. ``This should be integrated into the overall 
care plan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lovastatin, sold by Merck Inc. as Mevacor, was the first of a  
powerful new class of cholesterol-lowering medicines known as 
statins. The smallest lovastatin pill on the market is 10 
milligrams, while a daily four-pill regimen of Cholestin adds up to 
5 milligrams of lovastatin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cholestin can be bought without a prescription, but the price is  
similar to Mevacor. A month's supply of Cholestin costs about $30. 
A month of 40 milligram Mevacor pills costs about $150. But these 
pills can be cut into four pieces, bringing a 10 milligram-a-day 
dose down to $37 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rippe said many people may prefer Cholestin because it is  
a natural rather than synthetic form of the drug, and it offers one 
more option for those who need to lower their cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying, `Eat a cheeseburger for lunch and than take  
Cholestin,''' he said. ``It should be used in conjunction with 
exercise, diet and weight reduction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmanex's sponsorship of scientific research to back up its  
health claims is relatively unusual among supplement makers. 
Another study nearing completion will look at the effects of 
Cholestin when eaten in a twice-daily power bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The company recently was bought by Nu Skin International of  
Provo, Utah. Nu Skin is withdrawing the supplement from chain 
drugstores and will sell it exclusively through mail order and 
independent pharmacies.

<HEADLINE> Bush Navigates Tricky Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Gov. George W. Bush begins to navigate the  
slippery shoals of presidential politics and flesh out his 
positions, he's finding that social issues are proving particularly 
hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	How else could the Texas Republican explain the criticism in  
recent weeks over his pronouncements on abortion, gay rights and 
hate crimes? 
</P>
<P>
	Considered the early front-runner in a crowded field of  
Republican hopefuls, Bush must engage in a delicate balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
	On the one hand, he must articulate views that appeal to the  
social conservatives whose sway is felt most in the GOP primary 
process. Yet he cannot afford to alienate moderates, without whom 
he cannot hope to win in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush himself realizes the difficulty of the task. ``I don't  
expect to get everybody's vote should I decide to run for the 
presidency,'' he told Texas newspaper executives this week, 
shrugging off criticism about his stance on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an important issue. It's not the only issue,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, abortion isn't the only hot-button issue that Bush has  
tackled lately. 
</P>
<P>
	His stated ambivalence toward hate-crimes legislation making its  
way through the Texas Legislature and opposition to adoption by 
gays and lesbians has stirred criticism from civil-rights and 
gay-rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a kinder and gentler form of bigotry,'' said Dianne Hardy  
Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Lobby of 
Texas. ``But it's bigotry nonetheless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush waded gingerly into the fractious debate over abortion  
earlier this month, after announcing formation of his presidential 
exploratory committee, activists in both camps found room for 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	His unwillingness to rule out abortion in cases of incest, rape  
or when the mother's life is threatened earned him the wrath of 
some anti-abortion leaders, who refuse to bestow the ``pro-life'' 
label on him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, an abortion-rights group is running television  
ads in Iowa and New Hampshire accusing Bush and Elizabeth Dole, who 
also is considering a presidential bid, of soft-peddling their 
``extreme views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks from both sides may help Bush, who calls himself a  
``compassionate conservative,'' build an appeal to mainstream 
voters, some say. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the activists on the left and right who want a candidate  
to adhere completely to their agenda, he will not be their 
candidate,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political 
scientist. ``But he never had any chance of getting their vote 
anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other prospective Republican candidates are competing  
for the social conservative vote, including former Vice President 
Dan Quayle, businessman Steve Forbes, TV commentator Pat Buchanan, 
social activist Gary Bauer and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush ``is not necessarily going to be (social conservatives')  
favorite candidate. What he's aiming for is acceptability,'' said 
John Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing politically sensitive topics this early makes sense,  
some analysts suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing here is the equivalent of a distant early  
warning system,'' said Pitney. ``It's much better for him to deal 
with the controversy now than have it erupt in the middle of the 
primary season. Because now, he can get a sense of where the 
criticism is going to come from and who his friends and opponents 
are going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And by tackling touchy issues early on, Bush is inoculating  
himself against trouble down the road, Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to get it out of the way now,'' Sabato said.  
``Then later on you can say `We've already had that discussion. 
It's old news.'''

the government years later.

<HEADLINE>  Feds Cool to Microsoft Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A formal proposal by Microsoft Corp. to settle  
its landmark antitrust case is receiving a cool reception from the 
government, with one official describing it as a ``minimalist 
opening offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which made the overture Wednesday, refuses to accept  
any restrictions on what new features it can add to its dominant 
Windows operating system software. Experts believe any settlement 
is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, in a speech  
today at Georgetown University as part of a previously scheduled 
tour to promote his new book, joked with students about dropping 
out of Harvard University when he was young. He discussed ways 
technology can make companies more efficient, and didn't address 
the trial or any settlement prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, attorneys general from the 19 states suing Microsoft  
also are meeting here for their annual conference, and discussed 
the company's offer privately for more than one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	When they emerged, New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid  
said negotiations between the government and Microsoft will begin 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates has said he wants to reach a compromise but called it ``a  
little hard to speculate'' whether a deal is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to settle the thing,'' Gates said Wednesday in New  
York. ``If there's any reasonable way to settle this thing that 
preserves our ability to make Windows a better product, to keep 
supporting the Internet more and more, then we'd love to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who discussed  
Microsoft's proposal with Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller,

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 126.82 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly today, led by  
technology and financial shares, as strong earnings reports gave 
Wednesday's late rally some staying power. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 126.82 at 9,793.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, heavily weighted with technology issues,  
was up 48.99 at 2,414.27. The S&AMP;P 500 index was up 16.59 at 
1,285.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks rose after a report late Wednesday from  
semiconductor maker Micron Technology that it turned a profit in 
its second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, and its  
stock was down 3 5/8 at 48 3/8. But the rest of the technology sector was 
higher. Dow component IBM was up 1 3/8 at 170 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares were sharply higher after America Online and  
eBay formed a marketing alliance. AOL rose 8 5/8 at 125 11/16 on the 
New York Stock Exchange, and eBay was up 14 19/32 at 159 31/32 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks were stronger after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  
posted first-quarter profits of $1.76 per share, far above the 
$1.34 expected by analysts. Morgan Stanley's shares were up 4 3/16 
at 102 9/16 and pulled other financial services stocks with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financials overall, and the broker dealers in particular, have  
been hot,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; 
Co. in boston. ``And it's a healthy sign in the market to have the 
technology leadeship at least shared by the financial sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 4.99 Wednesday to 9,666.84, declining for the  
fourth straight session amid concerns that first-quarter earnings 
reports would be disappointing. NATO's bombing of targets in Kosovo 
also put a lid on prices. But stocks recovered late in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported unemployment claims fell last  
week, and the National Association of Realtors said sales of 
existing homes remained near record high levels in February. 
Neither report appeared to affect stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP;  
Co., said the overall outlook for earnings and the situation in 
Kosovo are still important concerns. ``I still think the market's 
suspect here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues had an 8-to-5 lead on decliners on the NYSE,  
where volume came to 528.23 million shares, up from Wednesday's 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO air strikes 
on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets relaxed after early anxieties over the military  
action, and made a strong comeback after a generous interest rate 
cut by Sweden. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.68 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hearns To Fight Miller in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Thomas ``Hit Man'' Hearns, winner of major titles  
at five different weight divisions since 1977, will make his 
British debut next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearns, who is 40 years old, will fight former WBA champion Nate  
Miller in a cruiserweight fight April 3 in Manchester. The bout is 
being billed as a title fight by the International Boxing 
Organization and will be on the undercard of Naseem Hamed's WBO 
featherweight title defense against Paul Ingle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearns, along with Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard and  
Marvelous Marvin Hagler, were the boxing stars of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hearns' career suffered after he lost his WBA  
light-heavyweight title to Iran Barkley in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He came out of retirement last year in quest of a cruiserweight  
title, which would be his eighth world title. He held various 
championships in the welterweight, middleweight, light heavyweight 
and super-middleweight divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his age, Hearns is expected to undergo strict medical  
tests by the British Boxing Board of Control before the fight goes 
ahead.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Restrict TV Ride-Alongs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cops who bring ``COPS'' must be more careful.  
</P>
<P>
	New guidelines by the Los Angeles Police Department bar  
television camera crews that tag along with police from entering 
homes or other private property without permission from the owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules apply to reality-based entertainment shows like Fox's  
``COPS'' as well as news programs, police Cmdr. David Kalish said 
Wednesday. The entertainment programs face another hurdle: News 
crews are likely to get priority on ride-alongs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We encourage media participation,'' Kalish said. ``Obviously,  
it's important in a democracy to have an informed public. But we 
have to prioritize and, quite frankly, reality-based TV would not 
be as high a priority as news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV crews may still film public incidents, Kalish said.  
</P>
<P>
	The issue of privacy and whether police officers can take TV  
cameras and other news media into homes during an arrest or search 
is currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Arguments in two cases were held before the court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles officials asked the department to clarify its policy  
about media ride-alongs following lawsuits involving the syndicated 
series ``LAPD: Life on the Beat'' and the Spanish-language program 
``Placas'' (``Shields''). 
</P>
<P>
	John Langley, creator and executive producer of the Fox series  
``COPS,'' said Wednesday he had no plans to work with the Los 
Angeles police. There are alternatives, including the Sheriff's 
Department and other cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may film in Albuquerque. We may film in Minneapolis. We're  
a road show,'' Langley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, which has featured a variety of law enforcement  
agencies in its 11 years, last worked with the L.A.P.D. several 
years ago, he said.

<HEADLINE> Black Workers Sue Mitsubishi, UAW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Black workers were harassed and passed over  
for promotions and training at a Mitsubishi auto factory that 
recently settled two major discrimination cases, according to a 
federal lawsuit filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil rights lawsuit also accuses Mitsubishi Motor  
Manufacturing of America Inc. and the United Auto Workers union of 
ignoring the workers' complaints of discrimination at the Normal, 
Ill., plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 workers named in the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court  
in Peoria say they were put on heavy labor assignments despite 
medical conditions such as back injuries and were harassed by 
co-workers and supervisors with racist graffiti, name-calling and 
degrading jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the factory opened in 1987 as Diamond-Star Motors  
Corp., a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, black 
workers have been subject to ``extreme, cruel and outrageous'' 
conditions, said Michael Riley, the Peoria lawyer representing the 
factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Mitsubishi said it did not tolerate  
discrimination but did not comment directly on the allegations. 
Mitsubishi spokeswoman Gael O'Brien said the company hasn't had 
time to review the lawsuit and couldn't comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company did release an internal memo, given to  
Mitsubishi workers Thursday, that claims an independent evaluator 
recently judged that the company has an effective system to handle 
internal complaints about discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no place in our work force for anyone who doesn't  
understand that racial discrimination or discrimination of any kind 
is morally and legally wrong,'' Rich Gilligan, Mitsubishi vice 
president, said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	United Auto Workers representatives did not return telephone  
messages left at local, regional and international offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The union was named in the lawsuit because of its negligence in  
handling the workers' complaints of harassment, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would complain to their union representative  
repeatedly, and (the union) would not go beyond that initial 
complaint,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims officials of Local 2488 also called the  
plaintiffs -- all factory workers -- by racist names. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the carmaker agreed to a record $34 million deal to  
settle the claims of 350 women that they were sexually harassed on 
the factory floor. And in September, the company agreed to pay $3 
million to settle the complaints of 87 people who claimed they 
weren't hired because of their disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	In both those cases, Mitsubishi also agreed to change how it  
does business, from how it hires people to allowing an outside 
monitor to evaluate internal policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's lawsuit does not ask for a specific amount for  
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't put a dollar amount in the complaint,'' Riley said.  
``I think that's something best left to a judge.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Disease Resistance Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Genetic resistance bred into wheat crops 40  
years ago has begun to break down, resurrecting the threat of crop 
plagues not seen since the last major outbreak in the United States 
in the 1950s, a nonprofit wheat group said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A new, mutated form of the stem-rust fungus -- a disease that  
virtually disappeared from the face of the Earth after destroying 
as much as half of wheat yields decades ago -- reappeared several 
weeks ago at an experimental farm in the rainy highlands of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	The reappearance of the wind-borne spores, which corrode the  
plants' stems, threatens a genetic fix introduced during the 
``Green Revolution'' in the late 1950s and early 1960s, scientists 
from the Mexico City-based International Wheat and Maize 
Improvement Center said. The nonprofit group discovered the fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	They made the announcement as U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman prepared to unveil the U.S. Plan for Food Security on 
Friday, and said they plan to ask U.S. aid officials to help fund 
an emergency monitoring and research program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resurgence of stem rust in Uganda is alarming because it  
signals the breakdown of a resistance gene that protects wheat in 
many countries,'' said Timothy Reeves, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
	Most affected would be eastern and southern Africa, where many  
crops depend solely on the sr-31 resistance gene. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sr-2 gene complex, used throughout much of the rest of  
the world and which is still able to prevent the fungus, may not 
work as effectively against the mutated spores. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major outbreak, which occurred in the United States in  
the mid-1950s, destroyed up to 50 percent of wheat crops on many 
U.S. farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said research is needed using new biotechnology methods,  
like molecular marking, to understand the sr-2 resistance and 
possibly develop more defenses against crop diseases like stem 
rust, leaf rust and yellow rust. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is sure: The spores won't stay on the African savanna  
where they first appeared. ``It'll move,'' Reeves said. ``It will 
travel.''

<HEADLINE> House GOP Pushes 2000 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are driving toward passage  
of their first budget in an era of government surpluses, a plan 
crafted to buttress Social Security and raise Pentagon spending 
while leaving room for sizable tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats charged in advance that the GOP would shortchange  
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make every effort to try to lock up the  
surplus in payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare,'' House 
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, said Wednesday on 
the eve of debate on the House floor. ``Our tax cut doesn't come 
from Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The budget lays out priorities and sets guidelines for spending  
and tax bills to follow later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As such, it marks a critical early test for the slender 11-vote  
Republican majority and the new House speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert 
of Illinois. Hastert has labored intensively in recent weeks to 
line up the support needed to approve the tax and spending plan. He 
mollified one powerful potential GOP defector, Rep. Bud Shuster of 
Pennsylvania, only hours before debate began, and in a gesture of 
bipartisanship, promised a group of moderate Democrats the House 
would vote on their alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.74 trillion Republican blueprint for fiscal 2000  
envisions a surplus of $141.4 billion. The government ran a surplus 
last year for the first time in three decades, triggering a debate 
over how to allocate the money suddenly available by the tens of 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the GOP plan calls for setting aside $1.8 trillion  
in surpluses through 2009 to pay down the federal debt, a step 
designed to strengthen Social Security. In theory, debt reduction 
would lead to a stronger economy and more government revenues to 
pay retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security aside, the GOP budget would boost defense  
spending to $289 billion, $9 billion more than this year and $8 
billion more than President Clinton has proposed. It would also 
increase spending for primary and secondary schools by more than $2 
billion next year, and provide more for some agriculture and 
veterans programs. Other programs would have to be cut to keep 
Congress from breaking spending caps put into place in the 1997 
balanced budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan envisions a tax cut of $15 billion next year and  
$778 billion over the next decade. Republicans argued they had set 
aside more money for Social Security than Clinton and had provided 
money for a more generous tax cut, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued those tax cuts would benefit the wealthy at the  
expense of Medicare and other domestic programs. ``Your tax cut 
gets bigger and bigger as time goes on and it takes huge cuts out 
of all of these accounts, including defense,'' Rep. John Spratt, 
D-S.C., told Republicans at a House Rules Committee hearing that 
offered a preview of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar charges were leveled on Wednesday in the Senate, which  
conducted its own budget debate during the day. ``The Republican 
budget is a thinly veiled assault on Medicare,'' charged Sen. 
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``It proposes to sacrifice the future of 
Medicare in order to finance a tax cut for the wealthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rite of spring that originated when Democrats controlled  
Congress and Ronald Reagan was in the White House, Senate 
Republicans demanded a vote on Clinton's budget so it could be 
repudiated. It was, 97-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also took a second slap at the president, voting 99-0  
for a nonbinding provision expressing opposition to his proposal 
for the government to invest some Social Security funds in the 
stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Republican leadership narrowly averted an  
embarrassing defeat on legislation that would provide $1.3 billion 
in aid for Central America, U.S. farmers and others. The measure 
passed on a vote of 220-211, and GOP leaders worked frantically to 
round up support after the regular 15-minute voting period had 
elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton vowing a veto, most Democrats voted against the  
bill, objecting to some of the spending cuts Republicans proposed 
to offset the spending. A band of conservative Republicans was 
upset that not all the new spending was offset by cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrow escape illustrated the difficulties confronting  
Hastert and the slim GOP majority over the next two years if they 
bring measures to the floor that do not attract substantial 
Democratic support. Thus, Hastert met separately during the day 
with Clinton at the White House and with moderate Democratic 
lawmakers.

<HEADLINE> IRS Easing Installment Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP)-- The nation's tax collector is taking a softer  
stance on millions of Americans without the money to pay their tax 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of collecting nothing from people with an unpaid tax  
bill, we're able to collect something,'' Internal Revenue Service 
Commissioner Charles Rossotti said Thursday. ``And for taxpayers 
facing severe hardship, we'll work with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change stems from last year's IRS reform law, which eased  
numerous requirements so taxpayers can work out installment plans 
and, in some cases, settle large debts by offering a lower 
compromise payment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, IRS agents are being trained to try harder to work  
things out with taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, we asked them to go out and protect the  
government's interest,'' said Harry Manaka, IRS chief of 
collections. ``Now, we're telling our people that customer service 
and the need to protect taxpayer rights always trumps the need to 
collect money when they come in conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many taxpayers do not have the money to pay Uncle Sam but are  
not doing anything wrong. Accountants give one primary piece of 
advice: file the tax return by April 15 no matter what to avoid IRS 
late penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, for the first time, the IRS is permitting taxpayers  
to pay with several popular credit cards: American Express, 
Mastercard or Discover. Visa decided to sit out this year to see 
how the program went. 
</P>
<P>
	But paying with plastic means a steep interest rate, sometimes  
18 percent or higher. A bank loan is an alternative, but people who 
cannot get that either may turn to the IRS for an installment 
agreement at an interest rate now at 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning this year, the IRS is guaranteeing that a taxpayer  
with a debt of $25,000 or less will be able to pay in installments 
for up to five years with little extra paperwork. Previously, the 
debt was $10,000 with a three-year payment window. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers who get these installment agreements will avoid an IRS  
lien, which drastically can affect a person's credit and ability to 
get loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the incentive of the government to ruin anybody's  
credit,'' Manaka said. ``As long as a taxpayer is current, our 
incentive is to allow the payments to continue without filing a 
lien.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, under the old rules, 2.8 million taxpayers had IRS  
installment plans to pay their taxes. But some people have tax 
liability too high to pay that way, particularly those involved in 
difficult situations such as a failing business or a messy divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	For those taxpayers, the IRS has a program called ``offers in  
compromise'' in which payment for a lower amount is negotiated with 
the agency. For years, however, the program had stringent paperwork 
requirements that frequently meant people got turned down, even if 
the problem were something as simple as a missing signature. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, only 25,052 out of 105,255 offers were accepted.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were very, very finicky about only accepting what we  
considered perfect offer forms. We would reject them before we even 
started to look at the merits,'' Manaka said. ``Now, our intention 
is to work with the taxpayer and try to perfect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the IRS is expanding the financial data its agents  
will use to determine a proper tax payment compromise, such as a 
person's future earning power. Only agents trained specifically in 
negotiating these deals will handle them, instead of the 
jack-of-all-trades approach of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Brand, a former IRS compliance chief now with the KPMG  
accounting firm, said the new offer-in-compromise system should 
``at least make sure the person gets a fair hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an expectation that the IRS treat people with more  
concern about the total impact of these actions on their lives,'' 
Brand said. ``What you're trying to do is turn the individual into 
a compliant taxpayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS reform law also set up new appeals rights and other  
protections for people who find themselves owing taxes, such as a 
requirement that a judge give permission before the agency tries to 
seize someone's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest key is changing the attitude of IRS agents.  
Manaka said that will take time, but the agency has instituted a 
new system of grading performance that moves away from dollar and 
numerical collection goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to involve the taxpayer more and listen to the  
taxpayer,'' he said. ``That is a major change in philosophy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From its earliest days, Christianity has  
proclaimed that Jesus rose from the grave, bodily, and that those 
who believe in him will live eternally, also bodily. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics have always said that's impossible. And while ordinary  
churchgoers may not know it, many liberal Christian theologians 
believe Jesus lived on after death as a spiritual, but not 
physical, presence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the anthology ``The Resurrection'' (Oxford University Press),  
several philosophers at secular universities apply tools of modern 
logical analysis to support belief in Christ's bodily resurrection. 
Those who want to rethink Easter in depth will find they write 
refreshingly clear prose, as philosophers go. 
</P>
<P>
	The anthology stems from a 1996 ``Resurrection Summit'' at the  
New York Catholic archdiocesan seminary. The most striking of the 
18 papers come from three philosophy professors: William P. Alston 
of Syracuse University, Stephen T. Davis of Claremont McKenna 
College and Richard Swinburne of Oxford University. 
</P>
<P>
	Alston confronts liberal theologizing as typified by the Rev.  
Reginald Fuller, professor emeritus at Virginia Theological 
Seminary. Fuller, an Episcopalian, has written that Jesus' Easter 
restoration was not as a visible, bodily being. He thinks the 
``materializing'' of the risen Christ was something Christians 
developed later. 
</P>
<P>
	In his rebuttal, Alston, who is no fundamentalist, grants some  
New Testament material could have been made up later. And he 
acknowledges there are contradictions in the accounts of the empty 
tomb and the appearances of the risen Christ, particularly 
regarding time and place. 
</P>
<P>
	But he concludes it's reasonable to believe there were bodily  
appearances of Jesus of the general sort the four Gospels report. 
To him, arguments like Fuller's are speculative and produce 
conclusions that are ``arbitrary in the extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A typical Fuller argument: Paul's writings mention no Easter  
appearances. Alston objects, saying we don't have everything Paul 
wrote. Why assume that the surviving epistles covered everything 
important? 
</P>
<P>
	Liberal critics typically apply a ``dissimilarity'' principle,  
saying a Gospel report is most trustworthy when it differs from the 
viewpoint of ancient Judaism and the early church. Alston thinks 
that's like future historians rejecting the authenticity of any 
statements of Martin Luther King that agreed with the civil rights 
movement, before and after he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' essay asks: Did the original witnesses to the risen  
Christ see his body as a material object through normal eyesight, 
or did they have a subjective vision with no body present? 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting the subjective approach, Davis notes that Jesus was  
not seen just by people who believed he had risen. ``Doubting 
Thomas'' is a famous example (John 20:27-9), but Jesus' brother 
James was probably a skeptic, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Some modern theologians suppose ``first century folk were almost  
pantingly eager to believe in resurrection and other miracles,'' 
Davis comments. But ``they were as convinced as we are that dead 
people stay dead.'' The disciples certainly did not expect to see 
Jesus alive again. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Davis admits, Jesus made no ``grandiose appearances to  
the general public.'' So the testimony came only from Christian 
insiders. 
</P>
<P>
	He thinks the strongest argument for normal sight is the  
physical detail in the appearance accounts. The Gospels say Jesus 
showed his hands, feet and side; spoke; walked; distributed food; 
ate; and was touched. From early days, New Testament readers 
accepted the plain sense of these accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis concludes that anybody would have seen the resurrected  
Jesus. ``A camera could have taken a picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swinburne looks more generally at the philosophical issue of  
evidence. Most of our beliefs about the world are based on what 
others claim they perceived, he says. We assume people normally 
tell the truth, and we can't possibly check out every report for 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Easter depends on indirect testimony. The Gospel writers  
recorded traditions from the original witnesses about the empty 
tomb and Jesus' appearances. Discrepancies cast some doubt on those 
records, says Swinburne, but skeptics cannot explain why the 
witnesses would have given false testimony. Nor can they cite any 
contradictory testimony, such as claims that anyone saw Jesus' 
corpse. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the issue of ``background evidence,'' our  
assumptions about what normally happens -- for instance, that under 
the laws of nature the dead don't rise again. 
</P>
<P>
	Swinburne looks to other background evidence. If God exists,  
especially an all-powerful God who occasionally intervenes in 
history, the laws of nature depend on him and can be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Swinburne has long argued that in fact there's good reason to  
believe in God, and he laid this out in ``Is There a God?'' 
(Oxford). His evidence: a highly complex universe, natural laws 
that are almost invariable, the providential ordering of the 
universe and widespread religious experience. 
</P>
<P>
	If one includes God in the background evidence, ``the historical  
evidence is quite strong enough'' and it's probable, Swinburne 
says, that Jesus actually rose from the grave. 
</P>
<P>
	Swinburne proposes a separate piece of historical evidence, the  
universal custom of Sunday worship, starting with very early Jewish 
Christians. The only way to explain their switch from Saturday is 
some big event occurring on Sunday, such as finding the empty tomb 
or seeing the risen Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	So if you're a Christian and attend worship Easter Sunday,  
Swinburne thinks you'll be adding your own tiny bit of evidence to 
this perennial argument.

<HEADLINE> Slain Woman May Be Linked to Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The body of a woman was found west of  
Yosemite National Park on Thursday and the FBI was trying to 
determine if she was one of three tourists who disappeared six 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed that the woman was the victim of a homicide  
but her identity was not immediately determined, FBI spokesman Nick 
Rossi said. Officials would not say how she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found near a reservoir along one of the fastest  
routes from El Portal, where the three tourists were last seen. 
Nearby is Sierra Village, where the burned bodies of two victims 
were found in the trunk of their rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is also about halfway between El Portal and Modesto,  
where victim Carole Sund's billfold was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, her teenage daughter Julie, and Silvina Pelloso,  
a young family friend from Argentina, were last seen Feb. 15 at a 
restaurant just outside the western gate of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, two bodies were found in the torched shell of the  
rental car. One body was identified as Mrs. Sund's. Investigators 
were using DNA samples to try to determine the identity of the 
second victim.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Appoints New CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines' parent company on Thursday named  
a company insider as chief executive, keeping a veteran at the helm 
as the airline begins to consider renewing its employee ownership 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	James E. Goodwin, who just six months ago was appointed UAL  
Corp.'s president and chief operating officer after 32 years with 
the company, now is faced with trying to satisfy both Wall Street 
and the carrier's unions in coming months as the nation's airlines 
struggle to keep costs low and profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	Retiring Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald Greenwald, the  
former Chrysler Corp. executive who brought United an unprecedented 
five-year era of labor peace, said Goodwin was chosen after a 
five-month search that included discussions with a number of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we proceeded, it became clear to us that Jim was the  
template against which we were measuring everyone else. He emerged 
as the gold standard,'' Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Julius Maldutis at CIBC Oppenheimer said United's board  
members likely agreed there was no sense in rocking the boat and 
bringing in an outsider at a key juncture. The majority-employee 
ownership plan is set to expire in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an environment where management-labor conflicts are the  
norm, airlines ... that have labor peace are valued at a premium,'' 
Maldutis said. ``Mr. Goodwin has demonstrated the capability to 
work cooperatively and constructively with organized labor, which 
will help remove the uncertainty about a new (employee stock 
ownership plan) within the next several months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently liked the choice; shares of UAL rose  
$3.31 1/4, or 4.5 percent, to close at $76.81 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 54, in September replaced John Edwardson as president  
and chief operating officer. Edwardson departed abruptly in the 
face of union opposition to his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers were concerned Edwardson would be more inclined to cut  
wages and benefits than Greenwald, and they had been pressing 
company executives to create a search committee to find an outside 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Union opposition to a successor would not necessarily block an  
appointment, but the Machinists union and the Air Line Pilots 
Association own a majority of the stock in UAL and have board 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said Greenwald's successor has tough shoes to  
fill, particularly since the new chief executive will be faced with 
high labor costs, which account for about 35 percent of the 
airline's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main challenges I see ahead are meeting the needs of an  
increasingly sophisticated customer on a global basis and building 
upon the strides we have made already to improve the relationship 
among management, unions and all employees,'' Goodwin said in a 
statement. A spokeswoman said Goodwin would be unavailable for 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier faces huge costs in  
coming years as it either unwinds its employee majority ownership 
plan or renegotiates a new one -- a reason the airline's stock has 
lagged despite solid performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin has experience in operations, marketing, finance and  
international work. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts said at the time of Goodwin's appointment  
as president that it was unlikely he would eventually be named 
Greenwald's successor. But in the past few months, Goodwin has 
impressed both pilots and machinists with his knowledge of the 
company and willingness to work with both on all issues. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, America West recently rejected a United takeover  
offer in part because of United's insistence that the deal be 
contingent on its pilots unions' approval.

<HEADLINE> USDA Unveils Child Food Pyramid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department on Thursday  
released a simplified and jazzed up version of the much-used food 
guide pyramid in hopes of improving children's eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary Dan Glickman, surrounded by more than two dozen  
pre-schoolers, said the new version is intended for youngsters age 
2 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The nutritional advice does not differ from the original food  
pyramid. But the new guide features bright colors, graphics of 
children exercising, foods they like to eat and materials they can 
understand -- for example, simplified food group names, as well as 
shortened and single numbers for servings rather than a range of 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the milk group, of which children are recommended  
to have two servings daily, has a glass of milk with yogurt, 
pudding, ice cream and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	The fruit group, which also recommends two servings, shows a  
picture of strawberries, an apple, a fruit cup and a boxed fruit 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key message of the children's pyramid is variety,''  
Glickman said. ``There are no 'good' foods or 'bad' foods. 
Healthful diets depend on choosing a wide variety of foods of all 
types: grains, vegetables, fruits, meat and dairy products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original food pyramid, released in 1992, has a black  
background and features terms like dry beans and fats and oils. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's pyramid comes at a time when 20 percent of  
American children are categorized as obese, Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is kind of nutritional guidelines for kids to follow when  
their young so they can keep going down that road as they get 
older,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department hopes companies, many of which now use the  
original pyramid on cartons of cereal and other foods, also will 
feature the children's pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the department's endorsement of the new design, some  
activists questioned whether the children's pyramid would send the 
wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indirectly I think it does recommend hamburgers and ice cream  
and higher fat by showing them in the pyramid as the ideal diet,'' 
said Margo Wooten, senior scientist with the Center for Science in 
the Public Interest. ``Why not clearly mark the milk as 1 percent 
milk?''

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Tests Plastic Bottle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. is selling Budweiser and  
Bud Light beer in 16-ounce plastic bottles in a test in Dallas and 
Phoenix following a similar test last summer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The new packaging -- an alternative to the traditional aluminum  
can or glass bottle -- is being sold primarily in convenience 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Brewing Co., the nation's No. 2 brewer, has been selling  
beer in plastic bottles in similar market tests since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Hoffman, director of Budweiser marketing for Anheuser-Busch,  
said last year's test in New York showed that consumers preferred 
plastic bottles at places like beaches and pools, where glass is 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will determine the long-term recycling viability of the  
bottle,'' as part of the Dallas and Phoenix tests, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plastic bottles being used by both Anheuser-Busch and Miller  
are resealable. Both use a three-layered recyclable plastic that 
prevents absorption of oxygen, which would affect freshness. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller spokesman Scott Bussen said Wednesday that the plastic  
containers were getting a good reception from retailers and 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is selling Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft and Icehouse  
in plastic 16-ounce, 20-ounce and 1-liter bottles. Testing has been 
expanded to seven cities, Bussen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bussen said the plastic bottles are no cheaper to make than  
glass bottles. Beer has been available in plastic bottles in Europe 
and Australia for years.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Fall by 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans claiming unemployment  
benefits fell to the lowest sustained level in a quarter century 
while sales of existing homes remained near record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 289,000 Americans filed applications for  
unemployment checks last week, down 10,000 from the week before, 
the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors said Americans  
purchased existing homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.02 million in February, down just 0.4 percent from a record 5.04 
million pace in January and the third consecutive month above the 5 
million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the eighth consecutive week of jobless claims below  
300,000, the longest such stretch since 1973. It demonstrates the 
strong demand for labor in the U.S. economy even in the face of the 
nearly two-year-old world economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate survey shows factories have cut 337,000 jobs since  
March 1998, but apparently laid-off workers are finding jobs in 
service industries, which have been hurt less by international 
conditions than export-dependent manufacturing companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a flurry of layoff notices late last year, companies  
appear to be managing expenses without widespread layoffs,'' said 
economist Lynn Reaser of Bank of America Private Bank in 
Jacksonville, Fla. ``Indeed, many companies are struggling to fill 
various positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a private New York-based research  
organization, said its index of help-wanted advertising fell 
slightly in February from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``there is no suggestion that demand for labor will  
slacken,'' said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. ``Tight 
labor market conditions remain firmly in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plentiful supply of jobs is among the factors supporting  
home sales, along with low mortgage rates and high stock prices. At 
mid-morning, the Dow Jones average of industrial stocks had risen 
130 points to 9,797, partly recovering from a 222-point loss on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Home resales last month were strongest in the South, up 4.1  
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.05 million. Sales 
rose 2.8 percent in the Northeast to a rate of 730,000. They fell 
0.9 percent in the West to 1.07 million and 7.8 percent in the 
Midwest to 1.18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Realtors' economist James F. Smith said inclement weather  
temporarily depressed sales in parts of the Midwest and West. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no regions of the country that could be described as  
weak,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the median price of an existing home -- meaning half  
sold for more and half for less -- was $129,300 in February, up 3.9 
percent from a year ago. By region, the median price was $112,100 
in the South, up 1.4 percent; $152,300 in the Northeast, up 4 
percent; $174,800 in the West, up 7.2 percent, and $112,300 in the 
Midwest, up 5.9 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Hershiser Joins Mets for $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Mets decided they'd rather have Orel Hershiser than Hideo  
Nomo, and the former Cy Young Award winner decided New York had a 
chance to get into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old right-hander, who went to spring training with  
Cleveland, agreed Thursday with the Mets on a $2 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn $500,000 more in 
performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said during a news conference 
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Florida, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs also sought  
Hershiser. He would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract 
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. Indians manager Mike 
Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's rotation 
but was willing to keep him as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem we had here all along is that we didn't have an  
open spot for him in the rotation,'' Indians general manager John 
Hart said. ``We were not going to take any of our starters out of 
the rotation. Orel knew that. We addressed it with Orel. We would 
have liked to have had him here as a protection guy, it would have 
been a great fit for us. In reality, Orel got a nice contract with 
a team that has a chance to win and he's going to get the ball 
every five days. So I'm happy for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser made his Mets debut Thursday night pitching two  
shutout innings in New York's 5-0 win against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent Nomo, another  
former Los Angeles Dodgers star, outright to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine appeared to be upset at the  
demotion, saying Wednesday he had told his players not to worry 
about their performance in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine softened his tone Thursday but clearly remained upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``As down as I was yesterday over  
losing a player that I had a lot of sweat equity in and a guy I was 
pulling for to do well, I'm even higher that than today knowing one 
of the greatest competitors and one of the best pitchers I've ever 
seen is lined up on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 
11-10, with a 4.41 ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser has a 190-133 career record and admits he'd like to  
win at least 10 more to reach 200 and improve his chances of being 
elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major league record 
with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was MVP of the NL 
championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Valentine, but general manager Steve Phillips 
made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances.	   If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A Norfolk, the team would save 
Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he does report, the Mets will 
probably place Nomo on unconditional release waivers next Wednesday 
and give him only 45 days' termination pay, $719,262.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves 2000 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans overpowered Democrats in both  
houses of Congress Thursday to win approval for their ``budget for 
the new millennium,'' a blueprint designed to showcase support for 
Social Security, the Pentagon and a new round of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued that the GOP-backed tax reductions in the  
packages would favor the wealthy at the expense of the long-term 
health of Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate passage of the $1.74 trillion spending plan for the 2000  
fiscal year came on a 55-44 vote after two days of debate that 
centered on priorities for the enormous surpluses that are forecast 
for the next several years. Republicans unanimously voted yes; Sen. 
John Breaux of Louisiana was the only Democrat to cross party lines 
and support the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the House ratified a similar spending plan on a vote of  
221-208. All but two House Republicans voted in favor. Only four 
Democrats supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote in the House marked a triumph for the new speaker, Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, who had made its passage the top priority of his 
early months as leader of the slender Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., said the GOP prescription ``saves more for  
Social Security and Medicare than the president's budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, it ``provides for common-sense tax relief in the  
future. We have the largest surplus in history, which means the 
taxpayers are being overcharged,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats labored throughout the day and night to raise  
questions about the prudence of the GOP tax cut plan. The final 
attempt, a bid by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to hold the cuts in 
abeyance each year until surpluses materialize, fell when all 
Republicans opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement  
describing the GOP blueprint as a ``series of missed 
opportunities.'' The tax and spending plan did not ``do enough to 
pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers will meet next month to iron out relatively minor  
differences between the House and Senate versions. Congress will 
then spend the balance of the year working on spending and tax 
bills to carry out the policies embedded in their economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget, which sets guidelines for tax and spending bills  
later in the year, would be the first to be written by Congress 
since the government entered a new era of surpluses. And while 
House and Senate plans differed in detail, they had common 
priorities and served as the focus for a fierce partisan debate 
over Social Security, Medicare and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget  
Committee, said the plan could ``not only preserve Social Security 
and Medicare,'' but emphasize defense and education. ``We also 
believe the American people ought to be empowered, the American 
people ought to have more money in their pockets,'' he said, 
referring to almost $800 billion envisioned for tax cuts over the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we project a budget for the new millennium that is  
right in pace'' with what the public wants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a letter from the chief actuarial  
expert at the Social Security agency, who wrote that the House GOP 
plan would do nothing to extend the life of the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``They choose the tax cuts over extending the solvency of Social  
Security and Medicare,'' charged Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri. He said a Democratic plan of smaller, targeted tax cuts, 
would be fairer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bewildering mountain of budget statistics, each side found  
fine print to buttress their claim to being the stronger defender 
of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, for example, said they would put aside the entire  
Social Security surplus for debt reduction. They also won a letter 
of praise for their approach to Social Security and Medicare from 
the American Association for Retired Persons, the nation's largest 
advocacy group for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered that over 15 years, their plan would set  
aside more money for Social Security and Medicare than the GOP 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the plans presented for debate provided any specific  
changes in Medicare or Social Security. Instead, they earmarked 
hundreds of billions of newly available surplus funds for debt 
reduction, a step designed to strengthen the economy and make it 
easier for the government to pay benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the House plan called for $1.74 trillion in spending  
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and forecast a surplus of 
$141 billion. The Senate proposal would spend $1.74 trillion and 
produce a $135 billion surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans would cut taxes next year by up to $15 billion and  
by $778 billion over the next decade. While the budget outlined no 
specifics, key Republicans have talked in terms of reducing the 
so-called marriage penalty or reducing tax rates as possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, President Clinton's budget, submitted to Congress  
earlier in the year, called for spending of $1.79 trillion and 
would leave an $80 billion surplus. Clinton called for tax cuts 
totaling $81 billion through 2009 -- but he recommended increasing 
tobacco and other taxes by $178 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In other areas, Clinton would spend $281 billion next year for  
defense, compared with $289 billion by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans matched Clinton's proposal for education and  
job training, exceeding the House total by $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget had scant support in either house of Congress,  
so much so that the House buried it, 426-2, with one lawmaker 
voting present. The Senate rejected it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary votes on the House floor, two separate Democratic  
alternatives were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	One called for smaller tax cuts than the GOP plan and more money  
for selected domestic programs. Supporters said it also would 
extend the life of Social Security until 2050 and of Medicare until 
2020. It failed on a vote of 250-173. 
</P>
<P>
	The second, crafted by a group of moderate to conservative  
Democrats, set aside more money than any other alternative for debt 
reduction and had the smallest tax cuts. It was rejected, 295-134. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar debate unfolded in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	There, Republicans rejected an effort by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
D-Mass., to reserve 15 percent of the surplus for Medicare, as 
Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushed through a measure directing the Finance  
Committee to consider a Medicare reform plan pushed by Breaux, 
chairman of a Medicare commission that recently deadlocked. ``Let's 
quit talking about Medicare,'' said Senate Budget Committee 
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. ``Let's fix it.''

<HEADLINE>  Hershiser Joins Mets for $2 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Mets decided they'd rather have Orel Hershiser than Hideo  
Nomo, and the former Cy Young Award winner decided New York had a 
chance to get into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old right-hander, who went to spring training with  
Cleveland, agreed Thursday with the Mets on a $2 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn $500,000 more in 
performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said during a news conference 
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Florida, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs also sought  
Hershiser. He would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract

<HEADLINE> Starr Juror Speaks Out on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The forewoman of the grand jury that  
investigated the Monica Lewinsky case says she believed President 
Clinton behaved badly in his personal life and she would have voted 
to indict him for perjury if prosecutors had asked her to. 
</P>
<P>
	But Freda Alexander, who stepped from behind the grand jury's  
wall of secrecy on Thursday and spoke openly about her 18-month 
experience on the panel, said she sympathized with Clinton and 
believed his personal failings should not have become public or led 
to his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was personal and of a civil nature,'' Ms. Alexander said in  
an interview with The Associated Press. ``He didn't do anything 
that I can see that took away my liberty or was a crime against the 
state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander said the panel's work -- hearing from a parade of  
witnesses, some weeping at times -- was emotionally intense. She 
defended Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr but said she sometimes 
felt sorry for Ms. Lewinsky and presidential secretary Betty Currie 
as they were pressed to testify about the president. She portrayed 
Linda Tripp, the co-worker who turned Ms. Lewinsky in to 
prosecutors, as determined to damage Clinton and gather material 
for a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors are forbidden by law from disclosing what goes on in the  
grand jury room. But Ms. Alexander, 46, said she felt she could 
talk about the Clinton case because so much of it was made public 
following Starr's report to Congress. She said she might even write 
a book. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander said Clinton was not honest with the grand jury  
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She was offended by his 
assertion that ``a reasonable person'' would define sexual 
relations only as intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had asked if he committed perjury, I would say yes,''  
Ms. Alexander said. Still, she believes seeking an indictment would 
have been ``overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's a man supposed to do, when they're trying to protect  
their family and not hurt innocent people?'' she asked. 
</P>
<P>
	She believes there was not enough evidence for a criminal  
indictment of Clinton for obstructing justice by covering up the 
affair -- the other charge considered in the Senate impeachment 
trial along with perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Ms. Alexander, who is divorced and has two sons in  
their 20s, said it was proper for the grand jury to investigate the 
Lewinsky matter and that Starr unfairly was demonized for doing his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Ken Starr is the devil incarnate. I think it's  
very sad that he's been put in that role,'' Ms. Alexander said. 
Instead, she blamed the independent counsel law for giving too much 
power and unlimited money to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alexander, who is black, said investigating the president  
was ``very difficult'' for her because she ``had a very high 
regard'' for Clinton for appointing minorities to high-level 
administration jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she believed Ms. Lewinsky paid a high price for  
youthful mistakes. The former White House intern's testimony about 
being confronted by Starr's prosecutors was so moving -- ``there 
were very few dry eyes'' in the room -- that Ms. Alexander gave her 
a hug at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ross, a criminal defense lawyer and expert on grand  
juries, called it ``a little bit of a shock'' that Ms. Alexander 
discussed the case and said the fact that much of the panel's work 
has been disclosed publicly does not necessarily free her from 
adhering to secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr sent Congress a report and three volumes of supplemental  
information about the investigation, including transcripts of grand 
jury testimony. The House released the information publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jurors' names are not released by federal courts. Ms.  
Alexander was first identified in USAE, a weekly newspaper covering 
conventions and hotels, which published a story saying she was 
suing a hotel that fired her during her grand jury service. She 
would not comment on the lawsuit.

	Russia Won't Use Force Against NATO  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today that Russia  
will continue its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Kosovo 
conflict and will not use force to counter NATO attacks against 
Yugoslavia. Instead, Moscow called for an urgent U.N. Security 
Council vote today to stop NATO attacks. A Russian call for a 
council meeting on Wednesday failed to halt the bombings. When the 
attacks began yesterday, Yeltsin said Russia was halting 
cooperation with NATO and pulling out of the alliance's Partnership 
for Peace.

	Yugoslavia Attacked by NATO Forces

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Claiming it suffered minimal damage  
from an assault intended to force it to make peace with rebels in 
Kosovo, Yugoslavia defiantly absorbed its first night of punishment 
from NATO air power. But bombardment early today emphasized that 
this was only the beginning. Across Yugoslavia, forces of eight 
NATO nations struck military bases, factories and air defenses with 
cruise missiles and aircraft, including the U.S. B-2 stealth 
bombers, which made their combat debut. NATO said all aircraft 
returned safely, rejecting Yugoslav claims that two planes had been 
shot down.

	1st Lady Backs Clinton on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	LUXOR, Egypt (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton said today she  
concurs with her husband's assessment that NATO bombing in 
Yugoslavia is justified to ``avert a broader humanitarian crisis.'' 
The U.S. first lady addressed the subject briefly while attending 
the opening of a medical clinic. ``As my husband, the president, 
explained last night to the American people, the United States and 
its NATO allies have acted to stop the brutal killings of people in 
Kosovo and avert a broader humanitarian crisis,'' Mrs. Clinton 
said.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has asked the  
United States to submit a formal proposal for postponing a 
Palestinian declaration of statehood and setting a new deadline for 
a final peace agreement with Israel, a senior PLO official said. 
Arafat made the request in his meeting with President Clinton 
earlier this week in Washington, said the senior PLO representative 
in Washington. The Maariv daily said today that Clinton would write 
a letter to Arafat soon and propose to extend the Palestinian 
period of autonomy for a year, to May 2000. This would also become 
the new deadline for a final peace accord with Israel, the paper 
said.

leader made a sudden peace overture, a rebel leader said today. 
Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic 
Coalition, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba had won 
Kabila's agreement to meet the rebels for the first time since they 
took up arms in August, backed by troops and arms from Rwanda and

the Finance Ministry doesn't yield to workers' wage demands, the 
Histadrut Trade Union Federation warned. Another attempt at talks 
between the Histadrut and the Finance Ministry broke down

</P>
<P>
	Like most players on tour, he's not about to lump the Players in  
with one of golf's most time-honored tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to compare apples to oranges,'' Leonard  
said. ``But this is one hell of an orange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Players tournament, which began today with Leonard trying to  
defend his title, has provided its own special moments over a 
shorter period. And it seems only the most seasoned players have 
been able to muster a victory here recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington and Greg Norman are among  
those to win the tournament at the 6,896-yard Stadium Course at 
Sawgrass this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as the course, with its signature 17th par-3 island  
hole, it is the field, the timing and the stakes that set this 
tournament apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I probably put it right where everyone else does, as  
the fifth most important tournament you want to win,'' said the 
tour's hottest player, David Duval, who grew up just a long iron 
away in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is getting closer and closer to being thought of as a  
major, but isn't quite there. But I think certainly as the players 
see it, it is awful close in their eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine of the top 50 players in the World Golf Rankings  
thought so. Only 14th-ranked Jumbo Ozaki chose to skip it. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is a $900,000 first prize and $5 million in total prize  
money, tying this with The Tour Championship in October as the 
richest regular tournament on tour, majors included. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory also brings with it a five-year tour exemption, a nice  
gesture, but one few of these players would need. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the idea of gaining momentum with the Masters just  
two weeks away, although most golfers shy away from drawing a 
direct correlation between tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good form guide,'' England's Lee Westwood  
said. ``But it doesn't really matter, does it? It's not like you 
carry this week's score into The Masters. But, yeah, similar kind 
of greens. There will be similar speed by the end of the week, 
similar firmness, I would imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With very little rain over the last week, the greens were  
running slick on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Course managers tinkered with some areas of rough, after  
whispers that parts of the course might have played too easily in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But hardly any player would agree that this course, or this  
tournament, needs toughening. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard had what he called ``a nice cushion'' going into the  
final three holes last year and ended up beating Glen Day and Tom 
Lehman by two strokes apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the big lead, the finish was unnerving.  
</P>
<P>
	``It could take you an hour to play that 17th hole,'' Leonard  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes players must bring the same mindset into this  
tournament as they would at a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``This golf course plays like a major championship course -- it  
is firm, there is a lot of rough and the greens are fast and 
wherever you hit it is trouble,'' Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	One other hint.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some timely 30-foot putts seem to work fairly well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Considering Interim Admissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- College basketball coaches haven't  
heard the last from the NCAA on freshman eligibility standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the sanctioning body said Thursday that emergency  
legislation is an option if a federal judge doesn't grant a stay of 
a court ruling striking down minimum SAT and ACT scores for 
incoming athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said an appeal of the March 8  
decision could take until October. But a ruling on the stay is 
expected before the spring recruiting signing period begins on 
April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many of the nation's coaches welcomed the ruling,  
administrators say dropping minimum admissions standards 
established under Proposition 16 will open the door for widespread 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``My best speculation is we will have certainly some interim  
legislation,'' Dempsey said during a news conference at Tropicana 
Field, site of the men's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find very little interest within the association not to have  
national legislation and procedures. I think most people have felt 
that it has been beneficial to intercollegiate athletics to have 
some form of initial eligibility requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, two of the nation's top coaches said while they  
welcomed the court ruling. Louisville's Denny Crum and Kansas' Roy 
Williams nevertheless agreed there is a need for some sort of 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Crum said he would favor allowing each school to determine its  
own admission policy, noting the NCAA already has a rule in place 
requiring an athlete to make satisfactory progress toward a degree 
to retain eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every school is different. Every school has a different  
mission. Every school isn't the same,'' Crum said. ``To pose the 
same initial eligibility standards when every school is different 
and have different missions, to me, is not right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also feels the ``satisfactory progress'' rule makes  
initial eligibility requirements less important than when 
Poposition 16 was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not knowledgable enough to know exactly what we should  
have. I know I am not in favor of what we've had because the test 
scores are biased,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the satisfactory progress rule ... if a kid is not  
progressing to that area where he should be as a sophomore, junior 
or senior, he's not going to be playing anyway. So you as a coach 
have to be very careful the type of student-athletes you're going 
to bring in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey wouldn't speculate about specific guidelines the NCAA's  
board of directors is considering for interim legislation. One 
thing he doesn't forsee, though, are schools being given the green 
light to set their own standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``One advantage of being my age is I was there when we didn't  
have it. You have to remember why we got involved heavily into 
initial eligibility and continuing eligibility requirements,'' 
Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were under seige at that point in the early '80s with  
exposes on student-athletes who were in college and couldn't read, 
those who were used in a sense for four years and never made 
progress toward a degree. We had some serious issues at that 
point.''

<HEADLINE> Proscutors Question Susan McDougal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Prosecutors prodded Susan McDougal to  
acknowledge today that she was far more involved in her husband's 
Whitewater business deals with President Clinton than she has let 
on from the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Mark Barrett zeroed in on detailed answers that Mrs.  
McDougal gave in 1986 to an auditor hired by the McDougals' former 
savings and loan to look into its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett said Mrs. McDougal gave the accountant information about  
a proposed shopping center development south of Little Rock that 
her husband, James McDougal, and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy 
Tucker were involved in. Mrs. McDougal said she didn't remember 
what she told the auditor but probably got the information from her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett noted the report said Mrs. McDougal had said she dealt  
personally with the shopping center project, which was a key issue 
in the 1996 trial in which she and McDougal were convicted of 
fraud. ``I don't remember,'' Mrs. McDougal answered. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Barrett began his questioning Wednesday afternoon, Mrs.  
McDougal has said more than 40 times that she does not recall 
various business deals. She said her husband, now dead, handled 
most of the financial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't someone who studied business ... but generally I  
agreed with Jim,'' she said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal also said she had only a vague recollection of a  
utility company owned by the McDougals, even though prosecutors 
showed a check recording a five-figure real estate commission for 
the sale of the utility payable to Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	In many instances, she said, real estate commission checks  
payable to her actually went to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal got into several contentious exchanges Wednesday  
with Barrett, prompting U.S. District Judge George Howard to 
admonish her twice to answer questions directly and refrain from 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Ken Starr had a plan and it was to convict me so that  
he could then get testimony against the president,'' Mrs. McDougal 
said, in response to a question from Barrett about the 1996 trial 
in which she was convicted of four felonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr didn't pick the 12 jurors,'' Barrett snapped.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal responded that it was Starr's office that put on  
``perjured'' testimony by prosecution witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett had Mrs. McDougal review the many ways she was  
associated with the people or businesses that Starr was authorized 
to investigate in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Her connections, she acknowledged, included her marriage to  
McDougal, their ownership of Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan, their 
partnership with Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in 
the Whitewater real estate venture, and her receipt of a fraudulent 
$300,000 loan in 1996 that was used in part to benefit Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI agent has linked the $300,000 loan to a $27,600 loan made  
in Clinton's name that was used to pay off Whitewater debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal is charged with two counts of criminal contempt  
and one count of obstruction of justice for refusing to answer 
grand jury questions in September 1996 and again in April 1998. She 
already has served 18 months in prison on a civil contempt citation 
imposed on her by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals and Tucker were convicted of fraud in 1996 in the  
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal testified that after that trial, in which she and  
her ex-husband were convicted of multiple felonies, James McDougal 
tried to persuade her to say she had an affair with Clinton so 
Starr's office could ``get'' the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim told me ... `You don't have to say that Clinton  
pressured''' a Little Rock judge to make the $300,000 loan that 
benefited Whitewater because `you can just say you had a sexual 
affair with Clinton,''' Mrs. McDougal told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged that McDougal, who subsequently died in prison, told  
her that a Starr associate, Hickman Ewing ``believes he can get 
Clinton on a sex charge before the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the federal courthouse, Ewing took issue with her  
testimony. ``That's outrageous. I never said anything like that,'' 
he said. ``I'm positive nobody else said anything like that.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Heads to New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- A truck loaded with radioactive waste  
began a historic journey to the nation's first nuclear waste dump 
Thursday amid the cheers of supporters and jeers of protesters 
gathered along the route. 
</P>
<P>
	Fog had delayed the scheduled shipment from Los Alamos National  
Laboratory, but shortly before 8 p.m. the big rig pulled out, 
beeped its horn twice and began its 270-mile journey south to the 
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad. The driver gave a 
thumbs-up, and the crowd of about 100 people cheered in response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have it underground than sitting on the tarmac  
somewhere,'' lab worker Hugh Rich said of the waste. 
</P>
<P>
	But down the road in Santa Fe, a hub of anti-WIPP sentiment,  
dozens of protesters lined the waste route holding up placards that 
read, among other things, ``Stop Nuke Trucks'' and ``Science or 
Science Fiction?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artist Nomi Green held her 4-year-old son Isaac and said: ``I  
believe this is wrong, but a person's just got to stand up and say 
what they believe. ... I feel very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first shipment from Los Alamos to the $1.8 billion  
repository follows 25 years of studies, protests and lawsuits. The 
appellate court in Washington, D.C., and a federal judge in Santa 
Fe on Wednesday rejected three last-ditch appeals from 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's shipment consisted of about 600 pounds of waste --  
plutonium-contaminated trash including clothing, gloves, booties, 
filters, coveralls, plastic covers and metal cans. Most of the 
material is from the lab's manufacture of nuclear batteries used in 
NASA deep space probes, such as the Voyager missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, there will be about 37,000 shipments of material  
from the nation's weapons work to fill the repository's underground 
storage rooms and become entombed by salt over the next 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Explains Reasons for War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With maps to show Americans where the war is,  
President Clinton invoked the national interest and the cause of 
future peace to tell them why it is. 
</P>
<P>
	He seeks and he needs to enlist the nation in support of the  
U.S.-led air raids that were exploding against Serbian targets in 
defense of Kosovo, even as he spoke Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's nationally televised address, his first on the Balkan  
crisis, came six hours after the NATO raids began -- an air campaign 
with no end date. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration needs public backing to sustain it, and to  
keep at it, especially if American airmen are killed over what used 
to be Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems remote, and Clinton came late to the task of bringing  
it home as an operation serving U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 15-minute summation of what he's been saying piecemeal and  
to Congress, Clinton said ``our mission is clear,'' to demonstrate 
the NATO commitment to peace so that Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic will back down and accept a settlement with Kosovo 
Albanians, to deter Serb offensives in Kosovo and ``if necessary, 
to seriously damage'' the Serbian military. 
</P>
<P>
	That could take time, especially if the defiant Milosevic stays  
that way and NATO persists to the third aim, essentially, 
undermining his military forces, not only blocking them in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A geography lesson came with the policy address: Kosovo is 160  
miles from Italy, 70 miles from Greece, marked on the TV map with a 
big red arrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Another map, with red dots on the ethnic Albanian towns the  
Serbs have attacked, and arrows showing the movement of fleeing 
refugees. Clinton used that one to make the point that the conflict 
could spread to other nations, as wars have widened from the 
Balkans before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let a fire burn here in this area and the flames will  
spread,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd said Tuesday that his policy was ``the best of a lot of bad  
alternatives,'' a bit of candor he dropped in making his case on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
	There's already skepticism enough. Certainly in the Senate,  
where a resolution authorizing air and missile strikes was approved 
after Clinton had said it was going to happen. Until then, 
Republicans were threatening to balk at the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Congress, they're always wary of anything that might seem  
to deny support to U.S. forces committed to conflict abroad. So the 
Senate voted 58-41 on Tuesday to OK air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	The House didn't deal with the policy, but voted to salute and  
support the U.S. forces carrying it out. The vote Wednesday night 
was 424-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Those resolutions, like others adopted before in times of  
conflict and crisis, are not binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, like all post-World War II presidents, maintains that  
he does not need congressional authorization to use U.S. forces 
abroad, but welcomed the support. Just as George Bush did after a 
52-47 vote for his Persian Gulf War policy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the House guardedly approved Clinton's plan to  
send 4,000 American troops to join a planned NATO peacekeeping 
force in Kosovo. That is moot at this point because Milosevic 
blocked the settlement, Serbia pressed its Kosovo offensive, and 
that triggered the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that if there is a peace accord, he'd send American  
forces to help enforce it. ``But I do not intend to put our troops 
in Kosovo to fight a war,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The path to this crisis began six months ago, with a cease-fire  
agreement that didn't hold. But Clinton had other problems at that 
point -- scandal, impeachment and Iraq -- and the administration 
didn't do much to explain the Balkan threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, on Dec. 17, two days before the House impeached him, the  
president ordered air strikes in another theater, against Iraq for 
Saddam Hussein's interference with U.N. inspections designed to 
deny him weapons of mass destruction. Those air strikes were 
limited, three days of raids by U.S. and British warplanes. There 
is still a low profile air war over Iraq; allied planes enforcing 
no-fly zones there have hit anti-aircraft and radar sites with more 
than 250 missiles and bombs, inflicting more damage than the 
initial round of raids. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no American casualties, no downed planes, no  
fliers lost or captured over Iraq. So there has been little notice 
of those operations at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Casualties change attitudes, and sometimes affect policy. Even  
with the warnings of risk from Clinton and the Pentagon, losses 
over Kosovo would make more difficult the president's effort to 
rally and sustain support for a faraway conflict. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> LPGA: Webb Confident at Dinah Shore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Karrie Webb rides a crest of  
confidence into the Nabisco Dinah Shore, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb has won three of the six LPGA tournaments she's played,  
including last weekend at Phoenix. She finished second in another 
event, and seventh and eighth in her two others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I couldn't have more confidence because of the way  
I've started,'' the 24-year-old golfer from Australia said. ``It is 
pretty unbelievable. I hope it carries into this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, Korea's Se Ri Pak, England's Laura Davies and Sweden's  
Annika Sorenstam, Helen Alfredsson and Liselotte Neumann provide 
the Dinah Shore, the women's first major of the year, an 
international flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	While Webb is the favorite because of her great start, any one  
of that group has to be considered a top contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak won four tournaments in 1998 on the way to earning Rookie of  
the Year honors, and two of those titles were in majors -- the LPGA 
Championship and the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be her first time in the Dinah Shore, and she hadn't  
even seen the Mission Hills Country Club course until this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play last year because I was a rookie,'' she said.  
``This is a big event. Because I never saw the course before, I'm 
busy practicing. The fairways are narrow and I think I have to play 
smart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I had a very good year, but everything is still  
new. I want to learn more and see more and practice more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, 21, said her first year a learning experience in more ways  
than one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was tired. My mind was always on too many things,'' she  
said. ``In 1999, I want to take care of myself, 50 percent for 
myself and 50 percent for practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defending champion, however, is an American, former San Jose  
State NCAA champion Pat Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with facing an extremely competitive field, Hurst might  
find it difficult to repeat for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm almost six months pregnant,'' Hurst said. ``I notice I get  
tired coming down the last three or four holes. That's to be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``My swing is a little rusty, but I'm looking forward to this  
week. We'll see how it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst, 29, hasn't cut down on her schedule. She has played in  
seven tournaments this year and hopes to keep going through the 
Titleholders event May 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
	The due date for her child, the first for her and husband Jeff  
Heitt, is late May. Hurst plans to take four months off before 
returning to the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my only major this year, so hopefully I'll go out with  
a bang,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst said her game is relatively sharp as she headed into  
today's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been feeling really well,'' she said. ``I haven't been  
practicing too much. I'm trying to pace myself. My putting is real 
good. I'm real confident now, and being in the desert, I feel right 
at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst worked as a teaching pro at nearby La Quinta when she had  
difficulty qualifying for the Tour following her fine college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning the major last year was a key to her career so far, said  
Hurst, a winner of just one other event in her four-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The confidence level went up so much,'' she said of the Dinah  
Shore victory. ``When you're playing well against the best players 
on the Tour, it's a great feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurst finished 1998 with $612,329 in earnings, eighth on the  
money list, about double what she won any other year.

	FCC To End Regulating Cable TV  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cable TV customers will have to pay whatever  
their cable companies want to charge them to watch many of their 
favorite programs when federal price regulation ends next week. But 
even with government controls, the rates rose sharply over the past 
few years. Following the directive of a 1996 law, the Federal 
Communications Commission will stop regulating most cable TV 
services March 31. Specifically, it will lift federal price 
controls for the expanded basic services that include many popular 
cable TV channels, such as Discovery, CNN, MTV and ESPN. Consumers 
now pay on average about $31 a month for regulated cable TV 
services. 

</P>

	Home Sales Fall 0.4 Percent  

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes fell 0.4 percent in  
February from January's record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
5.04 million. The February figure was 5.02 million. In another 
economic figure announced today, the Labor Department said the 
first-time jobless benefit claims sank last week to the lowest 
sustained level in a quarter century despite world economic turmoil 
that has battered U.S. manufacturers. A seasonally adjusted 289,000 
Americans filed applications for unemployment checks, down 10,000 
from the week before.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 169.55  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded smartly today, boosted by  
strong earnings reports and growing confidence that NATO air

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks were boosted today by a report  
late yesterday that semiconductor maker Micron Technology had 
turned a profit in its second quarter after four straight losing 
quarters. But Micron's results didn't meet investors' expectations, 
and its stock was down 3 5/8 at 48 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Other computer stocks, however, were higher, including Microsoft, 
up 6 1/4 at 177 1/2 in Nasdaq trading. Financial stocks advanced after 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter posted first-quarter profits of $1.76 
per share, far above the $1.34 expected by analysts. Morgan Stanley 
stock was up 5 1/8 at 103 1/2 on the NYSE and pulled other financial

	DaimlerChrysler Worries About S&AMP;P  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is moving to stem its loss of  
U.S. shareholders amid a growing perception that the newly merged 
automaker is more German than American. Co-Chairman Robert J. Eaton 
told Wall Street analysts this week that he recently met with 
officials in Washington to seek their help in persuading Standard &AMP; 
Poor's to reverse its decision not to include DaimlerChrysler in 
its S&AMP;P 500 index of U.S. stocks. Since the merger took effect in 
November, the percentage of DaimlerChrysler shareholders in the 
United States has fallen to 25 percent from 44 percent. 
DaimlerChrysler said that change prompted S&AMP;P to leave it out of 
the index. In turn, many large mutual funds that track the S&AMP;P 500 
unloaded the stock.

	Committee OKs Y2K Lawsuit Bill

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved one of  
several bills before Congress aimed at averting lawsuits related to 
Y2K computer breakdowns. But the Republican sponsor, committee 
chairman Orrin Hatch, said supporters must overcome Democratic 
resistance. The bill was approved 10-7, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
the only Democrat to vote for it. She and Hatch are co-sponsors of 
the legislation. The measure would establish a 90-day grace period 
so companies could fix computer problems before suits go forward.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A formal proposal by Microsoft Corp. to settle

offer.'' In yesterday's offer, Microsoft refuses to accept any 
restrictions on what new features it can add to its dominant 
Windows operating system software. Experts believe any settlement 
is unlikely. Attorneys general from the 19 states also suing 
Microsoft discussed the offer today, and New Mexico Attorney 
General Patricia Madrid said afterward that negotiations between 
the government and Microsoft will begin Tuesday.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Polk Audio Inc., a maker of loudspeaker  
systems, is going private and will delist itself from the American 
Stock Exchange after it buys back outstanding shares. The 
Baltimore-based company said it's making the move primarily because 
of its small stockholder base and low trading activity on the 
exchange. George Klopfer, also said Asia's economic problems have 
hurt the industry. The company sells its home and auto loudspeaker 
systems directly through specialty retailers in the United States, 
Canada, Britain and Germany, and through distributors in about 45 
countries.

bonds mature in six years and offer an annual interest rate of 9.75 
percent, or 4.45 percentage points over U.S. Treasury bonds. ``This 
price is a result of the improved perception that foreign investors

	TOKYO (AP) -- Trapped in a deep economic slump, Japan is becoming  
an increasingly risky place for investment, the U.S. credit rating 
agency Standard &AMP; Poor's said today. It also said investors can 
expect substantially greater credit risks in Japan in the near term 
as profound structural changes in the economy and the breakdown of 
traditional business practices gain momentum.'' Corporate 
bankruptcies and loan defaults will likely increase in Japan over 
the next couple of years, according to S&AMP;P. However, it did not 
change its rating on Japan's debt.

<HEADLINE> Body May Be Linked to Yosemite Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A body has been found west of Yosemite  
National Park and the FBI was trying to determine if it was one of 
three female tourists who disappeared six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Nick Rossi said a homicide victim had been found  
and an autopsy was planned. He did not disclose the gender of the 
victim or how the victim was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A law enforcement source, who spoke Thursday on condition of  
anonymity, said the victim was female. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found near a reservoir along a route from El  
Portal, just outside the park, where the three tourists were last 
seen. Nearby is Sierra Village, where the burned bodies of two 
victims were found in the trunk of their rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is also about halfway between El Portal and Modesto,  
where victim Carole Sund's billfold was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund, 42, her teenage daughter Julie, and Silvina Pelloso,  
a young family friend from Argentina, were last seen Feb. 15 at a 
restaurant just outside the western gate of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, two bodies were found in the torched shell of the  
rental car. One body was identified as Mrs. Sund's. Investigators 
were using DNA samples to try to determine the identity of the 
second victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful this recent development will help investigators  
solve this case,'' said Raquel Pelloso, Silvina's mother.

<HEADLINE>  Kevorkian's Fate in Jury's Hands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Finished defending himself in his  
first-degree murder trial, Jack Kevorkian leaned back in his 
courtroom chair, rested his head on his right hand and took a 
45-minute nap as jurors in another room deliberated his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day of deliberations ended Thursday without a verdict  
for the retired pathologist accused of killing Thomas Youk, a 
52-year-old Lou Gehrig's disease patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Youk's death by lethal injection was videotaped and shown on  
CBS's ``60 Minutes'' in a segment in which Kevorkian dared 
prosecutors to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	In his closing arguments Thursday, Kevorkian told jurors that  
history would judge them harshly for a guilty verdict and suggested 
they should trust their judgment more than the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain things that words on paper can never make a  
crime,'' the 70-year-old said. ``There are certain acts that by 
sheer common sense are not crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor John Skrzynski told jurors that Kevorkian should not  
be allowed to ``make a political statement'' with Youk's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that any better than murder for hire? Is that any different  
than murdering somebody for money?'' the prosecutor asked. ``He's 
asking you to say euthanasia is all right, and it's not. That's the 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who represented himself during trial, presented a  
scattershot and occasionally heated closing argument to the jury, 
peppered with objections from Skrzynski. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look at me,'' Kevorkian told jurors. ``Honestly now, do  
you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you do, then you must convict. And then, take the harsh  
judgment of history, and the harsher judgment of your children and 
grandchildren if they ever come to need that precious choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skrzynski methodically worked through the prosecution's case,  
attacking the idea that Kevorkian is a man of compassion. Kevorkian 
``came like a medical hitman in the night with a bag of poison to 
do his job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian could get life in prison if convicted of first-degree  
murder. He has been tried four times previously on assisted suicide 
charges, with three acquittals and one mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	By his own count, Kevorkian has taken part in more than 130  
deaths since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who rested his case without calling any witnesses,  
used a blackboard to try to show that euthanasia did not 
necessarily equal murder. He said he was providing a ``medical 
service'' to Youk, and that he lacked the intent of a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The aim was a final solution to incurable agony,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In her instructions to the jury, Judge Jessica Cooper said in  
part: ``Euthanasia or mercy killing is not a defense to murder. It 
does not justify, excuse or mitigate the killing.''

<HEADLINE> O'Brien, Calhoun Have Paid Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- They live like gypsies, keep  
doctors' hours, gulp Pepto-Bismol like it was water and have the 
job security of mob enforcers. As if the coaching business doesn't 
include enough cruel twists and turns, consider the case of Ohio 
State's Jim O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	After three different mailing addresses, 17 seasons and a  
half-dozen years spent raising two teen-age daughters by himself, 
O'Brien finally came up with a team good enough to carry him all 
the way to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	So, naturally, he gets here and standing in his way is someone  
who's waited 27 years for his own shot and better yet, a friend 
who's beaten him the last 18 times they met. 
</P>
<P>
	To say O'Brien and Connecticut's Jim Calhoun ran into each other  
before is like saying France and Germany did, too. There have been 
more uneven partnerships than theirs -- Sonny and Cher come to mind 
-- but not many in the world of college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1961 through 1985, whoever held the UCLA job always beat  
his counterpart at Cal -- 52 times in all. Ditto for Marquette and 
North Carolina, whose coaches made whipping boys out of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Virginia Military Institute, respectively, 
for more than seven decades and nearly three dozen victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet none of them were probably as friendly rivals and none of  
them stretched into the last weekend of the season like this one 
has. And if familiarity really does breed contempt, then the truly 
remarkable thing about this streak is that O'Brien hasn't paid 
somebody to break Calhoun's leg. 
</P>
<P>
	With one exception, their teams met twice every season from  
1988-97 in the Big East, when O'Brien was at Boston College. What 
happened after O'Brien won the third of their first five meetings 
qualifies as a case study in frustration: He lost in double 
overtime, at the buzzer, from the free-throw line, from just behind 
the 3-point arc, and a handful of times by such lopsided scores 
they've apparently been banished from his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you would have asked me during that time who our team  
played better against, it would probably be Connecticut,'' O'Brien 
said. ``You'd be hard-pressed to go back and find scores where any 
of those games did not go down to the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not entirely true, but it's easy to see how all those  
losses could run together. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 11, 1989, Connecticut beat Boston College by 37. Eleven  
days later, the difference was 77-75. The next two seasons, 
O'Brien's teams didn't get closer than 17. The three seasons after 
that, five of the six losses were by six points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the fans who mailed letters to golfer Tom Watson suggesting  
how he could cure his putting ``yips,'' people passed along 
encouraging tips to O'Brien and assured him the streak couldn't 
continue. It did. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm losing my belief in that,'' O'Brien said. ``I used to go  
into every one of those games saying, 'Well, we'll definitely get 
this one because it's the law of averages.' But we went for years 
and years in this thing and it never really balanced out. At some 
point I would have thought it would have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His only concern now, of course, is whether it will happen one  
more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids on our team wouldn't know anything about it,''  
O'Brien said. ``This has no bearing on them at all. They don't even 
know UConn. This is a totally different thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not exactly true, either, since point guard Scoonie Penn,  
who engineered the Buckeyes' surprising postseason run, followed 
O'Brien from Boston to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Penn still has nightmares about UConn, at least he's  
keeping them to himself. Not so with Billy Curley. The former BC 
star, now playing with the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves, played for 
O'Brien from 1990-94. He called his former coach and pleaded with 
him to beat Connecticut for both their sakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had some specific phrases dealing with UConn,'' O'Brien  
said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is that after all those fierce battles on the  
court, the two coaches have only good things to say about each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien lost his wife, Christine, to cancer the day after Boston  
College finished the 1990-91 season at 1-15. Having raised 
daughters Erin, 23, and Amy, 22, by himself has given him a 
different perspective on the losses that went before and after the 
loss of his wife. It has also won him the unyielding respect of his 
longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``How he handled that,'' Calhoun said, ``going through a  
tumultuous time and raising two daughters, speaks to what kind of 
man he is.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Seek Privacy, Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- While the other three teams in the  
Final Four are staying at resort hotels, Ohio State checked into a 
remote gated complex that's surrounded by 6-foot wire fences and 
lots of security. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State athletics director Andy Geiger and coach Jim O'Brien  
said they were seeking a ``buffer'' from fans before the Buckeyes 
meet Connecticut in the national semifinals Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``At something like this, when you're trooping through hotel  
lobbies all the time, there are times when it's wise to maybe have 
just a little bit of distance,'' Geiger said, speaking through the 
chain-link fence. ``Well-meaning boosters making mistakes, agents, 
gambling -- heaven knows what. We just want a little tiny bit of a 
buffer and a little bit of privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters attempting to check on the team after its arrival from  
Columbus on Thursday afternoon were threatened with trespassing by 
guards. No fans were allowed into the gated enclave, which has few 
signs identifying it from the two-lane roads on its border. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was originally scheduled to stay at the Tampa Airport  
Hilton. Asked why it was switched to the townhouse condominiums, 
coach Jim O'Brien said, ``Because it's too, too busy in there, too 
crazy. It has nothing to do with being paranoid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien said his players would not be restricted from being  
around fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be able to do that tonight after going down  
to dinner and then they're going to be bouncing around the 
convention center for a couple of hours, where all the activity is. 
We're not shielding them from all of that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, two Ohio State fans approached O'Brien, who  
signed the T-shirt of one -- by sticking a pen through the fence.

<HEADLINE> Hale Guilty in Insurance Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Whitewater figure David Hale was found guilty  
Thursday of putting $150,000 into his insurance company's bank 
account to show it was financially stable -- then withdrawing the 
money days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was convicted of lying to the state Insurance Department  
about the financial health of the National Savings Life Insurance 
Company. Defense lawyers said the infraction was a technicality and 
that no one lost money as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury, which deliberated three hours, recommended a sentence  
of 21 days in jail. With good behavior, that could mean 3 1/2 days in 
jail. Hale could have been sentenced to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale pleaded guilty in the Whitewater case to two felonies and  
served 21 months of a 28-month sentence. He was a key witness 
against then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James and Susan McDougal at 
their 1996 fraud trial. All three were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The McDougals were business partners with President Clinton and  
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater land development. Hale had 
once claimed Clinton pressured him to make an illegal loan. Clinton 
denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the insurance case, Hale testified that business dealings  
surrounding the operation of his burial insurance company were 
proper. But he acknowledged a long history of lying about his 
business operations.

                         *Faneuil Adams Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Faneuil Adams Jr., who ran a program that  
brought chess to inner-city schools, died Monday from a brain 
tumor. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	A direct descendant of Samuel Adams, a signer of the Declaration  
of Independence, and Peter Faneuil, for whom Boston's Faneuil Hall 
is named, Adams was one of America's premier patrons and 
aficionados of chess and its top players. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a Bronze Star for his service in World War II and the  
Korean War. Adams worked for the Mobil Corporation for 28 years, 
serving as president of Mobil South Inc. and of affiliates in Japan 
and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his retirement in 1985, Adams devoted himself to  
chess, serving as president of Chess-in-the-Schools and treasurer 
of the Manhattan Chess Club. Chess-in-the-Schools conducts programs 
in 160 city schools and has sent teams to national and 
international scholastic competitions.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Adm. William F. ``Bush'' Bringle, a World War  
II aviator who worked his way through the ranks of naval air forces 
in the Pacific Fleet and in Europe, died of pneumonia Friday. He 
was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringle was nicknamed ``Bush'' because of his thick head of  
curly hair. His World War II efforts in the Pacific and European 
theaters earned him several awards, including the Navy Cross, the 
Distinguished Flying Cross with five gold stars and the French 
Croix de Guerre. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, as commander of the fledgling Kitty Hawk, Bringle took  
the carrier on its maiden voyage from the East Coast to its home 
base at San Diego. More than 1,047 feet in length, the Kitty Hawk 
was then the largest ship to enter San Diego harbor.

helped Walt Disney buy thousands of acres of land that eventually 
became Walt Disney World, died Tuesday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the bank that would later become SunTrust, Dial  
also successfully pushed for Interstate 4 to pass through downtown 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial became chairman of First National Bank at Orlando in 1968  
and remained with the company into the 1970s as the institution 
added affiliate banks and was renamed SunBanks Inc. The bank, now 
based in Atlanta, is the nation's 10th-largest banking company. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial aided representatives of Walt Disney as they quietly, and  
thus cheaply, bought 27,400 acres southwest of Orlando in the 
1960s. The property, more than twice the size of Orlando, became 
home to the sprawling Walt Disney World resort.

	First served more than 20 years as press spokesman for Foley,  
D-Wash., now U.S. ambassador to Japan. 
</P>

hired as a reporter for The Spokesman-Review in Spokane. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 89.91 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rebounded on a positive earnings  
report from Micron Technology today, but the market remained wary 
about first-quarter results in general. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 89.91 at 9,756.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow eased 4.99 on Wednesday to 9,666.84, closing on the down  
side for the fourth straight session amid concerns that 
first-quarter earnings reports would be disappointing. NATO's 
bombing of targets in Kosovo also put a lid on prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks reacted positively to late Wednesday's report from  
semiconductor maker Micron that it had turned a profit in its 
fiscal second quarter after four straight losing quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron's shares were down 1 5/16 at 50 11/16, but the rest of  
the technology sector was higher. Dow component IBM was up 2 1/2 at 
172, while Dell Computer was up 1 1/16 at 39 9/16 in leading volume 
in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 12.04 at 1,280.63. The  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 39.47 at 2,404.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP;  
Co., said that while Micron's results were lifting the technology 
sector and the entire market, the overall outlook for earnings and 
the situation in Kosovo are still important concerns. ``I still 
think the market's suspect here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues had a strong 2-to-1 lead on decliners on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 110.54 million 
shares, up from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.03 percent, as the  
dollar edged higher against the yen following the NATO attack on 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets reversed early anxieties over the attack and  
made a strong comeback after a generous interest-rate cut by 
Sweden. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.52 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.21 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Students Depart for Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Within hours of arriving in Cuba, about 100  
Baltimore and Washington, D.C., students hit the baseball field for 
a casual ball game with Cuban kids their own age. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great out here,'' said Clarence Collier, 11, one of 15  
youngsters who were selected to receive donations to help afford 
the trip. ``The kids who play baseball here are really 
challenging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kids arrived in Havana on a plane chartered by Baltimore  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos. On Sunday, they will watch the Orioles 
play the Cuban national team in an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids here play a more exciting kind of baseball,'' said  
Jimmy Petrila, 12, of Washington D.C., whose parents paid for his 
trip. ``In the United States, people swing for the fences. Here 
there are a lot of bunts and stealing. It is a more strategic kind 
of playing, like Ty Cobb in the 1940s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After getting last-minute federal approval March 19 to take his  
team to Cuba, Angelos sent word to area schools and recreation 
leagues that he would provide a plane for 100 yougsters and up to 
50 chaperones. By Sunday, 50 had been signed up by parents who 
could afford the $750-per-person cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers saved the rest of the seats for students who would  
have trouble affording the fee. Angelos pledged $12,500 to help 
defray costs, but the boys from St. Ignatius Loyola Academy still 
needed about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday benefactors were lining up to help make the trip a  
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids were coming in for breakfast, people were pulling  
over and giving them checks -- $1,000, $2,000,'' Mary Sapeta, the 
school's director of development, said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the students got  
passports, visas and inoculations for Hepatitis-A and typhoid in 
just three days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the youngsters were doing their best to communicate  
with the Cuban kids on the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I knew more Spanish,'' Clarence said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban youngsters said they wished they could speak English,  
but were glad they finally got to play ball with kids from a 
country that embraces baseball as much as theirs does. 
</P>
<P>
	``They sure play with a lot of spirit,'' said Ahmed Pacheco, 10,  
a Havana resident who plays first and third base and pitches when 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel great to be able to play for the first time  
against the Americans,'' said 11-year-old catcher Jorge Luis Coury, 
who wore his baseball cap backwards. ``They're pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Park Service To Study Microbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A federal judge has suspended Yellowstone  
National Park's unique contract with researchers who want to use 
microbes from the park's hot springs for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ordered  
the National Park Service to first do an environmental study of the 
potential impact to the nation's oldest national park. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Service spokesman David Burna said Thursday that the agency  
will not appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Diversa, a San Diego biotechnology firm that farms hot springs  
microbes for industrial uses, has agreed to pay Yellowstone 
$175,000 over five years, plus an undisclosed percentage of 
whatever commercial profits grow from its microbe research. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the agreement ``marks the first time in history  
that an American national park would stand to gain financially from 
scientific discoveries made within its borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also noted that other microbe research has led to  
products ranging from paint strippers to cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellowstone is a particularly fertile field for such research,  
the judge said, because it is home to 80 percent of the world's 
geysers and more than half of its thermal features. Microbes that 
can live in such an environment are more likely to also survive hot 
industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental groups called the ruling a victory for the park,  
but Yellowstone Superintendent Mike Finley said it will deprive 
parks of needed money. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract between the government and Diversa  
remain secret. That secrecy is being challenged in a separate suit 
by the groups that sued to demand the environmental considerations. 
They argue that federal law prohibits any natural resources -- from 
minerals to pine cones -- from being removed from national parks.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fisher To Coach S.D. State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Steve Fisher, whose career as Michigan's  
basketball coach ended as abruptly as it began, reportedly is on 
the verge of being hired to take over San Diego State's sad-sack 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could be finalized as soon as this weekend, Fox Sports  
News reported Thursday, citing sources close to Fisher who were not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, an assistant with the NBA's Sacramento Kings, did not  
return two phone calls placed to his room at a Los Angeles-area 
hotel. The Kings are scheduled to play the Lakers Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State athletic director Rick Bay, who also has ties to  
Michigan, said he was still talking to candidates Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of this moment I don't have a coach,'' Bay said. ``I'd like  
to think I'm getting closer, but I don't have a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A school official involved in the coaching search denied that an  
agreement had been reached with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if an announcement was imminent, Bay said, ``I'd like  
to say it's imminent that I'll have a coach. I went up to the 12th 
hour with (Rick) Majerus, and that didn't happen. So I'd be 
reluctant to characterize it as imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majerus, who coached Utah to the national championship game last  
year, rejected San Diego State's job offer Monday night, and 
Gonzaga's Dan Monson took himself out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego State was 4-22 this year, its fourth losing season in  
five years under Fred Trenkle, who resigned at season's end. The 
Aztecs have had just one winning season since their last NCAA 
tournament appearance, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was an assistant to Bill Frieder for seven years at  
Michigan and was named interim coach on the eve of the 1989 NCAA 
tournament when Frieder accepted a job at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay said Fisher is ``a guy I've known a while, and we both have  
Michigan in our background.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bay wrestled and played football at Michigan, and, after a stint  
in the Marine Corps, returned as assistant wrestling coach, then 
became head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher was fired by Michigan on Oct. 10, 1997, shortly after a  
Kansas law firm hired by the university issued a report that called 
into question his role in arranging complimentary tickets for a 
booster. The NCAA accepted the school's self-imposed penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about that incident, Bay said: ``People make their  
own judgment. Without having confirmed or denied that I've talked 
to Steve, if I would hire a coach, I would check everything out.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Seek To Limit Restraints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by deaths of mentally or emotionally  
disturbed teen-agers in physical restraints, congressional 
Democrats proposed sharply restricting when restraints can be used 
on the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son was not a bad boy,'' said Marsha Draheim, whose  
14-year-old son, Mark, died in December after being restrained by 
three counselors at a residential treatment center in Orefield, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Draheim spoke at a Capitol news conference to highlight three  
bills that would outlaw the use of restraints on mental health 
patients except when necessary to ensure the safety of the patient 
or other patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physical restraints and seclusion are being used not only too  
much, but also inhumanely, brutally and sometimes fatally,'' said 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., whose bill would cover all patients 
in the roughly 1,100 private and public mental health facilities 
that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberman's bill, and separate bills by Sen. Christopher Dodd,  
D-Conn., and Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., 
and Pete Stark, D-Calif., would require mental health facilities to 
report deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Such reports would be available for possible investigation by  
the nation's protection and advocacy system, a network of mostly 
nonprofit agencies in the states that is federally mandated to 
provide legal representation and advocacy for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the bills would provide additional funding for that  
system to conduct investigations, although lawmakers said it could 
be provided once initial standards for use of restraints, and 
reporting requirements, are in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very, very big concern,'' said Gary Gross, director of  
legal services for the National Association of Protection &AMP; 
Advocacy Systems Inc., which supports restrictions. ``Now, more 
people are turned away than we can serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which are backed by the Clinton administration  
but few Republicans, are modeled on existing federal restrictions 
on the use of physical restraints in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical restraints are ways to restrict a person's movement,  
such as by pinning them to the floor. They may also include the use 
of straitjackets, leather straps, shackles or other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said restraints are used too often on the mentally ill  
to punish them or change their behavior, or for the convenience of 
workers who may be poorly paid, overworked and badly trained. 
</P>
<P>
	They pointed to cases such as the March 1998 death of  
11-year-old Andrew McClain while being restrained in a Portland, 
Conn., psychiatric hospital. A subsequent investigation by The 
Hartford Courant turned up 142 restraint-related deaths, many 
involving children, over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts last year, 16-year-old Mark Soares died after  
workers put him in a headlock at a home for troubled youths in 
Marlboro, where he was placed because of a history of committing 
verbal and physical assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, 17-year-old Casey Collier died of asphyxiation in  
1993 after six hospital orderlies restrained him by sitting on his 
back, legs and shoulders, DeGette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd's bill and the House version would require better training  
of mental health workers. They would subject facilities that don't 
comply with the new law to penalties, including loss of federal 
funding.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Vet Birdie Tebbetts Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Birdie Tebbetts, who spent 56 years in  
the major leagues as player, manager and scout, was remembered 
fondly by Hall of Famer Frank Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's like losing a member of my family. ... I  
appreciate everything he did for me,'' said Robinson, who won 
National League Rookie of the Year honors in 1956 when Tebbetts 
managed the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Tebbetts died Wednesday of congestive heart failure at 86. His  
four children were at his bedside. Tebbetts had been hospitalized 
since March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All Star was a catcher from 1936-52 with the  
Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the Tigers' 1940 team that made it to the  
World Series with a pitching staff that included Schoolboy Rowe, 
Bobo Newsom and Dizzy Trout, and a batting order led by Hank 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1953-1965, he managed the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Braves  
and Cleveland. A heart attack ended his active days in 1965, but in 
1968 he started a scouting career that lasted through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball has been so good to me and such a wonderful life,''  
Tebbetts told The Bradenton Herald last month. ``I'd like to be 
remembered as a good father and a good citizen. But I am a baseball 
guy. That's all I am. That's all I ever was. That's all I ever want 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Whitmore, mayor of Holmes Beach where Tebbetts lived in an  
active retirement that included keeping up with the Anna Maria

<HEADLINE> Duke Tuning Out Loud Praise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke has been leading college basketball's  
marathon for several months now. Many believe the Blue Devils have 
already lapped the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we listen to that, then it's a setup for a downfall,''  
All-American center Elton Brand said of the talk that the Blue 
Devils (36-1) will continue rolling right through the Final Four in 
St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we hear is, `Ah, you guys are going to win it,''' Brand  
added. ``And if we lose, then on the cover of magazines it will be 
`Duke Chokes.' So we don't listen to that and coach doesn't let us 
listen to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easier said than done.  
</P>
<P>
	There have been only three single-digit victories mixed in  
during the team's school-record 31-game winning streak, plus an 
array of 20-point blowouts. In addition, Duke's average winning 
margin of more than 25 points has been increased to 30 in four NCAA 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the shock value has worn off,'' Shane Battier said of the  
perception that Duke is invincible. ``We've been the front-runners 
for awhile and we've learned to work hard in practice and just play 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever people say doesn't surprise me anymore,'' senior  
Trajan Langdon said. ``I just take it for what it's worth, it's not 
really worth anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, coach Mike Krzyzewski wants to put a little reality back  
into the picture before his team's national semifinal Saturday 
night against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	He dismisses the notion that things have come easily for the  
Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have bothered me at some other point in my  
career,'' said Krzyzewski, whose 80 percent winning mark in the 
NCAA tournament is the best among active coaches. ``That's just the 
way it is, but I want to make sure it doesn't bother the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski spoke with his players many times this season about  
the expectations others have placed on the team. He wants them to 
tune out such talk and listen to Duke's inner circle of coaches and 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell them, `You're going to hear that it's easy. William  
(Avery), when you were trying to drive and you didn't get it in 
there, was it easy?''' Krzyzewski said. ``At times over the last 
month the reality of how we're playing and who we're playing 
against has not been captured by people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that regard, Duke has been its worst enemy, giving no  
indication it can be beaten. In its last 13 victories, Duke has won 
by an average of 29 points, shot 15 percent better than its 
opponents and outrebounded them by an average of 13 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	And much like Jerry Tarkanian's UNLV team of 1991 that went into  
the NCAA tournament with a 30-0 record, but lost in the Final Four 
to Duke, the Blue Devils have had few close games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets to you after awhile,'' Tarkanian said of the high  
expectations. ``The big problem that we had was all year long I 
kept telling our guys this was going to be a tough game, this was 
going to be a tough game, and then we'd go out and win by 20. After 
awhile they don't believe you. After awhile they start thinking, 
`Well, coach is just talking again.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski knows there is a fine line between confidence and  
overconfidence, and he doesn't want his club crossing it with the 
national title within grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is kind of like the wave theory, like all of the sudden we  
have waves (of players) and we have two teams that could have made 
the Final Four,'' Krzyzewski said. ``Realistically, we don't, we 
have eight or nine guys.''

	U.S. Prepares Long Bombing Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a second night of airstrikes under way,  
the United States is prepared for a sustained bombing campaign 
against Yugoslavia, top officials said today. The strikes were 
focusing on Serb air defenses and the forces arrayed against the 
ethnic Albanian minority in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia, said 
a Pentagon spokesman. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``knows how to get in touch 
with us'' when he is ready for peace. But there was no hint the 
assault, which reportedly killed at least 11 people so far, was 
causing Milosevic to rethink his refusal to end his forces' 
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo or accept a 
peace plan.

	Anti-NATO Protests Rock Macedonia  
</P>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- More than 2,000 demonstrators hurled  
stones and firebombs at the U.S. Embassy in Macedonia and tried to 
storm it today before riot police drove them away with tear gas. 
Hundreds also gathered outside the missions of other NATO members -- 
including France, Britain and Germany. The siege came hours after 
Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski warned against rising anti-NATO 
and anti-American sentiment. Macedonia has supported the NATO 
attacks on neighboring Yugoslavia, but nationalists and members of 
the Serb minority are sympathetic to Belgrade.

	Kevorkian's Fate in Jury's Hands  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The jury at Jack Kevorkian's murder trial  
began deliberating today after the suicide doctor all but asked the 
jurors to disregard a law he considers unjust. ``There are certain 
acts that by sheer common sense are not crimes,'' Kevorkian, acting 
as his own lawyer, said during closing arguments. But prosecutor 
John Skrzynski said Kevorkian should not be allowed to ``make a 
political statement'' with the lethal injection he gave to Thomas 
Youk, a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. Judge Jessica 
Cooper told the jurors they could consider convicting Kevorkian of 
second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter.

would have voted to indict him for perjury if prosecutors had asked 
her to. But Freda Alexander, whose grand jury service ended last 
week, said she believed Clinton's transgressions were so personal 
they never should have been made public, much less become grounds 
for impeachment. In an interview with The Associated Press, 
Alexander described her 18 months on the grand jury as emotionally 
intense. She defended Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr but said 
she sometimes felt sorry for Lewinsky.

officials said. The text says the Palestinians have an unqualified

negotiations would best guarantee Israeli security.

	NATO: 3 Yugoslav Fighters Destroyed  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO supreme  
commander, said today that allied aircraft had ``destroyed'' three 
Yugoslav jet fighters. He said the planes were among the ``most 
modern and capable'' in Yugoslavia's inventory. Clark said the 
allied operation against Yugoslavia ``will be just as long and 
difficult as President Milosevic wants it to be.'' The Yugoslav 
Defense Ministry in a statement today called the NATO attacks an 
``unprecedented criminal act'' that support ethnic Albanian 
``terrorists.''

force President Slobodan Milosevic to make peace in Kosovo. The 
Yugoslav army reiterated its defiance after a night of strikes on 
more than 50 targets, saying the ``high morale of the units was 
preserved.'' Milosevic congratulated military commands for their 
``brave resistance.'' NATO defense officials, speaking on condition

hours.

made up of dominant Serbia and smaller Montenegro -- said all 
journalists can stay, as long as they are objective. A statement 
said the order was issued ``because they, by their reporting from 
the territory of the Republic of Serbia, strengthened the 
aggressive acts of NATO forces aimed at violent destruction of ...

murder trial today. The trial that began Monday raced toward a 
conclusion as Kevorkian rested his defense without calling 
witnesses. Kevorkian is charged with first-degree murder and 
delivery of a controlled substance. Circuit Judge Jessica Cooper

<HEADLINE> Ex-Celtic Lewis Cleared of Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An internal Northeastern University investigation  
turned over in a court battle over the sudden death of Celtics star 
Reggie Lewis found no evidence that he used cocaine in college. 
</P>
<P>
	In a motion filed in the medical malpractice case, lawyers for  
Lewis' estate said ``every credible witness with personal knowledge 
states unequivocally before the Northeastern Commission that Reggie 
Lewis never used cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 report has become central to the battle over  
responsibility over Lewis' death in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old basketball star had collapsed during a playoff  
game at Boston Garden three months before his death. A team of New 
England Baptist Hospital doctors diagnosed him with a 
life-threatening heart ailment and warned that his career was in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis transferred to Brigham and Women's Hospital, where a team  
led by Dr. Gilbert Mudge diagnosed him with a less-harmful 
neurological condition and said chances were good that Lewis could 
play again. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy after Lewis' death revealed a badly damaged heart.  
</P>
<P>
	His widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, has sued Mudge and three others,  
accusing them of misdiagnosing and mistreating her husband's heart 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge has countered that 16 days before Lewis died, the  
basketball star acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had 
stopped. The lack of full disclosure early on made it impossible to 
make a proper diagnosis because Lewis hid his cocaine use, Mudge 
has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has vehemently denied her husband ever used  
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties were in court Thursday to argue a request for a gag  
order and debate certain testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyers asked for the gag order to prevent out-of-court  
statements to the media from influencing a jury. They were upset 
that Harris-Lewis told a reporter she expected to ask for $100 
million, an estimate of her husband's potential lifetime earnings. 
The trial is scheduled for April 26. 
</P>
<P>
	According to two depositions released in the case, Lewis and  
teammate Andre LaFleur failed a drug test while playing for the 
college team. They took it again the following day, passed and were 
allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Harris-Lewis' motion, Northeastern team doctor  
Dr. Job Fuchs testified that Lewis passed the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two witnesses ever said Lewis had used cocaine, according  
to the papers. One was Northeastern teammate and friend Derrick 
Lewis, who said in a newspaper interview after the Celtics player 
died that Reggie Lewis used drugs, but later recanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion quoted the Northeastern report as saying: ``Derrick  
Lewis never saw Reggie Lewis use cocaine. ... (He) characterized 
his prior statements as lies and that he was wrong to have made 
those statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin Cohen, the school's athletic director, however, told the  
commission that Fuchs told him Lewis tested positive for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuchs' testimony is crucial to determining whether Lewis used  
cocaine. As team doctor at Northeastern, he was the only one privy 
to results of drug tests done on the entire team in 1987. The 
players names were coded with a number, and Fuchs later discarded 
the log that matched the names with the numbered test results. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's hearing, Harris-Lewis' lawyer, Bridget Asaro, said  
``the boxes of material (from Northeastern) are replete with 
evidence that there was only one player who tested positive ... 
Andre LaFleur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge's lawyer, William Dailey, countered that there were two  
sets of test results that showed positive cocaine use by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dailey said Fuchs, who is now 82, had told other witnesses that  
Lewis was one of those players and had changed his story at the 
time of the Northeastern inquiry in 1995 because he suffered 
medical problems, including ``steroid induced psychosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith said he would decide  
whether to order a gag next week, but refused to impound documents 
filed in the case.

<HEADLINE>  Cambodian Senate Holds 1st Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Cambodia's newly formed Senate held  
its first session today, and the country's president promised that 
the upper house will enhance the quality of governance and serve as 
an additional check on the executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, born out of a November coalition agreement that  
ended more than a year of political turmoil, has been blasted as an 
undemocratic and costly solution to finding a position in the new 
administration for Chea Sim, the aging leader of the ruling 
Cambodian People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In his inaugural speech, Chea Sim told his 60 colleagues in the  
Senate that they have been empowered to be a moderator between the 
executive and the lawmaking National Assembly and a bridge between 
the Cambodian people and their government. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, the Senate can be used as a braking system or a  
counterweight to judicial errors in the state governance. It can 
inspire patience, wisdom and moderation. Unity, stability, 
permanence and normalcy will be the principles of the Senate,'' 
Chea Sim said on the new Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators later donned traditional white tunics and green  
pantaloons for a swearing in ceremony at the Royal Palace, which 
was presided over by King Norodom Sihanouk and attended by Prime 
Minister Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old king, rumored to be ailing, appeared in good  
health as he smiled and joked with attending diplomats before the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the new lawmakers, Sihanouk also acknowledged the  
Senate's critics by saying the new legislative body would be a 
strain on the national budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the duty of all the members of our Senate to devote  
their utmost to seeing to it that this legislature yields its full 
benefit in order to prove to our people ... that our Senate is not 
useless, but on the contrary is able to render great services to 
the people, the nation and our homeland,'' the king said. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper house has the power to pass back legislation approved  
by the National Assembly with recommended changes, but the assembly 
can reject the recommendations in a second vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators will be elected in the future, but the first Senate was  
appointed using the results of last year's general election. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPP holds an absolute majority with 31 seats, its coalition  
partner FUNCINPEC has 21, the opposition Sam Rainsy Party has seven 
and the king appointed two. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sam Rainsy Party bitterly opposed creation of the Senate.  
After it was unable to convince former ally FUNCINPEC to break from 
its coalition pact with the CPP, the opposition party refused to 
appoint its seven senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Sihanouk convinced Sam Rainsy in a March 14 letter to make his  
appointments, telling the opposition leader that his party risked 
losing political influence if it did not participate in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes Rely On Supporting Cast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Some teams are good at recognizing  
the open man. Others are good at recognizing a changing defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State got where it is -- the Final Four against Connecticut  
on Saturday -- by recognizing its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an egoless collection of guys for the most part,''  
coach Jim O'Brien said. ``Everyone has an ego, but it has never 
been a problem with these guys to understand who the marquee 
players are. That's a tribute to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those marquee players are Michael Redd and Scoonie Penn. They're  
1-2 on the team in scoring, postseason honors and garnering 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	But for Ohio State to keep playing beyond Saturday night, it  
must continue to get solid contributions from a supporting cast 
that opponents don't recognize until it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has to offer something,'' is the way forward Jason  
Singleton puts it. 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare to find a team where players' roles are so clearly  
defined. 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Mop-up Man    	
</P>
<P>
	Singleton -- called the ``Robin'' of the team by Penn -- seldom  
wanders far from the basket on offense, unless it's to set a pick 
or to set up a teammate with a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a 15-foot jumper he hit earlier in the season, the  
6-foot-5 senior said he couldn't remember ever shooting that far 
from the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost always draws the toughest defensive assignment from  
the opposing front line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie and Michael are front stage and he's the guy handling  
the curtains,'' backup forward George Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
                          *The Shot Blocker    	
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, during an 8-22 season, the Buckeyes were forced to  
play zone every game because they couldn't keep up with fast point 
guards, and Ken Johnson was constantly in foul trouble, trying to 
block every shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Penn, who sat out his transfer year from Boston  
College, has shored up the perimeter defense. And Johnson, a 6-11 
junior, has picked his spots and has been a major factor in Ohio 
State's remarkable turnaround to a 27-8 record. In the South 
Regional final win over St. John's, he blocked seven shots and had 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the St. John's game, he played out of his mind. He played  
the best game of his whole life,'' Penn said. ``If he wasn't doing 
the things he's doing, we wouldn't be here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Defender    	
</P>
<P>
	How many other teams dramatically change their starting lineup  
after 31 games? That's what O'Brien did when he inserted freshman 
Brian Brown in place of Jon Sanderson before the NCAA first-round 
game with Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown handles the ball, allowing Penn and Redd to scissor  
through picks for open shots or beat defenders backdoor. He also 
guards the top perimeter threat, shielding the Buckeyes' big two 
from foul trouble and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scoonie and Mike, they've been carrying this team all season  
long offensively,'' Brown said. ``But Scoonie and Mike couldn't be 
here without us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                           *The Minutemen    	
</P>
<P>
	When O'Brien needs someone to muscle the other team's big man,  
he can call on the broad-shouldered Sanderson. If the offense is 
stagnant, he brings in 6-7 junior-college transfer Reese. Senior 
Neshaun Coleman is the team's 3-point specialist and freshman Boban 
Savovic spells the guards and has broken open a couple of games 
with perimeter shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	All have pluses and also minuses. Finding the right combination  
is a strange balancing act for O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a collection of guys who do a couple of things pretty  
well and have some limitations,'' he said. ``Where you have a gain, 
sometimes you have a loss. So you just have to keep weighing the 
trades.''

<HEADLINE>  French Lead in Ice Dance Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The French duo of Marina Anissina and  
Gwendal Peizerat captured the original dance and moved into first 
place of the ice dance event today at the World Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov were  
second but in a virtual tie for first. The decision will go down to 
the final free dance on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were third. Even if  
they win the free dance, if one of the other top two couples comes 
in second, that couple would win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kwan also was skating, although only in practice for  
her next competition in Friday's short program. She had considered 
taking today off, but came to the first of the day's two practice 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	She repeatedly landed the triple lutz that she had unexpectedly  
turned into a double during the previous day's qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Frank Carroll said Kwan was recovering from the head cold  
that had been bothering her earlier in the week and decided to 
capitalize on the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided to practice bcause it would be an opportunity to go  
over some things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said she would sit out the day's second practice session.  
</P>
<P>
	She woke up 1 hour, 20 minutes before she went through her  
qualification session, yet hit six triple jumps with grace and 
easily won her group. 
</P>
<P>
	Her main challengers, Maria Butyrskaya and Tatiana Malinina,  
were first and second in their section, with three and four 
triples, respectively. And with nowhere near the polish Kwan had. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt a little tired in my program, but thought, `One thing  
at a time,' '' Kwan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan did not make any errors, but did only a triple-double  
combination and cut down another triple to a double lutz. 
</P>
<P>
	``My jumps seemed solid but I could have done better,'' Kwan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In pairs, China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo had a repertoire of  
powerful throws, lifts and jumps. The music from the movie 
``Mulan'' matched their power, with dynamic drums and fanfares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians skated to a wordless Coloratura Soprano piece,  
delivering a soft, delicate performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Berezhnaya fell on a double axel, it was their only  
error. They quickly swung back into the mood of soft skating, 
featuring elegant lines and extension in lifts, as opposed to the 
Chinese couple's fast-paced series of jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians were rewarded with a string of 5.9s for  
presentation. The best the Chinese could do were four 5.9s for 
technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant a 7-2 advantage for the Russians from the panel of  
nine judges. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 29th gold medal for couples from the former Soviet  
Union or Russia, all since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Third went to Dorota Zagorska and Marius Siudek of Poland, the  
top three positions not changing from Monday's short program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the men finish their competition tonight with the  
free skate -- following the original dance to the waltz rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are leading in both events.  
</P>
<P>
	The men's gold medal almost certainly will be decided between  
defending champion Alexei Yagudin and compatriot Yevgeny Plushenko. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Stojko, the three-time world champion, is currently in  
third, with a slight chance to win. The top two Russians both must 
do poorly enough to allow Stojko and others to beat them in the 
free skate, worth 50 percent of the final score.

<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Vancouver Canucks captain  
Mark Messier, who missed 18 games with a sprained left knee, was 
scheduled to return to the lineup for Thursday night's game against 
the St. Louis Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier, who suffered the injury when his skate caught a rut in  
his first shift during a game in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, remained 
second in team scoring with 13 goals and 44 points, and continued 
to lead the NHL with seven short-handed points (two goals, five 
assists). 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks, losers of their last five, went 3-11-4 in Messier's  
absence.

<HEADLINE> Belgraders Take Strikes in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid the cry of sirens, dozens lined  
up today in front of a basement bomb shelter in the center of 
Belgrade, prepared to rush inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The few storekeepers who opened their establishments stood in  
front of their doors, their faces anxious. One shopkeeper greeted a 
customer by saying ``bombing day,'' instead of ``good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb capital of 2 million braced for a second day of NATO  
attacks after Yugoslav authorities said 10 people were killed and 
38 wounded overnight in the barrage of cruise missiles intended to 
force the country to make peace in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Branko Vujinovic, a veteran of both German and Allied bombings  
of the city during World War II, showed a mixture of anger and 
stoicism at the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am old, and I don't care,'' said the 70-year old pensioner.  
``But my children and grandchildren were terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NATO air campaign was actually a plan to make Serbs  
give up Kosovo, a Yugoslav province where government forces have 
been fighting ethnic Albanians separatists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't give up a square meter of what has been our land for  
centuries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milica Jericic, 49, shrugged off the dangers of not seeking out  
a bomb shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are not safe anywhere,'' she said, sipping coffee in one  
of the few establishments open today. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown Belgrade was eerily still today.  
</P>
<P>
	Trq Republika, the normally bustling square in the center of  
town that was destroyed by Allied and German bombing during World 
War II, was deserted. Hundreds of chairs set out in front of coffee 
shops to lure customers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	In a small grocery stacked with sausages, cheeses, canned goods,  
fruits and other food, women discussed whether Russia, the Serbs' 
traditional ally, would come to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools were closed in the city, and gasoline rationing was  
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, as air raid sirens sounded over Belgrade for the  
first time since World War II, some Serbs were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it, this is the 20th century in the middle of  
Europe, and this is war!'' said Milica Milojevic, 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Panicked residents ran home, some dragging dogs they had been  
walking on a mild spring evening. 
</P>
<P>
	After Serb authorities declared a state of war and a general  
mobilization, many military-age men fled their homes to avoid 
conscription. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be killed without knowing why,'' said Filp  
Pavicevic, 30, as he packed his bag to take refuge in a friend's 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently trying to boost morale, Serb TV aired World War II  
movies featuring partisans fighting Germans. The broadcast was 
occasionally interrupted by announcements of targets that had been 
hit.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Wants Postal Diversity Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker said Thursday he wants a  
congressional hearing on diversity at the U.S. Postal Service, 
citing a government audit that found the agency has not done enough 
to promote women and minorities to management. 
</P>
<P>
	A report issued three weeks ago by the General Accounting  
Office, the auditing branch of Congress, said the Postal Service 
had not corrected problems identified in a report the Postal 
Service Board of Governors ordered in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO found that despite some progress, the overall  
representation of women and minorities in high-level management 
positions at the end of fiscal 1997 was almost 20 percent lower 
than their representation in lower level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary of the GAO's report, released by Rep. Danny Davis,  
D-Ill., said the ranks of women and minorities in high-level 
management jobs increased between fiscal years 1993 and 1997, but 
that the number of black men had decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he requested the GAO study as a follow-up to the  
Postal Service's own report, issued in January 1998, which found 
that management of the country's largest civilian employer was 
dominated by white males. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies are required by law to diversify their work  
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal Service spokesman Roy Betts said the agency is committed  
to providing advancement opportunities for its women and minority 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The failure of the Postal Service to follow the law is  
disturbing because they should be the leader,'' Davis, a former 
letter carrier, said at a news conference. ``It just makes good 
business sense to have diversity at every level of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he has asked Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y., chairman of a  
House panel that oversees the postal service, to schedule a hearing 
on the matter. Davis has not heard back from McHugh, whose office 
only received the request Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also has asked Postmaster General William Henderson to  
respond to the GAO findings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, Davis said he would consider legislative remedies,  
including linking bonuses of Postal Service executive managers to 
improvements in diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Postal Service is clearly working in the direction of  
continuing to generate opportunities and to make progress with the 
promotion of minorities and women throughout all levels of the 
organization,'' Betts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service crafted 23 initiatives to improve diversity  
and address concerns in the governing board report. The agency has 
recently developed broad goals and objectives for its diversity 
program, but GAO said it has yet to establish procedures to measure 
progress toward meeting them.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Child Labor Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *BY MICHAEL TUCKER, JR   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of children 14 and younger are  
full-time workers, many toiling under hazardous conditions, 
according to a Labor Department study of child labor made public 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is finally a recognition across the board that abusive  
child labor exists,'' Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman told a news 
conference at which she released the 230-page report titled ``By 
the Sweat and Toil of Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the ``most comprehensive resource'' to date on child  
labor said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, the senior Democrat on the 
Senate Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, which requested the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The study examined 16 countries and documented the number of  
child workers and the extent and nature of occupations. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin said, many countries have long denied this practice.  
</P>
<P>
	In Nepal, 41.7 percent of children between the ages of 5 and 14  
are employed and in Kenya, 41.3 percent between the ages of 10 and 
14 are full-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are finally out of the denial phase and into the action  
phase,'' said Herman 
</P>
<P>
	The report also states that many of the world's children work in  
dangerous or hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman and Harkin are looking to the governments of these  
countries to provide a clear commitment to ``implementing and 
enforcing adequate child labor laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman said that child labor cannot be eliminated without  
tougher education laws. Less than 70 percent of the children in the 
countries reviewed were enrolled in primary school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids should be in school, not toiling in the sex trade,  
carpets, mining ore, making fireworks, carrying bricks, or 
operating saws,'' said Harkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Funding of a program to eliminate international child labor was  
increased from $2 million to $30 million last year, and is in the 
president's budget this year at the same level, according to 
Harkin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some progress, but we have a huge mountain to  
climb,'' Harkin said.

<HEADLINE> Holdsclaw, Peck Earn AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw, already  
the first three-time All-American, achieved another breakthrough 
Thursday when she became the first to repeat as The Associated 
Press player of the year in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Peck, who has her team in contention for the national  
championship in her second and final season at Purdue, was selected 
coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were overwhelming choices in voting by AP newspaper and  
broadcast members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The  
AP's award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 
39-0 record and its third straight national championship. The Lady 
Vols fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fluid, 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw still had an outstanding  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge came not because Holdsclaw was ornery or  
conceited. To the contrary, she's modest and unassuming. The 
challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help make her 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw arrived at Tennessee after leading Christ The King  
High School in New York to four state championships. While winning 
its three NCAA titles during Holdsclaw's career, Tennessee compiled 
a 128-17 record, including a 21-1 mark in NCAA tournament play, and 
had a 46-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1 on  
Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``We work together and we work 
well. One thing I've found as a head coach, you don't have to feel 
like you've got to do it all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers do work, but they also have fun and Peck sets  
the tone with her positive, upbeat manner. Instead of stomping 
along the sideline and growling at the officials, Peck is 
constantly applauding her players or imploring the crowd to make 
more noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, she can laugh and cut up with her players without  
losing their respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be successful with what you're doing, you have to enjoy  
what you're doing,'' Peck said. ``It doesn't matter if you're a 
doctor or a clerk, you have to enjoy doing what you do. The thing 
that is so much fun or that I enjoy the most is seeing our players 
enjoying what they're doing.''

<HEADLINE> Unsafe Rail Crossings To Be Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Railroad engineers, signalmen and conductors  
will be putting together a list of dangerous railroad crossings 
after this month's fatal truck-train wreck, three unions said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions hope to improve safety at the nation's 259,000  
railroad crossings following a March 15 accident in Bourbonnais, 
Ill., in which 11 people were killed and more than 100 injured when 
an Amtrak train crashed into a truck carrying steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to ``cut through the red tape and find quick and  
sound solutions to these problems,'' said Charles L. Little, 
president of the 125,000-member United Transportation Union, which 
represents mainly conductors. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions will set up a task force and encourage rail workers  
to telephone or e-mail with information about dangerous crossings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members of our unions know what is safe and what is an  
accident waiting to happen,'' Little said. ``We intend to compile 
this information and let the political leadership in every state 
and in Washington know where the problem spots are located.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UTU and the 56,000-member Brotherhood of Locomotive  
Engineers are based in Cleveland, while the 10,000-member 
Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen is based in Mt. Prospect, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Locomotive engineers often face the problem of car drivers who  
ignore gates and try to dodge an approaching train, said BLE 
president Clarence Monin. 
</P>
<P>
	W.D. Pickett, president of the signalmen's union, said the  
unions want the Federal Railroad Administration to do more to 
improve crossing systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency would welcome the information, spokeswoman  
Pamela Barry said.

<HEADLINE> Rally Held for D.C. Principal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 500 students and parents rallied  
Thursday to support an embattled school principal who raised 
thousands of dollars through pizza sales to supplement his school's 
budget during the height of the city's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's getting a horribly raw deal given the problems of  
the D.C. school system,'' said Esther Williams Yarborough, whose 
daughter is in the seventh grade at Alice Deal Junior High School, 
where Reginald Moss has been principal for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. Inspector General E. Barrett Prettyman Jr. has recommended  
that Moss be fired for his role in an on-campus pizza sales 
arrangement that ended last June. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that the arrangement violated school policy and that  
haphazard record-keeping made it impossible to determine how the 
money was used from pizza sold during lunchtime on school grounds 
by a nearby Domino's franchise. The cash arrangement ended last 
June, said the inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it apparently was deposited in the Student Activity  
Fund and used for school-related activities, although certain sums 
could not be accounted for,'' said Prettyman. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar arrangements, dubbed ``dough raisers,'' are helping  
schools across the country raise money, said Cozette Phifer, a 
spokeswoman for Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Domino's. ``We actually 
adapt our recipes to meet federal school lunch requirements, and we 
make kits available to our franchises,'' Phifer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prettyman contends that Moss' efforts on behalf of his 1,022  
students jeopardized federal school lunch subsidies for the entire 
District of Columbia school system. Ninety percent of the 77,111 
students enrolled in D.C. schools are served free or reduced cost 
school lunches under federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Arlene Ackerman has placed Moss on  
administrative leave with pay. Spokeswoman Denise Tann said a 
decision on his future could be announced within a few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Parties Cashing In on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats alike are using  
President Clinton's impeachment to encourage the party faithful to 
open their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are seeking contributions to help the House  
impeachment managers and others who supported removing Clinton from 
office. The House managers have founded their own political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are asking donors to help those who opposed  
impeachment or, in their words, ``fought vigorously to defend the 
Constitution and to bring an end to the politics of personal 
destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Republican National Committee chairman Jim  
Nicholson sent out a fund-raising letter about impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will send a terrible message if those principled men and  
women who supported impeachment are turned out of office by James 
Carville, Barbra Streisand, pornographer Larry Flynt and President 
Clinton's other liberal friends who opposed impeachment,'' 
Nicholson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville and Streisand are ardent Clinton supporters, and Flynt  
is the Hustler magazine publisher who investigated the private 
lives of several prominent Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Managers PAC filed papers with the Federal Election  
Commission this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 13 managers who prosecuted Clinton in the Senate  
trial have signed onto the venture and the other three are expected 
to follow suit, said Jeff Hartley, political adviser to one of the 
former prosecutors, Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, who organized 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just seemed natural to do it,'' Hartley said. ``They are a  
team and a PAC is a way they can work together toward a common 
goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former manager Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., sent out his own  
fund-raising letter just days before he presented evidence at the 
Senate trial in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``As visibility increases for many Republicans due to the  
impeachment process, the likelihood for opposition in the next 
election also increases,'' he wrote in appealing for donations to 
his campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has a  
fund-raising letter, over the signature of te House minority 
leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, with a separate update 
praising congressional Democrats' stand against impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their stalwart defense of democratic principles is deserving  
of support from DCCC members all across the nation,'' the update 
said. ``Now those same men and women are working to make sure the 
106th Congress quickly and effectively addresses problems of deep 
concern to America's families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' GOP counterpart, the National Republican  
Congressional Committee, is looking at starting its own 
fund-raising effort on behalf of the pro-impeachment lawmakers. 
Already, tentative fund-raising scripts have been written. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a hard look at raising money to defend those whom  
the president has this vendetta against,'' NRCC spokeswoman Jill 
Schroeder said. ``We want to do everything we can to defend our 
members against the president's politics of revenge.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue Thrives on Free Throws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The basketball season has been one long  
parade for No. 1-ranked Purdue -- a parade to the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
	To beat the Boilermakers, Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore  
says, that parade has to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue and Louisiana Tech will meet Friday night in the  
semifinals of the women's NCAA tournament Final Four, a game 
matching No. 1 seeds who have met once already this season and have 
long winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The one that continues its streak will play for the national  
championship Sunday against the winner of Friday's first semifinal 
game between Duke and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've seen a basketball team, men or women, that  
shoots more free throws than Purdue,'' Barmore said Thursday. 
``They dribble around until you foul them. If you don't foul them, 
they dribble around some more. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get to the foul line as well as any team that I've seen  
play,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (32-1) has made 569 free throws, which is more than its  
opponents have attempted (495), and shoots 72.7 percent from the 
line. The Boilermakers' top three scorers, Stephanie White-McCarty, 
Ukari Figgs and Katie Douglas, all shoot at least 80 percent from 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
	And Purdue's advantage at the line has been even more pronounced  
in the NCAA tournament as the Boilermakers have run their winning 
streak to 30. Purdue has made 85-of-123 free throws in four games, 
its opponents 22-of-43. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (30-2) thrives on defensive pressure and has  
forced an average of 25 turnovers a game. The Lady Techsters' 
challenge Friday night will be to keep up that pressure -- without 
fouling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you become more focused because you don't want to go  
for the head fake,'' Tech's Monica Maxwell said. ``You don't want 
to get in early foul trouble and let your team down because you're 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very patient and they're very smart. They force you to  
play smart basketball or they're going to put you on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech, making its 10th Final Four trip, has won 22  
straight since a 71-65 loss to Purdue at Indianapolis on Dec. 19. 
And guess where Purdue had a big edge? The Boilermakers were 
21-of-29 at the line in that game, Louisiana Tech 6-for-13. 
</P>
<P>
	Tech is playing much better now. Only one team has come closer  
than 14 points since that loss and the Lady Techsters have won 
their four NCAA tournament games by an average of 26.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're clicking on all cylinders right now,'' Purdue coach  
Carolyn Peck said. ``Monica Maxwell has played extremely well. 
There's no other way I could describe her than an animal on the 
boards. She really has a nose for the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell has averaged 13.3 points and 9.3 rebounds in the  
tournament. Amanda Wilson, a second-team All-American, is Tech's 
season leader in scoring (16.5) and rebounding (8.0). 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very quick, with the ball and without the ball,'' said  
White-McCarty, a unanimous All-American. ``It's just going to come 
down to our communication and team defense. We have to get back in 
transition and we have to help each other out in the half-court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, Figgs and Douglas make Purdue difficult to defend  
because all three can shoot, drive and pass. When teams commit too 
much in their direction, it frees up 6-foot-4 Camille Cooper, who 
scored a career-high 20 points in the Midwest Regional finals 
against Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have a lot of fun working for each other,'' Peck  
said. ``We don't have any selfish players. I think they have a lot 
of fun setting up opportunities for each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore thinks so much of White-McCarty that he voted her his  
player of the year over Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing point guard myself in college and high school, you can  
kind of relate, '' he said. ``I can't relate to Wilt Chamberlain or 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I respect what she does for her team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect that she took a team of less talent than say a  
Tennessee ... and she has them knocking on the door of a national 
championship.''

<HEADLINE> Cop Car Safety Devices Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spectators were waiting for a parade to start  
in downtown Minneapolis in December when a police van suddenly 
surged forward onto a crowded sidewalk, killing two people and 
injuring nine others. 
</P>
<P>
	After several investigations, federal safety officials concluded  
in a report this month that the police officer driving the van had 
mistakenly stepped on the gas pedal rather than the brake when he 
shifted the van out of park. But the report said the accident could 
have been avoided if a key piece of safety equipment -- known as a 
shift lock -- on the Ford Econoline van had not been deactivated. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift lock prevents autos from moving out of park unless the  
driver's foot is on the brake. 
</P>
<P>
	It was inadvertently disabled by city mechanics using  
aftermarket parts to wire the van's brake lights to flash when the 
overhead police lights were on, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now NHTSA investigators fear that many other police departments  
across the country have also wired the brake lights in their Ford 
Crown Victoria police cruisers to flash when the police overhead 
emergency lights are on, probably disabling the shift locks. 
</P>
<P>
	They are contacting police departments to determine how  
widespread the problem is and whether the federal safety agency 
should issue a nationwide warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Most police departments use Ford Crown Victoria patrol cars and  
Econoline vans. More than 200,000 of the vehicles are driven by law 
enforcement officers, safety officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want all the police departments to check the way they've  
wired their systems and fix them,'' said NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota State Patrol also concluded recently that if the  
shift lock had been working on the officer's van in December, he 
``would have been unable to shift the van into drive, thereby 
preventing the incident from happening in the first place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They made a modification to the vehicle so that a safety  
system did not work,'' said Bob Young, the NHTSA investigator who 
uncovered the problem. ``If the shift lock had been there, there 
would have been two people alive and nine people who were not 
injured.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford officials said Thursday that the company would soon issue a  
service bulletin to mechanics warning them the shift lock can be 
disabled if aftermarket parts are used to make the brake lights 
flash. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental owner's manual for Ford police cars already  
warns that ``connection of aftermarket electrical equipment into 
the brake light circuit ... will cause vehicle malfunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 police vehicles in Minneapolis have rewired  
flashing brake lights, police officials there said, and several 
other police departments in Minnesota have discovered they have the 
same problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quick spot check, NHTSA investigators found all three  
police departments they contacted in the Washington, D.C., area had 
flashing rear brake lights on their Ford patrol cars.

<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- The Final Four teams: 	
</P>
<P>
                           *CONNECTICUT 	
</P>
<P>
	Record: 32-2.  
</P>
<P>
	Road to St. Petersburg: Beat No. 16 Texas-San Antonio 91-66;  
beat No. 9 New Mexico 78-56; beat No. 5 Iowa 78-58; beat No. 10 
Gonzaga 67-62. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Final Four: none.  
</P>
<P>
	Hot player: Swingman Richard Hamilton, first-team All-America  
and co-Big East player of the year, averaged 23.5 points in the 
four tournament games and has shown there are no lingering effects 
from the deep thigh bruise that limited him toward the end of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive: The Huskies were buoyed in the regional semifinal  
by the return of Albert Mouring from an injury. He went 3-for-4 
from 3-point range. Power forward Kevin Freeman has been his usual 
solid self up front. He had 13 points and 15 rebounds in the 
regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative: Point guard Khalid El-Amin was 0-for-12 from the  
field against Gonzaga and center Jake Voskuhl, who has averaged 
21.5 minutes in the tournament, still doesn't seem 100 percent as 
he continues to recover from a stress fracture in his foot.

<P>
	Hot player: Point guard Scoonie Penn, the co-Big Ten player of  
the year, averaged 21 points, 7.3 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 4.5 
steals over the last three games of the tournament. Backcourtmate 
Michael Redd isn't far behind, averaging 21 points in the

</P>
<P>
	The positive: The fourth-seeded Buckeyes have become the  
emotional favorite as they continue the turnaround from last 
season's 8-22 record. The team was considered all Penn and Redd 
until the St. John's game when 6-foot-11 junior center Ken Johnson 
became a force in the middle with seven blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The negative: Penn is the only player on the roster to have  
played in a postseason game before this season and the pressure has 
got to be building on the only non-No. 1 seed to reach the Final

<HEADLINE> Calif. Valley On Alert for Fire Ant / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KERMAN, Calif. (AP) -- Would fire ants make it to California?  
Fresno County Agriculture Department entomologist Norman Smith 
always knew it was a question of when, not if. 
</P>
<P>
	The pest, a major problem in the Southeast, has indeed been  
spotted in the Golden State, causing officials to go on heightened 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Department of Food and Agriculture last week  
announced statewide plans to eradicate the vicious ants, setting 
aside $2.8 million in seed money to assist counties and cities in 
the effort. The state also planned to add inspectors at border 
stations and work closely with local governments to remove the 
insect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get this eradicated,'' Smith said, turning over soft  
dirt in an almond orchard in west Fresno County where he found 
hundreds of fire ant mounds. ``It's possible here because once we 
get rid of this, that'll be it. The problem isn't as widespread as 
in the South.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ants, which are native to South America, were first spotted  
in the southern United States in the late 1920s. Since then, the 
insects have dominated 11 Southeastern states, affecting human 
health, agriculture and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time they said 'uh-oh,' it was too late,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	In October, the problem moved west when fire ants were  
discovered in Southern California after contaminated nursery stock 
was transported from Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	The same fire ants known to viciously attack people also can  
hurt agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They cause a whole raft of problems,'' said Sanford Porter,  
USDA Agriculture Research Service entomologist in Gainesville, Fla. 
``For example, they'll chew the bark of young citrus trees, 
eventually killing them. Citrus growers in Florida lose about 5 
percent to 20 percent of their trees that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ants also can decrease soybean production by a couple  
percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not sound like much, ``until you multiply tens of  
thousands of acres, then you're talking about millions of dollars 
in losses,'' Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although recent discoveries of fire ants in California's  
farm-rich Central Valley have been controlled, no one is taking the 
insects lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith found about a dozen fire ant mounds on a 1,200-acre almond  
grove in west Fresno County, but later discovered a bigger problem 
in a smaller orchard just half-mile north: hundreds of mounds in a 
120-acre orchard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no idea they were out there until the county called,''  
said Paul Betancourt, 39, a third-generation farmer who owns the 
orchard. ``We haven't had anyone bitten in the orchard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, who has been following California's fire ant problem  
closely, believes it's not too late to remove the ants completely 
from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily a losing battle, but it'll be a very  
difficult battle,'' he said. ``If it's anything less than a major 
effort, it'll surely fail. But not trying will essentially mean 
that within 20 to 30 years, the whole state could be infested.''

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P Says Investment in Japan Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Trapped in a deep economic slump, Japan is becoming  
an increasingly risky place for investment, the U.S. credit rating 
agency Standard &AMP; Poor's said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors can expect substantially greater credit risks in  
Japan in the near term as profound structural changes in the 
economy and the breakdown of traditional business practices gain 
momentum,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bankruptcies and loan defaults will likely increase  
over the next couple of years as Japan struggles to recover from 
its worst postwar economic slump, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	S&AMP;P assigns ratings to government and corporate bonds based on  
borrowers' ability to repay their debts, though the company made no 
changes to its rating on Japan's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Moody's Investors Service Inc., another leading  
ratings agency, cut its assessment of the creditworthiness of the 
Japanese government. The move was seen as a major condemnation of 
Tokyo's management of its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Japan's official economic forecast for the current  
fiscal year, which ends this month, the economy will shrink 2.2 
percent. The economy contracted 0.4 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Apology Delivered for Valdez Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- The skipper of the Exxon Valdez has  
apologized to Alaskans for the accident that spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil into Prince William Sound a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do apologize for what's happened,'' Capt. Joe Hazelwood said  
in an interview with KTUU Channel 2 that aired Wednesday, the 10th 
anniversary of the grounding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what apology would be appropriate, though,'' he  
said. ``I could apologize to the people of Alaska, and I mean that 
from the bottom of my heart, but I still don't think it would be 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hazelwood had been drinking before the tanker left the Port of  
Valdez, but has maintained his judgment wasn't impaired. 
</P>
<P>
	He told KTUU that it has been too easy for people to cast him as  
the spill's villain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's simple, quick and dirty, and it appeals to a wide  
audience,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite admitting that he had consumed at least three drinks  
before boarding the Exxon Valdez, Hazelwood was acquitted in 1990 
of operating the tanker while drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he was convicted of negligently discharging oil, and  
this summer he will begin serving his sentence -- 1,000 hours of 
picking up garbage along Anchorage-area highways.

<HEADLINE> FCC To End Regulating Cable TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cable TV customers will have to pay whatever  
their cable companies want to charge them to watch many of their 
favorite programs when federal price regulation ends next week. But 
even with government controls, the rates rose sharply over the past 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the directive of a 1996 law, the Federal  
Communications Commission will stop regulating most cable TV 
services March 31. Specifically, it will lift federal price 
controls for the expanded basic services that include many popular 
cable TV channels, such as Discovery, CNN, MTV and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers now pay on average about $31 a month for regulated  
cable TV services, including set-top box and remote control 
rentals, the Consumers' Union estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Decker Anstrom, president of the National Cable Television  
Association, doesn't believe the nation's 67 million cable 
customers will get hit with whopping increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our companies are very much aware that they need to act with  
restraint,'' Anstrom said. ``If they don't, Congress will come back 
in and reinstitute rate regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups said companies may restrict increases in the  
next few months to avoid being regulated again. ``But in the long 
run, rates will keep skyrocketing unless true price competition 
develops or the government decides to put a lid on rates,'' 
contends Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Consumers Union's 
Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and lawmakers say they will keep  
close tabs on rates after the price controls are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and the Clinton administration set the March 31 date  
with the hope that widespread competition to cable would 
materialize, making price controls unnecessary. But such 
competition hasn't developed yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the most basic level of service, including mostly  
broadcast TV channels and a few cable networks, will continue to be 
regulated. So will prices for set-top boxes and remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium channels such as HBO and Showtime were never subject to  
federal price regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	When price controls took effect in 1993, after a 1992 law that  
regulated the industry, rates initially went down, saving customers 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But near the end of 1994, the FCC bent to political pressure and  
revised the rules to give cable companies much more leeway to 
increase rates to pay for higher business costs, such as 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	By the summer of 1996, cable rates were spiking up.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics' figures,  
said that since February 1996 -- when the law paving the way for the 
March 31 deregulation was enacted -- cable prices have increased 24 
percent, while overall inflation has risen 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry says that with each rate increase, customers have  
gotten more channels, improved service and better picture and sound 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent cable TV rate increases are getting smaller,  
even though they still run well ahead of inflation. For the year 
ending Feb. 28, cable TV prices rose 4.9 percent, while overall 
inflation increased 1.6 percent, according to Bureau of Labor 
Statistics' most recent figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner, for example, which runs the nation's largest cable  
TV company with 12.6 million customers, announced price increases 
this year of no more than 4.9 percent, said spokesman Mike Luftman. 
</P>
<P>
	``No price changes will take place as a result of  
deregulation,'' Luftman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups and some lawmakers don't believe competition for  
cable has developed sufficiently to keep rates in check. Rep. Peter 
DeFazio, D-Ore., wants Congress to freeze rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``A funny thing happens when you deregulate a monopoly,''  
DeFazio said. ``Consumers get shafted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va.,  
said: ``Competition is the only true protection tool for 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bliley, his Senate counterpart, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and  
House Commerce telecommunications panel chairman Billy Tauzin, 
R-La., are pursuing legislation to make satellite TV companies more 
powerful competitors to help keep cable rates in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hoped that by this date every community would have two or  
three choices of video programming,'' Tauzin said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Nevada Cops Stabbed, Suspect Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A woman who once threatened to kill herself  
and her daughter was fatally shot by police after she stabbed two 
officers, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaylyn Cotton-Dobie, 34, attacked the officers Wednesday in an  
apartment complex parking lot after they responded to a call that 
she was bothering another tenant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton-Dobie concealed the large kitchen knife in a coat pocket  
until an officer reached out to grab her arm, said Jim Weston, a 
deputy police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``She pulled the knife, lunged at him and started flailing with  
the knife,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton-Dobie then attacked a second officer, Weston said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both officers fired; Cotton-Dobie died during surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	The officers were treated for multiple stab wounds and released.  
Both were placed on leave pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, police investigated a complaint that  
Cotton-Dobie was threatening to kill herself and her 10-year-old 
daughter. She was referred to a mental hospital and the child was 
given to social workers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Won't Use Force Against NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today that Russia has  
decided not to use force to counter NATO attacks against Yugoslavia 
and will continue its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the 
Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia has a number of extreme measures in store, but we  
decided not to use them so far,'' Yeltsin said after meeting with 
his top ministers at the Kremlin. ``Morally we are above America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Moscow called for an urgent U.N. Security Council vote  
today to stop NATO attacks. A Russian call for a council meeting on 
Wednesday failed to halt the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people demanding an end to the attacks protested  
today outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the U.S. consulate in 
St. Petersburg, hurling bottles, eggs and other objects. Police 
detained several protesters in brief scuffles outside the Moscow 
embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have liked to use grenades, but all we had were  
eggs,'' said protester Denis Yasov in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	When the attacks began Wednesday, Yeltsin said Russia was  
halting cooperation with NATO and pulling out of the alliance's 
Partnership for Peace, a program designed to promote military and 
political cooperation between the West and former Soviet bloc 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin had initially ordered the recall of Russia's chief  
military envoy to NATO, Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, and the closure 
of Russia's offices at NATO headquarters in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	But after its initial harsh reaction to the bombings, Moscow  
appeared to be backing away from confrontation with the United 
States and its NATO allies. The ITAR-Tass news agency reported 
today that Russia would keep its mission at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels open and apparently would continue to take part in other 
alliance programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its staunch support for Yugoslavia, Russia's options are  
limited. It is no longer a major military power, and it desperately 
wants Western aid to revive its shattered economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF chief was due in Moscow on Saturday for loan talks,  
Primakov's spokeswoman, Tatyana Aristarkhova, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian newspapers expressed broad sympathy for Yugoslavia  
today, but said Moscow is too weak to challenge the West and can do 
nothing except protest loudly. 
</P>
<P>
	Some papers assailed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov for his  
decision to abruptly cancel his trip to Washington to seek new 
loans from the International Monetary Fund when he heard that NATO 
attacks were imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much easier to brandish rusty weapons and assail  
Americans than properly hold talks with the IMF,'' the daily 
Segodnya said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow was not considering  
giving Yugoslavia any military help, according to the Interfax news 
agency. ``There is no talk about using force in response to 
force,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials had suggested Moscow might provide aid to  
Yugoslavia. Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin hinted that Moscow 
could break an international arms embargo against Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stepashin also played down the situation, saying Russia had  
to maintain good relations with Europe. ``We must not find 
ourselves face to face against all of Europe, which unfortunately 
happened during the Cold War,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's ambassador to Russia said his country would welcome  
military support from Russia if it did decide to ignore the arms 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Russia now leaves the sanctions regime -- that's up to the  
Russian leadership to decide -- but I say that it would be 
absolutely legitimate,'' said Ambassador Borislav Milosevic, the 
brother of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Also seeking to calm the situation, Primakov said he had assured  
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that Moscow would continue 
cooperation with the European Union despite the NATO attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Hires Former Gephardt Aide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley has appointed a former  
aide to House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to run his campaign in 
New Hampshire, a key state if Bradley is to beat Vice President Al 
Gore for the party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's selection of Mark Longabaugh as national coordinator  
for New Hampshire comes 10 days after Gephardt endorsed Gore for 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Longabaugh, 40, directed Gephardt's 1988 unsuccessful  
presidential campaign in New Hampshire and the successful 1992 
Clinton-Gore campaign in Ohio, his native state. He lost his own 
bid for the House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire, with its history of throwing surprises at  
presidential front-runners, holds the leadoff primary next year. 
Bradley has paid two visits to the state since late January and 
will return to campaign April 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Longabaugh will be responsible for building Bradley's campaign  
organization in New Hampshire, similar to the role he played for 
Gephardt in the 1988 primary. Gephardt finished second in New 
Hampshire that year, behind eventual Democratic nominee Michael 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, said Longabaugh's  
``experience in New Hampshire will be an invaluable asset in our 
efforts to wage a successful campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Baptist Mistress Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The alleged mistress of the Rev. Henry Lyons  
pleaded guilty Thursday to two federal tax evasion charges for her 
part in a scheme to swindle companies doing business with the 
National Baptist Convention USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice Edwards, acquitted last month of state racketeering  
charges, agreed to pay $200,000 in back taxes on $500,000 of 
unreported income. 
</P>
<P>
	She faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine at  
sentencing, which had yet to be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Lyons, the president of the influential church,  
and Ms. Edwards diverted money from companies into secret bank 
accounts, using the cash to buy expensive homes, cars and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	During trial testimony, Ms. Edwards, 42, said she earned the  
money in her job as public relations director for the black church 
organization, but said she couldn't recall reporting hundreds of 
thousands of dollars as earnings to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons, 57, was convicted last month of state racketeering and  
grand theft charges. Last week he pleaded guilty to federal tax 
evasion and fraud charges and resigned his position with the 
convention.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Can't Change FAA's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Airlines failed to change  
the government's mind Thursday about grounding it, leaving the tiny 
discount carrier with little hope for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revocation order still stands,'' Federal Aviation  
Administration spokesman Jim Peters said after Kiwi representatives 
met for two hours with FAA officials at Kennedy Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency grounded the Newark-based carrier on Wednesday,  
saying it was unable to fly its three planes and six-city schedule 
safely. The surprise shutdown of the 7-year-old airline stranded 
thousands of travelers who had booked tickets for spring break, 
Easter and Passover, and threw 450 of the airline's 500 employees 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi appealed the decision to the National Transportation Safety  
Board. The board must rule within 60 days of the FAA's response to 
the appeal, NTSB spokesman Matt Furman said. He said the board 
cannot rule until the FAA counters Kiwi's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kiwi barely has cash to make it until Monday, when a  
bankruptcy court judge has scheduled a hearing to consider a 
proposal by Pan American Airlines Inc. to buy the company's assets. 
Kiwi declared $30.3 million in assets and $41.1 million in 
liabilities when it filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am, a former commercial airliner that now flies charters out  
of Portsmouth, N.H., offered the company $3 million to maintain its 
current flying schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really felt that we had a new lease on life,'' spokesman  
Rob Kulat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA failed to consider that Pan Am's money and seven  
aircraft would have helped Kiwi satisfy demands made earlier this 
week by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Kiwi said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi was founded in 1992 by airline employees who had lost their  
jobs at other carriers. The founders chose the name of a flightless 
bird for their upstart enterprise to symbolize the loss of their 
wings at their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has struggled to remain profitable for most of its  
life, although it had a brief period when it had 15 leased jets, 
1,200 employees and flew 65 flights a day.

<HEADLINE> Futurama: A 30th Century 'Simpsons' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's the year 3000, where ``talking head'' is  
a literal term, the national slogan is the repressive ``You gotta 
do what you gotta do'' and suicide booths are a street corner 
staple. 
</P>
<P>
	You're not laughing now, but you will be: This is the world of  
``Futurama,'' a wickedly funny animated series from Matt Groening, 
creator of ``The Simpsons.'' It debuts 8:30 p.m. EST Sunday on Fox, 
and moves to a regular Tuesday 8:30 p.m. slot on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	There it becomes part of an all-animated lineup that includes  
``King of the Hill'' and ``The PJs,'' underscoring the rise of 
cartoons in network prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	Like ``The Simpsons,'' the new series (co-produced by David X.  
Cohen of longtime ``Simpsons'' service) pokes fun at the foibles of 
people and society. But it also feasts, lovingly, on the cliches of 
science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Let others drool in anticipation of the forthcoming ``Star  
Wars'' prequel. Force, schmorce; we'll happily settle for the 
adventures of Fry and his buddies: Leela, the one-eyed 
intergalactic babe and Bender, a robot with an attitude and a 
drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade after ``The Simpsons'' began, we finally have another  
vehicle for the Groening blend of visual and verbal wit and 
juvenile slapstick that guarantees entertainment for the entire 
20th century (and beyond) family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' opens in present-day New York City, where we meet  
Fry, a slacker with a crummy pizza-delivery job and an unfaithful 
girlfriend. ``I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life,'' he 
mutters. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly gets to shed it after stumbling into the Applied  
Cryogenics office (company motto: ``No power failures since 
1997''). A thousand years whiz by in a clever sequence, and our 
hero emerges as a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, New Yorkers are still rude. Bosses haven't gotten any  
better than Mr. Burns. But a millennium does make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumatic tubes are the high-tech subway system. For just 25  
cents you can check out at any one of the convenient ``Stop and 
Drop'' locations, ``America's favorite suicide booth since 2008.'' 
Spacecraft are home-kit stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world still has Richard Nixon to kick around: The heads  
of movers, shakers and celebrities of the past are preserved in 
museums to share their wisdom. (Look for a quick glimpse of 
Groening's mug, perched next to Barbra Streisand's.) 
</P>
<P>
	This clever device allows ``Futurama'' to use ``The Simpsons''  
trick of scattering celebrities throughout its stories. The 
tete-a-tete guest voices on the first episode are Leonard Nimoy and 
Dick Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Fry is delighted with the change in scenery. But he  
soon rebels at the rigidity of this brave new world: Tests have 
shown his greatest potential is as a delivery boy, so he must be 
implanted with a chip that is a permanent job sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	That sets up the conflict that will carry Fry, Leela and Bender  
into adventures on Earth and distant planets, and it promises to be 
a wild ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The talented voices behind the cartoon figures are Billy West  
(Fry and other characters); Katey Sagal (Leela) and John DiMaggio 
(Bender and others). West has done extensive animation voice work, 
including both TV's Ren and Stimpy and Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in 
the film ``Space Jam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (Peg Bundy on ``Married ... With Children'') proves a  
natural as a voice-over artist, as does DiMaggio, a comic whose 
acting credits include a recurring role on ``Chicago Hope'' as 
resident Sean Underhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening, a longtime sci-fi buff, calls the future a natural  
subject for animation, one ignored since 1962-63's ``The Jetsons.'' 
That series failed to take satiric advantage of the turf; the 
pedigree of ``Futurama,'' and its timing, ensures against that. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' and all the other science  
fiction that's out there, it's fun to be able to comment on it in a 
witty way,'' Groening said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to suggest a viewer must be steeped in the wisdom  
of Obi-Wan or Mr. Spock to enjoy ``Futurama''; many of the sci-fi 
references are familiar enough to be obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, one of the joys of Groening's work is that viewers can  
search out the sly comedic references or just enjoy the ones that 
smack you in the face. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to reward people for paying attention. If you just  
watch the way most people watch TV, the show will go by and it will 
be fine,'' said Groening. ``But if you want, there's more to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of sly, Groening notes that he has been criticized for  
providing questionable role models in ``The Simpsons.'' 
Underachieving Bart, beer-swilling Homer and other characters have 
come under attack since the show's debut. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, most of the unseemly behavior seems to be the  
province of Bender the robot -- who, Groening reasons, can't really 
be deemed a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like wishful, 30th-century thinking.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Reporter Awarded Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A jury decided that a newspaper defamed  
its former lead reporter in its JonBenet Ramsey coverage, awarding 
her $115,000 for articles that said she had stolen documents when 
she left the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison Krupski, 24, alleged the Daily Camera's management  
defamed her in at least four articles by claiming she took $15,000 
worth of documents related to the murder case when she resigned in 
December 1997. She said her journalistic career had been destroyed 
by the paper's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	A six-member jury ruled in Ms. Krupski's favor Wednesday  
following an eight-day trial at the Boulder County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Krupski's attorney, William Meyer, said he was pleased with  
the decision, but declined to comment further. Ms. Krupski also 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen C. Conant, the newspaper's publisher and executive  
editor, said she was ``profoundly disappointed'' but had not 
decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents included a copy of the autopsy report, police  
reports and newspaper articles on then-Police Chief Tom Koby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Krupski testified that some of the material was sensitive  
and had been given to her based on trust. But most, she said, were 
news releases and public documents that the Camera already had 
copies of or were readily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Judge Morris Sandstead dismissed the newspaper's  
claim of theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the  
basement of her family's Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. Her murder 
remains unsolved.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Hits Range of Yugoslav Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scores of U.S. cruise missiles and  
radar-evading bombers, leading punishing NATO attacks, struck Serb 
air defenses, power grids, arms factories, airports, barracks and 
command-and-control centers across Yugoslavia and in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, more than 40 targets were struck in the first day of  
strikes Wednesday, NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark, said today. He 
said they included command-and-control facilities, air defenses and 
some facilities ``associated with the Yugoslav military and 
ministerial police forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no planned sanctuary,'' Clark said, although downtown  
Belgrade was not struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Two B-2 stealth bombers, each carrying 16 satellite-guided  
one-ton bombs in the first combat test of the bat-winged plane, 
delivered some of the heaviest hits, including on command bunkers 
and air defenses, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The airstrikes, launched in darkness Wednesday about 8 p.m. in  
Yugoslavia (2 p.m. EST), were expected to continue tonight and 
possibly for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take more than one day,'' Defense Secretary  
William Cohen said on NBC's ``Today'' show, citing Yugoslavia's 
``fairly robust and redundant air defense systems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said NATO planners picked targets ``with great care.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We are attacking the military infrastructure'' that Serbian  
forces directed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``are 
using to repress and kill innocent people,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, commander of Yugoslav troops in  
Kosovo, had called the impact of the overnight NATO attack 
``minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Russian General Staff in Moscow said NATO attacks badly  
damaged five military airfields, two factories, a communications 
center, several barracks, and a police training base. 
</P>
<P>
	An official NATO bomb damage assessment will come from satellite  
photos and surveillance planes, Pentagon officials said. Camera 
footage from warplanes and pilots also will provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO attack began with sea- and air-launched cruise  
missiles, more than 50, many aimed at the Serbs' sophisticated air 
defense system, which consists of up to 1,000 Russian-designed 
surface-to-air missiles with advanced guidance systems capable of 
shooting down allied planes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. B-52 and B-2 bombers, F-16 fighter-bombers and F-117  
stealth bombers, as well as Canadian F-18s and other NATO aircraft 
from 11 countries, also were in the 400-plane force. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's attacks, more than 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles  
were fired from two U.S. surface ships in and around the Adriatic 
Sea, plus one American and one British submarine, U.S. defense 
officials said today. The B-52 bombers fired up to four dozen 
air-launched cruise missiles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and allied fighter-jets downed at least two Soviet-made  
MiGs. The Pentagon said no NATO aircraft were lost as Serbs engaged 
in dogfights rather than launch anti-aircraft missiles. One U.S. 
Air Force F-15 fighter jet did make an emergency landing today in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, next door to Yugoslavia. But U.S. officials 
said it had been flying a routine mission over Bosnia when a 
hydraulic pump went awry, and was not damaged by Yugoslav air 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen refused to reveal what targets were hit, but a Navy  
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said highly accurate 
Tomahawk missiles likely did severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one factory that makes parts for air defense systems  
was targeted, a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Around Belgrade, NATO struck near a power plant and the  
Batajnica military airport, the main Serbian air base 10 miles west 
of the Serb capital. Four missiles also struck an aircraft plant at 
Pancevo, six miles north of Belgrade, destroying several small 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The central Serb town of Kragujevac, a major military-industrial  
center, was plunged into darkness after a heavy explosion, the 
private news agency Beta reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A power grid also was hit in the Kosovo capital of Pristina, and  
several heavy blasts came from around the nearby Slatina airport, 
as well, the official Tanjug news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Montenegro, which with Serbia forms Yugoslavia,  
an army military barracks in Danilovgrad burst into flames after 
being hit. One soldier was reported killed and three wounded. 
Serbian TV said several civilians were wounded in attacks 
throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Chevron Refinery Explodes in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- An explosion at a Chevron oil refinery  
on the edge of San Francisco Bay on Thursday sent a huge pillar of 
black smoke into the air, forcing people to stay indoors with their 
windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron spokeswoman Marielle Bortz said all workers at the plant  
were accounted for and there were no injuries. Firefighters warned 
people to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Celia Orrick and her four children fled their apartment when  
they heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	They got on a bus to escape the smoke, but had to get off after  
a mile when her baby and 13-year-old son began vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky was pitch black,'' said Marvin Orrick, the son. ``We  
came outside and me and my mom's head started hurting. That's why 
we tried to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Stanton of the Richmond Fire Department said the smoke  
was not considered so toxic that people would drop where they 
stood, but it was a health hazard he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thick, roiling black smoke, visible from San Francisco to the  
east and from Marin County to the northeast drifted over Berkeley 
from the 97-year-old refinery, which processes about 240,000 
barrels of oil a day. The smoke dissipated about two hours after 
the blast and at 5 p.m. the fire was close to being out, according 
to Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people in the area reported having breathing problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Chevron said the explosion, which happened about 2:40 p.m., was  
from a pipe leading from a unit where impurities are removed from 
crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Primestar 500 Track Reconfigured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH (AP) -- Texas Motor Speedway officials can only hope  
that the millions of dollars spent the past two years have made the 
1 1/2-mile track more raceable. 
</P>
<P>
	Offseason testing has brought good feedback, but today's start  
of practice and qualifying for the Primestar 500 should give an 
even better indication. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton, who won the first race at the track in 1997, tested  
on the reconfigured layout in December and liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that when you started going down into turn one,  
it was like going into a funnel, and the transition from the 
banking on the straightaway to the banking on the corner was 
awkward,'' Burton said. ``It was treacherous, but they've improved 
that a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said turn two never was a problem, but turn four ``was  
difficult, because you got to the outside wall very quickly. There 
was a transition problem there, too. So they've fixed that, as 
well. Now you can run off turn four and not feel like you're going 
to hit the wall every lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still a narrow racetrack,'' Burton added. ``It's still a  
very tight racetrack. I don't see a second groove coming in yet, 
and it's fast. In fact, it's a lot faster than it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Mayfield owns the current track qualifying record of  
185.906 mph, set last April. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with speeds expected to climb to near 190 mph, the problems  
that forced speedway officials to spend $500,000 on physical 
changes after the 1997 race and more than $4 million to reconfigure 
the oval following last year's event, had better be solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes for a difficult situation when you have problems on  
the racetrack because, as fast as we're going, those problems are 
hard to see,'' said Dale Jarrett, one of the favorites in Sunday's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Two previous Winston Cup races at the track have produced  
several crashes, most of them caused by what was a narrow fourth 
turn and those difficult transitions from the turns to the 
straightaways. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the problems are there, but your job is to go as fast  
as you can,'' said Jarrett, who has finished second and 11th in the 
races in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think those problems are remedied now and we have a much  
better racetrack to race on. The fans are going to enjoy our racing 
more, and the drivers are going to enjoy it more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other big problem at Texas was with drainage. Last year,  
qualifying was washed away because of water seeping up through the 
track despite sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the money spent to fix the track was put into a new  
drainage system. With rain forecast for Sunday, it could be put to 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Goodyear, the exclusive tire supplier for NASCAR's  
top stock car series, says the reconfigured track should not cause 
any tire problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Eagle tires we're bringing to Texas this year basically  
are the same tread compounds as used in the 1998 race,'' said Tony 
Freund, Goodyear's lead engineer for stock car tire development. 
``But, in line with our general goal to improve riding and 
handling, we have evolved the tire construction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear developed a new right-side tire after Burton tested on  
the reconfigured and repaved track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to see a great race with signifcant handling  
improvements,'' Freund said. ``The entry into corners had been 
particularly tricky, but the new configuration in combination with 
the new tires has addressed that situation.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Service Targets Mail Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal authorities are trying to curtail theft  
and consumer fraud with new regulations affecting private 
businesses that accept mail for others. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning April 24, customers who want to rent a private mailbox  
from commercial businesses must show a photo identification and 
verify they live or conduct business at the address listed on their 
application. 
</P>
<P>
	These customers also will be required to write their ``PMB,'' or  
private mail box, number on the second line of their mailing 
address, similar to the way people with post office boxes are 
identified with a ``P.O. Box'' number. The U.S. Postal Service will 
hold mail without a PMB number. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal authorities said the changes target people who rent  
private mailboxes to shield illegal activities, such as credit card 
fraud and narcotics trafficking. Such mailboxes also are used as 
covers for mail order fraud, child pornography rings and schemes to 
swindle the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new regulations clarify addresses for individuals and  
businesses,'' Chief Postal Inspector Kenneth Hunter said. ``A suite 
number or a prestigious avenue can give the perception of a 
corporate executive office of a well-established business. 
Unscrupulous individuals rely on using these addresses to bilk 
American consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customers with preprinted stationery will be given six months  
from the effective date to deplete current supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Mansfield, an assistant Queens district attorney in New  
York, said many white-collar crimes involve commercial mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In one common scenario, thieves will rent a box and reroute  
their victims' mail to it after filling out fraudulent 
change-of-address forms. Often, the criminals will rent the box for 
only a month before moving on to another address. However, 30 days 
-- the length of most billing cycles -- are all thieves need to look 
through credit card statements, pension information, home equity 
lines and frequent flier reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``During a 30-day period, someone can find out virtually  
everything there is to know about you,'' Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite postal regulations to verify address changes, people  
still find ways to use the mail for scams. After receiving a change 
of address form, the Postal Service mails a confirmation letter to 
the old address, regardless of the move date, and a second 
confirmation to the new address. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said the Postal Service has sent out information about  
the PMB designation and the other new regulations to companies that 
issue credit cards, the rebate and mail order industry, and law 
enforcement agencies. Postal authorities plan to conduct audits to 
ensure compliance and make sure the regulations are working 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not targeting commercial mail-receiving agencies, we  
are just closing a loophole that allows criminals to take advantage 
of these businesses,'' Hunter said.

<HEADLINE> Heart Attacks Becoming Less Severe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Heart attacks have become less severe in  
the United States over the past decade, improving victims' chances 
of escaping death or a life of chronic chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
	New research being presented today shows that while the number  
of heart attacks has remained relatively stable, they are less 
likely to do serious damage. Experts credit a combination of 
healthier living habits, better heart medicines and more intense 
treatment immediately after heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said that while they documented the change during  
the last 1980s and early '90s, the same trend probably helps 
explain the steady drop in heart attack deaths nationwide since the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really good news that the severity of heart attacks is  
declining,'' said Dr. David Goff Jr. of Wake Forest University. 
``Less damage is being done, so people will be less likely to 
become cardiac cripples, unable to live normally because of severe 
chest pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goff presented one of several studies on heart disease trends at  
an epidemiology conference in Orlando sponsored by the American 
Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said heart attacks are still the nation's biggest killer  
and cautioned against complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very good and encouraging news,'' said Dr. Melissa  
Austin of the University of Washington. ``But we have got to be 
vigilant. We can't assume everything will continue to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the taming of heart disease has been one of the  
major success stories of modern medicine. In 1996, 477,000 
Americans died of coronary heart disease. According to government 
statistics, there would have been 1.1 million deaths by then if the 
rate had stayed at its 1960s high. 
</P>
<P>
	To help understand the change in heart attack severity, Goff  
studied 4,900 heart attack victims over an eight-year period in 
Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	One measurement of a heart attack's severity is the level of  
creatine kinase, an enzyme released by damaged heart tissue. Goff 
found that average peak blood levels of this enzyme fell 5 percent 
per year during the study period. In 1987, levels were at least 
twice the normal reading in 80 percent of the patients. By 1994, 
this had fallen to 63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Goff also found that in 1987, doctors judged three-quarters of  
the heart attacks to be definite, while the rest were probable. By 
1994, the definite heart attacks had fallen to two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Carole Derby of New England Research Institutes in  
Watertown, Mass., looked at heart attack trends in two southeastern 
New England towns between 1980 and 1991. While the number of 
survivable heart attacks went up, heart attack deaths fell in half. 
</P>
<P>
	During this time, 6,117 men and women suffered heart attacks.  
She found that the rate of nonfatal heart attacks increased 37 
percent in women and 25 percent in men during this period. But the 
fatal heart attacks went down 50 percent in women and 47 percent in 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are having less severe heart attacks, and we are  
getting better at treating them. But the amount of heart attacks is 
not declining,'' Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goff said that quick administration of clot-dissolving drugs has  
certainly helped reduce the severity of heart attacks. But this 
could not explain all of the change seen in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors believe that reducing such risk factors as high blood  
pressure, smoking and cholesterol also have played a considerable 
role over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Donna Arnett of the University of Minnesota is reporting  
results of the Minnesota Heart Study, which followed risk factors 
in about 6,700 people between 1980 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During this time, men's cholesterol levels dropped from an  
average of 212 to 203, while women's declined from 208 to 201. 
One-third smoked in 1980, compared with one-quarter in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Has Worries at Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There's more fizzle than fizz these days in  
Coca-Cola Inc. stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The millstone of overseas economic stagnation has turned a  
once-invincible profit machine into a laggard whose stock is 
helping drag down the whole market. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke stock has been trading in the $65-$66 range this week -- a  
far cry from the upper $80s where Coke traded last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's troubles affect more than just its shareholders. As a  
component of the Dow Jones industrial average, Coke has contributed 
to the average's inability to break through the psychological 
barrier of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While most analysts still recommend buying Coke stock as a  
long-term investment, there is little expectation for a quick 
rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's absolutely no question they have a tremendous amount  
of challenges ahead,'' said Skip Carpenter, who follows Coca-Cola 
for Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``You have to look beyond the near 
term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's chairman and chief executive officer,  
acknowledged in the company's just-released annual report that 1998 
was ``a mediocre year for our stock'' and even, ``the most 
difficult year in my memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Coke's profit fell 14 percent. It was down 27  
percent in the fourth quarter alone. And Ivester told shareholders 
that 1999 will ``be another challenging year, especially the first 
half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's problems are partly the result of a strategy that the  
company still feels will ensure its growth over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has aggressively built its overseas business in the past  
decade, and now has about half of the world's market for carbonated 
soft drinks, compared to 20.5 percent for rival Pepsi, in 1997 
estimates by industry publication Beverage Digest. In Russia, Coke 
surpassed Pepsi in 1996 after two decades of being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	With such once-promising growth areas as Russia and Asia in  
economic trouble, Coke has resisted cutting its losses. In 
Indonesia, for example, Coke could have broken even by pulling out. 
Instead, the company focused on increasing availability and 
affordability, said Ivester. 
</P>
<P>
	That hurt short-term profits, but Ivester has said that such  
strategies in hard times build brand loyalty that will pay off 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	He cites Mexico as an example. That country has been one of  
Coke's growth leaders since its economic crisis four years ago, 
with sales up 13 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall in 1998, Coke's worldwide case volume -- an important  
industry indicator that measures sales of units of 24 eight-ounce 
servings -- was up 6 percent to nearly 16 billion cases. 
</P>
<P>
	And the company has deepened its overseas commitment with a  
$1.85 billion deal announced in December that will give it rights 
in 120 countries outside the United States to sell Cadbury 
Schweppes brands such as Dr Pepper and Crush. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Coke is diversifying, with plans to introduce a new  
line of fashion and sports clothing and a rollout by this summer of 
the ultimate un-cola -- a bottled water called Dasani. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester says the company is sticking to a course of long-term  
commitment to global growth and not rushing to bail out of sinking 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that the global economy is here to stay. Troubled  
markets will improve. And people will still get thirsty,'' Ivester 
said in the annual report 
</P>
<P>
	One Coke shareholder who has kept the faith is Donald  
Wesley-Brown, who sells real estate in northwest Georgia. 
Wesley-Brown said he began buying Coke stock several years ago and 
doesn't get too perturbed by periodic downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Owning Coca-Cola is like a good marriage,'' he said Wednesday.  
``There's times when you get upset with her, but for the long haul 
you know you made the right choice.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Wants To Revamp FCC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's top telecommunications lawmaker  
says he wants to revamp the federal agency that shapes how 
Americans get telephone and TV services. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Federal Communications 
Commission, said Thursday he'll offer legislation to ``refocus the 
commission'' but didn't give details. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and other, mostly Republican, lawmakers have accused the  
FCC of being too regulatory in implementing a 1996 
telecommunications law that allowed cable TV, local telephone and 
long-distance companies to enter each others' businesses. The FCC 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator -- along with Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who chairs  
the House Commerce Committee's telecommunications panel -- also 
wants to limit the FCC's ability to review mergers involving 
telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can no longer treat with benign neglect the commission's  
notorious merger approval process which imposes needless costs and 
delay on the parties,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tauzin, McCain questioned the need for the FCC to review  
antitrust aspects of a merger when antitrust experts -- the 
Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission -- already do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard has defended his agency's role in  
merger reviews, saying it considers factors that federal antitrust 
authorities don't. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also said the FCC shouldn't force Bell Atlantic and GTE  
nor SBC Communications and Ameritech to open to rivals their local 
markets in several states as a condition of receiving approval for 
their mergers. The FCC has been considering imposing such 
conditions on the mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, the FCC won't be inspired to unearth yet another  
new requirement,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the FCC for not removing regulations so the  
nation's Bell companies can offer high-speed Internet and data 
services across local calling boundaries, which technically 
constitutes a long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he'll hold a hearing on the matter on April 13 and  
offer a legislative fix, which he didn't detail.

<HEADLINE> Dad Convicted in Children's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A father was convicted of second-degree  
murder Thursday for letting his daughter and another baby die in a 
hot, unventilated car while he and a friend searched for arrowheads 
and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Crisp, 24, avoided a first-degree murder conviction in the  
deaths of his daughter, 16-month-old Vicky Crisp, and her cousin, 
4-month-old Sidney Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp huddled with family members and cried after the verdict  
was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury was to return Friday to recommend a sentence. Each  
conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. 
First-degree murder carries a maximum of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Crisp left the children strapped to their car  
seats for several hours in April of last year while he and a friend 
searched for arrowheads near Little Flock, in northwest Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died of heat exhaustion and dehydration after they  
were left in an unventilated car that reached at least 130 degrees. 
Prosecutors have said the pain was so severe that Vicky pulled out 
her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Crisp's friend, Justin Griffith, 28, pleaded guilty earlier this  
month to manslaughter. He has yet to be sentenced. Griffith said he 
and Crisp didn't plan to look for arrowheads and mushrooms for 
long, but lost track of time because they had taken drugs and 
alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Panel: Ease Campaign Fund Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign contribution limits that haven't been  
changed since they were imposed in 1974 contribute to public 
cynicism toward government, a retired Republican senator said in 
urging a Senate panel to ease the limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., said the limits are  
``antiquated'' and must be raised to account for inflation. They 
remain at $1,000 for donations from individuals and $5,000 for 
contributions from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Coats said Wednesday that the constant hunt for money takes  
lawmakers away from the job of governing, which reduces public 
confidence in elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing the limits, he argued, would free lawmakers to focus  
on issues and legislation since they would be able to raise money 
from fewer sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Demaris Miller, a Republican who lost a bid to unseat Rep. Jim  
Moran, D-Va., told the panel that she favors eliminating limits on 
contributions from individuals, or at least increasing them to the 
level imposed on political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
	She said existing limits put challengers at a disadvantage.  
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the 1974 law is an example of good intentions gone  
bad,'' she said before describing her difficulties raising money 
and getting her message out to voters. ``I was seriously 
constrained by this 25-year-old ... fund-raising limit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Christopher Dodd of  
Connecticut, expressed skepticism about assertions that lawmakers 
would willingly limit their fund-raising should contribution limits 
be increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``I view the problem as too much money in the system, not too  
little,'' Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said higher limits could increase cynicism among those  
who can't afford to donate large sums. ``I'm deeply worried about 
that,'' Dodd said. ``We've got to be careful that they don't feel 
further disenfranchised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., however, noted that even President  
Clinton, among other officials, has said the limits should be 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the House passed a major campaign finance bill that  
would have banned ``soft money'' -- unlimited and unregulated 
donations to political parties. The bill, reintroduced by Reps. 
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., also would 
have limited issue advertising and expanded disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure supported by a majority of the Senate failed  
to reach a final vote in that chamber last year and also has been 
reintroduced by its sponsors, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and 
Russell Feingold, D-Wis.

<HEADLINE>  Holdsclaw, Peck Earn AP Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw, already  
the first three-time All-American, achieved another breakthrough 
Thursday when she became the first to repeat as The Associated 
Press player of the year in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Peck, who has her team in contention for the national  
championship in her second and final season at Purdue, was selected 
coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were overwhelming choices in voting by AP newspaper and  
broadcast members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, the most decorated player of her era, also won The  
AP's award as a junior last season, when she led Tennessee to a 
39-0 record and its third straight national championship. The Lady 
Vols fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fluid, 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw still had an outstanding  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge came not because Holdsclaw was ornery or  
conceited. To the contrary, she's modest and unassuming. The 
challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help make her 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw arrived at Tennessee after leading Christ The King  
High School in New York to four state championships. While winning 
its three NCAA titles during Holdsclaw's career, Tennessee compiled 
a 128-17 record, including a 21-1 mark in NCAA tournament play, and 
had a 46-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1 on  
Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``We work together and we work 
well. One thing I've found as a head coach, you don't have to feel 
like you've got to do it all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers do work, but they also have fun and Peck sets  
the tone with her positive, upbeat manner. Instead of stomping 
along the sideline and growling at the officials, Peck is 
constantly applauding her players or imploring the crowd to make 
more noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, she can laugh and cut up with her players without  
losing their respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be successful with what you're doing, you have to enjoy  
what you're doing,'' Peck said. ``It doesn't matter if you're a 
doctor or a clerk, you have to enjoy doing what you do. The thing 
that is so much fun or that I enjoy the most is seeing our players 
enjoying what they're doing.''

39-0 record and its third straight national championship. The Lady 
Vols fell one game short of returning to the Final Four this year, 
losing to Duke in a regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fluid, 6-foot-2 Holdsclaw still had an outstanding  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	She led Tennessee in scoring (21.3) and rebounding (8.1), shot  
52 percent from the field and left thousands of admiring fans 
something to remember by matching her career high of 39 points in 
her final home game, an 89-62 victory over Boston College in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been so special,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.  
``She has been a low maintenance player because she does the right 
things off the floor. She makes good decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a joy and an honor to coach Chamique, and I have  
to throw in every once in a while that it has been a challenge,'' 
Summitt said. ``But I like the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge came not because Holdsclaw was ornery or  
conceited. To the contrary, she's modest and unassuming. The 
challenge for Summitt was to take a great player and help make her 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I challenged myself immediately when she signed with  
us,'' Summitt said. ``Because I saw this potential for greatness. I 
don't know if I envisioned three national championships and the 
level of notoriety that Chamique received. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did envision someone very special. So I was very  
challenged because I knew all eyes would be on this player and the 
development of this player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw arrived at Tennessee after leading Christ The King  
High School in New York to four state championships. While winning 
its three NCAA titles during Holdsclaw's career, Tennessee compiled 
a 128-17 record, including a 21-1 mark in NCAA tournament play, and 
had a 46-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	She finished with 3,025 points and 1,295 rebounds, No. 1 on  
Tennessee's career list in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck will join the WNBA's Orlando Miracle as coach and general  
manager when the college season ends, but she has done far more 
than just go through the motions as a lame-duck coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue became No. 1 for the first time in school history and  
will take a 32-1 record and 30-game winning streak into the 
national semifinals against Louisiana Tech Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck counts Summitt among her influences after spending two  
seasons as an assistant at Tennessee. She also spent one year on 
the staff at Kentucky and one season as an assistant to Nell 
Fortner at Purdue. When Fortner left to coach the U.S. national 
team, Peck was promoted to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the combination of all of that, plus the staff I have,  
has helped me so much,'' Peck said. ``We work together and we work 
well. One thing I've found as a head coach, you don't have to feel 
like you've got to do it all by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a team effort. And I think when our team sees us work as  
a team, they work as a team as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers do work, but they also have fun and Peck sets  
the tone with her positive, upbeat manner. Instead of stomping 
along the sideline and growling at the officials, Peck is 
constantly applauding her players or imploring the crowd to make 
more noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, she can laugh and cut up with her players without  
losing their respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be successful with what you're doing, you have to enjoy  
what you're doing,'' Peck said. ``It doesn't matter if you're a 
doctor or a clerk, you have to enjoy doing what you do. The thing 
that is so much fun or that I enjoy the most is seeing our players 
enjoying what they're doing.''

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Nuclear Waste Site Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The nation's first nuclear waste  
repository is ready for its inaugural shipment after 25 years of 
studies, protests and lawsuits -- if the weather allows it. 
</P>
<P>
	A truck loaded with radioactive waste was delayed by fog early  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The tractor-trailer toting three huge stainless steel containers  
must travel 270 miles from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to an 
underground dump in the salt beds of southern New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first of about 37,000 shipments expected to fill  
storage rooms and become entombed by salt over the next 30 years. 
The trip to the $1.8 billion Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near 
Carlsbad was expected to take about eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests were expected along the way. About 40 miles south of  
Los Alamos, in Santa Fe, about 60 protesters were waiting along a 
highway bypass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't be sleeping when the first truck went by after all  
this struggle,'' said Richard Johnson, who 11 years ago formed 
Business Against WIPP. The group is no longer active. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, it seemed pretty hopeless we could stop the  
U.S. government,'' he said. ``But we did for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another protester, Mavis Belisle, drove more than four hours  
from Amarillo, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a New Mexico problem. It's a national problem,''  
she said. ``We're afraid of the whole region being a nuclear waste 
disposal area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excavated in ancient salt beds nearly half a mile below the  
ground, WIPP will contain clothing, gloves, tools and other 
material contaminated with plutonium. The waste is from sites in 
California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Tennessee, South Carolina and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department maintains everything possible has been  
done to ensure safety. Critics contend brine pockets make the site 
unsuitable since brine could allow radioactivity to rise to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to store low-level nuclear waste in the salt beds around  
Carlsbad began in 1974. Because salt creeps, it is expected that 
any buried waste would be encapsulated within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The community of Carlsbad has largely favored the creation of  
the repository and urged its opening, saying it would bring much 
needed jobs to the potash mining region. The mayor and other city 
officials say they are confident of WIPP's safety.

<HEADLINE>  Court Upholds Pinochet Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After deliberating for nearly seven weeks,  
Britain's highest court rendered a decision on the fate of former 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet that allowed everyone to claim 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords' 6-1 ruling Wednesday denied the 83-year-old  
general absolute immunity, meaning he must remain under armed guard 
in Britain while a Spanish judge tries to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judges also gutted the Spanish arrest warrant, throwing  
out all but three of the 32 charges alleging human rights abuses 
during his 1973-90 regime. An official Chilean report says 3,197 
people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In view of the reduced case, Lord Chief Justice Nicolas  
Browne-Wilkinson called on Home Secretary Jack Straw to reconsider 
his December decision allowing the extradition process to go 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet ``is very happy because this ruling has made justice,''  
retired Gen. Luis Cortes said in Chile, after talking with the 
general by phone. ``He now has no doubts whatsoever that he will 
come back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But human rights groups and Pinochet's opponents also hailed the  
ruling -- not only as a setback for a hated enemy, but as a 
precedent that should put other dictators on notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law lords' decision gives teeth to the proposition that  
official capacity cannot be used as a shield from criminal 
responsibility when heinous international crimes are involved,'' 
said Michael Posner, executive director of the New York-based 
Lawyers Committee for Human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is that if Pinochet can be brought to justice, so  
can they,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on the Spanish warrant,  
which alleged abuses committed by his security forces after he 
toppled Chile's elected president, Marxist Salvador Allende, in a 
1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The lords' decision left only three counts of torture,  
conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opinion, Browne-Wilkinson wrote ``there is no real  
dispute that during the period of the Senator Pinochet regime, 
appalling acts of barbarism were committed in Chile and elsewhere 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he agreed with his colleagues that Pinochet could not be  
held accountable for acts of torture committed before 1988, when 
Britain signed a law making it an international crime. Most of 
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon's case consisted of allegations 
well before that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the ruling, Pinochet's lawyers went to the  
High Court to appeal Straw's December decision allowing the 
extradition process to go ahead. The court said the appeal would be 
considered Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chile, where Wednesday's ruling sparked only minor street  
clashes, President Eduardo Frei told the nation that it upheld the 
sovereignty of the Chilean courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon said he was studying the ruling and offered no immediate  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	England's High Court threw out the general's arrest in October,  
but Spanish prosecutors appealed the case to the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-judge panel upheld Pinochet's arrest in November, but  
their ruling was overturned after the discovery that one of the 
judges voting against the general had close ties to Amnesty 
International.

<HEADLINE> Intel Plans Utah Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERTON, Utah (AP) -- Intel Corp. will buy 150 acres to build a  
major research and development campus, a move heralded by the 
governor and mayor as great news for families dependent on 
high-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real beneficiaries of this will be our children and our  
grandchildren and our families,'' said Gov. Mike Leavitt at a press 
conference Wednesday at Riverton City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Sandra Lloyd called it a ``red letter day for Riverton.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara, Calif., microprocessor manufacturer plans to  
break ground in three to four months, Lloyd said, but is not saying 
much about its plans for the research campus. Company officials did 
not attend the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Bill Calder said the first occupants will be the  
350 employees Intel already has in Taylorsville, another suburb 
southwest of Salt Lake, and American Fork to the south, in Utah 
County. 
</P>
<P>
	In talks with state and city officials over the past year, Intel  
has said the campus could eventually employ 6,000 to 8,000 in seven 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Leavitt said, the jobs will be good ones. ``These are  
better than average jobs. These are family wage jobs,'' the 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials have been told the jobs would pay an average of  
$50,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder said Intel exercised a purchase option for the acreage  
Wednesday. The company had notified the city of its plan Tuesday 
evening, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	The land, now a welfare farm belonging to The Church of Jesus  
Christ of Latter-day Saints, is along the Bangerter Highway, which 
leads to the Salt Lake International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	That access was a key part of Intel's decision to put its  
research facility in Utah, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was impressed by the state's ``good business climate'' and  
the ``tremendous support'' local officials have given the project, 
Calder said, as well as the proximity of the land to major 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials have said the proximity to two universities  
with engineering programs -- the University of Utah in Salt Lake and 
Brigham Young University in Provo -- also was an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Calder said the company has no firm construction time line or  
schedule, nor a firm construction plan for the first building. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's Business and Economic Development Board in September  
gave the company a $5 million industrial assistance loan, the 
largest the state has ever offered as a business development 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan will become a grant provided Intel creates 6,000 to  
8,000 jobs with salaries averaging $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverton City Council in November approved the master site  
plan of the Intel campus' first phase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverton council in December also approved several  
incentives to draw Intel. Among other things, it established an 
Economic Development Area to freeze the taxable value of the 150 
acres that will become home to Intel's campus and adopted a budget 
that gives the microchip manufacturer more than $10 million in tax 
incentives over a 12-year period to offset the cost of roads, 
utilities and other improvements to the site.

<HEADLINE> Mercury Goes Online To Debut Sable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- As part of a campaign to recast its stodgy image,  
Mercury is going online to debut its 2000 Sable, the automaker's 
flagship family sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the facelifted Sable is proof that Ford Motor Co.  
is committed to the Mercury brand. Analysts have said recently that 
Ford is considering doing away with Mercury over the next several 
years as the No. 2 automaker focuses more product and attention on 
Lincoln as its U.S. luxury brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mercury is planning to bring to market new versions of several  
products over the next couple of years -- hardly a sign of a brand 
with a limited future,'' Ford sales chief Bob Rewey said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has been trying to update Mercury's image to attract  
younger buyers. It introduced the sporty Cougar coupe last year -- 
the only Mercury car that's not a Ford clone. It also moved the 
division's headquarters to Irvine, Calif., from Dearborn, Mich., to 
expose its product planners, engineers and executives to the trendy 
California market, where import brands are far more popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came to California to do things differently,'' Lincoln  
Mercury President Mark Hutchins said. In fact, Mercury will reveal 
the Sable at a venue where such debuts are rare: the San Diego auto 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury is hoping the new design of the Sable will attract  
younger buyers while still retaining loyal older buyers. The 
average age of Sable buyers is around 62, spokesman Jim Trainor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sable launch is scheduled to be broadcast on the World Wide  
Web starting at 1 p.m. EST Wednesday at www.mercuryvehicles.com. 
The Web launch will be followed by virtual chat rooms in which Ford 
President Jac Nasser and other executives will answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch also will be broadcast to journalists attending the  
larger New York International Auto Show's media preview. The Sable 
is the Mercury twin of the Ford Taurus, which is being unveiled 
Tuesday in New York. Both are receiving sheet-metal facelifts for 
the 2000 model year and go on sale next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Web launches are becoming more common. Saab, which is half-owned  
by General Motors Corp., plans to broadcast the introduction of its 
high-performance 9-3 Viggen sedan from the New York show at 3 p.m. 
EST Tuesday, but it will be tape-delayed. The ``webcast'' can be 
reached at www.saabusa.com/viggen.

<HEADLINE> Senators Support Defending Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States takes ``very seriously'' its  
obligation to help Taiwan maintain its self-defense, a senior 
Pentagon official said Thursday at a Senate hearing marking the 
20th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do so not only because it is mandated by U.S. law,''  
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs 
Franklin Kramer said, ``but also because it is in our own national 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose  
chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on Wednesday joined Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., in introducing a bill to enhance U.S. security 
ties to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Helms-Torricelli measure was put forth against a background  
of deteriorating U.S.-Chinese relations and growing concern over 
Chinese moves to deploy more missiles along the Taiwan Straits 
facing Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	It would prohibit any politically motivated reduction in arms  
sales and authorize a broad array of defense articles, including 
missile defense systems, satellite early warning data, diesel 
submarines and advanced air-to-air missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also increase U.S. staff at the American  
Institute in Taiwan, the office that has represented American 
interests since the United States broke ties with Taiwan and 
recognized China in 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act was passed at 
that time to state U.S. commitment to a peaceful resolution to the 
question of Taiwan's future and to ensuring that Taiwan can defend 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The third part of the measure would be to establish direct  
communications between the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries and expand 
military exchanges and joint training. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill does not alter our commitments under the Taiwan  
Relations Act. Rather, it ensures that Taiwan's security needs are 
adequately met,'' Torricelli said at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, said it was a  
mistake for the Reagan administration, in a 1982 communique, to 
agree to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan, and for the Clinton 
administration to deny submarine sales to Taiwan on the grounds 
that subs are offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan Relations Act, he said, compels the United States to  
provide defensive arms to Taiwan based solely on U.S. 
determinations of Taiwan's needs, he said, ``meaning that Beijing's 
opinion doesn't count.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> MSU Is THE School in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Blue-collar work ethic has replaced brash  
and flash in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the days of baggy pants and Michigan's Fab Five  
dominating the college basketball scene in the Great Lakes State. 
It's been replaced by the green and white of Michigan State's 
Flintstones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's noteworthy that the Spartans are now the dominant  
recruiting school in Michigan,'' said Bob Gibbons, who ranks 
college recruits at All Star Sports Publications in Lenoir, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State finds itself in the same position Michigan was in  
during the early 1990s, when the Fab Five made successive 
appearances in the NCAA title game and had many high school 
basketball players longing to wear maize and blue, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan State was really unable to break through'' in  
recruiting those years, he said. ``Michigan had such a stranglehold 
on the top prospects in your state. It was a great imbalance 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, all that has changed. The Wolverines finished the season  
with a 12-19 record, 5-11 in the Big Ten. They weren't eligible for 
the NCAA tournament or the National Invitation Tournament, missing 
a postseason berth for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	And Michigan State coach Tom Izzo's years of recruiting in  
Michigan's shadow are over, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Spartans don't win any more games in the NCAA  
tournament, making it to the Final Four will help Izzo and his 
staff recruit more top prospects, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't put a market value on how much that means in  
exposure and with future recruits. Every kid in Michigan has now 
got to be dreaming of being a Spartan,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbons points to the Spartans' recruiting successes, such as  
Jason Richardson, a 6-6 forward at Saginaw Arthur Hill, who 
received the Mr. Basketball award Monday and will join the Spartans 
next season. Last fall, Gibbons ranked Richardson eighth among 
recruits nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the Spartans have a 33-4 season so far and have  
won both the Big Ten Tournament and the NCAA Midwest Regional also 
won't hurt in recruiting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In future years, it could help pull in Marcus Taylor of Waverly  
High School near Lansing, now ranked among the top juniors in the 
country, or young up-and-comers such as Robert Whaley of Benton 
Harbor and Kelvin Torbert of Flint Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michigan State has had an outstanding recruiting class this  
year,'' Gibbons said. ``It could be the beginning of not going 
every 20 years'' to the Final Four, but much more often. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Duke sends the Spartans packing Saturday night in their  
matchup in St. Petersburg, Fla., Michigan State fans can take 
heart. With only three players graduating and some hot new 
prospects headed for campus, another NCAA run next year looks 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot depends on who leaves from this team,'' Gibbons said.  
``But from a talent standpoint, they could be even stronger next 
year than this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State assistant athletic director John Farina said he's  
upbeat about next year's team, even as he's hoping this year's team 
wins the NCAA tournament crown Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future does look pretty bright,'' he said. ``With the  
number of key players coming back and the incoming class rated in 
the top 10, it appears things will be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors Antonio Smith, Jason Klein and Thomas Kelley are the  
only three players who definitely won't be returning next year. 
Junior Mateen Cleaves, the team's first-team All-American, has not 
decided whether to return for his senior year or go to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Cleaves' defection would be partly offset by the  
strength of new recruits, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Spartans will still have 3-point whiz A.J. Granger,  
reserve star Morris Peterson and starters Andre Hutson and Charlie 
Bell on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Another new force next fall will be Mike Chappell, a 6-9 forward  
from Southfield Lathrup High who transferred to Michigan State last 
summer after playing for Duke two years. He'll still have two years 
of eligibility left. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the team next year will be freshmen Jason Andreas, a  
6-10 center from Sugar Creek, Ohio, and Adam Wolfe, a 6-8 forward 
from Westerville South High School in Ohio. Redshirted David 
Thomas, a 6-7 guard-center, will play as a junior next year.

<HEADLINE> Feds Seek To Help U.S. Attorneys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Restrictive state legal ethics rules could  
hamper some federal investigations and prosecutions of complex 
criminal cases, Justice Department lawyers told a Senate 
subcommittee Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder asked the panel to free U.S.  
attorneys from complying with such rules, by repealing or 
postponing implementation of a law passed in the final days of last 
year's congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``McDade amendment'' was intended to curb overly zealous  
prosecutors. It is to take to effect April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment pressed by former Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., could  
keep federal prosecutors from using investigative techniques such 
as wiretaps, undercover stings and contacting company 
whistleblowers that are not barred by federal law but are 
disallowed by some ethics rules enforced by state and local bar 
associations, Holder said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Holder said, the law is too vague and would leave  
prosecutors wondering which ethics rules they must follow in cases 
involving more than one state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that federal prosecutors should comply with  
the highest ethical standards, regardless of who makes and enforces 
the rules,'' Holder said. ``But we also believe that ethics rules 
should be clear, predictable and reasonably uniform -- and also that 
they should not unreasonably interfere with legitimate law 
enforcement techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Senate Judiciary's  
Committees new subcommittee on criminal justice oversight, agreed. 
He said federal prosecutors already have volumes of ethics rules 
they must heed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Requiring federal prosecutors to follow state ethics rules is  
generally not a problem,'' Thurmond said. ``However, the problem is 
not that there are not enough rules and regulations for federal 
prosecutors to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's highest ranking  
Democrat, said the law would punish all federal prosecutors for the 
abusive, overzealous actions of a few. 
</P>
<P>
	But an attorney for a Virginia investigative consulting company  
said there is nothing wrong with asking federal attorneys to follow 
the same rules as private lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still unaware of any empirical or substantive evidence  
the department has proffered to demonstrate the need for this 
exemption from the rules governing all other attorneys,'' said Drew 
McKay, legal counsel for DSFX International of Falls Church, Va., 
and a member of the American Corporate Counsel Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has offered compromise legislation  
that would allow the Justice Department to depart from state ethics 
rules in certain cases -- when local rules are inconsistent with 
federal rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Patrick Leahy, in a written statement, said he was  
skeptical ``about granting such broad rulemaking authority to the 
attorney general for carte blanche self-regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leahy also said the overall question of what ethics rules govern  
federal prosecutors has frustrated the legal profession for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two judges' organizations, the Judicial Conference of the United  
States and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, has been 
studying the problem, and their recommendations could come as early 
as this fall, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dean Testifies Against Nixon Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Nixon never intended to sell or use  
for commercial purposes his presidential papers or secretly 
recorded White House tapes, says John Dean, whose testimony here 25 
years ago helped force Nixon's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Dean testified Wednesday, he would have sued had Nixon  
tried to sell tapes of their conversations or his personal papers 
within the Nixon collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never my understanding, nor would I have donated --  
turned over -- my papers, my personal papers, if I had had the 
understanding that they would have been sold,'' said Dean, who was 
Nixon's White House counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean was in his 30s the last time he set foot in the federal  
courthouse. Then, in 1974, he testified at Watergate criminal 
trials in the courthouse. Now, the 60-year-old, gray-haired 
investment banker from Beverly Hills, Calif., is a witness in a 
case to decide the value of tapes and papers the government seized 
when Nixon left office. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean was called as a government witness in a case challenging  
the Nixon estate, which is seeking $35 million in compensation plus 
$175 million in compounded interest for the former president's 
materials, including 42 million pages of documents, 3,700 hours of 
secretly recorded tapes and thousands of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department attorney Neil Koslowe has argued in court  
that if anything must be paid to compensate the Nixon estate, a 
fair value would be no more than $2.2 million plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nixon had sold his materials, Koslowe argued, Dean's personal  
items would have ended up on the auction block as well. Those 
objects included pictures from his office and duck decoys. ``I was 
a duck hunter,'' Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon estate lawyer R. Stan Mortenson objected to the line of  
questioning, saying the estate has never claimed that the president 
had the right to sell, or even intended to sell, Dean's duck 
decoys. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean was in the witness chair throughout day 60 of the trial.  
Hour after hour, he was asked to peruse mundane memos from the 
1970s, discuss scratchy, hard-to-hear tape recordings played in the 
courtroom and testify about activities inside the Nixon White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony, however, was not without humor. Just before noon,  
U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn told Koslowe that he could 
ask Dean one more question before lunch and that he ought to make 
it a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who was Deep Throat?'' Koslowe asked Dean, referring to The  
Washington Post's key Watergate source whose identity remains a 
matter of ceaseless speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that's privileged,'' Dean said, without missing a  
beat.

<HEADLINE>  Mets Sign Hershiser for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Mets decided they'd rather have Orel Hershiser than Hideo  
Nomo, and the former Cy Young Award winner decided New York had a 
chance to get into the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old right-hander, who went to spring training with  
Cleveland, agreed Thursday with the Mets on a $2 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn $500,000 more in 
performance bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of the contenders had a chance, but the other  
criteria came into play,'' Hershiser said during a news conference 
in Port St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the chance to win and to win in New York -- people say  
the greatest city in the world -- was an opportunity that I wanted 
to have,'' he said. ``I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight 
and I enjoy the competition. I don't want to go off to some city 
where it's ho-hum, let's go watch the game, I want go some place 
where we're going to get after it and that's what New York is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Florida, Philadelphia and the Chicago Cubs also sought  
Hershiser. He would have gotten only a $400,000, one-year contract 
if he had made Cleveland's opening day roster. Indians manager Mike 
Hargrove decided there was no room for him in his team's rotation 
but was willing to keep him as a reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem we had here all along is that we didn't have an  
open spot for him in the rotation,'' Indians general manager John 
Hart said. ``We were not going to take any of our starters out of 
the rotation. Orel knew that. We addressed it with Orel. We would 
have liked to have had him here as a protection guy, it would have 
been a great fit for us. In reality, Orel got a nice contract with 
a team that has a chance to win and he's going to get the ball 
every five days. So I'm happy for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came one day after the Mets sent Nomo, another  
former Los Angeles Dodgers star, outright to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine appeared to be upset at the  
demotion, saying Wednesday he had told his players not to worry 
about their performance in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed, I guess,'' Valentine said. ``It's  
regretful. I said it wasn't a tryout camp and that they should work 
on things they needed to work on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine softened his tone Thursday but clearly remained upset.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``As down as I was yesterday over  
losing a player that I had a lot of sweat equity in and a guy I was 
pulling for to do well, I'm even higher that than today knowing one 
of the greatest competitors and one of the best pitchers I've ever 
seen is lined up on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In three spring appearances, Hershiser was 1-0 with a 2.70 ERA.  
He allowed three runs and 10 hits in 10 innings, striking out four 
and walking three. Last year with San Francisco, Hershiser was 
11-10, with a 4.41 ERA in 34 games covering 202 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser has a 190-133 career record and admits he'd like to  
win at least 10 more to reach 200 and improve his chances of being 
elected to the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-time All-Star, Hershiser won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award  
with the Dodgers after going 23-8 and setting a major league record 
with 59 consecutive scoreless innings. He also was MVP of the NL 
championship series and the World Series, going 3-0 in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year while playing for the  
Dodgers, was liked by Valentine, but general manager Steve Phillips 
made the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult decision because it involves a player of his  
stature and given what he's done in his career,'' Phillips said. 
``But I've got to make a judgment in what I can do to have us win 
as many games as we can, and this starts the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo joined the Dodgers in 1995 and won 45 games in Los Angeles,  
but struggled last season and was traded to the Mets in June. He 
went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A Norfolk, the team would save  
Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he does report, the Mets will 
probably place Nomo on unconditional release waivers next Wednesday 
and give him only 45 days' termination pay, $719,262.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Pushes 2000 Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans drove toward passage today  
of their first budget in an era of government surpluses, a plan 
crafted to buttress Social Security and raise Pentagon spending 
while leaving room for sizable tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect we'll pass it,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., predicted shortly before debate began. 
</P>
<P>
	The top Democratic leaders of the House and Senate said the  
Republicans were shortchanging Medicare and Social Security. House 
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said the GOP ``chose the tax cut 
over extending the solvency'' of the programs that provide health 
and retirement benefits for millions of elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget lays out priorities and sets guidelines for spending  
and tax bills to follow later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	As such, it marks a critical early test for the slender 11-vote  
Republican majority and the new speaker. Hastert has labored 
intensively in recent weeks to line up the support needed to 
approve the tax and spending plan. He mollified one powerful 
potential GOP defector, Rep. Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, only 
hours before debate began, and in a gesture of bipartisanship, 
promised a group of moderate Democrats the House would vote on 
their alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.74 trillion Republican blueprint for fiscal 2000  
envisions a surplus of $141.4 billion. The government ran a surplus 
last year for the first time in three decades, triggering a debate 
over how to allocate the money suddenly available by the tens of 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the GOP plan calls for setting aside $1.8 trillion  
in surpluses through 2009 to pay down the federal debt, a step 
designed to strengthen Social Security. In theory, debt reduction 
would lead to a stronger economy and more government revenues to 
pay retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security aside, the GOP budget would boost defense  
spending to $289 billion, $9 billion more than this year and $8 
billion more than President Clinton has proposed. It would also 
increase spending for primary and secondary schools by more than $2 
billion next year, and provide more for some agriculture and 
veterans programs. Other programs would have to be cut to keep 
Congress from breaking spending caps put into place in the 1997 
balanced budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan envisions a tax cut of $15 billion next year and  
$778 billion over the next decade. Republicans argued they had set 
aside more money for Social Security than Clinton and had provided 
money for a more generous tax cut, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued those tax cuts would benefit the wealthy at the  
expense of Medicare and other domestic programs. ``Your tax cut 
gets bigger and bigger as time goes on and it takes huge cuts out 
of all of these accounts, including defense,'' Rep. John Spratt, 
D-S.C., told Republicans at a House Rules Committee hearing that 
offered a preview of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar charges were leveled Wednesday in the Senate, which  
conducted its own budget debate during the day. ``The Republican 
budget is a thinly veiled assault on Medicare,'' charged Sen. 
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. ``It proposes to sacrifice the future of 
Medicare in order to finance a tax cut for the wealthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a rite of spring that originated when Democrats controlled  
Congress and Ronald Reagan was in the White House, Senate 
Republicans demanded a vote on Clinton's budget so it could be 
repudiated. It was, 97-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also took a second slap at the president, voting 99-0  
for a nonbinding provision expressing opposition to his proposal 
for the government to invest some Social Security funds in the 
stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, the Republican leadership narrowly averted an  
embarrassing defeat on legislation that would provide $1.3 billion 
in aid for Central America, U.S. farmers and others. The measure 
passed on a vote of 220-211, and GOP leaders worked frantically to 
round up support after the regular 15-minute voting period had 
elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton promising a veto, most Democrats voted against the  
bill, objecting to some of the spending cuts Republicans proposed 
to offset the spending. A band of conservative Republicans was 
upset that not all the new spending was offset by cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The narrow escape illustrated the difficulties confronting  
Hastert and the slim GOP majority over the next two years if they 
bring measures to the floor that do not attract substantial 
Democratic support. Thus, Hastert met separately during the day 
with Clinton at the White House and with moderate Democratic 
lawmakers.

went 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 games with New York and was 
ineffective this spring, going 0-2 with a 7.62 ERA in four 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nomo doesn't report to Triple-A Norfolk, the team would save  
Nomo's entire $2,925,000 salary. If he does report, the Mets will 
probably place Nomo on unconditional release waivers next Wednesday 
and give him only 45 days' termination pay, $719,262.

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The trade of center Peter Zezel to the  
Mighty Ducks has been voided because Zezel declined to report to 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ducks acquired Zezel from Vancouver in exchange for future  
considerations Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zezel, 33, didn't expect to be traded and his agent had asked  
Vancouver not to move him because of a family illness. Zezel's 
3-year-old niece, Jilliann Carter, has cancer. She is the daugher 
of Zezel's sister, Neda. 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, Zezel took a week-long leave from the Canucks  
to go with his sister's family to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier was made aware of the  
situation and a clause was put in the deal that if Zezel failed to 
report to the Ducks, his rights would revert back to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect his situation and realize some things are bigger  
than hockey,'' Gauthier told the Orange County Register before the 
trade was voided.
