<HEADLINE> Dollar Lower Vs. Most Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most currencies Thursday  
on fresh reminders of Brazil's economic problems. But the U.S. 
currency managed a slight recovery against the Japanese yen 
following a steep fall in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders blamed the dollar's weakness on news that Brazil's  
third-wealthiest state, Minas Gerais, declared a 90-day moratorium 
on monthly debt payments of around $67 million to Brazil's central 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's continued fragility could cause investors to shun U.S.  
investments, as many U.S. banks and corporations have significant 
exposure to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Some currency dealers also cited the beginning of the Senate  
impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton for the dollar's fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.1670, up  
from $1.1592. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, the dollar had plunged to a 27-month low  
against the Japanese currency of 109.88 yen, then gained ground as 
speculators who had sold dollars began buying them back. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 111.04 Japanese yen late Thursday, down  
from 112.66 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In European markets, the pound edged slightly lower after the  
Bank Of England cut interest rates, citing a continuing slowdown of 
the British economy and international risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound, which is not part of the euro, was quoted at  
$1.6513, down from $1.6556. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro recovered from Wednesday's volatility, trading in a  
narrow range all day. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6756 German 
marks, down from 1.6872 late Wednesday; 1.3753 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.3934; 5.6211 French francs, down from 5.6593; 1,658.37 
Italian lire, down from 1,669.45. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5129 Canadian dollars, up from  
1.5106.

<HEADLINE> After-School Plans Will Get Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to triple to $600  
million the budget for after-school programs, seizing on an 
initiative popular both with working parents and with Republicans 
who hold the government's purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Clinton proposes tying the funds to his  
campaign against ``social promotion'' in schools, the practice of 
moving children to the next grade with their age group but without 
regard to whether they've mastered the material. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, his wife Hillary and Vice President Al Gore were  
unveiling the proposal -- the latest in a series of advance peeks at 
Clinton's Jan. 19 State of the Union address and fiscal 2000 budget 
-- in an East Room ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton submits his budget to Congress in February, he will  
call for tripling the $200 million that the federal government is 
spending this year on educational and recreational programs meant 
to occupy the children of working parents after school and during 
summer recess. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration estimates that more than 28 million  
school-age children have both parents or their only parent in the 
work force, and at least 5 million of those children are left home 
alone after school. Studies show that half of violent juvenile 
crime occurs between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., when children are 
unsupervised and more likely to experiment with drugs, alcohol and 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser,  
called the programs ``most successful and most popular'' among 
congressional Republicans who control the appropriations process 
and who have rejected other Clinton spending proposals in favor of 
their own ideas on increased local control, better teachers and 
education savings accounts that promote family choice. 
</P>
<P>
	After-school funds have jumped from $1 million in fiscal 1997,  
to $40 million in 1998, to $200 million in this budget year, which 
ends Sept. 30, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has attracted broad bipartisan support and there are  
enormous demands for it by school districts around the country and 
by parents,'' Reed said. ``It addresses one of parents' greatest 
worries -- a safe place for the kids when their parents are at 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department's last grant competition for the ``21st  
Century Learning Center'' funds yielded 10 applicants for every 
award, Reed said. ``And even with the tripling of the program, 
we're not going to be able to meet the full demand because there 
are so many working parents and so many unsupervised kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's new budget proposal, the Education Department  
would give priority to those districts with concrete policies to 
stop social promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Reed said, to get extra points in the grant-making  
competition, a district would have to show it requires students to 
demonstrate they have met each grade's academic standards before 
being promoted; or that it has after-school tutoring and mandatory 
summer school to ensure kids are actually learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The $400 million increase is paltry compared to the billions  
more Clinton is seeking for military and long-term care 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that much in the scheme of the whole budget, but it  
is a priority,'' Reed said, noting that Clinton's after-school 
initiative is one of the fastest growing domestic programs and is 
slated for the biggest percentage funding increase of any federal 
education project. 
</P>
<P>
	The president would pay for the increase through unspecified  
spending cuts in other areas, which will not be delineated until he 
submits his formal budget next month, Reed said.

crackdown on drug dealing and a gang turf war that has left 12 
people dead and as many wounded in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments charge 16 members of the John Doe gang and 10  
members of a rival gang, Cloud Nine, with federal drug, firearms, 
and money laundering counts that could put them behind bars for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had different drug holds, different organizations and  
(were) fighting for the same customers,'' said U.S. Attorney Thomas 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen people were arrested in police stings Thursday morning.  
Authorities seized dozens of hand guns, assault rifles, bullet 
proof vests and hand grenades, as well as $250,000 cash and more 
than 13 pounds of crack cocaine with a street value of about 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people were already in state custody, and police were  
looking for the other six.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philadelphia Cop Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The first openly gay police recruit signed  
up through a campaign to reach out to homosexuals shot himself to 
death near the Liberty Bell, apparently distraught over the breakup 
with a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Kalt Jr., 26, shot himself Wednesday with his service  
revolver just a month after reaching his goal of joining the force. 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the gay community fear the suicide could brand  
homosexual officers as unstable. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about the ability of gay officers to serve, it is  
about the personal tragedy of one man,'' Andrew S. Park, executive 
director of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, said 
Thursday. ``Many lesbians and gay men are serving with distinction 
in the police force in Philadelphia and across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt spoke glowingly of his treatment by colleagues when he  
graduated from the academy Dec. 15, saying he felt no need to hide 
his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``During my training they were always there for support,'' he  
said then. But Tuesday he signed resignation papers, beginning his 
severance from the department. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he walked onto a grassy slope in a park near  
Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell pavilion, pulled out the 
service weapon he still had not turned in, and shot himself in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner John Timoney said Kalt left two suicide  
notes he would not detail that indicated the rookie officer was 
``distressed,'' but not about his job.	   Police spokeswoman Capt. Linda MacLachlin said new officers 
often find work on the street more stressful than life in the 
police academy. But she said there was no indication that was what 
troubled Kalt. 
</P>
<P>
	The suicide notes, she said, ``indicate he was troubled by  
personal issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Chumley, a gay activist who said he had known Kalt for four  
or five years, told The Philadelphia Inquirer he was depressed over 
breaking up with a boyfriend about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really not taking it well,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kalt's father, Thomas Kalt. Sr., said he was upset about media  
coverage of his son's death and would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt had been signed up via a recruitment campaign begun in  
1989, with fliers and speeches to gay organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first recruit to openly declare his homosexuality,  
said Sgt. Fred Cotton, supervisor of the police recruiting unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hurts,'' Cotton said. ``He was a good kid.''

<HEADLINE> New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Send your cards and letters now, before the  
price goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal rates increase Sunday for the first time in four years,  
raising the cost of the basic first-class letter to 33 cents, up a 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four years, we needed a small increase that was just  
enough to continue our investments to maintain quality customer and 
delivery service,'' said Frank P. Brennan, postal vice president 
for corporate relations. ``We have plenty of stamps and are ready 
to serve our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase takes effect despite four straight, highly  
profitable years for the post office, which says it needs added 
cash to buy equipment, cover rising costs and reduce outstanding 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Robinson of the National Minority Business Council,  
denounced the increase, charging that ``there is not one good 
reason'' advanced by the Postal Service to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the rate increase had been expected to take effect  
last summer, but it was postponed at the urging of the Postal Rate 
Commission and Congress, which noted the continuing strong profits 
being rung up by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office made a profit of $550 million for the fiscal  
year that ended in September, following three years of profits of 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the post office says rising costs are eating into  
income and it still faces some $4 billion in losses accumulated 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 33-cent stamps went on sale Tuesday, with first-day  
ceremonies in Los Angeles. It's the Chinese New Year stamp 
commemorating the year of the hare. In addition, there are millions 
of undenominated ``H'' rate stamps available at post offices to 
cover the 33-cent rate, as well as 1-cent stamps that can be added 
to leftover 32-centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail without enough postage will be delivered postage due. If  
the recipient declines to pay the extra postage the item will be 
returned to the sender. Most businesses refuse postage-due items. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials like to point out that their domestic price is  
a bargain compared to some other countries. For example, Germany 
charges 66 cents for first-class postage, Switzerland 65 cents, 
France, 53 cents, Italy, 48 cents and Britain 44 cents. On the 
other hand, the rate is 30 cents in Canada and 23 cents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. stamp price goes up for the basic one-ounce  
letter, for heavier letters there is a one-cent reduction -- to 22 
cents -- in the charge for each additional ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	That means someone sending a two-ounce letter would pay 55  
cents, the same as at present. And a three ounce missive, say a 
long letter with some photos, would cost 77 cents, a penny less 
than current rates. The current rates took effect Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rates cover most types of mail. In other typical price  
changes a priority mail package will rise from $3 to $3.20; sending 
a local newspaper will cost 15.7 cents, up from 14.5 cents; the 
price to mail a national magazine will rise from 27.1 cents to 29.1 
cents and a basic parcel post package that cost $2.42 to send will 
rise to $2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase does have a somewhat complicated impact on the  
special stamp issued last year to raise money for research on 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp costs 40 cents and is valid for 32-cents postage, with  
up to 8 cents going to research. 
</P>
<P>
	That stamp will remain on sale for 40 cents, and starting Sunday  
will be valid for 33 cents postage, meaning that up to 7 cents will 
go to research for each stamp sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, breast cancer stamps sold before Sunday remain  
valid for just 32-cents postage and people using them after Sunday 
should add a 1-cent stamp to cover the new rate. But, practically 
speaking, the post office has no way of knowing then the stamp was 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's rate increase does not affect international mail.  
</P>
<P>
	An increase is expected in July for some mail going overseas,  
though for half-ounce letters to most countries the price is 
expected to remain at the current 60 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only expected increase for a foreign letter will be for mail  
to Canada, which now costs 46 cents for the first half-ounce. That 
new rate has not been announced.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Dr. Weil To Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Championing folk medicine and homeopathic remedies  
has made Dr. Andrew Weil popular with the public. The medical 
establishment isn't as impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old Weil is scheduled to receive a honorary  
doctorate Sunday from the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy, and 
some mainstream physicians are infuriated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jerome Kassirer, editor in chief of the New England Journal  
of Medicine, said the college's honor inappropriately legitimizes 
Weil's points of view. The journal's editor in chief emeritus, Dr. 
Arnold S. Relman, wrote a blistering critique of the 
Harvard-trained Weil in a Dec. 14 New Republic cover story. 
</P>
<P>
	Weil did not return a call Wednesday seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Relman objected to Weil's increasingly popular notion that  
traditional and alternative treatments can be used in conjunction 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are not two kinds of medicine,'' Relman wrote. ``Nor, as  
Andrew Weil and his friends also would have us believe, are there 
two kinds of thinking, or two ways to find out which treatments 
work and which do not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That followed criticism in September in the journal, which  
criticized New Age medicine advocates for their heavy reliance on 
anecdote and lack of clinical research into the effectiveness of 
various remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	But those doctors may be on the losing end of a debate over the  
possibility that traditional, or allopathic, and alternative 
medicines can coexist peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey published in the Journal of the American Medical  
Association showed that the percentage of people using at least one 
of 16 alternative therapies during the previous year increased from 
33.8 percent in 1990 to 42.1 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most popular therapies included herbal medicine,  
massage, megavitamins, self-help groups, folk remedies, energy 
healing, and homeopathy. 
</P>
<P>
	They've all been promoted by Weil, who has appeared on the cover  
of Time and the magazine's list of the 25 most influential people 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	His book ``8 Weeks to Optimum Health'' was a best seller for  
more than a year, and his clinic at the University of Arizona, 
which opened in August 1997, has more than 1,000 people on its 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to honoring Weil, the Massachusetts college is  
planning to open a new center that will evaluate alternative 
therapies and test herbal remedies such as magnolia tree bark for 
irritable bowel syndrome. It is the first of the nation's 80 
pharmacy schools to do so.

<HEADLINE> Biographers Take On Mrs. Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's turbulent marriage and  
her political partnership with the president will be under the 
microscope in dueling biographies by Pulitzer Prize-winner Carl 
Bernstein and best-selling author Gail Sheehy. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect Mrs. Clinton to sit down and talk with either  
author. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she will do any interviews. At some point there  
is speculation about whether she will write a book, and, frankly, 
she would be the best source for her book,'' Mrs. Clinton's 
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, whose Watergate work with Bob Woodward in The  
Washington Post helped bring down President Nixon, has signed a 
deal with Alfred A. Knopf. Sheehy, author of the best seller 
``Passages,'' is expected to announce a deal by next week, said her 
agent, Lynn Nesbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Both work as contributing writers to Vanity Fair magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	In the race to publish, Sheehy appears to have the jump on  
Bernstein with a 15,000-word article exploring the Clintons' 
marriage in Vanity Fair's February issue, which hit newsstands 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Relying on interviews with family, friends, unidentified  
associates, aides and lawyers and on previous interviews with Mrs. 
Clinton, Sheehy characterized the first lady as a woman with two 
identities: a moral Methodist and a radical feminist. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have helped Mrs. Clinton with her marriage and her public  
life, says Sheehy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her life strategy, decided long ago, was to take the raw  
material of a brilliant, emotionally battered child with a good 
heart and a desperate ambition and shape him into a political star. 
... It took a Hillary to raise a president,'' Sheehy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Clintons moved to the White House, Sheehy wrote,  
``Hillary believed that, at last, Bill would be more or less 
exclusively hers. If not because of a change of heart, then because 
of diminished opportunity. She told friends they had grown closer 
than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when the allegations of sexual improprieties arose,  
``Hillary adopted a Valkyrian battle mode in order to save her 
marriage. Presumably, she learned not only to rationalize, but even 
to capitalize on her husband's weaknesses,'' the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	The article speculated that Clinton would fight to keep his  
marriage, quoting Betsy Wright, who was Clinton's chief of staff 
while he was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``That man would lie down and kill himself before he would let  
her leave,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehy's book is due out in a year at most, Nesbit said.  
Bernstein said he has just started the research and would not 
speculate on a publication date, nor would he discuss the terms of 
the book deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I've always done, and I really believe is  
that books speak for themselves. The last thing I would do is talk 
about what's going to be in a book that I haven't even written,'' 
he said. ``We are in the early stages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheehy has written nine books and also has contributed to New  
York magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein is the coauthor of ``All the President's Men,'' ``The  
Final Days'' and ``His Holiness: John Paul II and the Hidden 
History of Our Time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed and soybean  
futures prices lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures drifted lower in reaction to lower-than-expected  
weekly export sales figures. The U.S. Agriculture Department 
reports export sales for soybeans were slightly more than 216,000 
metric tons. That is at the lower end of the 200,000 to 500,000 
metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices retreated as the market consolidated  
yesterday's big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher on news wheat exports totaled 327,000  
metric tons, higher than the 250,000 metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 1 cent higher at $2.88 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 3/4 cent lower at $2.23 a bushel; March oats were a 1/4

lower at $5.48 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures were lower and pork futures prices higher in  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle were .47 cent lower at 61.70 cents a pound;  
January feeder cattle were .22 cent lower at 71.45 cents a pound;

<HEADLINE> Holmgren Talks With Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Amid speculation that he might become the  
next coach of the Seattle Seahawks, Mike Holmgren talked for hours 
Thursday with club president Bob Whitsitt, then moved on to dinner 
with billionaire owner Paul Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, coach of the Green Bay Packers for seven seasons, left  
Seahawks headquarters with his agent Bob LaMonte and Whitsitt 
shortly after 6 p.m. PDT, after about five hours of talks with team 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Whitsitt spoke.  
</P>
<P>
	``The meeting was productive,'' he said. ``Obviously, we still  
have more conversations to continue with, which we will be doing 
into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I said earlier, we're not going to give you a big  
play-by-play every time we're interviewing people. But I guess you 
know he's here and we're talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren issued a statement through the Seahawks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a good day getting to know Bob, Randy (Mueller,  
the Seahawks' vice president of football operations) and the 
organization and we will continue to talk,'' he said. ``I've been 
impressed with a number of things, including the design of the new 
stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt and Holmgren also met for several hours Thursday  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks wouldn't confirm that the next move involved  
meeting with Allen, but LaMonte told ESPN that dinner with the 
Microsoft co-founder was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	LaMonte told ESPN the Seahawks' interest in Holmgren was  
``deadly serious,'' but emphasized no formal offer had yet been 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN said Holmgren had put scheduled trips to Baltimore and  
Philadelphia on hold while he listens to the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt refused to say whether the talks would continue Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are interviewing Holmgren for their vacant head  
coaching job. He has said he would like a position in which he 
would be general manager as well as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks reportedly are willing to give Holmgren a $21  
million, five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle fired Dennis Erickson after the season when the Seahawks  
missed making the playoffs for the 10th year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, 50, coached the Packers to victory two years ago in  
the Super Bowl, but his team was eliminated by San Francisco in the 
first round of this season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew to Seattle on Wednesday night. LaMonte was here on  
Wednesday for preliminary talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren has until Jan. 25 to decide whether to leave Green Bay.  
</P>
<P>
	If the Seahawks sign Holmgren to become their coach and GM, it  
will cost the franchise a second-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks also have interviewed their assistant head coach,  
Pete Rodriguez, and Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Jim 
Haslett for their coaching job.

<HEADLINE> The Good and Bad to NBA Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This is the cloud: Latrell Sprewell definitely will be back.  
</P>
<P>
	And this is the silver lining: Michael Jordan is a maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	What the NBA will attempt to do during the next few months, come  
back from the sports world's equivalent of purgatory, is hardly 
without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hockey League did it in 1995, after a strike wiped  
out 2 1/2 months of its season. The National Football League found a 
way to get rid of the bad taste that was left after a few games 
with replacement players. Even major league baseball, coming off 
what was arguably the greatest season in its history, has managed 
to paper over much of the resentment caused by a strike that made 
the World Series disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't be easy for the NBA. There is a backlash out there just  
waiting for a target. Commissioner David Stern might consider 
growing back the beard he hid behind for the first few months of 
the lockout, and some players should consider doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, if the polls tracking fan interest in the NBA are  
any indication, it just may be that most people couldn't pick Stern 
or his employees out of a lineup, anyway. The exception, of course, 
is Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	His return won't make everything right, not even with 50 games  
and a full complement of playoff games. Without him, the odds of 
the NBA coming all the way back don't even make it on the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern is still the shrewdest man in sports and anybody who  
thinks he put a padlock on this season without some very specific 
changes in mind underestimates his resolve even more than the 
players' union did. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA had plenty trouble on its hands before the lockout.  
Merchandising sales have been flat for several years. And then 
there's the occasional player who tries to choke his coach and 
grabs way too many headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this comes as news to the commissioner. It's possible  
that nobody bothered to take the pulse of the game while the money 
was rolling in, but now that it's been done, the depth of the 
problem is easily measured. An ESPN poll in the last few days found 
that 54.7 percent of the respondents said they have ``no interest 
at all'' in an abbreviated season. Another 27.9 percent expressed 
``mild interest.'' Only 11.3 percent said they were ``excited,'' a 
number that was trimmed almost by half, to 6.3 percent, when the 
characterization was ``very excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern apparently got most of what he wanted -- cost certainty,  
which lends itself to competitive balance; a code of conduct. And 
if he gets what he most needs -- Jordan's return -- the lockout may 
yet turn out to be a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	He's already assured of chastened players (for the most part),  
solicitous owners (for the most part) and a new TV contract coming 
on line that bumps every team's revenues from $9 million a year to 
$22 million. And because of the compressed season, he's got every 
team in the league playing four times every week, each one knowing 
the games matter more. 
</P>
<P>
	If the players are paying attention, what they give away in  
conditioning at the start of the season should be made up in 
intensity by the end. Teams with set rosters, such as Milwaukee and 
Utah, and those veteran-loaded squads that have been working out 
together, such as Indiana, may have a decided edge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few weeks, more than 200 free agents will be thrown into  
the mix. Hard to believe, but that's likely to turn out to be a 
good thing. Not only does that promise a shift of power almost 
daily; it promises a short shelf-life for ugly financial squabbles 
and whining, and it reduces the amount of facetime the players' 
agents can command. 
</P>
<P>
	The wild card, though, is Jordan. He's the one player fans won't  
boo, resent or hold out on. He's the one player that the TV 
networks and corporations looking to push product won't shy away 
from. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has yet to make his intentions known, and likely won't  
until he has some idea who else would be back with the Chicago 
Bulls. Scottie Pippen probably is the critical ingredient, just as 
it was when the season ended so dramatically in June. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports Thursday that Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf tried one  
more time to convince Phil Jackson to come out of his brief 
retirement might be an indication that he is sincere about holding 
the team together for one last go-round. If Reinsdorf manages to 
keep Pippen in the fold, or brings in somebody else Jordan can live 
with, he probably returns. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, where else can he pick up enough money to last a  
lifetime for a few months work? 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Losses; Dow Down 49.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks had cut their morning losses in  
half but were still lower at midday, after well-known market bull 
Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs recommended that investors trim 
their stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 49.95 at 9,495.02 clipping a New Year's rally in the Dow that 
sent it up 233.78 points Wednesday to a record 9,544.97. The Dow 
got as low as 9,445.85, down 99.12, in morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 2.41 at 1,269.93, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.92 at 2,329.78. 
The NYSE composite index , which closed at a record high Wednesday 
of 611.01, was off 2.55 at 608.46 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 2 to 1 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 389.88 million 
shares, off from Wednesday's pace of 441 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying stocks had become too expensive, Cohen recommended that  
investors trim the equities portion of their portfolios by 2 
percent, to 70 percent from 72 percent, and at the same time add to 
their bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
	That would bring her recommended bond allocation to 27 percent  
from 25 percent earlier this week. As of earlier this week, Cohen 
recommended the remaining 3 percent of her model portfolio be put 
in commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led the Dow components lower,  
losing 2 1/8 at 76 7/16. It was followed by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, down 
11/16 at 83 5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega was leading in volume on the Big Board and was up 15/16  
at 9 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a sign that investors' confidence in the economy  
may not be misplaced, the Commerce Department reported that new 
orders to American factories rebounded in November, rising 0.6 
percent to a seasonally adjusted $337 billion, following a 1.7 
percent plunge in October. However, workers filed a seasonally 
adjusted 350,000 unemployment claims during the week ended Jan. 2. 
That represented a drop of 22,000 but it only partially made up for 
a big jump of 83,000 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch Communication's shares were up 2 7/8 at 82 3/4 in heavy  
trading on the Big Board, following reports that MCI WorldCom was 
preparing a bid for the company, making a three-way bidding war, 
with Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Group. MCI's shares were down 2 5/8 at 
75 3/4 in leading Nasdaq volume.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Could Lead Cuba Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The owner of the Baltimore Orioles may lead a  
delegation to Cuba in the next couple of weeks to prepare for an 
exhibition game against a Cuban team, The (Baltimore) Sun reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced a proposal Tuesday that would let  
more Americans send money to Cubans, offer direct mail service 
between the two countries, expand direct charter flights and 
possibly let the Orioles play a Cuban team. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos said the team received approval from  
the U.S. government for a spring game against the Cuban National 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles hope to play in Cuba and then host the Cuban team  
later at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But although the Orioles have received a preliminary go-ahead  
from commissioner Bud Selig, they still need approval from baseball 
and the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there must be approval from the Cuban government and the  
Cuban sports ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos said he hopes to leave in the next two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that Bud (Selig) and I have been talking  
about for years,'' Angelos was quoted by The Sun as saying. `Now 
that it has been made part of a policy announcement by the 
president, we need to sit down and talk to all the parties 
concerned. If everybody is satisfied, we can go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos denied he was motivated by an interest in Cuban players.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember ever being motivated by that objective,'' he  
said. ``This is just an interested citizen. Why can't we do 
something together to improve the relations between our people? We 
have so much in common.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Misses Steel Plan Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee chairman who favors free  
trade is urging President Clinton to stand firm against powerful 
unions that seek more aggressive actions to curb steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is expected to outline as early as today its  
efforts to combat the rising tide of imported steel. Sources have 
indicated that a draft of the report is largely an update that 
stops short of outlining new policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was due on Tuesday. Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said 
Wednesday that he hoped the delay did not open the door for union 
interests to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``On an issue this critical to millions of U.S. workers and  
consumers and the U.S. and global economy, I urge you to stand firm 
by not putting politics before principle in your decision-making,'' 
Crane wrote Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Asian economic crisis, imports into the  
United States reached record levels in 1998, resulting in thousands 
of layoffs and other cutbacks at steel mills across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and their unions already have filed  
formal trade complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing 
them of illegally flooding the U.S. market with steel products at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the steel industry, saying more jobs could be lost by the  
time rulings are made this summer, also has asked the 
administration to initiate other forms of relief, including reviews 
that could lead to quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend that fulfilling the industry's request could  
undercut the administration's desire to promote free trade 
globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share a common agenda to boost jobs and economic growth  
here at home by opening markets for U.S. goods and services 
overseas,'' Crane said. ``We must remember that any action we take 
will set an example to troubled economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted that the steel report could  
still be released this week. Officials attributed the delay to 
Clinton's desire to consult more fully with members of Congress. 
Clinton said he had a two-hour meeting on the issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has strong support on Capitol Hill among  
steel-state lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus,  
criticized the administration's inaction Wednesday. He said he 
would propose legislation to allow courts to step in to block 
imports sold below market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't stopped all the steel from coming in,'' Specter  
said of administration officials. ``They have the authority to stop 
it (through such means as) quotas. They haven't done that.''

<HEADLINE> Birthday Bash for Boxer Roy Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. will stage a boxing  
birthday celebration Saturday night, and an honored guest will be 
Shane Mosely. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones wanted to defend his WBA-WBC light heavyweight titles in  
his hometown to mark his birthday, although he will not be 30 until 
Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wanted to make the WBC mandatory defense against Rick  
Frazier, a 39-year-old New York City police officer, on his actual 
birth date, but was blocked from doing it by Mike Tyson's comeback 
fight against Francois Botha on that day at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosely will defend the IBF lightweight title against Golden  
Johnson, who got his title shot three weeks ago after Australia's 
Justin Rowsell, who was Mosely's scheduled opponent, got knocked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones insisted that Mosely be part of the HBO doubleheader in  
the 8,500-seat Pensacola Civic Center. The telecast will begin at 
10 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shane has everything,'' Jones said of Mosley (30-0, 28  
knockouts). ``He's one of the best fighters out there. ``People 
should see him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Mosely could be the second-best pound-for-pound fighter  
in the world, Jones said, ``Easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones (38-1, 32 knockouts) is a former middleweight and super  
middleweight champion. He is considered by many boxing people, 
including himself, to be the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second time Mosely of Pomona, Calif., has  
preceded Jones on an HBO doubleheader. He stopped James Leija in 
the ninth round last Nov. 14 before Jones stopped Otis Grant in the 
10th round at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy he's welcomed me to fight in his hometown on the  
same card with him,'' Mosely said. ``We complement each other's 
style. He's a boxer-puncher. So am I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier, a cop for 17 years, doesn't figure to ruin Jones'  
birthday celebration. He's fought only 22 times (18-3-1, 7 
knockouts) in a pro career that began in 1992, and there has been 
criticism of his No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Frazier shrugs off the criticism. He's just  
happy to get a title shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (15-2-2, 10 knockouts) of Wichita Falls, Texas, also is  
happy to be in Pensacola -- and a bit surprised since he lost his 
last fight on a 12-round decision to Israel Cardona in a non-world 
title fight Oct. 16 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson believes he won that fight, and so does Jack Mosley,  
Shane's father, manager and trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who often fought in Pensacola, early in a career that  
began in 1989, will be appearing in his third championship bout in 
his hometown. In 1995, he defended the IBF super middleweight title 
by stopping Antoine Byrd in the first round and Tony Thorton in the 
third round.

<HEADLINE> Groups Lobbying Against Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- E-mail a congressman. Send a telegram. Write a  
check. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters and opponents of President Clinton are taking to the  
airwaves and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Log onto the Web site of the anti-impeachment group People for  
the American Way, type in a ZIP code, click on a button, and have 
this message automatically routed to the appropriate senators: 
</P>
<P>
	``As one of your constituents, I am asking you to stop this  
witch hunt and move on to more important issues that are facing 
this country. Please do not allow the Senate to waste time on a 
trial which could last for months, and should not be happening at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or call a special number to have this telegram delivered to a  
senator: ``It's time to move on. Vote against impeachment and get 
back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group also has an ad running in today's edition of The  
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the debate, the Christian Coalition has  
delivered the last of its petitions containing 300,000 signatures 
to Capitol Hill. Coalition officials have talked to lawmakers, and 
the group's members ``undoubtedly'' have been calling congressional 
offices, executive director Randy Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process should not be short-circuited or shortchanged,''  
Tate said. ``It's important to let the Senate hear the evidence and 
let the trial go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, conservative singer-songwriter Steve Vaus has raised  
enough money from talk-radio listeners and visitors to his web site 
to buy $20,000 worth of commercial time on Washington radio 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads feature the voices of children asking the president for  
help after they are caught fibbing. ``You can explain lying better 
than anybody,'' the commercial says. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the New Jersey Democratic consulting firm that helped  
Democrat Rush Holt upset Republican Rep. Michael Pappas of New 
Jersey has bought $2,000 worth of TV time on Washington cable 
stations to oppose impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Message &AMP; Media's campaign commercials featured Pappas on the  
House floor singing, ``Twinkle, twinkle Kenneth Starr, now we see 
how brave you are,'' and accused the incumbent of being ``out of 
tune and out of touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's new commercial warns: ``As long as Congress puts  
partisanship ahead of real work, Message &AMP; Media has two words for 
you -- we're watching.''

<HEADLINE> England, Denmark Cut Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain cut a key interest rate Thursday for the  
fourth time in as many months as it continued to try to ward off 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England voted to reduce its base lending rate for  
loans to commercial banks to 6 percent from 6.25 percent. The move 
followed cuts of a half percentage point in November and December, 
and a quarter percentage point cut in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was met with some disappointment among  
manufacturers and unions that had been hoping for another 
half-point cut. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was some relief, however, since many analysts had  
predicted the bank's Monetary Policy Committee would leave rates 
unchanged to give it a chance to assess economic data due over the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the committee members said recent evidence  
pointed to a continuing slowdown in the economy, while the risks of 
more international turmoil ``remain clearly on the downside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They also indicated they expected to see more job losses.  
</P>
<P>
	Following the bank's announcement, British building societies  
and banks began announcing a quarter-percentage point drop in 
mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Denmark's central bank cut its key securities  
repurchase rate on Thursday by 0.2 percentage points to 3.75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came because the Danish krone ``is strong and stable  
and has been so since the introduction of the euro,'' Kirsten 
Mordhorst, a deputy central bank governor told Danish radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, the European Union's joint currency, was introduced on  
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Denmark and Britain are among four EU members staying out of the  
monetary union for the time being. Interest rates in both countries 
are higher than in the 11 EU countries forming the eurozone.

<HEADLINE> Foreman Would Like Tyson at 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It doesn't appear likely George Foreman will celebrate his 50th  
birthday with a fight -- at least not a scheduled one in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Birthday Bash between Foreman, who turns 50 Sunday, and  
49-year-old Larry Holmes on Jan. 23 in the Houston Astrodome 
appears to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman is unhappy that promoter Roger Levitt missed two  
deadlines for payment of the remaining $9 million of his $10 
million purse and was not satisfied when Levitt on Monday posted a 
guaranteed insurance bond instead of a letter of credit. 
</P>
<P>
	So if big George celebrates his 50th birthday with a fight,  
somebody might have to call the cops. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion still might fight at 50,  
something he has often talked about doing. 
</P>
<P>
	So, if not Holmes, how about 32-year-old Mike Tyson, who is  
scheduled to launch his latest comeback against Francois Botha, a 
native of South Africa, Jan. 16 in the MGM Grand Garden at Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to George, and George said he would be interested  
in fighting Tyson,'' promoter Bob Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arum said he has not talked to Shelly Finkel, Tyson's boxing  
advisor, about Iron Mike fighting Foreman, but that he planned to 
do so next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the potential of being the biggest (financial) fight  
ever,'' Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting the vast difference between the two fighters'  
personalities and images, Arum added, ``People would have to be 
intrigued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Foreman has not been promoted by Arum for some time, Arum  
said that ``when I let George, go I retained the right to promote 
him if he fought Tyson, but I never thought it would happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreman-Tyson fight, of course, would draw criticism from  
various areas. Boxing purists would see it as a sideshow. Some 
people would argue that a 50-year-old man doesn't belong in the 
ring with even a faded Tyson, that it's much too risky. Others 
would say Foreman should not risk tarnishing his image by fighting 
a man whose image will be forever tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Foreman-Tyson match is intriguing.  
</P>
<P>
	Foreman cannot match Tyson in speed. On the other hand, age and  
inactivity have robbed Tyson of the speed that made him unbeatable 
in the late 1980s. Also, Tyson's size -- he is a small heavyweight -- 
dictates he must attack. That's what Joe Frazier did when he was 
stopped in the second round by Foreman in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, of course, doesn't put punches together like he did  
back then. He's depends mostly on a stiff left jab and occasional 
rights. But he still hits hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman also would have the benefit of knowing he would have  
nothing to lose. Tyson would have to fight with the knowledge that 
his considerable achievements in boxing would be trampled on by a 
loss to a 50-year-old opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	So why would Tyson want to take the risk?  
</P>
<P>
	Why not, wondered Arum.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tyson may very well be at the stage of his career where  
anybody who can fight a little bit could be dangerous,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Birds Threaten Beijing Air Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Flocks of birds are threatening aircraft safety  
at Beijing's International Airport, interfering with flight paths 
and even forcing the airport to suspend operations on one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	A large flock of swallows crowded runways at the airport one day  
last September, forcing a suspension of all flights in and out for 
more than two hours and ``causing massive financial losses,'' the 
Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem comes despite more than $360,000 spent on equipment  
to scare the birds off, Xinhua said in a report late Thursday 
quoting the Science Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``A number of modern devices using solar energy and computers  
were bought from the United States last April but are not as 
effective as expected as the birds quickly get used to them and 
ignore them,'' Xinhua quoted Du Qingren, an airport official, as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees and plants around the airport have provided a breeding  
ground for insects, attracting ``birds in vast numbers,'' Xinhua 
said. It said 76 different species have been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
	A map tracking the birds' living and flying patterns around the  
airport has been drawn up to find new ways to reduce the risk of 
accidents, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As they have so often before, Asia's top three  
stock markets followed a surge on Wall Street by moving higher 
themselves today, even though no one knows for sure whether the 
region's economic crisis is bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore and Hong Kong, the key indexes soared more than 3.5  
percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei jumped 2.4 percent, but slipped as 
the day progressed, closing only a half a percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	These and many other Asian stock markets also had enjoyed a big  
rally on Wednesday, thanks in part to falling local interest rates 
and the successful launch of Europe's new euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the board, analysts and traders credited today's  
gains to the rally by the Dow Jones industrial average, which 
easily crossed the 9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the first time 
Wednesday. It rose 233.78 points, or 2.5 percent, to finish at 
9,544.97, surpassing its previous closing record high of 9,374.27 
on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also marked a continued turnaround from last fall. The  
Dow, which slid below 7,500 in early October, has now rallied more 
than 2,000 points, or nearly 28 percent, in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, the research  
manager of Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has pulled Singapore and the rest of the Asian markets  
along,'' said one trader in Southeast Asia's city-state who spoke, 
as market officials often do there, on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will continue is another question. Ever since the  
Asian financial crisis began in 1997, with wild fluctuations in 
currencies and stocks, the region's markets have often imitated 
good days on Wall Street, only to see their gains soon fade away, 
due to profit-taking and more bad economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 4.3  
percent, before closing the day up 52.91 points, or 3.6 percent, to 
1,1517.88. The recently modified index, which rose 5.7 percent on 
Wednesday, not only bypassed the closely watched 1,500 threshold, 
but also reached its highest closing level since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index also had a great day, rising  
459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, to 10,693.57, a seven-week high. In 
fact, the indicator has risen 9 percent since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the world's second largest economy, the Nikkei average  
of 225 selected issues rose 2.4 percent before lunch, but ended the 
day at 13,536.56, only 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Nikkei had enjoyed a 1.8 percent improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Japan's markets have been troubled by the yen's big  
gains against the dollar, which hurt giant exporters such as Sony 
Corp. Wall Street's record performance first benefited the Japanese 
electronics giant today, which saw its stock rise for the first 
time in six trading sessions. But by the end of the day, Sony 
shares slipped back into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of 1998, many Asian analysts predicted that the  
region's crisis was showing signs of ending, including falling 
interest rates, stabilizing currencies, and signs of recovery in 
some of the hardest-hit economies, such as Thailand and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But others have said it's too early to tell whether the crisis  
is winding down. Some say that fund managers who have been plowing 
cash back into Asian stock markets in the past few months are 
nervous and could easily set off another market stampede by 
withdrawing.

<HEADLINE> Justice Will Review D.C. Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department began reviewing the use  
of lethal force by police in the nation's capital even before the 
department requested help this week, Attorney General Janet Reno 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan Police Chief Charles Ramsey said he didn't know of  
the federal inquiry when he asked the Justice's civil rights 
division to examine every shooting involving a District of Columbia 
police officer in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they had been reviewing it,'' Reno said at her  
weekly news briefing less than 24 hours after Ramsey announced his 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not notified, but I welcome their assistance,'' Ramsey  
said when he learned of the earlier review. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last November, district police officers had been  
involved in 640 shootings in the 1990s -- 40 more than in Los 
Angeles, a city with six times the population, according to a 
compilation by The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Three district officers have been on administrative leave since  
Tuesday pending a routine departmental investigation of their 
involvement in the fatal shooting of Joseph Robert Durant Jr., 40. 
Officers said they shot Durant when he lunged at them with knives 
after they were called to the home of Durant's father. Durant was 
hit with several bullets, and family members dispute the police 
version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting sparked a demonstration by more than two dozen  
people outside the mayor's offices on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Ramsey's cooperation provides an opportunity to better  
understand problems that confront law enforcement agencies 
nationwide, such as enforcement and investigative procedures and 
education and training. ``We could well use the District of 
Columbia as a model for what could be done,'' Reno added. 
</P>
<P>
	Local activists applaud Ramsey's decision to call for an  
independent probe. ``Past chiefs would not have asked the Justice 
Department to investigate themselves,'' said Mark Thompson, 
chairman of the NAACP-DC Metropolitan Police and Criminal Justice 
Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are enforcement procedures to be undertaken, we will  
do so with Chief Ramsey,'' Reno said. She noted that a Justice 
Department civil rights probe raises the possibility that charges 
could be filed against current and former officers involved in 
shootings or the police department's investigations of them.

<HEADLINE> NBA Pick Olowokandi Stays Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALONICA, Greece (AP) -- The NBA's top draft pick is staying in  
Europe for now. And once again, the Los Angeles Clippers could be 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Olowokandi, chosen by the Clippers as the No. 1 pick in  
June, joined the Italian team Kinder Bologna in the final days of 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	He will stay with the European club champion at least until Feb.  
15 even though the lockout is over, the Italian team said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 Nigerian, who played at Pacific, joined Kinder on  
Tuesday, signing a $1 million deal with an escape clause that 
allows him to leave on or after Feb. 15. He gets another $2 million 
if he stays longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a contract with us until Feb. 15,'' said Roberto  
Brunamonti, Kinder's vice president. ``We have many important games 
before then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would leave as soon as his time at Kinder is up,  
Brunamonti said: ``He might.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in Los Angeles, Clippers vice president Elgin Baylor said  
Olowokandi definitely will rejoin the NBA team when his short-term 
deal with Kinder ends in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, he'll be on the first plane back,'' Baylor said.  
``He's looking forward to coming back and playing in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A truncated NBA season is not expected to begin until Feb. 5  
with each team playing 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder is not alone in the gamble to court NBA talent. Vinny Del  
Negro jumped from the San Antonio Spurs, and will stay with the 
Italian club TeamSystem Bologna at least until Jan. 31, Bologna 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in Europe could be a plus for Olowokandi and the  
Clippers, giving him some needed work at the professional level. 
NBA players are going to be allowed to begin team workouts next 
Monday, but coaches won't be allowed to join them until the new 
agreement is finalized, with Jan. 18 the target date for camps to 
formally open. 
</P>
<P>
	It was somewhat of a surprise when the Clippers used the top  
pick to take Olowokandi, who grew up in England and has been 
playing competitive basketball for only three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the draft lottery began in 1985 to help non-playoff teams,  
the Clippers have had nine picks from among the top eight players -- 
but with little to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous No. 1 pick, Danny Manning, starred for the Clippers  
before sustaining serious knee injuries and later went to Charlotte 
and Phoenix. Danny Ferry was a No. 2 pick and wouldn't even talk to 
the Clippers, ending up with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess was a No. 2 pick but was traded to Denver. A No.  
3 choice by the Clippers who fizzled was center Benoit Benjamin.

<HEADLINE> Fuhr: Next Season Will Be My Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Blues goalie Grant Fuhr, hampered by  
a series of knee and shoulder injuries, plans to retire after next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr made the surprise announcement Wednesday after Blues coach  
Joel Quenneville said that Jamie McLennan will make his third 
straight start in goal tonight against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``No they didn't tell me Jamie was playing,'' Fuhr said. ``I  
only work here. As long as we're winning, that's all that matters. 
Jamie's been playing well, so it doesn't surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Besides, they need me to get somebody ready. They're going to  
have to replace me after next season, anyway. One more year after 
this one, and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news caught general manager Larry Pleau off guard.  
</P>
<P>
	``What can I say?'' Pleau said. ``It's the first time I've ever  
heard of it. Geez, Grant. ... He rebounds from injury so well. I 
haven't even thought about that. He's been playing well this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my talks with Grant and his agent last year, when we did  
his new contract, nobody indicated anything to me like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quenneville also was surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's news to me,'' Quenneville said. ``I guess at this stage  
of his career, he knows best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fuhr, 36, signed with St. Louis as a free agent in July 1995,  
and agreed to a two-year deal last spring for $3 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	He played on five Stanley Cup championship teams with Edmonton,  
and also has spent time with Toronto, Buffalo and Los Angeles. He 
is 6-3-5 with a 2.67 goals-against average in 17 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 Vezina Trophy winner is 388-274-109 with 24 shutouts  
and a 3.38 GAA in 823 regular-season games, and 86-44 with five 
shutouts and a 2.98 GAA in 137 playoff games.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Cocaine Farming Down in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia, traditionally the seat of cocaine  
production, is also increasingly involved in growing the raw 
material used to make the drug, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Peru and Bolivia have reduced the amount of farmland  
devoted to coca plants as farmers abandon Andean coca farms in 
favor of legal crops and U.S.-backed eradication efforts enjoy 
success, White House drug policy coordinator Barry McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely astonishing,'' McCaffrey said at a news  
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca plants must be chemically processed to become the powdered  
or crystallized cocaine typically sold in the United States. For 
years, Peru has been the leading supplier of coca plants, followed 
by Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	As production declined in Peru and Bolivia and kept coca from  
Colombian processing outfits, Colombian coca farming increased 56 
percent in 1996 and 1997, CIA analysis of satellite photos and 
other data show. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA is still analyzing Colombian data for 1998, but  
officials said they expect to see further increases in coca farming 
there. So far, increases in Colombian production have not filled 
the gap created by decreased production in Peru and Bolivia, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey would not comment in detail about Colombia, pending  
final analysis of the data. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, coca production in Colombia is skyrocketing,''  
McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca grew on about half as much Peruvian land in 1998 as it did  
in 1996. And with fewer plants, the amount of cocaine Peruvian 
plants could produce fell by 48 percent to 240 metric tons between 
1995 and 1998, CIA analysts concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolivia eradicated a record 28,660 acres of coca fields last  
year, or almost a quarter of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey credited enlightened self-interest in Peru and Bolivia  
for reducing the coca crop, much of which ends up in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers see the advantage of getting law enforcement off their  
backs, and they like financial incentives offered by U.S.-backed 
anti-drug programs, McCaffrey said. The governments of both 
countries have worked hard to reduce economic dependence on drugs 
because they, too, see the long-term benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They believe it serves their own national interests,''  
McCaffrey said. ``The U.S. has played a modest supporting role.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyeing 2000 Budget Jump Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to end a standoff that killed their  
budget plans last year, House and Senate Republicans are seeking an 
early, unified front on a fiscal 2000 budget that could include 
$500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, their efforts have included a meeting Tuesday between  
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. 
John Kasich, R-Ohio, who heads the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men found common ground in their desire to write a  
budget that would include buttressing Social Security, cutting 
taxes, and bolstering education and the Pentagon, participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very encouraged,'' Kasich said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	They plan to meet again later this month.  
</P>
<P>
	With the capital focused on the Senate impeachment trial of  
President Clinton, a GOP budget accord would help the party counter 
Democratic arguments that Republicans are obsessed with removing 
Clinton from office. It would also please the GOP's core 
conservative and business constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement would also be a plum for the new House speaker, Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wants Congress to approve a budget 
resolution by April. That resolution is a nonbinding map of 
spending and tax plans that guides lawmakers' fiscal work for the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, House and Senate Republicans were so divided over the  
size and type of tax reductions that Congress approved no major tax 
cuts, and passed no budget resolution for the first time since the 
current budget process began 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans from both chambers say an agreement will be tough to  
achieve and is at least weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	They still must decide which taxes they would cut and how  
deeply, and whether the reduction would be paid for entirely out of 
budget surpluses or with some savings from spending cuts. One 
Senate GOP aide said a $500 billion, 10-year cut was ``in the 
ballpark'' of what was being considered, but said it was too early 
for decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without congressional approval of a budget resolution for fiscal  
2000, which begins Oct. 1, Senate opponents of a tax cut can 
filibuster. That would force tax cut supporters to win the votes of 
60 of the 100 senators to prevail, a tough margin to achieve in a 
chamber Republicans dominate by 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican budget analysts say they expect help from new  
projections of federal surpluses due at the end of the month from 
the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' official budget analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the budget office is likely to project a surplus for  
the next decade surpassing the $1.55 trillion it projected in July. 
That could make it easier for some moderate Republicans to break 
with Clinton's call to prepare Social Security for retiring baby 
boomers before the surplus is used to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Clinton announced that the fiscal 1999 surplus is  
expected to be at least $76 billion, well above the $54 billion the 
administration projected in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to unveil his own $1.8 trillion spending plan for  
2000 on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a budget last spring calling for $101 billion  
in tax cuts over five years, while the more moderate Senate's 
version would have allowed $30 billion in reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Kasich, a potential 2000 presidential contender, has  
called for a 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut, which 
would cost the government more than $700 billion over 10 years. He 
acknowledged Thursday that a reduction of that size would be 
``difficult to maneuver'' through the House, where Republicans 
start this year with a narrow 11-seat majority.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Know Why They're Underdogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jimmy Johnson knows why the Miami Dolphins are 13-point  
underdogs in Denver on Saturday even though his Dolphins beat the 
Broncos 31-21 in Miami three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything that would concern a Miami team is there,'' Johnson  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Dolphins have won a road playoff game since  
1972. We don't play well in cold weather. This year we haven't 
played well on the road. We're physically not in good shape. We're 
playing a place that is a tremendous home-field advantage, and that 
is Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``So anything you think of doesn't make for a positive toward  
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, Jimmy, we get it. The Dolphins won't show up and the Broncos  
will win by forfeit. That's 2-0, so Miami will cover. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Miami will be there and John Elway and Dan Marino will meet  
for the second time in 19 days after playing each other just once 
in 16 NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But yes, the injuries will hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos had a bye and they're at Mile High, where they've  
won 17 straight since losing to Jacksonville two years ago at this 
stage of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	BRONCOS, 27-13   	

</P>
<P>
                   *San Francisco (plus 3) at Atlanta    	
</P>
<P>
	This is the only game in which the line is close; the three  
points are the home-field edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the two regular season meetings, that's correct -- they split  
and Atlanta outscored San Francisco 51-50, because the 49ers went 
for a 2-point conversion and failed in their 31-19 loss in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers have far more playoff experience. But they're also on  
a short week -- six days -- after an incredibly intense win over the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons had last week off and have momentum. They've won  
nine in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is at home, its fresher ... and it's probably better.  
</P>
<P>
	FALCONS 28-20   	

</P>
<P>
                 *Jacksonville (plus 7) at New York Jets    	
</P>
<P>
	The Bill Parcells mystique has grown each week to the point that  
a lot of people now think the Jets should be the favorite to 
represent the AFC in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	But this comes first, a matchup of Parcells and Tom Coughlin,  
one of his former assistants (Tuna Helper?). 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars have the same problem in this game as the other  
teams that played last week, injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Brunell played on a badly sprained ankle in the Jaguars'  
win over New England, but had none of his usual mobility. The 
artificial turf won't help, but the Meadowlands winds could be an 
equalizer, turning the game into Fred Taylor vs. Curtis Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless ...  
</P>
<P>
	JETS, 36-20   	

</P>
<P>
                    *Arizona (plus 15) at Minnesota

<P>
	The Cardinals' season is already made.  
</P>
<P>
	Very little analysis needed here. Even Dennis Green sees little  
need for CoachSpeak. 
</P>
<P>
	VIKINGS, 41-10   	

</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Last Week: 1-3, (spread), 1-3 (Straight up).

<HEADLINE> Jet Crashes, Pilot Ejects and Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An F-16 fighter jet crashed in flames Thursday  
shortly after takeoff from Luke Air Force Base on a training 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Both pilots ejected safely, but a motorist suffered minor  
injuries when one of the plane's fuel tanks nearly hit his truck, 
said Air Force Brig. Gen. John Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The $20 million jet went down at 1 p.m. about 1 1/2 miles north of  
the base, which is in the far western suburbs of Phoenix. Flight 
instructor Capt. Brian Egger, 34, and student Capt. Julian 
Chestnutt, 29, ejected and were not hurt, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots had jettisoned two fuel tanks to try to keep the jet  
airborne, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those tanks nearly hit a pickup truck on a nearby road,  
and the truck's driver suffered minor injuries, Barry said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Triple After-School Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring lessons should be taught ``in the  
schoolhouse, not on the street,'' President Clinton said Thursday 
he wants to devote $600 million to creating programs that will give 
thousands of American children something to do after school. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, the latest from Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget,  
calls for three times the amount of money the federal government 
now devotes to after-school programs. Clinton tied eligibility for 
the program to his effort to halt ``social promotions'' that move 
children up in the next grade even if they did not grasp their 
lessons in the previous one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our public schools must change,'' Clinton said. ``Don't flunk  
anybody because the system is failing the kids. Give them the 
after-school programs. Give them the summer school programs. Give 
them the tools they need to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton unveiled the proposal in a ceremony in the White House's  
East Room attended by his wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al 
Gore. It is among several policy initiatives that Clinton will 
offer in his State of the Union address Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the initiative will make ``the difference  
between lives of accomplishment and lives of hopelessness and 
failure. ... We know too well the consequences of those 
unsupervised hours, and parents do have need to worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the budget he will sent to Congress next month will  
call for tripling the amount spent on the 21st Century Learning 
Center Program, which provides public schools with money for 
educational and recreational programs in the afternoon hours when 
school is out but most working parents are still on the job. That 
program, currently funded at $200 million, serves 190,000 children 
at 800 schools in 46 states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``On any given day when school lets out, tens of millions of  
working parents look nervously at the clock, hoping and praying 
their children will be OK,'' Clinton said. ``With quality after 
school (programs), ... students learn their lessons in the 
schoolhouse, not on the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said 1 million schoolchildren would benefit from the  
proposed expansion. He estimated that as many as 15 million 
children are ``idle in front of a television or out on the 
streets'' between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., when studies have shown that 
half of violent juvenile crimes occur. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation last  
August indicated that 80 percent of those polled were willing to 
allow federal or state tax funds to go toward after-school 
programs, even if that meant their own taxes would go up. The 
survey of 800 registered voters had a margin of error of 3.5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	In awarding these funds, Clinton said, the Education Department  
would give priority to school districts that have policies to stop 
social promotion and set academic standards for students to move to 
the next grade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Recommends New DNC Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to recommend a new  
Democratic National Committee leadership team that includes Detroit 
Mayor Dennis Archer, a California congresswoman and an Indiana 
activist, The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Current co-chairman Steve Grossman announced his resignation  
Dec. 2, less than a month after Democrats performed surprisingly 
well in midterm elections. He said he wanted to spend more time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Andrew, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party and the  
DNC's convention site selection committee, is Clinton's choice to 
replace Grossman as the full-time chairman charged with day-to-day 
operations at the DNC, according to several Democratic officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, one of the nation's leading black politicians, was  
tapped by Clinton to be one of three part-time co-chairmen, sources 
said. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who was Grossman's co-chair and 
the party's main spokesman, will continue in that capacity, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also call for having Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., join  
Archer and Romer in the part-time leadership posts, though that 
move has not been finalized, officials said. She is a two-term 
Hispanic lawmaker who defeated conservative Bob Dornan in 1996 and 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's recommendations must be approved by the DNC membership  
in March, a formality. Officials said Vice President Al Gore, who 
is running to succeed Clinton, had input on the decisions. The 
party plans to announce the new team next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC must prepare for the 2000 elections, when the White  
House and control of the House and Senate will be at stake. The 
party has a debt of at least $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee has one chairman, Jim  
Nicholson, but he is being challenged in elections this month.

<HEADLINE> Most American Adults Are Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Married couples, take note: You're still the  
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau reported today that 56 percent of adult  
Americans are married and living with their spouses. That's 110.6 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
	True, the share has been slipping because of later marriage and  
more divorces. The married share was 68 percent in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	But Census population expert Terry A. Lugaila says the decline  
has slowed, with most of the decrease having occurred in the 1970s 
and 1980s when the divorce rate was rising and many young adults 
were postponing marriage to pursue education and careers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Census figures show that some of that delay may be  
easing. 
</P>
<P>
	The median age for men at first marriage last year was 26.7,  
down from 26.8 a year earlier and a peak of 27.1 in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	For women, it held steady at 25.0, still the highest median age  
for first marriage. Median means half were older and half younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Lugaila said the annual report, ``Marital Status and Living  
Arrangements: March 1998,'' shows a continuation of trends that 
have been evident for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings of the report included:  
</P>
<P>
	--There were 1,348,000 interracial married couples in 1998.  
That's up from 1,264,000 a year earlier but still short of the 
record 1,392,000 interracial couples reported in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some 19.4 million adults are currently divorced, representing  
9.8 percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are 14 million people between 25 and 34 years old who  
have never been married, about 35 percent of this age group. Of 
blacks in this age group, 53 percent had never been married. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forty-five percent of women 65 years old and over were widowed.  
Of the elderly widows, seven in 10 lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 20 million children under 18 years old in the United  
States lived with just one parent, representing 28 percent of 
children. The majority, 84 percent, lived with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 4 million children, nearly 6 percent of all children  
under 18, lived in the household of their grandparents.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Sued Over Education Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida is violating the constitutional rights of  
many of its public school students -- not just minorities and 
immigrants -- by failing to provide adequate education, a lawsuit 
filed against the state alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``This includes the poor, not just black children,'' said John  
Due, deputy general counsel for the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People, a plaintiff in the suit. ``We're 
talking about poor white children. We're talking about children in 
the inner city regardless of their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen minority students were among the plaintiffs in a  
lawsuit filed Monday by the Florida Appleseed Center for Law and 
Justice alleging that the state has violated their constitutional 
right to adequate education. 
</P>
<P>
	The students, who the lawsuit states are from poor communities,  
attend schools with the worst academic outcomes in Florida, 
attorney John Ratliff said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't be required to go to a school where 70 percent  
of those kids are failing,'' Ratliff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the illiteracy rate at various schools range  
from 25-75 percent, and those students lack the skills to hold a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	It was filed on behalf of 1.4 million children in  
underperforming schools. The schools named in Miami-Dade, Polk, 
Okaloosa, Highlands and Bay counties are a cross-section of 
Florida's rural and urban counties that have a large percentage of 
poor or minority students. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys said they are seeking an improvement in educational  
outcome, not a specific amount of money, although the amount of 
education funding likely will be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits have been filed and are at various stages of  
litigation in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Alabama, North 
Carolina, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio and Vermont, the 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush's office is declining comment until its legal team  
has finished reviewing the suit, spokesman Cory Tilley said.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Cops Look for Missing Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- As crime scenes go, this one offered precious few  
clues: two quarters and a bicycle on the sidewalk of a quiet 
residential street. 
</P>
<P>
	One moment, 11-year-old Mikelle Biggs was clutching coins to buy  
a treat from an ice cream truck she heard jingling in the distance. 
The next, the fair-haired girl simply vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, helicopters buzzed overhead as about 100 law  
enforcement officers fanned out on horseback, on all-terrain 
vehicles and with bloodhounds in four square miles of rugged desert 
near the family's home in Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	They were acting on two tips that a copper-colored Jeep seen in  
Mikelle's neighborhood shortly before she disappeared Saturday had 
been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
	The search turned up only a stolen vehicle unconnected to the  
girl's apparent kidnapping, said Sgt. Dave Trombi, a spokesman for 
the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators ended the search late Wednesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we have so little to go on that everything that  
comes in is taken very seriously,'' said Detective Jose Martinez. 
``We're going to continue that effort until we find something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Saturday, police have questioned hundreds of motorists at  
roadblocks in Mikelle's neighborhood, ice cream vendors who worked 
in the area and known sex offenders. The FBI has been called in, 
and a small army of volunteers has mobilized to distribute fliers 
around Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	But investigators concede they have no clue what happened to  
Mikelle, a bright sixth-grader who served on the student council, 
played clarinet and was a member of the Future Scientists and 
Engineers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a freaky thing. It's just so strange there was no one on  
the street,'' said Nick Orlando, a friend and neighbor of the 
Biggses. ``There's almost always some foot-traffic on that 
street.''

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Soar After Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Share prices across Asia got a lift Thursday  
from Wall Street's record close, but news of economic troubles in 
Brazil wiped away some of the gains in Tokyo and Singapore while 
pushing shares lower in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 68.10  
points, or 0.51 percent, at 13,536.56, after giving up strong early 
gains as investors saw their sentiment dampened by bad news from 
Brazil, where the state of Minas Gerais declared a 90-day 
moratorium on debt payments to the federal government because of a 
lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei had been as much as 320 points higher before lunch,  
following Wednesday's 2.5 percent rise by the Dow Jones industrial 
average that sent it to a record high of 9,544.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The news from Brazil combined with the possibility of a  
drawn-out impeachment trial of U.S. President Bill Clinton in the 
U.S. Senate to drive the U.S. dollar lower against the Japanese 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 110.98 yen, down 1.54 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in Singapore mimicked Tokyo's trading pattern.  
</P>
<P>
	An early morning buying frenzy tapered off as investors began to  
digest the news from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices ended mixed, though the Straits Times Index managed  
to retain a strong gain of 3.6 percent, or 52.91 points, to close 
at 1,517.88. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, the Brazil news knocked 1.2 percent, or 4.84 points,  
off the benchmark SET index, which closed at 397.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong fared better on hopes of local interest rate cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which had gained 3.5 percent  
Wednesday, surged 459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, on Thursday, 
closing at 10,693.57 point. It is the highest close in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, research  
manager at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they expect interest rates to come down as early as  
Friday. A rate cut might help revive the local economy now mired in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the benchmark JSX composite index leapt 7.2 percent  
to 457.940 points, as foreign investors returned to the market. It 
was the highest close since Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts warned investors may start selling again ahead of  
the five-day holiday in the Jakarta Stock Exchange beginning Jan. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, the key All Ordinaries Index set records for both  
intraday and closing highs, temporarily breaching the 2,900-point 
barrier. It closed with a gain of 1.5 percent at 2,897.3 points, 
beating a record set April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors poured funds into the local market, finally electing  
to chase equities after hoarding their cash for much of 1998, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian prices closed lower as investors sold  
back shares. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite 
Index fell 0.59 point to finish at 585.89. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks closed higher, spurred by Wall  
Street's advance and improved investor confidence following the 
successful launch of the country's $1 billion global bond issue. 
The 30-company PSE index rose 55.16 points, or 2.7 percent, to 
2,134.91, an eight-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean prices skyrocketed, with a lift from local  
merger news. The Kospi index rose 4.1 percent to 637.59 points. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended sharply higher, as the government's  
stock market support and the record U.S. stock market rise spurred 
buying, especially of semiconductor shares. The Weighted Price 
Index closed up 204.40 points, or 3.3 percent, at 6,404.31. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished higher, following  
gains in the region. The index closed 38.89 points, or 1.8 percent 
higher, at 2,170.66.

<HEADLINE> TV Wants NBA Players Fan-Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For more than a decade, television has put stars like Michael  
Jordan, Grant Hill and Shaquille O'Neal up on a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
	To win back fans alienated by the lockout, says NBC Sports  
chairman Dick Ebersol, maybe it's time for the players to mingle 
more with the masses. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means taking a cue from the women.  
</P>
<P>
	``We want players to follow the model of the WNBA and interact  
with the fans,'' Ebersol said. ``Instead of going back into the 
locker rooms after games, for them to stay out there for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we're not talking about doing this for one or two weeks.  
It may have to go on forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol and his counterparts at Turner Sports and Fox Sports Net  
will play a major role in restoring the NBA's image after the 
devastating six-month lockout that canceled nearly half of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, as the league announced plans to start a 50-game  
season early next month, the networks were not ready to say how 
their broadcasts would handle the delicate issue of dealing with 
the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	But they all predicted some degree of fan -- and viewer --  
resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, there's going to be a backlash,'' said Turner  
broadcaster Kevin Harlan. ``One thing that disturbed me was the 
apathy the fans showed toward the league as a whole. People were 
saying how they didn't miss it and didn't care if it started back 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an uphill struggle for everybody involved,  
including us,'' Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, which signed a four-year, $1.75 billion deal prior to the  
season, will televise its first NBA games of 1999 on Feb. 7. The 
matchup is uncertain until the release of the NBA schedule, which 
will be announced soon after the written agreement to end the 
lockout is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner paid $178 million a year for four seasons and will lose  
47 games as of Feb. 5. It will negotiate with the league in an 
attempt to insert about 20 games into this year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox Sports Net suffered the most throughout the lockout. Holding  
rights to 26 of the 29 NBA franchises, it lost more than 550 games 
through the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
	The league will be adding about two weeks to the schedule to  
compensate for the loss. NBC, which has lost nine telecasts due to 
the lockout, plans to add a few games in that span. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol didn't seem too concerned about making up the lost games  
or luring the diehard fan back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The casual fan will definitely take some time,'' Ebersol said.  
``But the NBA, more than any other league in the '90s, has been 
able to capture the casual fan in the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former NBA coach Jack Ramsay is far less concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that once it gets back going, the fans will come  
back,'' said Ramsay, now an analyst. ``By playoff time fans will 
have forgotten. The product is good, and you can't duplicate 
playoff basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may depend on whether or not Michael Jordan returns. His  
agent said he will wait to see what happens with the rest of the 
Chicago Bulls before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC analyst and former coach Matt Guokas agrees the uncertainty  
about Jordan and the fan backlash is troubling for the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combine that with a shortened season, and it's going to take a  
while,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Outlook Seen Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Aggressive pro-growth policies, as well as  
signs of economic recovery in the region, have brightened 
Singapore's prospects to recover in the second half of this year 
and grow 3.5 percent in 2000, a report by Merrill Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires on Thursday,  
predicts that Singapore interest rates are likely to ``head for 
historic lows,'' which along with cost-cutting policies should 
speed recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch predicts that if U.S. consumers don't disappoint --  
and Christmas sales appeared strong -- then the manufacturing 
recession Singapore is experiencing ``should prove shallow'' with 
economic growth returning by the second half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore is going through its first recession since the  
mid-1980s, with the economy shrinking in the second half of 1998. 
Despite the contraction in the last six months of the year, the 
government said the economy still grew 1.3 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill's report forecast the economy will contract 0.9 percent  
this year but then grow 3.5 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	As one reason for optimism, the report said there are ``no signs  
of troubles'' in the manufacturing sector's inventory position. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous manufacturing recessions in Singapore in 1985, 1992 and  
1996 were characterized by ``severe inventory overhang in 
electronics,'' it said. ``This time around, however, lead 
indicators showed no such imbalances in inventory, orders or 
shipments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch said Malaysia's ``economic setback'' would weigh  
on Singapore's growth in the short-term. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Singapore's exports go to Indonesia and Malaysia, which  
have been most affected by the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Woman Didn't Get Help for Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A woman was charged with not calling for  
medical help for her dying husband because she was afraid she would 
be arrested for having a house full of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrell Puckett, 60, died Dec. 13 after being stricken with a  
heart- or diabetes-related problem at his home in the suburb of 
Whitehall, prosecutor Mark Hunt said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Puckett's wife, Gwenith, tried to help him herself after he lost  
consciousness, then sought help from the neighbors, who asked why 
she didn't call 911, Hunt said. Mrs. Puckett told the neighbors she 
would be arrested, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics were eventually called, and ``found the house so full  
of trash, junk, garbage and clothes that there was no room to treat 
the patient,'' Hunt said. Puckett was carried out, and pronounced 
dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Puckett, 51, was charged with failing to provide for a  
functionally impaired person, which is punishable by up to 18 
months in prison. She was freed on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this 32 years, and this may be one of the most  
bizarre charges I've ever seen,'' said her lawyer David O. Niehoff.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Soar After Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Share prices across Asia got a lift Thursday  
from Wall Street's record close, but news of economic troubles in 
Brazil wiped away some of the gains in Tokyo and Singapore while 
pushing shares lower in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 68.10  
points, or 0.51 percent, at 13,536.56, after giving up strong early 
gains as investors saw their sentiment dampened by bad news from 
Brazil, where the state of Minas Gerais declared a 90-day 
moratorium on debt payments to the federal government because of a 
lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei had been as much as 320 points higher before lunch,  
following Wednesday's 2.5 percent rise by the Dow Jones industrial 
average that sent it to a record high of 9,544.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The news from Brazil combined with the possibility of a  
drawn-out impeachment trial of U.S. President Bill Clinton in the 
U.S. Senate to drive the U.S. dollar lower against the Japanese 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 110.98 yen, down 1.54 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in Singapore mimicked Tokyo's trading pattern.  
</P>
<P>
	An early morning buying frenzy tapered off as investors began to  
digest the news from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices ended mixed, though the Straits Times Index managed  
to retain a strong gain of 3.6 percent, or 52.91 points, to close 
at 1,517.88. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, the Brazil news knocked 1.2 percent, or 4.84 points,  
off the benchmark SET index, which closed at 397.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong fared better on hopes of local interest rate cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, which had gained 3.5 percent  
Wednesday, surged 459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, on Thursday, 
closing at 10,693.57 point. It is the highest close in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, research  
manager at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they expect interest rates to come down as early as  
Friday. A rate cut might help revive the local economy now mired in 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the benchmark JSX composite index leapt 7.2 percent  
to 457.940 points, as foreign investors returned to the market. It 
was the highest close since Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts warned investors may start selling again ahead of  
the five-day holiday in the Jakarta Stock Exchange beginning Jan. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, the key All Ordinaries Index set records for both  
intraday and closing highs, temporarily breaching the 2,900-point 
barrier. It closed with a gain of 1.5 percent at 2,897.3 points, 
beating a record set April 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors poured funds into the local market, finally electing  
to chase equities after hoarding their cash for much of 1998, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian prices closed lower as investors sold  
back shares. The benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite 
Index fell 0.59 point to finish at 585.89. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks closed higher, spurred by Wall  
Street's advance and improved investor confidence following the 
successful launch of the country's $1 billion global bond issue. 
The 30-company PSE index rose 55.16 points, or 2.7 percent, to 
2,134.91, an eight-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean prices skyrocketed, with a lift from local  
merger news. The Kospi index rose 4.1 percent to 637.59 points. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Taiwan shares ended sharply higher, as the government's  
stock market support and the record U.S. stock market rise spurred 
buying, especially of semiconductor shares. The Weighted Price 
Index closed up 204.40 points, or 3.3 percent, at 6,404.31. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: The NZSE-40 capital index finished higher, following  
gains in the region. The index closed 38.89 points, or 1.8 percent 
higher, at 2,170.66.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 70; Nasdaq Is Off 30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened lower. The Dow Jones  
industrial average is down 70 points in today's early going. Losers 
on the New York Stock Exchange hold an 8-3 lead over gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down 30 points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is down eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Cue the profit-takers.  
</P>
<P>
	With the Dow posting a 2 1/2 percent gain yesterday, and the Nasdaq  
hitting its fourth record in a row, Wall Street stands to give some 
ground today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday's record-breaking moves sent Asian share prices  
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But European markets have fallen to profit-taking, setting up  
Wall Street for an early decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, some analysts say there's little to derail the current  
market rally. 
</P>
<P>
	And many investors may view a dip in prices as nothing more than  
an opportunity to buy stocks at cheaper levels.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Candidate Fined for Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Former state Treasurer Kathleen Brown  
and her campaign committee were fined $24,000 Thursday for failing 
to disclose more than $1.2 million in contributions for her 1994 
bid for governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown, who lost to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, could have  
been fined a maximum of $34,000. The Fair Political Practices 
Commission, the state's campaign law watchdog, said it reduced the 
penalty in part because there was no evidence the violations were 
intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown admitted the violations and agreed to pay the fines.  
</P>
<P>
	``This strikes me as a small infraction in the scheme of  
big-money politics,'' said Michael Reese, her 1994 campaign 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the violations was the failure to disclose more than  
$856,000 in indirect contributions from the Democratic State 
Central Committee. The money was used in part to send voters a 
letter from Hillary Clinton urging support for Ms. Brown and Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Owner Likes Cuba Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles owner Peter Angelos is counting on  
taking his team to Cuba for an exhibition game, and then inviting 
the Cuban national team to play in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and other Orioles representatives will soon travel to  
Cuba to work out details. The proposal ultimately must be approved 
by the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	More crucial is approval from the Cuban government and the Cuban  
sports ministry, as well the consent of baseball commissioner Bud 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging. I hate to be the one who makes  
prognostications, but it looks very positive,'' Angelos told The 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles hope to play in Cuba during spring training and host  
the Cubans at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and his son, Louis, are expected to head the delegation  
to Cuba, which also is expected to include Orioles counsel Russel 
Smouse, consultant Scott Armstrong and representatives of Major 
League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	The group hopes to depart in the next two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is something that Bud (Selig) and I have been talking  
about for years,'' Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun. ``Now that it 
has been made part of a policy announcement by the president, we 
need to sit down and talk to all the parties concerned. If 
everybody is satisfied, we can go forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball officials are worried about the possibility of  
defections if the Cuban team plays in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it would happen. I hope it won't,'' Angelos  
said. ``The goal here is to play both games for the purpose of 
using baseball as a conduit for better contact between the Cuban 
people and Americans.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Debates 1999 HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A GOP congressman who helped force House  
Republicans to confront HMO complaints last year kicked off a 
renewed debate in the new Congress, promising Thursday to push hard 
for bipartisan legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., introduced a bill that would allow  
patients to sue their health insurance companies and give them more 
access to specialists and more choice in doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly stronger than legislation Norwood backed last year, the  
bill makes it easier for patients to take their cases to court and 
stiffens penalties on health maintenance organizations that 
improperly deny care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we allowed partisanship and scandal to defeat a  
truly nonpartisan effort,'' he told reporters Thursday. ``We will 
not make that mistake again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and congressional Democrats also have pledged  
to put their ``patients bill of rights'' at the top of the 1999 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood's legislation met a barrage of complaints from insurance  
companies and business groups, who complained that it will increase 
costs and force companies to drop health insurance for their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big government mandates are the wrong prescription for health  
care,'' said a statement from Dan Danner, chairman of the Health 
Benefits Coalition, a group of employers and insurers who led the 
lobbying effort that defeated HMO legislation last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Norwood attracted more than 200 co-sponsors for his  
bill, including dozens of Republicans, and forced GOP leaders to 
address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, he went along with a GOP bill that was considerably  
more conservative than his legislation. President Clinton and 
Democrats opposed it as a sham, and the bill passed the House along 
party lines and then died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Now this time Norwood says he will resist pressure from House  
Republicans and insist on bipartisan legislation that gives 
patients a right to sue that is now prohibited by federal law for 
patients in health plans that fall under federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances may be better than they were in 1998. Last year's  
Republican measure passed by just five votes, and Democrats gained 
five seats in November's elections. Also, the new House speaker, 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., may be more inclined to allow the 
committee process to run its course that last year's GOP leadership 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hastert was chairman of the GOP task force that produced  
the legislation that was so strongly opposed by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwood's new bill was introduced Wednesday, first day of the  
new Congress. Its other provisions include: 
</P>
<P>
	--The right to take disputes to external review plans, which  
could order insurance companies to pay for needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	--The right to see a doctor outside a plan's network, though it  
may cost extra. 
</P>
<P>
	--The right to see a specialist when recommended.  
</P>
<P>
	--Guarantees that emergency room visits will be paid if a  
reasonable person would have believed his or her health was in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Direct access to gynecologists and obstetricians for women and  
access to pediatricians for children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Monetary penalties if an HMO claims that certain care was not  
covered by a plan and it turns out that it was.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Children Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. JOHN, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl and her  
12-year-old brother shot their father's live-in girlfriend to death 
because they thought she was taking their father away from them, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Jones and Curtis Fairchild were charged with killing Sonya  
Nicole Speights, 29, a teaching assistant at a junior high school. 
She was shot in the chest and found dead Wednesday in the master 
bedroom at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the youngsters confessed to the crime.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last week or two weeks they had planned to kill the  
victim and make it look like a burglary or an accident,'' said 
sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Evers. 
</P>
<P>
	The children used their father's gun, which they had taken  
several days before the slaying, Evers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor called 911 to report the shooting after one of the  
children went to the neighbor's home. The neighbor said the 
children claimed they were playing with the gun when it went off 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	The children ran away when the neighbor called 911 but were  
found Thursday in the woods a few miles from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will decide what degree of murder the children will  
be charged with and whether they can be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amazed,'' Evers said. ``I can't imagine a 12- and a  
13-year-old making such a heinous plot.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Still Rebounding From Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Five days after a blizzard dropped more than 20  
inches of snow, the city was still struggling Thursday to recover. 
School buses were not running, thousands remained out of school, 
many streets were barely passable and the train line that serves 
O'Hare International Airport was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	For cold and snow-weary residents, the main issue remained  
transportation. Officials of the beleaguered Chicago Transit 
Authority insisted they were doing the best they could in a crisis 
worsened by years of insufficient funding. 
</P>
<P>
	For some angry residents, however, it was not good enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbearably slow, slower than usual,'' said Joel Johnson,  
waiting at a train stop on Chicago's North Side Thursday morning in 
temperatures near zero. ``The CTA is one of the worst rail systems 
I've ever encountered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bundled so tightly in a parka, hood and scarf that only his eyes  
were showing, Waheed Rehan said the worst delays occur at night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a long time. And the last two days have been so  
cold,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CTA entered the weekend snowstorm with hundreds of aging  
cars, many of them with unprotected boxes on the bottom, where snow 
was able to get into sensitive electrical systems and short out the 
circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday afternoon, the system was still 30 trains short, and  
the line that serves O'Hare was shut down because damaged rail cars 
were still inoperable. The CTA was running buses along the line 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	CTA mechanics were making repairs around the clock, outside  
mechanics were called in and CTA retirees were brought back to 
help, said Frank Kruesi, the agency's president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley said the CTA's problems point to the need  
for more federal and state funding of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's public schools were open Thursday, but school buses  
were not running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been testing the bus routes for the last couple of  
days,'' said Reanetta Hunt, spokeswoman for the Chicago public 
schools. ``The buses are still having a pretty difficult time 
maneuvering on some of those side streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Absenteeism Thursday was 52 percent. Hunt said any of the  
system's 433,000 students who missed school this week would be 
given excused absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Levin, spokesman for the city Department of Streets and  
Sanitation, said crews were doing their best to get the side 
streets cleared but many remained in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent storm was the worst in more than 30 years. Chicago's  
record is 23 inches, set in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Steelers Hire Gilbride for Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kevin Gilbride, one of the finalists when  
Pittsburgh chose Bill Cowher as coach seven years ago, finally was 
hired Thursday by the Steelers as their offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride, fired as San Diego's coach in October after going 6-16  
and clashing with general manager Bobby Beathard, was picked by 
Cowher to replace Ray Sherman only hours after arriving for an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no timetable on this thing, but the more I talked  
around the league the last couple of days, this man was the right 
man for the job,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman quit after the Steelers' offense collapsed during their  
first losing season since 1991, scoring only three touchdowns in 
the last 6 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching the Steelers' offense slump from sixth in the NFL  
in 1997 to 25th and quarterback Kordell Stewart struggle with his 
confidence and throwing during a 7-9 season, Cowher wanted an 
offensive coordinator skilled with quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart had only 11 touchdown passes and two touchdown runs  
after throwing for 21 touchdowns and running for 11 in his first 
season as a starter in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride, who has a reputation as one of the NFL's most  
innovative offensive minds, developed quarterbacks Warren Moon in 
Houston and Mark Brunell in Jacksonville while coaching 
league-leading passing offenses in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old Gilbride also will hold the title of  
quarterbacks coach, the first Steelers' assistant coach to do so 
since Babe Parilli worked with a young Terry Bradshaw from 1971-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very fortunate he was available,'' said Cowher, who  
had a shortage of candidates last February when Chan Gailey left to 
coach the Cowboys. ``He's done a great job with every quarterback 
he's been around, a guy from an offensive coordinator's standpoint 
whose record speaks for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring came so quickly that Gilbride hadn't even talked with  
his wife when he met with reporters. He didn't arrive in Pittsburgh 
until Wednesday night, but it became apparent by Thursday morning 
that Cowher didn't want to formally interview other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher had planned to interview former Chicago Bears offensive  
coordinator Matt Cavanaugh on Friday, then meet with former Seattle 
Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson next week. Steelers tight end coach 
Mike Mularkey also was interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Cowher can be very persuasive and very persistent. It  
happened much more quickly than I expected,'' Gilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride is eminently familiar with the Steelers, coaching  
against them twice a season from 1989-93 with Houston and 1995-96 
with Jacksonville. His teams were a combined 8-7 against the 
Steelers.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Point-Shaving Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The son of a reputed Chicago mob associate has  
become the seventh person charged in a 1994 Arizona State 
basketball point-shaving scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Basso of Buffalo Grove, Ill., was charged with sports  
bribery, conspiracy to commit sports bribery, interstate travel in 
aid of racketeering and a money laundering-related count in an 
indictment unsealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Basso was arraigned Wednesday in U.S. District  
Court in Chicago and released on $50,000 bond; he is to appear in 
federal court in Phoenix on Jan. 20. Basso is the son of Dominick 
Basso, who was convicted in 1988 on syndicated gambling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not reveal what role Basso played in the  
point-shaving scheme. The six others charged have reached plea 
agreements with federal prosecutors, including Chicago bookmaker 
Benny Silman. 
</P>
<P>
	Silman, said to be the mastermind behind the scheme, is serving  
a 46-month sentence for getting Arizona State guards Stevin 
``Hedake'' Smith and Isaac Burton to shave points in certain games 
so the team wouldn't beat gamblers' point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the Sun Devils' No. 2 all-time leading scorer, agreed to  
fix four games for $20,000 a game, in part to erase a reported 
$10,000 gambling debt to Silman, authorities said. Burton was paid 
$4,300 for helping fix two games, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 games in question were those with Oregon State on Jan.  
27, Oregon on Jan. 29, Southern California on Feb. 19 and 
Washington on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, Burton, Phoenix investment adviser Joseph Gagliano Jr.,  
Chicago trucking company executive Dominic Mangiamele and his son, 
Joseph, are awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Willey Case Witness Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A friend whose testimony cast doubt on  
Kathleen Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by 
President Clinton was indicted Thursday on charges she obstructed 
justice and made up her story. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury in Alexandria, Va., working with Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr charged Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va., 
with three counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing  
a false affidavit in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against 
Clinton, lying to two grand juries and attempting to influence the 
testimony of other witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Luque, a lawyer for Ms. Steele, called the indictment  
reckless and said it ``is a glaring example of Mr. Starr's gross 
abuse of his prosecutorial power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Starr has clearly timed this baseless accusation in a  
transparent attempt to unfairly influence the pending impeachment 
proceeding,'' Luque said in a statement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she began receiving phone calls from reporters three  
days ago indicating that Ms. Steele was to be indicted and accused 
Starr of ``unlawfully leaking confidential grand jury information 
to the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers had used Ms. Steele's testimony in an  
effort to cast doubt on the credibility of Mrs. Willey, a former 
White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance toward her in the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies Mrs. Willey's accusation, which became a focus of  
Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In his testimony in the 
Jones lawsuit, the president said Mrs. Willey ``was not telling the 
truth'' and that her credibility had been ``pretty well 
shattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment notes that a lawyer for Clinton approached Ms.  
Steele in January 1998 to get her to file the affidavit and that 
she initially refused, then changed her mind. Ms. Steele eventually 
filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit alleging that Mrs. Willey 
never told her about the alleged advance as she had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr alleged Thursday that the affidavit and Ms. Steele's  
subsequent testimony before two federal grand juries were false. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele ``well knew and believed'' Mrs. Willey had told her  
about the alleged sexual advance shortly after it happened and 
``even related information about Mrs. Willey's account of the 
incident to several of defendant Steele's friends'' as early as 
1993, the indictment charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also contend that Ms. Steele lied to FBI agents  
working for Starr and ``attempted in the Eastern District of 
Virginia to influence the testimony of one or more witnesses in the 
grand jury investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charges that Ms. Steele ``repeatedly attempted''  
to convince two friends that she hadn't told them about the Willey 
incident, even though she had. At the time, one of the friends was 
being sought by FBI agents for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's nationally televised accusations of an unwanted  
sexual advance eventually became part of Starr's investigation into 
Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and 
allegations that the Jones lawsuit was obstructed by supporters of 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele and Mrs. Willey testified before the grand jury in  
Washington that Starr used during the Lewinsky investigation. 
Starr's office then used a separate grand jury in the northern 
Virginia suburbs of Washington to further investigate Ms. Steele 
and other allegations that Mrs. Willey may have been threatened and 
intimidated by unknown persons after her story became public. 
</P>
<P>
	Each obstruction charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in  
prison and $250,000 in fines. The false statement charge carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele came to public attention when she was quoted in a  
Newsweek article in August 1997 that first brought Mrs. Willey's 
allegation to light. Ms. Steele contended she lied to the Newsweek 
reporter at Mrs. Willey's request, and told the reporter that Mrs. 
Willey had confided to her about the alleged episode with Clinton. 
She later told the reporter she had lied. The magazine noted the 
allegation and the switch in the same story. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele sued Newsweek in federal court for breach of  
contract, saying reporter Michael Isikoff had promised not to print 
her name and then did so. The lawsuit sought unspecified 
compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit is still pending. 
Newsweek and Isikoff deny her charges.

<HEADLINE> Investors Back Digital Radio Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen investors are backing a Maryland  
company planning to develop digital technology for radios that 
would produce crystal-clear sound. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Digital Radio Inc. of Columbia, Md., said Thursday that all  
the new investors except one -- investment firm Chase Capital 
Partners -- are radio broadcasters. The new equity holders join CBS 
Corp. and Gannett Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Murphy, spokeswoman for USA Digital, wouldn't disclose how  
much money the new investors are throwing into the privately held 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The other new investors are Chancellor Media Corp., Citadel  
Communications Corp., Clear Channel Communications, Cox Radio Inc., 
Cumulus Media Inc., Emmis Communications, Entercom Communications 
Corp., Heftel Broadcasting Corp., Jacor Communications, Radio One 
Inc. and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said USA Digital hopes to provide digital radio service  
by 2000. Its technology would let radio stations air in their 
existing channel space both their current analog signal and a 
digital one. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to CD-quality sound, more efficient digital  
technology lets broadcasters offer more services without having to 
use more airwaves space. As a result, stations could use the 
technology to offer e-mail, Internet access and other data 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	The new investors increase USA Digital's potential access to a  
total of 1,628 radio stations to reach 207 million listeners, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Digital hopes to install experimental transmitters in  
several yet-to-be identified markets this year to test its 
technology, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology would allow people to continue listening to their  
favorite radio stations on existing analog radios. They would have 
to buy new digital receivers to get new digital services.

<HEADLINE> Oilers Fire Two Assistant Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Oilers fired defensive  
backs coach Greg Brown and defensive line coach Rex Norris on 
Thursday and said they would not re-sign special teams coach Russ 
Purnell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes are a constant whenever expectations are not met,''  
said Oilers head coach Jeff Fisher, who promised a shakeup after 
his team finished 8-8 for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher thanked the coaches for their work and said he is  
committed to building the best coaching staff he can. He gave no 
indication who might replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	Purnell was the Oilers' special teams coach for four years after  
spending nine seasons with Seattle. Though Oilers punter Craig 
Hentrich made the Pro Bowl and kicker Al Del Greco had his best 
year, the Oilers' special teams struggled on returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, who has been with the Oilers for four seasons and has  
coached football for 34 years, was criticized for not producing a 
consistent pass rush. The Oilers totaled just 30 sacks this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown joined the Oilers as defensive backs coach in 1997 after  
stints in San Diego and Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Four Dead in Oregon Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAMHILL, Ore. (AP) -- Investigators today picked through the  
wreckage of a twin-engine plane that crashed about 30 miles 
southwest of Portland, killing all four people aboard and narrowly 
missing a farmhouse and barn. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-seat Beechcraft Baron BE-58 went down in the wooded  
hills of Yamhill County about 6 p.m. Wednesday, said Debbie Taylor, 
a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash wasn't yet known and the names of the  
victims were not released. Taylor said the FAA believes the flight 
originated from La Grande in eastern Oregon bound for Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	The mangled wreckage was strewn a couple hundred yards along a  
rural road, FAA investigator Jim Reed said. The plane sheared 
through the trees, slid down a hillside and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out the window there, we seen a large red flash,'' said Steve  
Hagen, who lives nearby. ``Then a big boom, and the house just 
shook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said the plane's pilot lost radio contact shortly before  
the crash, but apparently no distress call was sent. 
</P>
<P>
	William Bowen, 62, said he heard the plane ripping through the  
trees and exploding into a fireball no more than 400 feet from his 
farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just thankful that those of us on the ground weren't  
hurt,'' Bowen said. ``It was a real close call.''

<HEADLINE> Flynt Hustles Porn and Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- He made his reputation in the world of  
hard-core sex publishing and had long wanted to be a player in the 
world of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Larry Flynt has achieved his goal -- to the dismay of  
politicians and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	One academic calls his tactics ``sexual bounty hunting.'' But  
Flynt says he only wants to unmask the hypocrisy of the 
investigation into President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate planned to put Clinton on trial, the Hustler  
magazine publisher was scheming to embarrass a ``big fish'' 
Republican, just as he did with Rep. Bob Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy is really a gem,'' Flynt told The Associated Press on  
Tuesday. ``We've got enough to go on now, but we are waiting for an 
affidavit from his ex-wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt said he will make the disclosure next week at a news  
conference. He described his next victim only as a GOP House member 
who has been a strong critic of Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Flynt) always wanted to be a political player,'' said Paul  
Krassner, who served briefly as Hustler publisher in 1978 and runs 
the alternative paper The Realist in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to play a part in politics and in the culture of the  
country,'' Krassner said, ``and he got what he wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts are recoiling at the influence now being  
wielded by Flynt, self-described ``pornographer, pundit and social 
outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost as if we as a society have fallen through the  
looking glass,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist 
at Claremont Graduate University. ``I have never seen anything 
quite like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffe said that by driving the public discourse to new lows,  
Flynt will deepen cynicism about the impeachment process and 
government in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is dangerous to democracy,'' Jeffe said. ``It's dangerous  
to the First Amendment and it only adds to the cynicism we see out 
there. This is sexual bounty hunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful politicians are already talking about being ``Larry  
Flynted.'' The president himself has decried ``the politics of 
personal destruction'' and Livingston warned of 
``government-by-Larry Flynt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, scandal-mongering goes back to the beginning of the  
republic,'' said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at 
the University of California, San Diego. ``But now it is on this 
huge financial scale. It's a sign of the times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Flynt ran a full-page advertisement in The  
Washington Post offering as much as $1 million to anyone who ``had 
an adulterous sexual encounter with a current member of the U.S. 
Congress or a high-ranking government official'' and could produce 
documentation of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston, a Louisiana Republican who was about to take over as  
House Speaker, turned down the gavel and said he would resign from 
Congress after confirming Flynt's discovery that he had had 
adulterous affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt also said he will name a third politician later next week,  
and that he is paying up to $4 million to a number of women who 
responded to his ad. He plans to publish details in a one-time 
magazine called ``The Flynt Report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt's previous forays into mainstream celebrity have included  
offering a $1 million reward for new information in the 
assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1984 trial of automaker John 
DeLorean, he released a government videotape of DeLorean with a 
suitcase full of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, made his name with a hard-core sex magazine that once  
pictured a woman being put through a meat grinder. He once went to 
the Supreme Court over a magazine spoof ad suggesting the Rev. 
Jerry Falwell lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt won the fight in the Supreme Court. He later gained  
legitimacy in some eyes when the 1996 movie ``The People vs. Larry 
Flynt'' portrayed him as a First Amendment hero. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been in a wheelchair since a man, incensed by an  
interracial photo spread in Hustler, shot him in 1978. That same 
white gunman also admitted shooting and wounding Vernon Jordan, the 
Washington lawyer and Clinton confidant who is a key figure in the 
Lewinsky investigation.

<HEADLINE> Walt Disney Studios President Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. has named stage and  
animation veteran Peter Schneider to the new position of president 
of The Walt Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider had been serving as president of Walt Disney  
Theatrical Productions and Walt Disney Feature Animation, where he 
helped revive Disney's animation business with such films as ``The 
Little Mermaid,'' ``Aladdin,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The Lion 
King'' and ``Toy Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider, 48, will report to Joe Roth, chairman of Disney's  
recently consolidated studio operation, Disney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney Studios had been singled out by chairman Michael  
Eisner for its weak performance during 1998. Disney earned $1.1 
billion from movies during fiscal 1998, but failed to make money on 
many of its films. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to investors that was released Wednesday, Eisner  
blamed the weak results in part on high salaries paid to actors and 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In too many instances, profits did not materialize from the  
revenues achieved by our films,'' Eisner wrote. ``Stated more 
bluntly, either the films and marketing cost too much, or the 
audience rejected our ideas. Whatever the reason, we're glad '98 is 
over in this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Eisner said the company will attempt to boost its  
success rate by catering to family audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider joined Disney in 1985 as head of its animation  
business. He was a co-producer in 1998 of a Broadway production of 
``The Lion King'' that won six Tony awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Disney, Schneider directed plays in New York and  
was managing director of Chicago's St. Nicholas Theater.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Challenge Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On what it expected to be its last day  
questioning the government's final witness, Microsoft planned to 
challenge an economist's conclusions that the company acted 
illegally to crush a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara said he wanted to quiz  
Franklin Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today 
on some key issues in its antitrust trial, such as questions about 
the price it charges for its dominant Windows operating system and 
its Internet browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends the company bundled its browser free  
into newer versions of Windows -- and pledged to make its Internet 
software ``forever free'' -- solely to undercut rival Netscape, 
whose own popular browser competed directly with Microsoft's and 
once earned millions of dollars in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal antitrust law, part of such a legal claim includes  
the expectation that Microsoft eventually would raise its prices 
once it dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Fisher told the judge that Microsoft spent  
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to develop its browser and that 
it set its pricing ``for the explicit purpose of depriving rivals 
of revenues needed to be viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, however, maintains that it never planned to earn  
money selling its browser but that it would profit from advertising 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara said Wednesday he intended to finish questioning Fisher  
today. Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with 
MIT economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, the judge dramatically injected himself into  
the case. He interrupted the questioning of Fisher to ask about 
statements by America Online's chairman that its planned purchase 
of Netscape won't alter Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual exchange was a clear illustration of the judge's  
deep unease about how the pending $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape deal 
might affect the competitiveness of the nation's computer industry, 
the main issue in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that the deal, announced in November weeks into  
the trial, illustrates that the computer industry remains viable 
and thus suggests that government intervention isn't needed to 
ensure competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post,  
AOL Chairman Steve Case said: ``AOL's merger with Netscape has no 
bearing on the Microsoft case. ... I have a lot of respect for 
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that, starting in mid-1995, Microsoft  
sought to crush Netscape in part because it feared the popular 
browser might one day displace the importance of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest Internet provider with more than 15  
million subscribers. So, a decision by AOL to distribute Netscape's 
browser software could dramatically boost Netscape's now-flagging 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara had been questioning Fisher about AOL's purchase of  
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have some relevance,'' said Fisher, who called the  
deal a ``hopeful sign'' of renewed competition. But he said: ``It 
won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions to reduce 
the threat from Netscape's browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted, saying  
he had read Case's comments, and briefly recessed the trial to find 
a copy of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told the newspaper: ``We have no flight of fancy that we  
can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in the 
operating system business. ... It's hard to imagine that PCs won't 
be the dominant way people connect with the Internet for many years 
to come, and Microsoft has a pretty amazing lock on that 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson read aloud several paragraphs, then turned to the  
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have of you is ... is this consistent with your  
understanding of what the impact of the consortium will be, insofar 
as developing viable competition?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher replied: ``It certainly is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly preoccupied with Netscape's purchase. Last  
month, in remarkably candid comments, he said the deal ``might be a 
very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL currently distributes Microsoft's browser software to its  
subscribers in exchange for Microsoft prominently including AOL's 
software within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has indicated he will continue to distribute Microsoft's  
browser to AOL subscribers, but Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
recently said he expects AOL to distribute Netscape ``sooner or 
later.''

<P>
	Coach Ken Carter canceled all team-related activities until  
there is an improvement in the players' grades, even though 
Richmond High is off to a record 13-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said several players had failed to live up to the  
contracts they signed that focused on success in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-season coach postponed last Friday's non-league game,  
which he hopes to reschedule. And, he has threatened to forfeit 
Tuesday's league opener if there's no immediate improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, there will be no practices and no pep rallies.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids need to understand that working together is part of  
the process,'' Carter said. ``This is just a way of getting their 
attention. I wanted to show them that playing sports is just a 
small part of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Wayne Oliver agreed there may be some academic problems  
on the team, but said the lockout may cause the team to lose its 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It guess it's for the best,'' Oliver said. ``But I think we  
still need to practice. Not everyone has bad grades. This 
completely stops everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their agreement, all players must maintain at least a  
2.0 grade point average for each quarter, devote at least 10 hours 
a week to study time, attend all classes and sit in the front row 
of class. 
</P>
<P>
	``What coach Carter is doing is very courageous, and it supports  
the feeling of our administration wholeheartedly,'' vice principal 
Frank Fadelli said. ``Yeah, we're 13-0 right now, and our kids 
might think they're invincible, so this is a real wake-up call for 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Air Its Side Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's questioning of the government's  
final witness in its antitrust case turned combative today over the 
software giant's promise to make its Internet software ``forever 
free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyer even offered to pause so the witness --  
economist Franklin Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology -- could control his blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The most contentious moments came amid questions about the price  
Microsoft charges for its Windows operating system and its Internet 
browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends the company bundled its browser free  
into newer versions of Windows -- and pledged to keep its Internet 
software ``forever free'' -- solely to undercut rival Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's own popular browser competed directly with  
Microsoft's and once earned that company tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be driving black  
cars,'' Fisher said, his voice rising. ``That's not what 
competition is about. That's not what helping consumers is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you seem agitated, sir,'' Microsoft lawyer Michael  
Lacovara responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am agitated. I feel very strongly about this,'' Fisher said.  
``We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It might be a nice 
world, but it's not a competitive world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara offered to take a short break, but Fisher said his  
blood pressure wasn't cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, Fisher paused after Lacovara asked about his  
previous testimony that Microsoft ``studied and tried to implement 
ways to disable Netscape and reduce total browser sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara began to speak again when Fisher replied: ``I'm just  
dumbfounded by the question. It's not that I can't answer it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher then recounted government allegations that Microsoft  
bundled its own browser into Windows, promised the browser would 
remain free and used its influence to discourage others from 
distributing Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal antitrust law, a legal claim of predatory pricing  
includes the expectation that Microsoft eventually would raise its 
prices once it dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier testimony, Fisher told the judge that Microsoft spent  
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to develop its browser and set 
its pricing ``for the explicit purpose of depriving rivals of 
revenues needed to be viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that it never planned to earn money selling  
its browser, but did plan to profit from advertising fees. The 
company's chairman, Bill Gates, previously said in an interview 
that advertising fees from a browser, from the search page and the 
home page, far exceed the cost of development. ``So, clearly, the 
browser should be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara, for example, said companies with tools to search for  
specific information on the Internet -- such as Lycos and AltaVista 
-- pay Microsoft $15 million annually for prominent placement on its 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher said: ``That (explanation) appears to have been  
invented in the middle of this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, a Microsoft spokesman cited a single line  
in a May 1995 e-mail from Gates discussing what he called ``a very 
powerful deal of some kind we can do with Netscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates suggested in the e-mail that Netscape be told that  
browsers ``make no money.'' Netscape earned roughly $8.2 million 
selling its browser during the second fiscal quarter that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher acknowledged to Lacovara that many software companies  
distribute products free in order to sell related products or 
services, or to gain a foothold in a market. But Microsoft went 
further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT  
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week.

<HEADLINE>  Israelis, Palestinians Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- Israeli soldiers today scuffled with  
hundreds of Palestinians protesting the army's three-day siege of 
the divided city of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest came a day after Israeli soldiers shot and killed a  
mentally retarded Palestinian. The victim had brandished what later 
turned out to be a toy gun near an Israeli army post. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, about 300 protesters led by Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natche  
marched through the city to an Israeli checkpoint at the outskirts 
of town manned by eight soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators hung Palestinian flags on Israeli army jeeps,  
removed road barriers and stole a stop sign. They also shouted 
``God is Great!'' at the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some pushing and shoving as the soldiers tried to keep  
the crowd from advancing beyond the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebron, a city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers,  
is one of the tensest areas in the West Bank. On Monday, assailants 
believed to be Palestinian militants opened fire on a van in the 
center of town, injuring two Jewish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the army imposed a curfew on the downtown area it  
controls, barring Palestinian residents from leaving their homes. 
Troops also sealed Hebron, meaning Palestinians cannot enter or 
leave the city. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, Hebron has been under curfew and siege  
repeatedly, and Palestinian resentment against Israel has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We demand the closure and curfew be lifted because they are  
inhumane,'' Natche said in Thursday's march. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers at other points in the city shot a few rubber-coated  
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers. There were no reports of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in the West Bank city of Ramallah, scores of  
Palestinian women chanting ``We want justice!'' rallied today 
outside the Palestinian legislature, demanding the release of about 
200 Palestinians held without charges by Yasser Arafat's security 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been jailed by Israel  
during nearly 30 years of military occupation, touching just about 
every Palestinian family. 
</P>
<P>
	Another about 200 are currently in Palestinian custody without  
charges or trial, arrested when Arafat took the helm of the 
Palestinian Authority in 1994 and cracked down on members of 
Islamic militant groups, often in response to attacks on Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Most are members of Hamas and the smaller group Islamic Jihad.  
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Israelis and Palestinians signed six agreements for  
joint projects in science, medicine and culture in a ceremony at 
Israel's Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by UNESCO, the projects -- with a total cost of  
$250,000 -- cover areas such as rabies eradication and seminars for 
tour guides.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley, Lehman Beat Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's investment banking firms shared in  
the spoils of the stock market's recovery at the end of last year, 
with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; 
Co. reporting profits that topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers and acquisitions helped offset the industrywide drop  
in the business of underwriting stocks and bonds. Last year saw a 
record of deal-making, with auto, telecom and oil industries 
consolidating fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley, which ranked third in merger activity in the  
United States last year, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $879 
million, or $1.49 a share, excluding a one-time gain. The record 
profits were 15 percent above the final quarter of 1997, and 
dwarfed analysts' estimates of 96 cents a share, according to First 
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the gain, Morgan Stanley posted profits of $1.22  
billion, or $2.07 a share, for the quarter, compared with $810 
million, or $1.30 a share, in fourth quarter of 1997. The company's 
fiscal year ends Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are stellar numbers given the choppy environment we've  
just experienced,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst with Sanford 
C. Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $4 billion, a 6 percent jump from  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Flush with cash, Morgan Stanley said it would buy back $1  
billion of its stock to boost its flagging price, and boost its 
quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share, from 20 cents previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman Brothers reported fourth-quarter earnings of $74 million,  
or 51 cents a share, more than twice the 21 cents analysts 
expected. The results, however, fell 60 percent from Lehman's 
quarter of $185 million, or $1.30 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the period was $665 million, down from $1.02 billion  
in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of both companies were encouraging to investors,  
after reports of the industry's exposure to risky investment funds 
known as hedge funds like Long Term Capital Management, as well as 
rumors about Lehman's financial weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real signpost on the road to recovery for these  
firms,'' Krawcheck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped $3.50 to $84.18 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where Lehman's stock rose 50 cents to $54.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Morgan Stanley's net income was $3.05  
billion, or $4.95 a share, excluding non-recurring charges and 
gains. In 1997, Morgan Stanley earned $2.65 billion, or $4.27 a 
share, excluding costs related to its merger with Dean Witter 
Discover. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all costs and charges in 1998, Morgan Stanley earned  
$3.28 billion, or $5.33 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the firm was $16.4 billion, up 11 percent from 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehman's full-year profits were $736 million, or $5.19 per  
share, compared with $647 million, or $4.72 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $4.11 billion vs. $3.87 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Clearing skies in the Northeast and northern Plains were  
promising some relief from the snow today, while polar air spread 
back across the region. 
</P>
<P>
	An end to light snow was forecast in the upper Ohio Valley. But  
a new system moving out of Canada was expected to bring more 
precipitation by tonight to Kentucky and Tennessee, and rain to the 
deep South. 
</P>
<P>
	A few inches of snow were expected in the Northeast before skies  
cleared in the afternoon. Heavier amounts were possible in the West 
Virginia and Pennsylvania mountains, and up to 6 inches in parts of 
the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Detroit, classes for 180,000 public school students were  
canceled again today, extending their holiday break by at least 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the winter weather blamed for dozens of deaths across the  
eastern third of the nation and parts of Canada in the past week 
has settled down. The next system loomed for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	There are signs Lake Erie is ready to freeze over -- a good  
thing, since that would end the lake-effect system that has left 
knee-high snow across western New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There already is some ice on the lake,'' National Weather  
Service meteorologist Tony Ansuini said. ``On the satellite picture 
we can see the west end freezing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The central Plains also had clearing skies in the forecast,  
though light snow and drizzle were possible in Oklahoma and eastern 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The deep freeze continues in the northern Plains, where it was  
20 degrees below zero early today in Bismarck, N.D., and 12 below 
in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure was dominating the West, except for light rain on  
the northern Pacific coast and some snow showers in Idaho and 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures Wednesday in the lower 48 states ranged from 87 in  
Santee, Calif., to 27 below zero in Clayton Lake, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today were forecast only around zero in the northern  
Plains and western Great Lakes; in the teens and 20s from the 
northeastern Rockies through Missouri and Kentucky and up to New 
England; in the 30s and 40s in the Northwest, mid-South and 
mid-Atlantic states; and in the 50s, 60s and 70s across the 
southernmost states.

<HEADLINE> Coming: A Big Impact on Your Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You had better prepare yourself because this can  
have a big impact on your finances and your way of life, and there 
are signs already that it is relentlessly advancing upon us. 
</P>
<P>
	It is deflation, something most people have never experienced  
and, had they ever given it a thought, never thought they would 
see. But it is not far away, and some experienced viewers say they 
can see it even now. 
</P>
<P>
	Deflation, popularly defined, is when consumer prices actually  
drop rather than merely disinflate, the latter meaning prices 
rising at a lesser and lesser rate. As a result, deflation raises a 
dollar's purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	So why worry? You needn't, for the time being anyway. In fact,  
you should be considering how you might take advantage of the 
situation to build up your assets, now that jobs are plentiful and 
wages rising. 
</P>
<P>
	After a while, however, it could become a matter of very serious  
concern. As is sometimes pointed out, there is good deflation and 
bad deflation, but more about that later. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the prices of some consumer products are deflating. You  
know they are, for example, if you purchased a computer six years 
ago and now view advertisements for better products at literally 
half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is one explanation. Competition has never been on a  
global scale as it is now. Low-wage countries can cut prices by so 
much that their counterparts in more advanced countries have little 
choice but to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	In the more advanced industrial nations the only way they can do  
this is to cut their own costs, which more than ever before they 
are attempting to do. They must, in order to get more product for 
the same expense. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in the prices of commodities or raw materials, many of  
them from less-developed nations, aid in cost-cutting. And 
productivity-improving electronics and low interest rates make a 
very big dent in costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Edward Yardeni adds another factor in accounting for  
low prices. It is peace. ``Wars are inflationary,'' he says, 
``while peace tends to be deflationary.'' It is a simple historical 
observation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another factor is involved. It is you, the consumer, who  
won't buy anything if it isn't on sale. For instance buying clubs, 
increasingly popular, can cut a quarter from each dollar spent on 
supermarket items. 
</P>
<P>
	This can be a wonderful state of affairs, up to a point. What  
happens, for example, if a company has to keep cutting prices but 
still cannot maintain volume? It begins cutting jobs. It cuts 
capital spending. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens to a consumer the first impulse is to cut back  
wherever possible. And, because companies have already cut back on 
equipment and plant additions, their suppliers must cut back on 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	This, you'll agree, is when deflation goes bad. Budgets  
everywhere are cut, except perhaps in government. Cutting becomes 
everyone's defense, and the competition to do so leads to less and 
less of everything but problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone will agree with Yardeni, Deutsche Bank's chief  
economist, that ``deflation is no longer a risk,'' but ``a clear 
and present danger.'' Or that a Year 2000 recession could be the 
deflation trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it can't be denied that general disinflation already is  
upon us and that there is spotty evidence of deflation. The 
challenge for policy-makers is to keep it the good kind, and the 
question is, can they?

<HEADLINE> Tripp: I Saw Missing Bill Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp was the last person to see Vincent  
Foster alive. She taped her young friend Monica Lewinsky, which led 
to the investigation of a presidential affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, for the first time, Mrs. Tripp says she may have seen  
billing records from Hillary Rodham Clinton's law firm in a safe in 
Vince Foster's office. The White House had said the records were 
lost for a few years, but they mysteriously turned up later in the 
White House residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw what I now believe to be in the infamous billing records  
in that safe,'' Tripp said in a deposition this week for the 
conservative legal group Judicial Watch. The group made her 
testimony public on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, a Maryland resident and Pentagon employee, also said  
she may have seen Mrs. Clinton's initials on the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was secretary to Foster, the deputy White House  
counsel who committed suicide in 1993. She told Judicial Watch that 
sometime in May 1993 she might have seen the billing records, but 
didn't realize what they were until January 1996, when it was 
revealed in congressional hearings that the records had 
mysteriously appeared on a table in the White House residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutors had subpoenaed the records two years  
before. The White House said they could not be located. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't know a billing record if it hit me on the head,''  
Tripp told Judicial Watch, which has sued the Clinton 
administration on behalf of people whose FBI files were gathered by 
the White House. The administration has said the files were 
gathered by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Tripp said that after she saw a photo of the records on  
the news in 1996, she realized that what she saw in 1993 may have 
been the billing records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't recall having any clue what they were at the time,  
except that there was something during the time that I saw it that 
made me believe it belonged to Mrs. Clinton,'' Mrs. Tripp 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was her initials or some notation, I don't  
know,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The records detail Mrs. Clinton's legal work in the mid-1980s  
for an Arkansas savings and loan owned by the first family's 
Whitewater business partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has been investigating the  
Clinton's Whitewater business deals since 1993.

	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Add rocker Warren Zevon to the list of  
performers for Gov. Jesse Ventura's inaugural bash. 
</P>
<P>
	Zevon canceled four concerts in order to perform ``Lawyers, Guns  
and Money'' at the Jan. 16 party at the Target Center in 
Minneapolis, the Star Tribune reported Thursday. The tune is 
apparently a favorite of Ventura's. 
</P>
<P>
	Other performers at the sold-out inaugural party include Jonny  
Lang and Delbert McClinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13,800 tickets available for the party were gone in just  
more than a day.

</P>
<P>
	That a message be sent to the Senate to inform the Senate of  
these appointments and that the managers so appointed may in 
connection with the preparation and the conduct of the trial 
exhibit the articles of impeachment to the Senate and take all 
other actions necessary which may include the following: 
</P>
<P>
	One, employing legal, clerical and other necessary assistance  
and incurring such other expenses as may be necessary to be paid 
from amounts available to the Committee on the Judiciary under 
applicable expense resolutions, or from the applicable accounts of 
the House of Representatives; two, sending for persons and papers 
and filing with the secretary of the Senate on the part of the 
House of Representatives any pleadings in conjunction with or 
subsequent to the exhibition of the articles of impeachment that 
the managers consider necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	With the permission of the Senate, I will now read the articles  
of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	House Resolution 611: Resolved that William Jefferson Clinton,  
president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and 
misdemeanors, and that the following articles of impeachment be 
exhibited to the United States Senate: 
</P>
<P>
	Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of  
Representatives of the United States of America in the name of 
itself and of the people of the United States of America, against 
William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States of 
America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him 
for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Article One: In his conduct while president of the United  
States, William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president 
of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in 
violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the 
judicial process of the United States for his personal gain and 
exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that: 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the  
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before a federal 
grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William 
Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of 
the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with 
a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and 
misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he 
allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil 
rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the 
testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in 
that civil rights action. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Article Two: In his conduct while president of the United  
States, William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president 
of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in 
violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be 
faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the 
administration of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, 
and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or 
scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up, and conceal the 
existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil 
rights action brought against him in a duly instituted judicial 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme  
included one or more of the following acts: 
</P>
<P>
	1. On or about Dec. 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding 
that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	2. On or about Dec. 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him to give perjurious, false and misleading 
testimony if and when called to testify personally in that 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	3. On or about Dec. 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton  
corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal 
evidence that had been subpoenaed in a federal civil rights action 
brought against him. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, and continuing through  
and including Jan. 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified 
and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in 
a federal civil rights action brought against him in order to 
corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that 
proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness 
would have been harmful to him. 
</P>
<P>
	5. On Jan. 17, 1998, at his deposition in a federal civil rights  
action brought against him, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly 
allowed his attorney to make false and misleading statements to a 
federal judge characterizing an affidavit in order to prevent 
questioning deemed relevant by the judge. Such false and misleading 
statements were subsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a 
communication to that judge. 
</P>
<P>
	6. On or about Jan. 18 and Jan. 20-21, 1998, William Jefferson  
Clinton related a false and misleading account of events relevant 
to a federal civil rights action brought against him to a potential 
witness in that proceeding in order to corruptly influence the 
testimony of that witness. 
</P>
<P>
	7. On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, 1998, William Jefferson  
Clinton made false and misleading statements to potential witnesses 
in a federal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence 
the testimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading 
statements made by William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the 
witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive 
false and misleading information. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of this, William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the  
integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, 
has betrayed his trust as president, and has acted in a manner 
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherefore, William Jefferson Clinton, by such conduct, warrants  
impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Passed the House of Representatives Dec. 19, 1998, Newt  
Gingrich, speaker of the House of Representatives. Attest Robin H. 
Carle, clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, that completes the exhibition of the articles of  
impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, president of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial.  
</P>
<P>
	The managers now request leave to withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Reinsdorf: We Start With Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd was pursued by  
reporters at the Chicago Bulls' suburban practice complex. Chairman 
Jerry Reinsdorf was casting a vote for a new agreement in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause was home but not talking. And  
Michael Jordan was ... well, no one's sure ... probably playing 
golf Thursday as the NBA owners voted to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	As Chicago remained locked in a big chill several days after a  
huge snowstorm, the six-time champion Bulls were bracing for a 
three-week circus of player signings, a short training camp and 
eventually the start of an abbreviated season. 
</P>
<P>
	Where to begin?  
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start with Michael. If Michael decides to retire  
that changes a lot of things,'' Reinsdorf said after owners 
ratified the new labor agreement 29-0 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract doesn't hurt at all or help bring Michael back.  
He's grandfathered. He can make 5-percent more than last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be about $34.7 million, a figure that would be  
pro-rated for what will probably be a 50-game schedule starting 
around Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jordan's future might not be decided until teams open  
training camp Jan. 18. Will he retire? Will he return and play for 
Floyd? 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said he hasn't talked to Jordan since just before the  
lockout began July 1, weeks after he'd led the Bulls to their sixth 
title and before Floyd was named director of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he heard a lot of good things about Tim Floyd and  
to tell Tim not to take himself out of consideration,'' Reinsdorf 
said. ``Whether Tim was coach or not would not determine whether 
Michael would come back or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said he didn't know what Jordan would do and wouldn't  
until he spoke with him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked to Michael, he was frazzled and worn  
out after the playoffs and at that time, he didn't think he was 
going to play,'' Reinsdorf said. ``But now he's had a whole summer 
of golf and enjoying himself. Maybe he's energized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said his first phone call once the lockout was settled  
went to Phil Jackson, offering him another chance to return as 
coach. But Jackson, who left the Bulls after they won the 
championship last June, declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of chuckled,'' Reinsdorf said. ``He said he had the  
next few months planned out. He appreciated the call but said he 
hadn't changed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, meanwhile, said he wasn't aware of Jackson's response.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to Jerry Krause or Jerry Reinsdorf yet  
today,'' Floyd said Thursday as he departed the Berto Center on his 
way to lunch with assistant coaches Tex Winter and Frank Hamblen. 
``I know nothing about that, although that doesn't surprise me 
because that's what Phil said on several occasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krause, who must construct a team that currently has only four  
players under contract -- Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper, Keith Booth and 
Randy Brown -- declined comment from his suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Jordan's situation is settled, the rest of the Bulls' free  
agents remain in limbo. Mark Bartelstein, a Chicago-based agent who 
represents Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler, said he's talked briefly 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a little bit paralyzed,'' said Bartelstein, who also  
represents Brown. ``They haven't even been able to talk to Michael. 
``I'm sure when they do, they'll get a better understanding of 
where they're at.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Believes In High-Speed Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a report that its upcoming  
high-speed trains were built too fat to go fast, Amtrak responded 
Thursday by declaring the trains will meet their promised trip 
times along the Northeast Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, maker of the new trains, also said  
it will meet Amtrak's specifications for trip time, ride comfort 
and interior appointments. A spokeswoman said the width of the cars 
was left to the company's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``America will be proud of these trains, and I am confident that  
Bombardier will deliver 150 mph equipment that meets all of our 
travel time goals as specified in our contract,'' Amtrak President 
George Warrington said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, quoting Amtrak's vice president for  
high-speed rail, reported that the trains were built four inches 
too wide and, consequently, will be unable to go around some curves 
as fast as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The added width will require Amtrak to speed up as much as $12  
million in track and clearance projects in order to maintain its 
promised three-hour service between New York and Boston, the Post 
reported. The trains, which enter passenger service in October, are 
also scheduled to travel between New York and Washington in two 
hours and 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of a $710 million contract, Bombardier is  
supposed to supply 20 train sets, each including two locomotives, 
four coaches, a dining car and a first-class car. The trains will 
use technology allowing them to tilt as they go into turns, not so 
much for speed but so passengers won't be thrown outward into the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Carol, Amtrak's high-speed rail vice president, told  
the Post that because of the extra width, the trains cannot tilt to 
a planned 6.5-degree maximum without violating a safety buffer. The 
zone is designed to allow two trains to pass on adjacent tracks 
even if each set of locomotives and cars is leaning the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol said that with the extra width, the cars can tilt only 4.2  
degrees and still meet the clearance specifications. He said the 
first indication of a problem arose in April 1997, after most of 
the train sets were already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Stangl, president of Bombardier's U.S. subsidiary, said in  
a joint statement with Warrington that the cars are no wider than 
Amtrak's existing fleet. He said their size was dictated by the 
interior requirements outlined in the railroad's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Fischer, a Bombardier spokeswoman, said the company was  
allowed to set the width of the trains, and regardless of their 
size, they will meet the trip-speed requirements at the 4.2 degree 
tilt. She said the extra tilt will give Amtrak added capabilities 
should it complete the additional infrastructure investments. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never the belief from Bombardier's point of view  
that the trains would operate at 6.5 degrees tilt,'' Fischer told 
The Associated Press. ``You can achieve the run time at 4.2 
degrees. That was our mandate: To get from Point A to Point B, and 
from Point B to Point C, within specific trip times.''

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid, GNC In Marketing Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp. will set up GNC shops inside  
some of its drugstores and General Nutrition Cos. Inc. will make 
vitamins and nutritional supplements for Rite Aid under an 
agreement announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid and GNC, citing the growing market for nutritional  
supplements, plan to spend $30 million to advertise a new line of 
supplements to be called PharmAssure. They will be sold at Rite 
Aid's 3,900 stores and GNC's 3,650 stores beginning in the fall of 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pittsburgh-based GNC will take over the manufacture  
of Rite Aid's private-label vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Camp Hill-based Rite Aid will open GNC shops within  
1,500 of its drugstores across the country over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies also plan to develop a joint Web site  
dedicated to nutrition and nutrition supplements.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Launches Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn prelude to the first presidential  
impeachment trial in 130 years, House prosecutors delivered to the 
Senate today two articles of impeachment accusing President Clinton 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. The White House declared 
there wasn't ``a compelling case'' for ousting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	With a trial framework still elusive, Majority Leader Trent Lott  
asked all 100 senators to gather, after being sworn in as jurors, 
in an ornate room that served as the Senate chamber more than a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he asked for the rare, private session for senators  
``to decide in a bipartisan fashion how to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist arrived at the Capitol around  
12:30 p.m. EST to take an oath as the presiding officer at the 
trial and to swear in the 100 senators as jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,  
the 13 Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial walked 
silently across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast 
the scene live to the nation -- to deliver the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators will be in order,'' 96-year-old Strom Thurmond, the  
Senate president pro tempore, hollered as he called the session to 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms, James W. Ziglar, escorted the House  
members to the well of the Senate. ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all 
persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment,'' he 
declared, reading a proclamation written by the Founding Fathers 
more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed and impeded the  
administration of justice,'' the silver-haired Hyde intoned as he 
read from the articles to a stilled Senate chamber. Hyde's 
prosecution team stood at attention in a semicircle to his right. 
The senators sat silently, a few taking notes. About three-quarters 
of the seats in the galleries were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his  
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	When he had finished, Hyde said, ``That concludes the exposition  
of the articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton. 
The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of public view, but the White House made a  
new bid to cut short the trial. Clinton would stipulate to ``the 
five volumes, 7,000 or so pages'' of grand jury testimony and other 
evidence that prosecutor Kenneth Starr sent to the House last fall 
so that witnesses would not have to be called, presidential 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that ``we don't believe everything that was said  
is an accurate portrayal of events'' but that the president's 
lawyers wouldn't challenge using that record as the trial evidence. 
The White House made the offer in a late-night bargaining session 
with senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House prosecutors made clear their intention to call  
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, at a trial that could extend 
three weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said, ``If they insist on bringing witnesses it will  
significantly extend and delay this process and all bets are off. 
... We don't believe that they've made a compelling case that the 
president be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said all Republican proposals would  
allow witnesses to be called by both the House and the White House. 
``If the House feels they need them, then we're going to give them 
leeway. That's the Republican sentiment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., denounced demands for witnesses by  
Hyde. ``We need to negotiate between senators, not senators and the 
House. We're going to be held hostage any time the House 
Republicans object to something,'' Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators said they supported a plan offered  
by Lott on Wednesday that would allow the Senate to vote on a 
witness-by-witness basis on whether to allow their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can be demonstrated that a witness is needed to prove  
something, let them in. If not, keep them out,'' Sen. Robert 
Bennett, R-Utah, said, expressing his support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors said Wednesday they intend to call as many as  
10 witnesses or more to make their case, including Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan -- all of whom testified in Starr's grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no consensus yet, Lott told reporters today that after  
senators are sworn in, ``I am going to urge that the entire Senate 
retire to the Old Senate Chamber to decide in a bipartisan fashion 
how to proceed.'' He said the private session was necessary to 
ensure candid debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were in general agreement on allowing opening  
statements by both the House prosecutors and Clinton's lawyers, 
Lott said. Gregg said there was informal agreement that there would 
be no time limits on the statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator welcomed the White House offer to  
stipulate evidence. ``That would be very helpful. Stipulating to 
facts will help that process, and then if there were the need for 
witnesses, it could be on a very narrow focus on a very narrow 
subject and perhaps not at all,'' said Kay Bailey Hutchison of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Capitol, a long line of tourists formed, hoping to  
get a glimpse of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism on Wednesday that an agreement could be  
reached on a procedure for a ``full trial .... and votes on 
articles of impeachment at the end of the process.'' One GOP 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would likely be 
February at the earliest before votes were taken on the president's 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with Hyde,  
R-Ill., and three other lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers 
unexpectedly summoned four members of the White House legal team to 
the Capitol to discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday and today with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back.

<HEADLINE>  Colombia Leader Opens Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of heavily  
armed rebels poured into this southern town for today's 
inauguration of peace talks by President Andres Pastrana and the 
fabled leader of the hemisphere's oldest and largest guerrilla 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're setting up a security cordon for the president of the  
republic,'' a mustachioed rebel commander, an assault rifle slung 
over his shoulder, said wryly as 500 guerrillas ringed the central 
square on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But townsfolk knew better. The leftist Revolutionary Armed  
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was preparing for Manuel Marulanda, 
its legendary 68-year-old commander, to come down from the 
mountains and make his first public appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand FARC fighters were camped on San Vicente's  
perimeter, restricting entry at roadblocks and the town airstrip to 
residents, accredited journalists and invited diplomats and foreign 
dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In town, the highly disciplined guerrillas were polite

teen-agers and female, kept to themselves.

	``We are an army of the people. We always treat the people  
well,'' explained the mustachioed commander, who refused to give 
his name.

led several hundred people in prayer: ``Lord, make me an instrument 
of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colombians' hopes are high that the talks can end a 34-year-old  
conflict that claims thousands of lives every year. But the parties 
have yet to even set an agenda, and the FARC is at its strongest 
ever and growing. Its estimated 15,000 regulars control 40 percent 
of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel group demanded that Pastrana remove all troops from  
San Vicente and a surrounding area the size of Switzerland, a 
condition finally satisfied in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pastrana was permitted a 60-man police bodyguard contingent.  
They arrived Wednesday under the close scrutiny of FARC security 
men, pistols tucked under their shirts, who greeted their erstwhile 
foes with polite handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Marulanda's attendance was uncertain until the last moment,  
government officials said. The rebel leader, known as ``Sureshot,'' 
has expressed fears of an assassination attempt by the guerrillas' 
right-wing paramilitary foes or ultra-rightists in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	A month before his August inaugural, Pastrana flew to  
Marulanda's jungle hideout to set in motion what would be a third 
government attempt to make peace with the FARC after failed efforts 
in 1982-84 and 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels, some of whom protect the drug trade, have refused to  
agree to a cease-fire or any other concessions. Marulanda has 
indicated, however, that he is willing to help curb drug 
trafficking and promote alternative crop development as part of a 
peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have cautiously warmed to that idea, and a senior  
State Department official explored the issue in a secret meeting 
last month in Costa Rica with a senior FARC commander that was 
confirmed only after being reported by Colombian media. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Marulanda's conditions for peace include dismantling  
paramilitary groups and the exchange of 252 jailed rebels for more 
than 350 police and soldiers captured since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long term, he seeks rural wealth redistribution in a  
country that has never seen agrarian reform and where the top 5 
percent earn 30 times more than the bottom 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics worry that FARC may just be buying time before an  
all-out drive to take power, and some critics say Pastrana is 
simply naive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the analysts who say Pastrana has ceded too much don't  
understand that in politics you have to take chances,'' said Daniel 
Garcia-Pena, a former government peace commissioner. ``Pastrana and 
his government have made a decisive wager, with much audacity, 
because it was the only way to begin the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, even optimists say any successful peace process  
will be a matter of not months but years. And several guerrilla 
commanders have stated publicly that they have no intention of 
surrendering their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 former FARC militants who demobilized in the  
mid-1980s and formed the Patriotic Union party were assassinated by 
right-wing death squads, effectively squelching Colombia's 
democratic political left.

<HEADLINE>  Colombia Leader Opens Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Hundreds of heavily  
armed rebels poured into this southern town for today's 
inauguration of peace talks by President Andres Pastrana and the 
fabled leader of the hemisphere's oldest and largest guerrilla 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're setting up a security cordon for the president of the  
republic,'' a mustachioed rebel commander, an assault rifle slung 
over his shoulder, said wryly as 500 guerrillas ringed the central 
square on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But townsfolk knew better. The leftist Revolutionary Armed  
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was preparing for Manuel Marulanda, 
its legendary 68-year-old commander, to come down from the 
mountains and make his first public appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand FARC fighters were camped on San Vicente's  
perimeter, restricting entry at roadblocks and the town airstrip to 
residents, accredited journalists and invited diplomats and foreign 
dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In town, the highly disciplined guerrillas were polite  
propagandists. Older fighters shook hands and chatted with 
townspeople and reporters. The younger ones, many of them 
teen-agers and female, kept to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are an army of the people. We always treat the people

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Soar in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money funds soared by  
almost $33 billion in the past week, registering the largest 
increase in three months, the Investment Company Institute said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets in the nation's retail money market mutual funds rose by  
$12.47 billion to $829.73 billion in the week ended Wednesday. 
Assets in institutional money market funds rose by $20.09 billion 
to $568.98 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in overall assets for the week was the largest since  
Oct. 7, said Chris Wloszczyna, a spokesman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The investments by individuals in retail funds may reflect money  
received in yearend bonuses or Christmas gifts and parked in a 
money fund pending another investment decision. The huge rise in 
institutional funds more than offset a more than $19 billion 
decline in that category the previous week and reflects seasonal 
shifts of money by investing institutions, such as pension funds, 
according to the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $7.69 billion to $681.51 billion in the latest week. Tax-exempt 
fund assets rose by $4.78 billion to $148.22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Among institutional funds, taxable money market fund assets rose  
by $17.10 billion to $519.18 billion; assets of tax-exempt funds 
rose by $2.98 billion to $49.80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.399 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.366 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.56 percent from 4.53 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield held steady at the previous week's 4.54 percent, IBC 
Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.66 percent from 4.64  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.65 percent from 4.64 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
54 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.21 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.23 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the annual  
percentage yield available on interest-bearing checking accounts 
fell to 0.99 percent from 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank Rate Monitor said the annual percentage yield was 4.15  
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 4.16 
percent the previous week. Yields were unchanged on 1-year CDs at 
4.26 percent and held steady at 4.35 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs and at 
4.49 percent on 5-year CDs.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Launches Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn prelude to the first presidential  
impeachment trial in 130 years, House prosecutors delivered to the 
Senate today two articles of impeachment accusing President Clinton 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. The White House declared 
there wasn't ``a compelling case'' for ousting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	With a trial framework still elusive, Majority Leader Trent Lott  
asked all 100 senators to gather, after being sworn in as jurors, 
in an ornate room that served as the Senate chamber more than a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he asked for the rare, private session for senators  
``to decide in a bipartisan fashion how to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist arrived at the Capitol around  
12:30 p.m. EST to take an oath as the presiding officer at the 
trial and to swear in the 100 senators as jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,  
the 13 Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial walked 
silently across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast 
the scene live to the nation -- to deliver the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators will be in order,'' 96-year-old Strom Thurmond, the  
Senate president pro tempore, hollered as he called the session to 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms, James W. Ziglar, escorted the House  
members to the well of the Senate. ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all 
persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment,'' he 
declared, reading a proclamation written by the Founding Fathers 
more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed and impeded the  
administration of justice,'' the silver-haired Hyde intoned as he 
read from the articles to a stilled Senate chamber. Hyde's 
prosecution team stood at attention in a semicircle to his right. 
The senators sat silently, a few taking notes. About three-quarters 
of the seats in the galleries were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his  
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	When he had finished, Hyde said, ``That concludes the exposition  
of the articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton. 
The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of public view, but the White House made a  
new bid to cut short the trial. Clinton would stipulate to ``the 
five volumes, 7,000 or so pages'' of grand jury testimony and other 
evidence that prosecutor Kenneth Starr sent to the House last fall 
so that witnesses would not have to be called, presidential 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that ``we don't believe everything that was said  
is an accurate portrayal of events'' but that the president's 
lawyers wouldn't challenge using that record as the trial evidence. 
The White House made the offer in a late-night bargaining session 
with senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House prosecutors made clear their intention to call  
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, at a trial that could extend 
three weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said, ``If they insist on bringing witnesses it will  
significantly extend and delay this process and all bets are off. 
... We don't believe that they've made a compelling case that the 
president be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said all Republican proposals would  
allow witnesses to be called by both the House and the White House. 
``If the House feels they need them, then we're going to give them 
leeway. That's the Republican sentiment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., denounced demands for witnesses by  
Hyde. ``We need to negotiate between senators, not senators and the 
House. We're going to be held hostage any time the House 
Republicans object to something,'' Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators said they supported a plan offered  
by Lott on Wednesday that would allow the Senate to vote on a 
witness-by-witness basis on whether to allow their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can be demonstrated that a witness is needed to prove  
something, let them in. If not, keep them out,'' Sen. Robert 
Bennett, R-Utah, said, expressing his support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors said Wednesday they intend to call as many as  
10 witnesses or more to make their case, including Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan -- all of whom testified in Starr's grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But with no consensus yet, Lott told reporters today that after  
senators are sworn in, ``I am going to urge that the entire Senate 
retire to the Old Senate Chamber to decide in a bipartisan fashion 
how to proceed.'' He said the private session was necessary to 
ensure candid debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were in general agreement on allowing opening  
statements by both the House prosecutors and Clinton's lawyers, 
Lott said. Gregg said there was informal agreement that there would 
be no time limits on the statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator welcomed the White House offer to  
stipulate evidence. ``That would be very helpful. Stipulating to 
facts will help that process, and then if there were the need for 
witnesses, it could be on a very narrow focus on a very narrow 
subject and perhaps not at all,'' said Kay Bailey Hutchison of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Capitol, a long line of tourists formed, hoping to  
get a glimpse of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism on Wednesday that an agreement could be  
reached on a procedure for a ``full trial .... and votes on 
articles of impeachment at the end of the process.'' One GOP 
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would likely be 
February at the earliest before votes were taken on the president's 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with Hyde,  
R-Ill., and three other lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers 
unexpectedly summoned four members of the White House legal team to 
the Capitol to discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday and today with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back.

<HEADLINE> Grains End Mixed; Soybeans Fall / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices settled lower  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor export sales figures pushed soybean futures prices lower.  
The U.S. Agriculture Department reports export sales for soybeans 
were slightly more than 216,000 metric tons. That is at the lower 
end of the 200,000 to 500,000 metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurting soybean prices were weather forecasts for South  
America. The forecast calls for rain in southern Brazil and 
Argentina over the weekend, which is expected to help the region's 
soybean crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were fractionally higher on  
better-than-expected export sales of 327,000 metric tons and the 
purchase by Egypt of 165,000 metric tons of hard red winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices retreated. Expectation that demand from  
cattle ranchers and hog farmers for feed grains will remain strong 
limited the move downward. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures for March delivery were unchanged at $2.87 1/2 a  
bushel; March corn was 4 cents lower at $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats 
were 1 3/4 cents lower at $1.10 1/2 a bushel; January soybeans were 8 3/4 
cents lower at $5.44 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures prices were lower and hog futures prices higher  
in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogs futures traded the limit-up on news the USDA will urge  
Congress to aid hog producers ravaged by low prices due to a glut 
of hogs raised and shipped to market. A small rebound in the prices 
meatpackers are paying farmers also gave a boost to futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures prices rallied on belief retailers may be  
forced to lower prices, which could spur increased consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	March live cattle were .45 cent lower at 61.72 cents a pound;  
January feeder cattle were .22 cent lower at 71.45 cents a pound; 
Feburary lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 36.72 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 1.85 cents higher at 48.90 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Aide to bin Laden Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A top aide to the man accused of masterminding  
the deadly U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa has become the 12th 
person to be accused of taking part in a conspiracy against the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, a native of Sudan who is believed to  
be of Iraqi descent, was indicted Wednesday by a grand jury in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Salim, alleged to be the finance chief for Osama bin Laden, was  
brought last month to the United States, three months after his 
arrest in Germany on a U.S. warrant charging him with murder 
conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an 
international plot to kill Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Salim remains held without bail in the Metropolitan Correctional  
Center. His name joins 11 others on an indictment alleging a broad 
decade-long conspiracy against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Salim is accused of joining the conspiracy through specific  
acts, including trying to obtain the components for nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison without  
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which also names bin Laden, says that the  
conspiracy was carried out through al Qaeda, an organization the 
U.S. government alleges engaged in terrorism and is headed by bin 
Laden, a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges that Salim conspired with bin Laden and  
others to murder Americans, use weapons of mass destruction, 
including conventional and nuclear weapons, transport explosives 
and disrupt and destroy U.S. national-defense utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is accused of orchestrating the Aug. 7 bombings at  
embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Twelve 
Americans were among the 224 people killed in the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Salim's lawyer, Paul J. McAllister, did not return a telephone  
message for comment Wednesday.

	The hospital giant reported a drop in second-quarter profits and  
said fiscal 1999 earnings would be flat to 5 percent higher over 
the previous year's $1.73 a share, below analysts' expected $1.82.

<HEADLINE> Was Joe D. the George-Yogi Mediator? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio, fighting lung cancer in a Florida  
hospital, prompted New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to 
end his 14-year feud with Yogi Berra, the Daily News reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock Positano told the newspaper that DiMaggio urged  
Steinbrenner to settle his differences with Berra during a 
45-minute meeting at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't be a personal thing,'' DiMaggio told  
Steinbrenner, according to Positano. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be first for the fans, then for the game, then for  
the Yankees. That should be more important than two men having a 
feud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio and Berra were teammates on the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily News said Steinbrenner's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein,  
confirmed that the meeting took place. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Morris Engelberg, DiMaggio's friend and attorney, said  
today that Berra's name never was mentioned in the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Steinbrenner and Joe had a light, wonderful discussion,  
and the Berra situation never came up,'' said Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney said he was in the room at the time, and Positano  
was not there. 
</P>
<P>
	`Joe would never get involved in something like that,''  
Engelberg said from his office in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The feud started when Steinbrenner fired Berra as manager only  
16 games into the 1985 season. Ever since, the man who popularized 
the phrase ``it ain't over 'til it's over'' has stayed away from 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fourteen years, I'd say, is long enough,'' Berra said Tuesday.  
``He apologized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner flew in from Florida on Tuesday and apologized for  
the way in which he dismissed Berra -- sending a club executive to 
deliver the word rather than doing so in person. 
</P>
<P>
	The reconciliation, arranged by radio station WFAN, came at an  
appropriate setting -- the Yogi Berra Museum on the campus of the 
Hall of Famer catcher's adopted alma mater, Montclair (N.J.) State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize how much I'd screwed up. It was a major  
screw-up. It was a stupid thing on my part,'' Steinbrenner said. 
``It was a monumental mistake on my part. Sometimes, it takes a 
long time to get things right. Yogi is a highly principled man. I 
messed up.''

<HEADLINE> Starr Defends Alleged Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr argued to a  
federal judge that some news leaks attributed to his office did not 
violate grand jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr did not acknowledge in court records unsealed Wednesday  
that his office was the source of any leaks. But even if it was, he 
contended, the status of an immunity deal with former White House 
intern Monica Lewinsky, her DNA-stained dress and other evidence 
were not grand jury matters affected by grand jury secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports that attribute information about those topics to  
Starr or sources in his office are at the center of an 
investigation into whether prosecutors violated secrecy rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has denied that his office disclosed any information  
covered by federal law requiring that grand jury matters be kept 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Attorney General Janet Reno switched her stance and  
refused to comment on the Justice Department's review of other 
allegations against Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	But a department official, requesting anonymity, said an  
investigation had not been launched. There is no change in the 
status of the review, this official said, but Reno altered her 
normal response so that the department would be able to control 
whether it announced the opening of an investigation later if that 
should occur. 
</P>
<P>
	If she waited until an investigation was opened to start  
refusing to comment, then it would be obvious that an investigation 
had been opened, this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, Reno has said the department's internal watchdog,  
the Office of Professional Responsibility, has been reviewing other 
allegations against Starr. Late last year, she said the department 
had dismissed some allegations but asked Starr for information 
relating to others, but had not opened an investigation. Reno has 
the authority to fire Starr if she finds ``good cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The primary allegation, from Democratic members of Congress and  
some legal observers, is that Starr may have violated Justice 
Department rules when his aides discussed an immunity deal with Ms. 
Lewinsky outside the presence of her lawyer, department officials 
have said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Today when asked if that review was completed, Reno replied, ``I  
would just not comment.'' She repeated that when reminded of her 
previous public remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starr arguments unsealed Wednesday were in support of his  
request that U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson reconsider 
her decision to investigate certain articles. 
</P>
<P>
	She denied Starr's appeal, ordered a hearing into the matter and  
appointed a ``special master'' to investigate allegations of leaks, 
which were first made by President Clinton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said in a published report that he and his top deputy  
briefed reporters but did not disclose secret information about his 
investigation of an affair between Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky and 
efforts to keep it private. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents unsealed Wednesday by Johnson provide details  
about his contention that the court defined secrecy rules too 
broadly.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 7.21 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A last-minute rally on Thursday pulled blue-chip  
stocks out of a deep slump, slashing sharp losses to nearly nothing 
in the final 30 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 7.21 at 9,537.76.  
The index of 30 top companies had been off nearly 120 points in 
early afternoon and was still down 50 points at 3:30 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks shone again, pushing the Nasdaq  
composite index up 5.23 to 2,326.09, its tenth record since Dec. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow opened lower and stayed lower all day, as investors sold  
shares to extract profits from a sparkling three-day rally that 
took major indexes to record levels. The Dow closed Wednesday's 
session at a record 9,544.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's selling was partly caused by cautionary comments from  
Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., a well-known bull, and 
from U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Alice Rivlin, who both 
suggested that stocks were overvalued. It was also spurred by 
discouraging economic news in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	But prices got low enough that bargain hunters began circling in  
mid-afternoon. In the last half hour they bought in earnest, 
cutting the Dow's losses, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rally didn't go much deeper than the big names. In the  
end, declining issues still outnumbered advancers by better than 2 
to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume was 1.06 billion 
shares, shy of Wednesday's heavy day. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts explained the early sluggishness by saying the market  
was due for a breather. The Dow had risen nearly 4 percent in the 
first three trading sessions of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were lots of profit-takers sitting on the fence, and it  
only took a very little to nudge them off that fence,'' said Hugh 
Johnson, market strategist at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	They had an excuse to sell after Cohen told Goldman Sachs  
clients they should trim their portfolios to 70 percent stocks from 
72 percent, and invest the proceeds into high-yielding bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	That was only a slight adjustment, but it did indicate that one  
of Wall Street's most prominent cheerleaders was getting nervous 
that stocks were overvalued. Calls to Cohen were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in a morning news interview, Rivlin said that stocks are  
too rich based on her view that ``there is every reason to believe 
the economy will slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market got hit with another bit of bad news after it became  
widely known that Brazil's third-wealthiest state, Minas Gerais, 
had declared a 90-day moratorium on federal debt payments late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, an important importer of U.S. goods, has been mired in  
an economic slump so severe it has required a $42 billion bailout 
by the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the economy of Brazil suffers, then the sales and earnings  
of U.S. companies doing business there will suffer, too,'' Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks rose after strong earnings reports from Morgan  
Stanley Dean Witter, up 3 1/2 to 84 3/16, and Lehman Brothers 
Holdings, which rose 1/2 to 54 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	One trader said bank stocks rose after 12 big financial  
companies formed a committee to find ways to curb excess lending to 
high-risk investment firms. Chase shares rose 3 1/16 to 77 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	As they have for months, Internet stocks flew high, many on  
sheer buying momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com rose 20 7/8 to 158 7/8. Lycos added 5 1/2 to 71 1/2, after the  
company announced that it would provide an Internet connection 
function on IBM's new Aptiva personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In other market indexes, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite,  
which closed at a record on Wednesday, declined 2.61 to 1269.73. 
The NYSE composite index, which also hit a record Wednesday, 
declined 1.82 to 609.19. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Stock Exchange's market value index added 2.51 to  
703.98. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.04 to 
427.83. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.51 percent.  
The FT-SE 100 in London lost 0.77 percent, the CAC in Paris fell 
1.5 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt lost 2.21 percent.

<HEADLINE> WB Head Says Young Is Where It's At </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The future belongs to young television  
viewers and networks that know how to attract them, said the head 
of WB, the home of such teen-heavy shows as ``Felicity'' and 
``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers' preference for the under-35 crowd will only grow,  
further eroding the traditional broadcast networks and boosting 
so-called niche operations like WB, its chief executive officer, 
Jamie Kellner, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's going to be a fragmented marketplace, make sure the  
fragment you're hanging onto is valuable in terms of advertisers,'' 
Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner, noting that he was in his 50s, concurred with the  
advertising community's firmly held belief that young viewers are 
more susceptible to commercials than older ones and thus worth 
paying higher ad rates to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB does not dismiss all older viewers, he said: adults 35 to  
49 make up 22 percent of WB's audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner made his remarks to the Television Critics Association,  
which opened its annual winter session Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Any gloating done by the network is understandable. Among  
competitors including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and UPN, WB is the only 
one to show a ratings increase from last season. WB is up in both 
households and in the 18-49 categories. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the No. 1 network with teen-agers.

<HEADLINE> 4 Tied After 1st Round at Mercedes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- No experience was necessary on the  
Kapalua Plantation course in the first round of the Mercedes 
Championship when trade winds disappeared off the northeast coast 
of Maui. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Durant was proof of that on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	A first-time winner on the PGA Tour last year, Durant had not  
played a round of tournament golf since before Thanksgiving and had 
never played in Hawaii. But there he was, rolling in one birdie 
putt after another in a round of 7-under 66 that gave him a share 
of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by Steve Pate, Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair, who  
all have played Kapalua before, but rarely in these conditions -- 
relative calm, relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was probably the most vulnerable it could play  
without any wind out there,'' Mayfair said. ``The scores are 
obviously an indication of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of the 30 players in the winners-only field failed to  
break par on a resort course with generous fairways and equally 
spacious greens -- Steve Jones, who played the par 5s in 2-over; 
Steve Elkington; and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course played strange without the wind,'' said Pate, who  
lost in a playoff in the Kapalua International in 1989. ``Dead calm 
and the course in good shape? You can go ahead and make some 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I wasn't the only one who did.''  
</P>
<P>
	Right behind the leaders was David Duval, a four-time winner on  
the PGA Tour who might not waste any time getting started in the 
new year. Duval birdied four of the last seven holes for a 66 and 
was tied with Billy Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Another stroke back Justin Leonard, despite two bogeys on par  
5s, and Jim Furyk, while the group at 69 included Tiger Woods, 
Davis Love III and Fred Couples. Love and Couples have each won 
twice at Kapalua. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions they are used to might not be far away. With a  
big storm system approaching, tee times today were moved up nearly 
three hours with hope of beating the rain. One night after the PGA 
Tour made its debut on prime-time television, ESPN agreed to show 
the second round on tape delay. 
</P>
<P>
	If the first round was any indication, there will be some wild  
and wacky developments to go along with the stunning view from the 
sloping Plantation course. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate made the first birdie of 1999 in a rather bizarre fashion.  
He argued with his caddie over club selection, insisting on a 
3-iron on the 470-yard, par-4 opening hole, and pulled the club 
from the bag. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit it to the back fringe, I looked down at it,'' Pate  
said. ``It wasn't a 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-iron left him 45 feet away, but he knocked that in for  
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good start to the year,'' Pate mused.  
</P>
<P>
	It got even better. On the 17th, Pate had a 70-foot birdie putt  
that he tried to lag close, but instead saw it disappear into the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to be close,'' he said. ``I was kind of  
shocked when it went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Durant had never played the Plantation course, but it helped to  
have a partner like Lee Janzen. All day long, their putts were on 
the same line and Janzen was usually away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me great reads,'' Durant said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of those was on the 203-yard eighth hole, when Durant left  
his 6-iron 50 feet short of the hole with a huge hump in between 
and the green sloping hard to the left. After watching Janzen miss 
his putt way left, Durant played twice as much break and made it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked him for that,'' Durant said. ``I fixed his ball  
marks the rest of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods had a first round that summed up his 1998 season -- lots of  
opportunities, not much to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	He three-putted from about 20 feet on the first hole, then  
responded with a 60-foot birdie putt on the next hole. He drove the 
305-yard, par-4 14th but three-putted from the fringe for par, 
missed one green by about 60 yards to the right for bogey and then 
two-putted for birdie from about 8 feet on the last hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're more nervous over some putts from 4 feet than you are  
over others from 60 feet,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercedes moved this year from La Costa Resort in Carlsbad,  
Calif., to the Kapalua Resort renowned for winds that turn club 
selection into guesswork and keep scores from getting very low. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you don't have the trades, I think it brings everybody in  
a little bit and becomes more of a putting match,'' Andrade said. 
``It's kind of cool when the winds are whipping. Makes it kind of 
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> House Opens Congress' 106th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new Congress convened with promises to  
cooperate on big issues such as Social Security and education, but 
only after first concentrating on the highly partisan impeachment 
trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House opened the 106th session of Congress on Wednesday by  
electing as its new speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, a soft-spoken 
Midwesterner who urged Democrats to join him in ending the 
political wars that have divided Congress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting some housekeeping matters and reappointing the  
13 lawmakers who will prosecute the impeachment case, the House 
recessed until Jan. 19, when the president is scheduled to deliver 
his State of the Union address to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate stayed behind, taking formal steps to begin the trial  
on whether to remove Clinton from office for allegedly lying under 
oath and obstructing justice while trying to conceal his affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., was to  
formally present articles of impeachment to the Senate and Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist was to be sworn in to preside over the 
trial. Rehnquist in turn was administering an oath to the 100 
senators who will sit as a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, an Illinois Republican beginning his seventh term in  
the House, made clear that he wants a change from the 
contentiousness that marked the four years of his predecessor, Rep. 
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of  
bitterness,'' he said in his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will meet you halfway, maybe more so on occasion,'' he told  
the Democrats. ``I expect you to meet me halfway too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, in handing the  
gavel to Hastert, said, ``let's bury the hatchet. ... Let's join 
together, not only in words but in deeds, to do right by the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation will be necessary in a House where Republicans hold  
one of the smallest majorities in recent history. After losing five 
seats in the November elections, Republicans have 222 seats while 
the Democrats have 211. There is one independent who generally 
votes Democratic. Gingrich resigned his seat along with the 
speakership, so there is one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the Republicans maintained their 55-45 majority,  
but that's still well short of the 60 needed to give the party in 
power a free hand to overcome filibusters and move their bills 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Republicans have four general goals for this session: 
reforming the Social Security system and Medicare; improving 
education, with the emphasis on more local control; tax relief; and 
bolstering the national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to advance on all four fronts -- to enhance  
security, to promote responsibility, to strengthen freedom and to 
foster opportunity for all,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Action in the Senate on Wednesday was mostly behind the scenes,  
as senators struggled to come up with a formula on the length and 
structure of Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats wanted a short 
trial without witnesses, but many Republicans pressed for a longer 
proceeding with some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief business session, the House voted by voice to ease  
three-year-old rules under which members and staff were barred from 
accepting any gifts from constituents or lobbyists, no matter how 
small. Instead, they adopted Senate rules that allow gifts valued 
at up to $50, with a $100 cap on gifts from any one source in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us, members and staff, have a whole lot more important  
things to do than sit around trying to decide whether a gift of a 
pie or a can of popcorn is acceptable,'' said Rep. James Hansen, 
R-Utah, chairman of the ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also reappointed 13 House Republicans first named in  
the last session to act as ``managers'' in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats urged rejection of the reappointment, saying it was  
the last chance for the House to end the impeachment process so 
lawmakers could turn to a censure resolution. Members should ``cast 
a vote to really in my view end this nightmare,'' said Rep. Robert 
Menendez, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers were reappointed 223-198, with all 218 voting  
Republicans and five Democrats supporting the motion.

<HEADLINE> FCC Reviewing Telecom Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission hopes to  
decide the fate of three proposed telecommunications mergers within 
six months, the agency's chairman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC is reviewing the planned mergers of AT&AMP;T Corp. and  
Tele-Communications Inc., SBC Communications Inc. and Ameritech 
Corp., and Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp. to determine whether 
they would serve the public interest, a broad legal standard that 
can include the impact on competition. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 30, the Justice Department approved AT&AMP;T's $40 billion  
takeover on the condition that cable giant TCI sells its stake in a 
mobile phone company, called Sprint PCS. The department is 
reviewing the other two deals. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard told reporters Thursday that the  
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger ``has the prospect of being a very exciting 
transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't comment on the prospects for the two other deals,  
including whether conditions would be imposed on them. ``I'm not 
prepared to say what the definitive cuts are'' because the review 
is not complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard did say it was important for all the companies to be  
more specific about when residential consumers will see the 
benefits of more competition, choices and new services being 
promised through the mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T plans to upgrade TCI's cable lines to offer local phone and  
other services, a move that could crack open the Baby Bells' lock 
on local phone service. But opponents, including America Online, 
want the FCC to provide it and other companies with guaranteed 
access to TCI's upgraded, high-speed, cable lines to provide 
competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, the FCC will take steps at its Jan. 28  
meeting to ease congestion on the Internet by giving 
telecommunications companies incentives to build more high-speed 
connections into U.S. homes, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, as one incentive, is expected to adopt rules that give  
the Bell companies and other major local phone providers, such as 
GTE, some regulatory relief in the delivery of high-speed data 
services. But they would have to provide the new services through a 
separate affiliate, something the Bells oppose saying it is 
unwarranted, costly and burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also said the FCC is ``putting the finishing touches''  
on an order that will resolve a dispute over how phone companies 
compensate each other for customers' calls to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also plans this year to revise federal ownership  
rules for broadcasters, make telephone bills easier to understand 
and promote more competition to cable companies, which are slated 
to have rates deregulated on March 31, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable rates have been rising sharply even though they are  
regulated. In retrospect, ``the commission was probably too 
liberal'' in letting companies raise rates for increases in 
programming and other business costs, Kennard conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, meanwhile, hopes 1999 will be the year that the FCC  
will let a Bell company offer long-distance service to local 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hasn't approved any such requests and none are pending.  
But analysts believe that Bell Atlantic has the best chance of 
winning FCC approval to provide long-distance service in New York. 
Bell Atlantic is expected to file a request to the FCC later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm encouraged that 1999 could be a breakthrough year in that  
respect,'' Kennard said.

<HEADLINE> Nelloms Denies Sexual Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Former Ohio State track star Chris Nelloms  
took the stand in his rape trial Thursday and denied he sexually 
assaulted the 12-year-old girl who has accused him. 
</P>
<P>
	His voice breaking with emotion, Nelloms told a Montgomery  
County Common Pleas Court jury he isn't guilty of the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a liar,'' he said of the girl. ``I think she's doing it  
because she's troubled and disturbed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms, 26, of suburban Trotwood, set school records at Ohio  
State and tried unsuccessfully to qualify for the 1996 Olympics in 
the 200-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Nelloms was charged with eight counts of rape of a  
child less than 13, one count each of attempting to commit rape of 
a child less than 13 and felonious sexual penetration of a child 
less than 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can he sit there so smug and so self-righteous ... and  
tell you that child came into this courtroom and lied about these 
things?'' Assistant Prosecutor Angela Frydman said in closing 
arguments on the fourth day of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Frydman said Nelloms isn't before the jury as a track star.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Nelloms is a child abuser,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kevin Lennen said the prosecution's case was  
``unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen said there supposedly were people in the area when the  
alleged rapes occurred, but no one saw or heard anything. He also 
said the doctor who testified for the prosecution could say only 
that he believed the girl had sexual intercourse at least once, 
even though Nelloms is accused of raping the child several times 
from 1995 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	She has accused Nelloms of raping her at homes in Dayton and  
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennen also said that police concluded the child had been abused  
before completing their investigation and that the girl showed no 
emotion during her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a 12-year-old child who told a lie. Why? I don't  
know,'' Lennen said. ``It's an unbelievable story that could only 
be told by a 12-year-old child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelloms faces a life sentence if convicted of any of the rape  
counts or the felonious sexual penetration charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Frydman told jurors Thursday that one of the eight rape counts  
against Nelloms had been dismissed. Lennen said the dismissal 
occurred because the girl changed her story about one of the 
alleged rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury finished deliberating about 8 p.m. Thursday with no  
verdict reached. Judge John Kessler sent jurors home and said 
deliberations would resume at 9 a.m. Friday.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Ethics Panel Probes IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An influential African member of the  
International Olympic Committee earned $60,000 profit on a Utah 
land deal arranged through a member of the Salt Lake bid committee, 
The Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga's purchase and sale of three residential lots  
is being investigated by a Salt Lake Olympic Committee ethics panel 
looking into allegations that bribes were used to win the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, from the Republic of Congo, bought the three luxury home  
parcels in Pleasant View, a suburb north of Ogden and about 20 
miles from the Olympic downhill race course. The purchase was made 
in September 1995, three months after the IOC awarded Salt Lake the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was introduced to the seller, a home builder, by Bennie  
Smith, a local businessman and bid committee member who spent eight 
years wooing African IOC members whose votes were considered 
crucial for Salt Lake. Smith is a member of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics panel is trying to determine the source of the  
cash for Ganga's investment, but lacks subpoena power necessary to 
obtain bank records, a source close to the investigation said 
Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said the Justice Department, which  
is investigating Salt Lake's bid and has subpoena power, makes a 
point of cooperating with parallel investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga in Paris, Brazzaville and Cameroon were  
unsuccessful. Smith did not return telephone messages left at his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga is president of the Association of National Olympic  
Committees of Africa and has been on the IOC since 1986. Smith, a 
former BYU and NFL player and the only African-American involved in 
Salt Lake's bid, had been assigned to win African votes during the 
city's failed 1991 effort and the successful 1995 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel's investigation is one of four inquiries under  
way to determine whether Salt Lake bribed IOC members by providing 
them or their relatives with scholarships and expensive gifts, 
including guns and free medical care. The other investigations are 
by the IOC, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations were launched after Salt Lake organizers  
admitted in November that the bid committee had made payments of 
nearly $400,000 in scholarship funds to 13 people, including six 
relatives of IOC members, primarily from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who heads that agency's  
investigation, said the purchase of land ``of and by itself is 
neutral.'' He said he had heard of Ganga's case but had not seen 
any documents concerning the investment. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are not allowed to accept gifts of more than $150.  
They also take an oath to refrain from ``political or commercial 
influence'' and abide by the Olympic charter, which calls for 
``respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga has been identified as one of three African IOC members  
who received free medical care from Salt Lake-based Intermountain 
Health Care. He reportedly was treated for hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	K. Brent Keller, a Weber County home builder, said that Smith  
was helping Ganga look for promising land investments when the two 
first visited Pleasant View in August 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller's brother had built a home for Smith in Salt Lake, so  
Smith contacted him to inquire about investment opportunities, 
Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga bought three half-acre, undeveloped lots on the hillside  
overlooking Ogden and the Great Salt Lake for $25,000 each. Keller 
then built a road to the lots, put in utilities and a storm basin, 
and Ganga sold the lots for $45,000 each, one in 1997 and the other 
two in August, for a profit of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``He basically played bank for me,'' Keller said. Without  
Ganga's purchase at essentially a wholesale price, Keller didn't 
have the cash to improve the lots for eventual sale to home buyers, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller was the contractor on the first home, which was recently  
finished, and plans to break ground next week for the second, to be 
built on the last two lots sold by Ganga. It will be worth more 
than $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The three lots, on the western slope of the Wasatch Range, are  
northwest and across the range from Snowbasin resort, site of the 
2002 downhill races. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said Ganga wrote a check when he bought the land in 1995,  
and as far as Keller knows, he used his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the warranty deed on file with the Weber County  
recorder's office is the notation: ``When recorded, mail to 
Jean-Claude Ganga, c/o Benny Smith, Beneco Enterprises, Salt Lake 
City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who actually spells his first name ``Bennie,'' owns  
Beneco Enterprises, a construction management and engineering 
company in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller said that after Ganga bought the land, Smith was no  
longer involved. 
</P>
<P>
	David and Merlene Neilson, who bought the twin lots from Ganga  
in August, said they never met Ganga but worked through Keller and 
their real estate agent, who dealt with Ganga's Salt Lake attorney, 
David E. Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga didn't budge much on the price, Neilson said. ``He had a  
certain profit he wanted to make and he stuck pretty close to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy did not return phone calls to his office.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, US West, a major sponsor of the 2002 Olympics, has  
decided to withhold a $5 million payment to SLOC until it can 
answer some questions the company has about the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	US West spokesman Michael Frandsen said Thursday ``there are  
still some issues we need to work through'' before making the 
payment. He noted that while the payment was expected on Thursday, 
the company still has several weeks to make it before it is 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, US West president Sol Trujillo wrote SLOC president  
Frank Joklik a strong letter protesting the ``unsavory 
allegations'' surrounding the bid for the Games. Frandsen said the 
company received a written response from SLOC a couple of days ago, 
but US West still had concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Frandsen declined to detail those concerns or release SLOC's  
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working through the issues that were outlined, and it's  
likely we will need more answers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Police Seek Shooting Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Washington (AP) -- The Justice Department said it is considering  
a request from the police chief in the nation's capital to 
investigate his officers' use of deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan Police Department Chief Charles Ramsey called  
Wednesday for a Civil Rights Division probe of every shooting 
involving District of Columbia police over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot afford to have people not have faith in their police  
department,'' Ramsey told reporters. He said the outside probe is 
needed to restore public confidence in the department amid 
questions surrounding the use of deadly force by his officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's homicide division investigates all shootings  
involving district police officers, but Ramsey is concerned that 
the department's probes may not resolve public concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have credibility right now,'' Ramsey told a news  
conference. A series of articles published by The Washington Post 
in December said district officers have shot and killed more people 
per resident in the 1990s than has any other large city police 
force in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Through last November, district police officers had been  
involved in 640 shootings in the 1990s -- 40 more than in Los 
Angeles, a city with six times the population, according to a 
compilation by the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Tony Williams supported Ramsey's request with his own  
letter to Attorney General Janet Reno. ``He brought this subject to 
me ... and I told him I was behind him 100 percent,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials acknowledged late Wednesday that  
the letters from Ramsey and Williams had been received. ``We are 
determining what response would be appropriate,'' said Justice 
Department spokesman Myron Marlin.

<HEADLINE> New Mass. Representative Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A former police sergeant who collected disability  
for nearly a year and filed suit when he was fired for not 
returning to work has been sworn in as a state representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose L. Santiago, who says he's too disabled to do any work as a  
police officer, says he is able to serve as a legislator because 
the tasks are ``not strenuous. It's a totally different line of 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago was sworn in to his two-year term Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Now his former employers in the Boston suburb of Methuen say  
Santiago's successful run for office should help disprove his 
pending disability claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the election as state representative probably proves  
the point somewhat,'' said Maurice Lariviere, an attorney for the 
city. ``We assume all state representatives do some work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago said he injured his back breaking up a fight at a  
Methuen High School football game in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He collected disability equal to his full salary, about $40,000  
a year, until city doctors determined he was fit to work. He was 
ordered back to his job in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago said when he returned, he was expected to return to his  
cruiser. He pulled himself off the job a few days later and sued 
after city doctors refused to approve an accidental disability 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Lariviere said Santiago's duties might have required some travel  
in the cruiser, but it was mostly office work, not full patrol 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago, 39, is seeking restoration of his disabled status and  
reimbursement for the year of pay that he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	If his status is restored and he is reinstated as a police  
officer, Santiago said he will probably take a leave of absence, 
allowing him to serve as a state representative at an annual base 
salary of $46,410.

<HEADLINE> Flutie Names NFL Comeback Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Doug Flutie has been through Boston,  
New Jersey, Chicago and Canada in his career. He never traveled so 
far so fast as he did this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His kindest critics said Flutie might make an acceptable backup  
when he signed with the Buffalo Bills last year. To others, he was 
a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Some considered him a downright disaster, and questioned the  
sanity of those calling the shots in the Bills' front office. 
</P>
<P>
	These days in Buffalo, crow is more popular than chicken wings.  
Simply put, Flutie salvaged a season and saved a team. 
</P>
<P>
	He restored respectability to the Bills and made football fun  
again in a football-crazy town. 
</P>
<P>
	His selection as The Associated Press NFL Comeback Player of the  
Year is a no-brainer, according to Flutie. And he's as 
self-effacing as they come. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie admits Randall Cunningham and Vinny Testaverde had better  
years throwing the ball. And there was no shortage of compelling 
stories -- Reggie White, Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``But people lost sight of Doug Flutie and what he was doing for  
eight years,'' Flutie said. ``I had to really come back from a long 
way away. I wasn't even in the stadium. They were sitting in the 
bleachers and jumped back down. I was outside selling popcorn and 
had to come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie came in from the cold. After capturing the Heisman Trophy  
and taking a short cruise with the ill-fated USFL, he tried his 
luck with the NFL's Bears and Patriots. ``America's Midget,'' Jim 
McMahon called him. Soon Flutie was on his way to New England, 
where he went 6-3 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight seasons in the Canadian Football League, he won the  
league's Most Outstanding Player Award six times, led the CFL in 
yards passing five times and led his team to three Grey Cup Titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't miss the NFL,'' Flutie said. ``But the one  
thing that did aggravate me was hearing the comments come back to 
you, people saying `Well, you couldn't get it done down here, 
that's why you're up there.' That wasn't the case at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After signing Flutie, the Bills traded two draft picks and  
shelled out millions for untested quarterback Rob Johnson, and 
named him the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I knew Rob was the starter, I was just hoping to be a  
part of the team and get into a position to contribute,'' Flutie 
said. ``My first goal was just to make the darn team, because that 
was not a given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie made his first NFL appearance since Dec. 3, 1989 -- a  
hiatus of eight years, nine months -- replacing the injured Johnson 
in the third quarter of the season opener at San Diego. Flutie led 
the Bills back from a 10-0 deficit to a 14-13 lead before the 
Chargers won 16-14 after Steve Christie's 39-yard field goal 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal game for Flutie was a 31-24 win over the  
Indianapolis Colts in which he played all but the first series 
after Johnson went down with a rib injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, a Pro Bowl selection, went on to win seven of his 10  
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a great season,'' offensive lineman Joe Panos said.  
``The starter got hurt, and he played so well the starter couldn't 
get his job back. That says a lot right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie threw for 2,711 yards and 20 touchdowns in the regular  
season and teamed with Eric Moulds to form one of the most 
dangerous duos in the league. Moulds caught 67 passes for a 
team-record 1,368 yards, and went on to set an NFL record with 240 
receiving yards in Saturday's playoff loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doug carried this team all year,'' Moulds said. ``And he  
believed in me to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flutie-engineered turnaround sparked an outpouring of  
enthusiasm -- and money -- just when the team approached owner Ralph 
Wilson's December deadline for selling $11 million in premium 
seating. The team beat the deadline, and will stay for at least 
another five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's success and status as a savior doesn't guarantee  
anything. After the loss to Miami, he said he expected to fight for 
his job again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a knack for losing my job in the offseason in  
this league,'' he said. ``I finish as a starter and come back as 
the number three, because I'm 5-10 or 5-9.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Football and fame are fleeting. ``Ten years from now, nobody's  
going to remember who won this game,'' he said before the loss to 
Miami, which ended with a rare solid hit on Flutie and a lost 
fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	And Flutie figures even after football has cast him aside for  
good, he'll still be a valuable contributor in some way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years from now, I'm going to have a 17-year-old autistic  
son that I've got to take care of,'' he said. ``And I'm going to 
mean the world to him.''

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders Rise 0.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to American factories rebounded in  
November, partially recovering from a sharp decline the month 
before, but analysts are watching a worrisome year-end spike in 
unemployment benefit applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $337 billion,  
following a 1.7 percent plunge -- the sharpest in five months -- in 
October, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth increase in six months, suggesting the economy  
was winding up 1998 on a strong note. For the first 11 months of 
the year, factory orders were 2 percent higher than the same period 
of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the year, healthy gains for computers,  
communications equipment and autos have helped offset a drop in 
orders to steel mills and a lackluster increase at aircraft plants, 
reflecting the world economic slump that began in Asia in the 
summer of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, in New York, major retail chains said deep discounts  
just before Christmas and right after the holiday lifted retail 
sales in December to respectable levels following a disappointing 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, investors took profits this morning after a  
record-setting day. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more 
than 70 points in early trading. It had shot up 234 points to a 
record 9,545 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the world slump, the nation's unemployment rate has  
hovered near 28-year lows through much of 1998. Demand for labor in 
service industries has helped re-employ laid-off factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, economists have been scrutinizing jobless claims at  
state unemployment offices for signs global weakness would pinch 
American workers more severely. 
</P>
<P>
	During the week ended Jan. 2, a seasonally adjusted 350,000  
claims were filed, the Labor Department said today. That 
represented a drop of 22,000 but it only partially made up for a 
jump of 83,000 -- to 372,000 -- the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims had hit an eight-month low of 289,000 during the week  
ended Dec. 19 before posting the largest increase in six years 
during Christmas week. Reports from states suggested the weather -- 
including flooding in the Northwest -- contributed to that big jump. 
</P>
<P>
	All the 12 states registering increases of 6,000 or greater are  
in the Midwest, Northwest and Northeast. Many cited layoffs in 
construction, but some also mentioned job losses in manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists cautioned against reading too much into the volatile  
weekly figures until a clear trend has been established. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes  
fluctuations, rose by 5,500 to 327,500 last week, the most since 
July when the General Motors strikes swelled unemployment numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, orders for big-ticket durable goods, items expected  
to last three or more years, rose 0.8 percent. They were led by a 
9.2 percent rebound in orders for primary metals such as steel, the 
first gain in the sector since August and the strongest in more 
than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for electronic components and other types of electrical  
equipment fell, but there were gains for stone, clay and glass 
products, fabricated metal products, industrial machinery and 
computers and communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders for nondurable goods advanced 0.3 percent, with an  
increase for chemical products offsetting a decline in textiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Orders are a key barometer of future factory activity. Shipments  
of manufactured goods, a gauge of current production, rose 0.4 
percent in November.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Cops Raid Alleged Brothel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- For 19-year-old Natalie Moffett,  
the money was too good to pass up, sometimes $650 a day in tips for 
doing ``a variety of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal went sour two months later when Ms. Moffett found  
herself standing naked in the middle of a bedroom, a nude man 
hiding in the closet, as police kicked in the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moffett, a student at the University of California, Santa  
Barbara, was one of five co-eds who allegedly stripped and 
performed sex acts while working at a brothel that advertised 
``College Cuties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moffett missed class Wednesday so she could testify against  
Patricia Cota, the 29-year-old woman accused of running the 
brothel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed the money,'' said Ms. Moffett, who received immunity  
from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation. ``Depending on 
the dollar amount, we would do a variety of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When police raided the bungalow apartment that Ms. Cota  
allegedly used as her brothel on Dec. 2, officers found Ms. Moffett 
in the middle of a bedroom and her client hiding in the closet, 
said Detective Tyler Larson, the lead investigator in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Barbara police have broken up two other alleged  
prostitution operations in the last several months in this scenic 
town along California's central coast, which hadn't had an arrest 
for running a brothel in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a coincidence, but it's strange,'' said Deputy District  
Attorney Joyce Dudley, who is prosecuting all three cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cota pleaded innocent in December to 17 counts of pimping,  
pandering, money laundering and cocaine possession. She faces 12 
years in prison if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
	According to testimony Wednesday, Ms. Cota found potential  
prostitutes by placing ads in newspapers for exotic dancers. She 
charged $125 for a half-hour strip show, and the women received 
$40. Ms. Cota pocketed the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cota listened to her dancers' activities using baby monitors  
in each bedroom and beeped them through an intercom if their strip 
act surpassed a half hour, Ms. Moffett said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Gelb estimated he visited the apartment 75 times from  
March to December and befriended Ms. Cota. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had just been a friend and not a client, I would have  
urged her to close her business down,'' Gelb testified. ``I didn't 
do that and I regret that.''

                        *Dr. Louis Jolyon West    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a psychiatrist and  
cult expert who conducted court-ordered examinations of Jack Ruby 
and Patricia Hearst, died Saturday of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	He headed the psychiatry department and the Neuropsychiatric  
Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles for 20 
years. He retired in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	West began studying torture and brainwashing during the Korean  
War, and expanded his research to include post-traumatic stress 
syndrome, alcohol and drug abuse, pain, sleep problems, dreams and 
hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	West frequently served as a court-appointed expert psychiatrist.  
He testified that Ruby, killer of President Kennedy's assassin, Lee 
Harvey Oswald, suffered from ``major mental illness apparently 
precipitated by the stress of his trial and its aftermath.'' That 
opinion forestalled Ruby's death sentence, and he died of cancer in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	West was also one of four psychiatrists who examined Hearst, the  
kidnapping victim turned bank robber, before her 1976 trial. The 
panel found she was sane and able to stand trial but recommended 
she should be treated before the trial, a recommendation ignored by 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	West was the first white psychiatrist to go to South Africa to  
testify on behalf of black prisoners during the attempt to end 
apartheid. He was a member of the White House Conference on Civil 
Rights in 1966, and he worked for years to abolish the death 
penalty.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Goro Yamaguchi, a master of shakuhachi, or bamboo  
flute, who is credited with introducing traditional Japanese music 
to the world, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Designated a ``living national treasure'' in Japan for his  
exceptional musical talents, Yamaguchi was also known in the United 
States. In 1977, a recording of Yamaguchi's playing was included in 
a selection of music sent into outer space on NASA's Voyager 2 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Until his death, he taught music at Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku, a  
respected school of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi began learning shakuhachi at age 11 from his father.  
Shakuhachi playing has been closely linked to the practice of Zen 
Buddhism throughout its history in Japan.

                          *Dr. Paul M. Zoll    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Paul M. Zoll, a heart specialist whose  
research led to the pacemaker and the defibrillator devices that 
have helped millions of patients, died Tuesday of respiratory 
arrest. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 45 years ago, Zoll was credited with showing for the  
first time that electrical stimulation can restart human hearts. 
His research led to developing the electrocardiogram and making 
open-heart surgery possible, said Dr. Seigo Izumo, director of 
cardiovascular research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Zoll won the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research  
Award, considered the leading scientific prize in the United 
States. The citation noted that his work led to the development of 
the closed-chest defibrillator, which shocks the heart to restore a 
normal rhythm, and cardiac monitors as well as the pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years he was a clinical professor at Harvard Medical  
School and a physician at Beth Israel Hospital. He also wrote many 
articles for professional journals and in 1956 was named associate 
editor of the medical journal Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, he founded Zoll Medical Corp., which  
manufactured defibrillators.

<HEADLINE> SEC Cracks Down on Y2K Disclosures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal securities regulators, extending their  
Year 2000 crackdown, have charged nine stock-transfer agents with 
allegedly failing to adequately disclose their computer readiness 
for the millennial year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission said Thursday that five  
of the agent companies have settled the charges and four are 
contesting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer agents, which sometimes are banks or trust companies,  
are responsible for keeping records of shareholders of corporations 
and for issuing or canceling stock certificates when shares are 
bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and fix  
Year 2000 computer problems could ``seriously disrupt'' 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the nine transfer agents charged, three have agreed in  
settlements to each pay a $7,500 civil fine, to be censured and to 
refrain from future such violations. They are Davidson Trust Co., 
Great Falls, Mont.; Ivy MacKenzie Services Corp., Boca Raton, Fla.; 
and CSJ LLC, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Two others -- Corporate Planners Inc., Fountain Hills, Ariz., and  
National Stock Transfer and Accounting Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, 
Fla. -- agreed to be censured and to refrain from future violations 
but not to pay a fine because they demonstrated they didn't have 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The four agents contesting the charges are Alpha Tech Stock  
Transfer Trust, Draper, Utah; Greenfield Fund Inc., Old Greenwich, 
Conn.; Manor Investment Funds Inc., West Chester, Pa.; and United 
Stock Transfer Inc., Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, the SEC took the government's first major  
enforcement action related to the Year 2000 problem, charging 37 
small brokerage firms with failing to fully report on their 
computer systems' preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities Industry Association has been concerned that some  
smaller brokerage firms may be less prepared than larger ones, and 
has been working with them on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also requires mutual fund companies and publicly traded  
corporations to disclose their readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about the Jan. 1, 2000 date stem from the fact that  
some computer systems may read only the last two digits of a 
four-digit year and interpret the year 2000 as 1900, potentially 
wreaking havoc on financial transactions.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Latest Starr Indictments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sketches of two women at the center of Thursday's indictment  
handed down by a grand jury working with Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr.	
</P>
<P>
 *JULIE HIATT STEELE 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va., entered the public  
spotlight because of her two-decade-long friendship with Kathleen 
Willey. She was quoted in a Newsweek article in August 1997 that 
first brought to light Mrs. Willey's allegation that President 
Clinton had made an unwanted sexual advance to her in 1993. Ms. 
Steele initially told a Newsweek reporter that Mrs. Willey had come 
to her home several hours after the alleged White House incident. 
</P>
<P>
	But later Ms. Steele told the reporter she had lied. In a sworn  
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against 
President Clinton, Ms. Steele said she had never heard of the 
alleged 1993 encounter between Clinton and Mrs. Willey when her 
friend suddenly called her in 1997. According to Ms. Steele's 
account, Mrs. Willey asked her to tell a reporter that Mrs. Willey 
had confided the entire episode to her right after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Willey also asked me to describe her demeanor at the time  
as 'upset, humiliated, disappointed and harassed,''' Ms. Steele 
said in the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	The former friends apparently are no longer in contact. The  
indictment charges that Ms. Steele sold The National Enquirer a 
photograph of Mrs. Willey and Clinton, which was published in 
August 1997. Ms. Steele, who was in the sales and marketing 
business, received $9,000 from the tabloid for the picture, 
according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the course of the independent counsel's investigation,  
accusations arose that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had probed 
the adoption of Ms. Steele's 8 year-old-child from a Romanian 
orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *KATHLEEN WILLEY   	
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Willey of Richmond drew national headlines in March  
when she detailed alleged sexual advances made by Clinton to her in 
a CBS ``60 Minutes'' interview. Mrs. Willey, a former White House 
volunteer, said Clinton groped her and kissed her on the mouth 
during a 1993 visit to the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the incident occurred at a meeting to which she came to  
discuss her grave financial problems and to ask to be moved from 
her White House volunteer job to a paid position. Mrs. Willey's 
husband, Edward E. Willey Jr., the son of an influential state 
senator from Richmond, committed suicide the same day Mrs. Willey 
met with the president. His body was found the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has denied the allegations, which became an issue in  
Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against the president. He said 
he simply hugged his friend and may have kissed her on the forehead 
to comfort her because she was distraught. The White House also 
released letters that Mrs. Willey wrote after the alleged incident, 
speaking of the president in glowing terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey and her lawyer later asserted that she endured  
several threatening encounters, including finding an animal skull 
on her porch the day after she gave testimony in the Jones case. 
Mrs. Willey worked in the office of the White House counsel and in 
the White House social office. In September 1996, Clinton appointed 
her to the board that governs the United Service Organizations.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Jury selection began under tight security  
today in a trial to determine whether an anti-abortion Web site 
that lists ``baby butchers'' and crosses off the names of those 
killed is an illegal invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking around the downtown federal courthouse was closed off,  
and marshals limited seating and searched journalists and 
spectators. There was no sign of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors will be asked to determine whether the site known as the  
Nuremberg Files, which lists the names of hundreds of doctors who 
perform abortions, their addresses, their license plate numbers, 
even the names of their children, is legally protected free speech 
or a thinly veiled hit list. 
</P>
<P>
	Those killed, including four doctors and two clinic workers  
since 1993, are crossed off like items on a grocery list. The 
wounded are shaded in a misty gray. 
</P>
<P>
	The site drew attention in October, when the name of Dr. Barnett  
Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was killed at his 
suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sites like Nuremberg are a threat to doctors because the  
anti-abortion movement in the United States follows up on threats 
like that with violence,'' said Bonnie Jones, a lawyer at New 
York's Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. ``These are not 
words in isolation. They are typically followed up with murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood, a women's health center and five doctors  
filed the multimillion-dollar lawsuit in 1995, claiming the site 
violates a federal law that bars activists from inciting violence 
against abortion doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	That law -- the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act --  
has often been used against people who have firebombed clinics or 
attacked doctors, but has never been used to challenge a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include the American Coalition of Life Advocates, an  
umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups nationwide, and 
Advocates for Life Ministries, a radical Portland-based group. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendant Michael Bray called the Web site a form of political  
protest and said the lawsuit is simply an attempt to stifle debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a horrendous interference with freedom of speech,'' said  
Bray, a Reformed Lutheran pastor from Bowie, Md., who spent nearly 
four years in prison for setting fires to clinics in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that a victory for Planned Parenthood could backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you are blocked of public protests, then people are left  
saying, `What are we going to do?''' Bray said. ``It leaves only 
one option: the covert use of force -- vandalism, blowing up places 
and terminating doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Henderson, a lawyer who has represented Bray but will not  
this time, said Planned Parenthood has no case unless they can 
prove anti-abortion forces intended to cause harm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd hate to see the constitution perverted by the claim that  
posting names and addresses alone on the Internet is cause for 
incitement,'' he said. ``You've got to have a whole lot more than, 
`You put my name up there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The site goes further than that. In some cases, it chronicles a  
doctor's personal history, property, physical appearance and 
wedding anniversary dates. It invites readers to send in photos, 
videotapes and background data on doctors, their cars, their house, 
their friends and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Site creator Neal Horsley, a 54-year-old computer programmer  
from Carrollton, Ga., has said the purpose of the Nuremberg Files 
is to build a dossier on ``every abortionist presently plying their 
bloody trade in the USA'' so they can be tried for ``crimes against 
humanity.'' Horsley is not named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ray Guggenheim, a retired Portland obstetrician whose name  
appears on the site, said the list has had a clear effect on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see the doctors they've crossed off. You tell me, is  
that free speech or intimidation?'' he said. ``It tends to make you 
think twice about what you believe in.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fighter Plane Attacks Iraq Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter attacked an  
air-defense radar installation in northern Iraq today after the 
pilot determined he was about to be fired on by a surface-to-air 
missile, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-16 launched a high-speed anti-radar missile at the site at  
about 11:15 a.m., Iraq time, according to a statement issued by the 
U.S. European Command, headquarters for Air Force planes involved 
in enforcing a ``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq. There was no 
immediate indication whether the missile damaged the radar. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-16 was not fired upon and returned safely to base,  
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. European Command statement, made available in  
Washington, said the F-16 pilot acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. missile firing was intended to ``prevent any offensive  
fire'' from the Iraqi air-defense site, the statement said. It was 
aimed at a tracking radar for Iraqi surface-to-air missile 
launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was the latest in a series of confrontations with  
Iraq since the Dec. 16-19 U.S.-British bombardment known as 
Operation Desert Fox. Earlier this week four U.S. warplanes fired 
on -- but missed -- Iraqi planes in a ``no-fly'' zone over southern 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In those confrontations, said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon,  
13 to 15 Iraqi aircraft attempted to violate the no-fly zone in a 
rash of eight suspicious incursions. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's incident was the fourth military confrontation with Iraq  
within the past two weeks over enforcing the no-fly zones in 
northern and southern Iraq. Iraq considers the restrictions illegal 
and has vowed to defy them. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice last week, U.S. warplanes fired on Iraqi surface-to-air  
missile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In other recent incidents, Iraqi air-defense forces have  
sometimes fired surface-to-air missiles at U.S. and British planes 
patrolling the ``no-fly zones'' without turning on their tracking 
radars in order to avoid having them targeted and attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say Iraq has increased the number of  
surface-to-air missile launchers in the ``no-fly'' zones. Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein has insisted the flight restrictions -- 
imposed by the United States, Britain and France after the 1991 
Gulf War -- are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam has vowed to defy the flight bans by keeping aircraft  
flying and by firing on allied air patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. or British planes have been hit in the recent clashes,  
although Iraq claimed to have shot down one plane last week. The 
planes patrolling the northern zone are based at Incirlik Air Base 
in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has vowed to continue enforcing the ``no-fly''  
zones, which he says are vital to his policy of containing Saddam's 
military ambitions and protecting the minority Kurds in the north 
and Shiite Muslims in the south.

<HEADLINE> 8 Religious Leaders Back Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eight prominent Protestant and Jewish officials  
have sent letters to each member of the Senate, urging them to 
censure President Clinton and avoid ``an exhausting, debilitating 
trial that could drive him from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signers of the letters, sent Wednesday, included the chief  
executives of Judaism's Reform and Conservative rabbinical 
associations and the National Council of Churches. The council 
includes moderate and liberal Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
	The religious leaders said such a trial would ``have deleterious  
international consequences'' and divide the country. The president 
``has sinned by his own admission,'' they said, but there has been 
no ``subversion of our government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters state that when leaders in the Bible failed, ``they  
were punished for their wrongdoings, but the people were not 
deprived of their leadership.'' In the Clinton case, they 
recommended ``punishment with penitence, and healing with 
compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some conservative Protestants have called for the president's  
resignation or removal. Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church have 
taken no stand.

<HEADLINE> Superflares Can Fry Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Superflares powerful enough to fry nearby  
planets regularly erupt from distant stars that are just like the 
sun, but such death-dealing explosions are unlikely to occur in the 
solar system, astronomers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Yale University researchers said Wednesday that they have  
found nine solar-type stars that have erupted in flares up to 10 
million times more powerful than anything ever recorded from the 
sun. There is preliminary evidence for at least seven others, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sun were to have such an eruption, said Bradley E.  
Schaefer, it could possibly cause mass extinctions, plunge the 
Earth into brief heat wave, flood the planet with gamma and X-rays, 
melt electronics in orbiting satellites, cause global auroras and 
wipe out for up to two years all of the ozone that protects the 
Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of ozone could kill the food chain and probably cause  
mass extinctions,'' Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even smaller bursts, he said, could burn out all of the  
electricity distribution systems on Earth, plunging the planet into 
a global power outage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yale professor said there is no evidence that such  
powerful ``superflares'' have ever erupted from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen here,'' Schaefer said repeatedly in a  
presentation at the national meeting of the American Astronomical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said that an examination of astronomy archives  
uncovered proof that superflares erupt about once a century from G 
type, main sequence stars, the stellar type that is just like the 
Earth's own sun. The erupting stars are up to 100 light years away 
and pose no threat to the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that superflares do occur on disturbingly normal  
solar-type stars,'' said Schaefer. ``Superflares are 100 to 10 
million times more energetic than the brightest solar flares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the superflares last for one hour to one week and cause  
the stars to brighten by to 1,000 times their normal luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said he believes the sun will never erupt with such  
powerful flares because there is no evidence that it has ever 
happened during the 4 billion year history of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun has been scientifically studied for more than 150 years  
and the most powerful solar flares detected have been only a 
fraction of energy in superflares, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, astronomy records going back for 2,000 years have  
never recorded a superflare from the sun, said Schaefer. And, 
furthermore, such a superflare would have melted the ice on the 
moons of Jupiter and left smooth frozen plains. Recent spacecraft 
pictures of the moons show no such evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric P. Rubenstein, another Yale astronomer, said the eruptions  
probably occur because the distant stars have Jupiter-sized planets 
in a very close orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant planets in orbit close to a star, he said, would cause a  
twisting and stretching of the magnetic fields that radiate out 
from stars and from most planets. The twisted magnetic field lines 
eventually would explode with a sudden release of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his proposed superflare process is rather like what  
happens when rubber bands are twisted and twisted until they 
finally break and snap. The result is a sudden release of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubenstein said that if his theory is correct, it would explain  
why the sun has never had a superflare. Jupiter and Saturn do have 
strong magnetic fields, but the giant gaseous planets are both too 
far out to interact powerfully with the magnetic field of the sun, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Retreat / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell Friday morning amid  
concern about the outlook for profit growth at exporters amid 
continued volatility in global currency markets. The dollar edged 
lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average slid 185.24 points, or 1.37 percent, to  
13,351.32 points at the end of the morning trading. On Thursday, 
the average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 110.91 yen at late morning, down 0.07 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its level of 111.04 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares lost ground on worries about  
a stronger yen after the dollar plunged earlier to a 27-month low 
against the Japanese currency of 109.88 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players remain cautious about the recent rise of the yen,  
although some electric machinery makers have continued to post 
gains,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen erodes the value of profits made overseas by  
Japan's many exporters. Stocks of major auto and electronics 
manufacturers were among early losers, including shares of Sony 
Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 13.14 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,056.46. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.21  
points to close Thursday's session at 9,537.76. The blue-chip index 
had fallen nearly 120 points in early afternoon but rallied back, 
partially on a rise in bank shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Dow leaped 233.78 points to a record-high  
9,544.97. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slipped on profit-taking  
following the U.S. currency's moderate rebound from lows. 
Yen-buying by speculators also helped nudge the dollar's value down 
against the yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at $1.1716, up from $1.1642 in Tokyo late  
Thursday and also above $1.1713 late Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.675  
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.710 percent, driving its price 
up to 101.01 yen from 100.73 yen.

<HEADLINE> Cadillac Clings to Luxury Car Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Cadillac pulled it off in December: It's still  
the U.S. luxury king -- barely. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to sales of its big new Escalade sport utility vehicle,  
Cadillac managed to outsell Lincoln by just 222 vehicles for the 
year. The final score: Cadillac 187,343, Lincoln 187,121. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the folks at Cadillac had expected to lose the sales crown  
the General Motors Corp. division has now held for 49 years. Ford 
Motor Co.'s Lincoln was riding high on sales of its own luxury SUV, 
the Navigator. At the end of November, Lincoln had a lead of 6,783 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac's sales had been down in part because of last summer's  
strikes against GM, which halted production for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The venerable division overcame Lincoln's lead by selling 3,642  
new Escalades and 5,008 Seville sedans, compared with only 730 
Sevilles in December 1997. The Seville moved with the assistance of 
rebates up to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far behind Cadillac and Lincoln was DaimlerChrysler AG's  
Mercedes-Benz unit, which sold 170,245 cars and SUVs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cadillac introduced the Escalade this fall after rushing it into  
production at its Arlington, Texas, SUV plant to compete with 
Navigator. It is virtually identical to the GMC Yukon Denali.

<HEADLINE> NBA Governors Back Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved  
the lockout settlement today, and the league immediately went to 
work trying to win back the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner David Stern said the league hopes to start the  
season Feb. 5 and play about 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will play two exhibition games -- one home and one away  
-- and admission would be free, Stern said, appearing at a news 
conference with union director Billy Hunter and deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting next season, at least 500 tickets for every regular  
season game will be priced at $10 to lure families to arenas, Stern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some winning back of fans to do, and we're going to do  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most important to us is that basketball games will be upon us  
again, and as a fan I am elated,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-0 vote by the owners was done by a show of hands, rather  
than a secret ballot. It came one day after negotiators agreed on a 
new seven-year collective bargaining agreement to end the 
6-month-old lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players had approved the deal 179-5 on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will remain in effect until the agreement is put  
into written form, a process that could take up to 10 days. Team 
facilities will open Monday, but players will not yet be allowed to 
work with coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The league also lifted its gag order on owners, general managers  
and coaches, so long as they are only asked about basketball 
matters -- not collective bargaining issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors' meeting lasted for about two hours.  
Stern and Granik opened the meeting by addressing the 
representatives from each of the 29 teams, and a league attorney 
explained the details of the new labor agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter then was brought into the room and given a chance to  
speak to the owners, just as Stern was permitted to speak to the 
players a day earlier following their ratification vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``No applause was asked for or offered,'' Atlanta Hawks  
president Stan Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granik announced the agreement should be put into written form  
by Jan. 18, after which training camps will be allowed to open and 
teams permitted to sign free agents and make trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will last through the end of April, and the  
playoff format will remain unchanged. Granik said the NBA Finals 
should conclude by June 29 or 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all happy to be back in the basketball business,''  
Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's agreement was reached just 29 hours before the Board  
of Governors was to vote on canceling the rest of the season. It 
came during an all-night bargaining session at NBA headquarters 
between Stern and Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Patrick Ewing was not present at the final  
bargaining session or today's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad this is over,'' Hunter said. ``Our players are  
anxious to play, and we're anxious to join hands with David, Russ 
and the owners of the 29 teams to really create a strong and 
familial relationship -- one that will take the NBA to another level 
and to bring back the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only regret I have is that is took us so long to get where  
we are,'' Hunter said. ``We're glad to be back, and we'll do 
whatever we have to do in order to demonstrate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout, now in its 192nd day, was the most divisive labor  
battle in league history. It finally ended when Stern and Hunter 
compromised on the remaining issues keeping them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can exhale now, without a doubt,'' said Alonzo Mourning of  
the Miami Heat. ``The deal is done and we can just focus our mind 
right now on starting back up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Did we blink? I guess we both blinked,'' Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. It gives owners the unprecedented concession of a 
maximum limit on individual salaries and will be in place for six 
years, with owners having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, for their part, came away with their dignity intact  
and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season can begin, there will be a three-week frenzy  
of teams scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of 
the 200 free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis  
Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Jayson Williams, Vlade 
Divac, Matt Geiger, Jerry Stackhouse, Theo Ratliff, Rod Strickland 
and Damon Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the games get started, players will be faced with an  
exhausting schedule until playoffs start. Teams will be asked on 
occasion to play three games in three nights, something that hasn't 
happened in the last 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Lindt Recalls Chocolates for Nuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lindt &AMP; Sprungli Inc. is recalling some  
chocolate products because they may contain undeclared traces of 
peanut butter or hazelnuts. The products pose the risk of a life 
threatening reaction if eaten by someone allergic to nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Being recalled voluntarily are selected lots of the Lindt  
Chocolate Truffle, Lindt Amaretto Truffles, and the Lindt Milk 
Chocoletti Bar. The company said Wednesday it had received three 
reports since late December of possible allergic reactions to the 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Two children were reported to have been treated in hospital  
emergency rooms because of the severity of their allergic reactions 
to peanut traces in the truffle products. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindt, based in Stratham, N.H., said the recall was initiated  
with the knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration because the 
packaging of items does not indicate the presence of peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it can make no assurances that other products  
may not also contain traces of peanuts or nuts. Lindt said people 
allergic to nut products should not eat its chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
	The three products recalled:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lindt Chocolate Truffle Christmas Tins, 2nd Edition, Lot 5658.  
They were distributed nationally through independent retail stores, 
including Staples and Army/Air Force/Marine exchange stores. The 
red Christmas Tins are decorated with a Christmas scene. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lindt Amaretto Truffle Seconds, Lot 1668. They were distributed  
in only six Lindt retail stores in Riverhead, N.Y.; Burlington, 
Vt.; and the New Hampshire towns of Portsmouth, Stratham, 
Londonderry and West Lebanon. The Amaretto Truffles are unwrapped 
and packaged in clear plastic bags. The 48-count bag is called 
``Amaretto Truffles,'' and the 20-count bag is called ``Gourmet 
Truffles with Amaretto Flavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Lindt Milk Chocoletti Bars. They were distributed nationally  
through independent retail stores and also were distributed through 
Lindt retail stores in New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, 
Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, 
Virginia and Maryland. The 3.5-ounce bars contain 18 individual 
pieces and come in a blue box. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who purchased the products in the lot numbers  
indicated should return them to the place of purchase for a full 
refund. Consumers with questions may contact Lindt at 800-338-0839 
or 603-778-8100 and ask to speak with Robyn Long.

<HEADLINE> Speculation Surrounds Hoyas Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georgetown men's basketball team, suffering  
through its worst season in John Thompson's 27 years as coach, has 
called a ``major'' press conference for Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is regarding coach Thompson,'' men's basketball spokesman  
Bill Shapland said Thursday. ``In all my years here, this is most 
major press conference I've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapland declined to elaborate. He said the news conference was  
scheduled for 10 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hoyas are off to their worst start ever in the Big East.  
They are 0-4 in the conference and only one of the games was close. 
They are 7-6 overall, mainly due to victories over perennial 
non-conference patsies Thompson has made a point to schedule every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the balance of the Big East schedule ahead, Georgetown  
appears on pace to have a losing record for the first time since a 
12-14 record in 1972-73, his first year as coach in the 1972-73 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years following, Thompson turned the Hoyas into a  
national powerhouse, culminating with the school's only NCAA 
championship in 1984. His overall record is 596-239, a .713 winning 
percentage, and his program gained a reputation for having its 
players graduate on time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dynasty has faded over the last few years, starting in  
1996 when Allen Iverson became Thompson's first player to declare 
early for the NBA draft. Victor Page, Ed Sheffey and Kenny Brunner 
also left early, for various reasons, and all four -- especially 
Iverson -- have been involved in off-the-court incidents that have 
tarnished the school's carefully cultivated sports reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Thompson last year allegedly received threatening phone  
calls from a former player, Kevin Millen, who in November ignored 
an order to stay off campus. Millen is being held in a halfway 
house and is scheduled to stand trial Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Georgetown finished with a 15-14 regular season  
record and was invited to the NIT on reputation alone. The Hoyas 
defeated Florida before losing to Georgia Tech in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, showed up for media day this season with all the  
enthusiasm of a first-year coach. Realizing his current team would 
struggle, he talked about the top-notch recruiting class on its way 
in the fall of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Help is coming,'' Thompson said. ``We have to hold on one more  
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's son, Ronny, 29, joined the Georgetown staff as an  
assistant this season.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Should Have Coach Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers will have a coach by  
the start of the season. Soon afterward, they'll even have a 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers vice president Elgin Baylor as much as guarantees it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to be able to name the coach at the beginning of next  
week. We're down to three (candidates),'' Baylor said Thursday at a 
news conference several hours after the NBA lifted the gag order it 
imposed on team officials during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed that the three finalists for the job are former  
Clippers assistant Jim Brewer, former Sacramento Kings coach Eddie 
Jordan, and former Milwaukee and Boston coach Chris Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer is considered the front-runner for the job left vacant  
since Bill Fitch was fired after four seasons, but Baylor would say 
only, ``He's one of the candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had further interviews scheduled, Baylor replied,  
``I've talked with the candidates and there are details to be 
worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers will start the shortened season without the center  
they made the first player taken in the last NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Olowokandi, a 7-foot-1 Nigerian who grew up in England  
and has played competitive basketball just three years, is in 
Europe after signing a short-term, $1 million deal with an Italian 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	He has an escape clause that allows him to leave on Feb. 15. The  
NBA's 50-game regular season is scheduled to start on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back on the 15th of February,'' Baylor said. ``I  
talked to his agent and he said he'd be on the first plane back 
(after fulfilling his obligation with the Italian team). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking forward to coming back and playing in the NBA.  
It's unfortunate that it (Olowokandi's agreement to play in Europe) 
couldn't have happened a few days later, but he had to do it by the 
fourth of January.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor said he didn't resent the fact that Olowokandi went to  
play in Italy, adding that the difference in the European game 
should help the young center sharpen his outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Olowokandi, who played at the University of the Pacific,  
joins the Clippers, they probably will use Lorenzen Wright at 
center. He's a 6-11, 240-pounder who's more effective at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lorenzen has played that position (center) before, and very  
well,'' Baylor said. ``But that's going to be the coach's 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor reiterated that the Clippers are in the market for a  
point guard. Darrick Martin and Pooh Richardson shared the job last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the team apparently is willing to let forward Loy Vaught,  
the franchise's leading career rebounder, go as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, however, said he could not comment on Vaught's status.

<HEADLINE> Class of 1999 Heads for Cooperstown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When he started his pitching career, Nolan Ryan  
seemed like the last guy in the world likely to wind up in the Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike George Brett and Robin Yount, who are accompanying him to  
Cooperstown, Ryan was erratic and inconsistent, a kid who could 
throw hard but with very little idea where those pitches would wind 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like a young Sandy Koufax, except Koufax had only four  
no-hitters. Ryan wound up with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was the odd man out on a Mets staff headed by Tom Seaver,  
Jerry Koosman and Gary Gentry, the nucleus of the team's 1969 world 
championship. The hard-throwing pitcher was in a high-priority 
military reserve unit, required to report to meetings every other 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pitching maybe every 10th day,'' he said. ``I was  
erratic and wild. I wasn't happy my four years with the Mets. I was 
frustrated with the lack of success and no consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were frustrated, too, and shipped Ryan and three other  
players to California in 1971 for Jim Fregosi. 
</P>
<P>
	``That trade kicked off my career,'' Ryan said. ``I had no more  
military obligation. I went into a four-man rotation. Tom Morgan 
was the pitching coach. Jeff Torborg was my catcher. I was able to 
pitch over 300 innings the first year. That was what I needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the real beginning of one of the most dominating power  
pitching careers in baseball history. Ryan won 324 games and struck 
out a record 5,714 batters to go with those seven no-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers earned him 98.79 percent of the 497 ballots cast  
by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. 
Ryan's total was the second-highest in history, trailing only 
Seaver's 98.84 in 1992. Brett received 98.19 percent, trailing only 
Seaver, Ryan and Ty Cobb's 98.23 in 1936's first election. Yount 
received 77.46 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of them had great games and great seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	Yount remembered hitting two home runs against Jim Palmer in the  
last game of the 1982 season to push Milwaukee past Baltimore into 
the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett remembered celebrating the 1985 World Series championship  
in Kansas City after the Royals recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the 
playoffs and another 3-1 deficit in the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	And Ryan remembered pitching on that 1969 Mets staff.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back, some of the most memorable moments were  
things that occurred as a team,'' he said. ``The '69 Mets, nobody 
expected us to win. You develop a cohesiveness and there are 
memories and a special feeling. It was a unique group that came 
together at a very early age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Ryan thought about pitching on a staff with Seaver,  
Koosman, Gentry, Jon Matlack and Tug McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been fun to stay together for 10 or 15 years and  
see what we could accomplish,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Off on his own, he accomplished plenty. Brett, who won three  
batting titles, recalled hitting against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I faced Nolan, he was with California,'' Brett  
said. ``I was batting seventh, behind Jim Wohlford. He hit Jim in 
the ribs and the ball seemed to stick there for a minute before it 
fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim was trying to breathe and he couldn't. Then I came up and  
took three pitches, three strikes. That was good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan recalled pitching to Yount and how impressed he was with  
the rookie's courage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember Robin was only 18, but he choked up and stood up on  
the plate,'' Ryan said. ``You couldn't intimidate him. He'd hang in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount frowned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't intimidated?'' he asked. ``I must have hid it well.  
It took three or four years for me to catch up with that fastball. 
If you didn't turn it up a notch, you were in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, who had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 20-year career  
with the Kansas City Royals, went 29-for-101 lifetime against Ryan. 
That was better than Yount, who had 3,142 career hits but only 16 
in 69 swings against Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ryan-Brett-Yount rookie sweep marked the first time three  
first-year candidates were elected to the Hall of Fame since Cobb, 
Babe Ruth, Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson 
comprised the first class at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	The three will be inducted Sunday, July 25.

<HEADLINE> Laborers Union Clean-Up Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Laborers union on Thursday was given another  
year to rid itself of corruption, preventing court-appointed 
officers from taking over and cleaning house. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid racketeering charges, the Laborers agreed in February  
1995 to weed out alleged mob lieutenants from its ranks and hold 
direct elections of its officers. The Justice Department extended 
that agreement until Jan. 31, 2000, saying the union has made 
strides in its internal reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``This extension recognizes that additional time is needed to  
complete efforts to eliminate corruption from the union,'' said 
U.S. Attorney Scott Lassar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Laborers International Union of North America is one of the  
nation's largest labor unions, with 700,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The union held its first contested nationwide election in 1996  
under independent supervision. It placed leadership councils in 
Chicago, New York and Buffalo under trusteeship because of 
perceived ties to organized crime. Other changes include adopting 
an ethics and disciplinary code. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said proof that the group's disciplinary  
process is working can be seen in misconduct charges filed against 
the current president, Arthur Coia, accused of associating with 
mafia members. 
</P>
<P>
	Coia has denied that he is under mob influence.  
</P>
<P>
	The Laborers voluntary deal was seen as precedent-setting in  
1995. The government has forced supervision on other unions, 
including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Hotel 
Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union.

<HEADLINE> Superflares Can Fry Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Superflares powerful enough to fry nearby  
planets regularly erupt from distant stars that are just like the 
sun, but such death-dealing explosions are unlikely to occur in the 
solar system, astronomers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Yale University researchers said Wednesday that they have  
found nine solar-type stars that have erupted in flares up to 10 
million times more powerful than anything ever recorded from the 
sun. There is preliminary evidence for at least seven others, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sun were to have such an eruption, said Bradley E.  
Schaefer, it could possibly cause mass extinctions, plunge the 
Earth into brief heat wave, flood the planet with gamma and X-rays, 
melt electronics in orbiting satellites, cause global auroras and 
wipe out for up to two years all of the ozone that protects the 
Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The loss of ozone could kill the food chain and probably cause  
mass extinctions,'' Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even smaller bursts, he said, could burn out all of the  
electricity distribution systems on Earth, plunging the planet into 
a global power outage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Yale professor said there is no evidence that such  
powerful ``superflares'' have ever erupted from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to happen here,'' Schaefer said repeatedly in a  
presentation at the national meeting of the American Astronomical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said that an examination of astronomy archives  
uncovered proof that superflares erupt about once a century from G 
type, main sequence stars, the stellar type that is just like the 
Earth's own sun. The erupting stars are up to 100 light years away 
and pose no threat to the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that superflares do occur on disturbingly normal  
solar-type stars,'' said Schaefer. ``Superflares are 100 to 10 
million times more energetic than the brightest solar flares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the superflares last for one hour to one week and cause  
the stars to brighten by to 1,000 times their normal luminosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said he believes the sun will never erupt with such  
powerful flares because there is no evidence that it has ever 
happened during the 4 billion year history of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun has been scientifically studied for more than 150 years  
and the most powerful solar flares detected have been only a 
fraction of energy in superflares, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, astronomy records going back for 2,000 years have  
never recorded a superflare from the sun, said Schaefer. And, 
furthermore, such a superflare would have melted the ice on the 
moons of Jupiter and left smooth frozen plains. Recent spacecraft 
pictures of the moons show no such evidence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric P. Rubenstein, another Yale astronomer, said the eruptions  
probably occur because the distant stars have Jupiter-sized planets 
in a very close orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Giant planets in orbit close to a star, he said, would cause a  
twisting and stretching of the magnetic fields that radiate out 
from stars and from most planets. The twisted magnetic field lines 
eventually would explode with a sudden release of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his proposed superflare process is rather like what  
happens when rubber bands are twisted and twisted until they 
finally break and snap. The result is a sudden release of energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubenstein said that if his theory is correct, it would explain  
why the sun has never had a superflare. Jupiter and Saturn do have 
strong magnetic fields, but the giant gaseous planets are both too 
far out to interact powerfully with the magnetic field of the sun, 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bourque Sets All-Star Start Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Boston Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque has  
extended his NHL record for All-Star game starts to an even dozen. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Bourque as North America all-star starters at the Jan.  
24 game in Tampa, Fla., are goaltender Martin Brodeur of the New 
Jersey Devils, defenseman Al MacInnis of the St. Louis Blues, 
center Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings and wings Brendan 
Shanahan of Detroit and Paul Kariya of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bourque will be making his 17th career all-star appearance. Only  
Gordie Howe (23) had made more appearances. Wayne Gretzky also has 
17 appearances, nine as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan led all North America all-stars in balloting, receiving  
252,955 votes to earn his third career start. Kariya, who also will 
be making his third career start, was second with 248,434 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	MacInnis will be making his first start since 1992 and fifth  
overall, while both Brodeur and Yzerman will each be making their 
second career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan and Yzerman bring the number of Red Wings earning  
all-star starts to four. Defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Uwe Krupp 
were voted to the World all-star starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The last club to send four starters to the all-star game was the  
Pittsburgh Penguins in 1992 for the Wales Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining players on the North America all-star team roster,  
to be selected by the NHL's hockey operations department after 
consultation with league general managers, will be announced 
Tuesday.

	Senate Opens Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
presiding, the Senate today somberly began the historic trial of 
President Clinton. The nation's 42nd president -- and only the 
second to face a trial -- was at the White House when all 100 
senators stood at their desks in the Capitol, raised their hands 
and swore to render ``impartial justice'' in his case. The White 
House promised a ``compelling case'' for acquittal. After opening 
procedures, the trial recessed to let senators make further plans. 

</P>
<P>
	Senators Seek Trial Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders struggled today for an elusive  
accord on guidelines for the impeachment trial of President 
Clinton. They called an extraordinary closed-door meeting of all 
senators tomorrow. ``I think there is some common ground,'' said 
the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle. But Majority Leader Trent 
Lott and Daschle said there had been no bipartisan accord on 
whether to permit testimony by witnesses. 

</P>
<P>
	Willey Case Witness Indicted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grand jury helping prosecutor Kenneth Starr  
investigate Kathleen Willey's allegation that President Clinton 
made an unwanted sexual advance toward her indicted one of her 
friends today. Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va., was charged 
with obstructing justice and lying when she cast doubt on Mrs. 
Willey's story. Ms. Steele is accused of filing a false affidavit 
in the Paula Jones litigation. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Triple After-School Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed tripling to  
$600 million the budget for after-school programs, seizing on an 
initiative popular both with working parents and with Republicans 
who hold the government's purse strings. The president, his wife, 
Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore unveiled the proposal -- the 
latest in a series of advance peeks at Clinton's Jan. 19 State of 
the Union address and fiscal 2000 budget -- in a White House 
ceremony. Clinton said 1 million children would benefit from his 
proposed expansion of after-school programs.

	Sierra Leone Rebels Go On Rampage  
</P>
<P>
	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Plumes of acrid black smoke  
billowed over eastern sections of Freetown today as rampaging 
insurgents set city neighborhoods ablaze. Machine-gun fire rattled 
in this West African capital, and witnesses said the insurgents 
raided homes to capture civilians for use as human shields. 
Describing the rebel attacks as ``carnage,'' President Ahmed Tejan 
Kabbah said he and his jailed rival, guerrilla leader Foday Sankoh, 
had agreed to a cease-fire. 

</P>
<P>
	Iraq Targets U.N. Land Mine Program  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq asked the United Nations to cut ties  
with international groups clearing land mines in northern Iraq, 
saying that ``spies and saboteurs'' were using the world body as a 
cover. Baghdad said non-governmental organizations working to clear 
an estimated 10 million land mines in Kurdish areas of northern 
Iraq were an ``illegitimate presence.'' It said they did not have 
government permission to do so.

	Study Backs Birth Control Pill  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Women suffer no lasting ill effects from taking  
birth control pills, according to the biggest study ever on the 
subject and one that some experts say finally can lay to rest fears 
that have lingered since the pill was introduced in 1961. Ten years 
after they stopped using the pill, women's chances of dying from 
cancer, stroke and other side effects were the same as those of

<HEADLINE> Profiles of Clinton Legal Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key members of President Clinton's legal team:  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLES F.C. RUFF -- White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff's  
legal career has included stints as Watergate prosecutor, associate 
attorney general and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. He 
arrived at the White House in January 1997 during the Whitewater, 
Paula Jones and campaign finance imbroglios; still to come were the 
investigations of the Monica Lewinsky affair and Chinese missile 
technology. Known for his political savvy, Ruff's clients have 
included Anita Hill, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., and former White 
House aide Ira Magaziner. Ruff uses a wheelchair as a result of 
polio. He is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Columbia Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GREG CRAIG -- As a new special counsel, Craig ventured into the  
spotlight as one of Clinton's defenders during the House Judiciary 
impeachment hearings. Craig coordinates the president's impeachment 
defense inside the White House and is the lead spokesman on the 
issue. Previously, he worked for the State Department as special 
coordinator overseeing U.S. policy toward Tibet. He also was an 
aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and helped represent John 
Hinckley Jr. after Hinckley attempted to assassinate President 
Reagan in 1981. Craig is a former law partner of Clinton attorney 
David Kendall. He is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DAVID KENDALL -- The president's personal attorney, Kendall faced  
off with Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr in his 
cross-examination during the House impeachment hearings. Kendall is 
the architect of Clinton's legal defense both for Starr's criminal 
investigation and the House impeachment inquiry. He negotiated the 
agreement for Clinton to testify by videotape before Starr's grand 
jury. He works for the Washington firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly. 
While at Yale Law School, Kendall became friends with Hillary 
Rodham. He went to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship two years ahead 
of the president. A Quaker who grew up in Indiana, Kendall is known 
for his reserve. He has another high-profile client: the National 
Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LANNY BREUER -- A White House lawyer who remains largely behind  
the scenes, Breuer has been a quiet but dedicated member of 
Clinton's damage-control team. Breuer worked for Manhattan District 
Attorney Robert Morgenthau and joined the law firm of Covington &AMP; 
Burling after his move to Washington. One of his most publicized 
cases was a successful lawsuit against the Clinton administration 
involving a gay Marine who broke Pentagon rules. Breuer began 
working at the White House in 1997 on the recommendation of Charles 
Ruff, who also worked at Covington &AMP; Burling. Breuer was forced to 
testify before the Kenneth Starr grand jury to certify that the 
Clinton administration had complied with subpoenas in the Starr 
investigation. He graduated from Columbia University and Columbia 
Law School.

<HEADLINE> NBA Governors Back Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved  
the lockout settlement today, clearing the way for the season to 
start in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-0 vote by the owners came a day after the players' union  
ratified the agreement to end the 6-month-old lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was not immediately announced by the NBA but it was  
confirmed by Richard Peddie of the Toronto Raptors' ownership 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors is made up of one representative from  
each of the 29 ownership groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will remain in effect until the agreement is put  
into written form, a process that could take up to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The most divisive labor battle in league history finally ended  
at dawn Wednesday on the 191st day of the lockout when NBA 
commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter 
compromised on the remaining issues keeping them apart and shook 
hands on a collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The season will begin no earlier than Feb. 2, with each team  
playing no more than 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can exhale now, without a doubt,'' said Alonzo Mourning of  
the Miami Heat. ``The deal is done and we can just focus our mind 
right now on starting back up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just 29 hours before the Board of  
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. It 
came during an all-night bargaining session at NBA headquarters 
between Stern and Hunter. Union president Patrick Ewing was not 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did we blink? I guess we both blinked,'' Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I will say that I am elated that we will be  
playing basketball this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. The players, for their part, came away with their 
dignity intact and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the deal was ratified by players in a 179-5 vote  
after being approved by both negotiating committees. It gives 
owners the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on 
individual salaries and will be in place for six years, with owners 
having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the season can begin, there will be a three-week frenzy  
of teams scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of 
the 200 free agents while running abbreviated training camps 
opening around Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis  
Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the games get started, players will be faced with an  
exhausting schedule until playoffs start in late April. Teams will 
be asked on occasion to play three games in three nights, something 
that hasn't happened in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to play back-to-back-to-back games, but  
that's something we have to do as athletes,'' Jimmy Jackson, a free 
agent who last played for Golden State, told The New York Times. 
``But if you love the game, you'll do whatever it takes to be ready 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal was ratified, Stern spoke to the almost 200  
players who had flown in to vote on the owners' latest proposal -- a 
vote that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us Billy was a tough guy, but a good guy, and how glad  
he was to get it over with and to start playing again,'' Aaron 
Williams of the Seattle SuperSonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the players' response was polite, but not  
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	The players did, however, give Hunter and Ewing a standing  
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of about $2 billion in  
annual revenue in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of the 
agreement, according to several sources involved in the talks who 
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option  
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit 
on the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agreement includes a ban on marijuana, with all  
players undergoing drug testing once per season, and tougher player 
discipline penalties and conduct rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed to form a joint committee of three owners  
and three players to discuss the growth of the league and improving 
the relations between players and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, but not quite as high as the union had been demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA pushed for one throughout the lockout. The 
union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax be charged to 
any owner who signed a player for more than $15 million. The league 
kept holding out, and eventually the players relented. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys can still make $14 million, and that's a lot of money,''  
said Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors. ``If you can't live off 
that, something's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide  
the estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout went into effect July 1, just 2 1/2 weeks after Jordan  
and the Bulls won their sixth championship in a riveting Game 6 
that put up the largest TV viewer numbers ever for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s and especially since Jordan arrived, the league  
has enjoyed unprecedented popularity here and abroad. On the labor 
front, Stern and the NBA lived a relatively charmed life, while 
baseball struggled through a strike that caused thousands of fans 
to turn away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the lockout that for the first time caused the NBA  
to miss games because of a labor dispute. The first three months of 
the season were scrapped and players lost about $500 million in 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the remainder  
of the 1998-99 season, although details were still unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is tell the fans,'' Mourning said, ``that I'm  
sorry about the inconvenience. I appreciate their patience, and I'm 
sorry about any of the bad impressions that they've gotten from 
this whole ordeal, but that's what business is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that going into this thing that we were gonna step on  
some peoples' toes and upset some people, but we had to do what's 
best for the guys in this league.''

<HEADLINE> Robitaille Scores 500th Career Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Luc Robitaille scored his 500th NHL  
career goal with 1:46 remaining in the Los Angeles Kings' 4-2 
victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille took a pass from Pavel Rosa and flipped the puck into  
the net to beat Buffalo goalie Dwayne Roloson, who was sprawled on 
his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Robitaille became the 27th player in NHL history and the sixth  
left wing to score 500 goals. He notched his 499th in the first 
period, giving the Kings the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 10,821 gave Robitaille a standing ovation. The game  
stopped momentarily as the rest of the Kings hugged their assistant 
captain. Robitaille is in his 13th NHL season and 10th with the 
Kings.

<HEADLINE> Winners, Losers in Autos in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a few exceptions, 1998 was a very good year  
for automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Only four of the 22 major automakers who operate in the United  
States sold fewer cars and light trucks last year than they did in 
1997, based on year-end figures released this week. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. -- the largest -- sustained a 3 percent drop.  
The main reason was the crippling strikes last summer, which all 
but halted GM's North American production for weeks. An added 
indignity: GM's market share fell to 29.2 percent, its lowest since 
at least the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling Nissan Motor Corp. suffered the biggest sales drop --  
14 percent -- but showed evidence of a possible rebound at year's 
end. In December it posted a 12 percent gain over December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The other losers were tiny Hyundai Motor Co. and Land Rover, an  
arm of BMW AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen AG had the biggest gain in the U.S. market, with a 59  
percent improvement over 1997 on the strength of a new product 
lineup headed by the popular New Beetle. Though well behind such 
big Japanese automakers as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., 
VW regained the title of No. 1 European automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at some of the other big hits and misses of 1998:  
</P>
<P>
	--Light trucks -- which include sport utility vehicles, pickups  
and minivans -- continued to grow in popularity and drive total 
sales to near 15.6 million units -- the second highest ever. Cars 
still represented 52 percent of the market, but that's down from 55 
percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sales of U.S.-built trucks were strong almost across the board.  
Some numbers: Lincoln Navigator, up 64 percent; Dodge Ram pickup, 
up 17 percent; GMC Yukon SUV, up 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sales of high-end SUVs boosted the totals for Ford Motor Co.'s  
Lincoln brand (the Navigator), DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes-Benz 
(M-class) and Toyota's Lexus (RX300). 
</P>
<P>
	--Honda sold more than 1 million cars and trucks in the United  
States for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	--DaimlerChrysler, not counting Mercedes-Benz, gained nearly 1  
point in market share in posting its best year ever. GM's decline 
amounted to nearly 2 points; Ford Motor Co.'s share was off a 
quarter-point. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some of GM's newer products made impressive gains: sales of its  
Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac minivans were up 26 percent; its 
seven new midsize sedans as a group outsold the nine models they 
replaced by 5 percent. GM's Saab unit posted its best sales year 
ever with two new sedans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some of the smallest cars were the biggest losers: sales of the  
Chevrolet Metro plummeted 49 percent; Saturn sales declined 8 
percent; the Mercury Tracer was down 24 percent; Dodge Neon fell 10 
percent; and Subaru's Impreza was off 26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--But not all small cars were losers: Americans bought 55,842 New  
Beetles, making it VW's second-best selling car in its first year, 
after the compact Jetta. Sales of Toyota's Corolla were up 14 
percent and Honda's segment-leading Civic improved 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mercedes-Benz sold more vehicles in the U.S. than ever before:  
170,245, led by the E-class sedan and the Alabama-built M-class 
SUV.

<HEADLINE> USDA Searching for Black Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major advertising campaign will kick off  
soon to locate black farmers who may be eligible to join a 
multimillion-dollar settlement with the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys announced late Tuesday that a settlement had been  
reached in the 1997 racial discrimination lawsuit, ending more than 
two years of sometimes-contentious negotiations. Black farmers sued 
because they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge gave preliminary approval to the deal, which  
covers black farmers from 1981 to 1996. Final approval is expected 
at a hearing on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	To let farmers know about the settlement, the advertising  
campaign will include commercials on Black Entertainment Television 
and CNN as well as newspaper ads in 18 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads are also being placed in TV Guide and Jet Magazine. An  
800-telephone number has been set up to take calls from farmers 
wanting to join the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA also plans to work with community organizations in getting  
the word out to black farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings are being scheduled in Mississippi, Alabama, South  
Carolina and Arkansas so that attorneys can meet with farmers and 
review their cases. A meeting in Albany, Ga., has been scheduled 
for Feb. 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expedited procedure is truly unique,'' said plaintiffs'  
attorney Phil Fraas, adding that it should take less than six to 
eight months to process cases. ``It is designed to give farmers 
speedy action on complaints that have languished at USDA for years 
-- or in some cases decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement has several tracks under which farmers who have  
documented their discrimination can get relief. The majority of 
farmers are expected to take a simpler provision that would give 
them tax-free payments of $50,000 each and forgive their government 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers with more documented evidence of their discrimination  
can opt to go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger 
damages. Farmers may also choose to opt out of the lawsuit and have 
their cases settled administratively within USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact cost of the settlement is unclear because it is not  
yet known how many farmers will join the class and which settlement 
options they will choose. It could surpass $300 million to $400 
million, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Alexander Pires said he expects a class of  
about 5,000 black farmers, 10 percent of the 50,000 black farmers 
in the country in the early 1980s. He says attorneys have located 
almost 2,000 black farmers. To help locate more, a major 
advertising campaign will kick off on television, in magazines and 
in hundreds of newspapers within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $450,000 advertising campaign is being paid for by the  
Agriculture Department under the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- The toll-free number for black farmers wishing  
to join the settlement is 1-800-646-2873.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As they have so often before, Asia's top three  
stock markets followed a surge on Wall Street by moving higher 
themselves today, even though no one knows for sure whether the 
region's economic crisis is bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore and Hong Kong, the key indexes soared more than 3.5  
percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei jumped 2.4 percent, but slipped as 
the day progressed, closing only a half a percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	These and many other Asian stock markets also had enjoyed a big  
rally on Wednesday, thanks in part to falling local interest rates 
and the successful launch of Europe's new euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the board, analysts and traders credited today's  
gains to the rally by the Dow Jones industrial average, which 
easily crossed the 9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the first time 
Wednesday. It rose 233.78 points, or 2.5 percent, to finish at 
9,544.97, surpassing its previous closing record high of 9,374.27 
on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also marked a continued turnaround from last fall. The  
Dow, which slid below 7,500 in early October, has now rallied more 
than 2,000 points, or nearly 28 percent, in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, the research  
manager of Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has pulled Singapore and the rest of the Asian markets  
along,'' said one trader in Southeast Asia's city-state who spoke, 
as market officials often do there, on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will continue is another question. Ever since the  
Asian financial crisis began in 1997, with wild fluctuations in 
currencies and stocks, the region's markets have often imitated 
good days on Wall Street, only to see their gains soon fade away, 
due to profit-taking and more bad economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 4.3  
percent, before closing the day up 52.91 points, or 3.6 percent, to 
1,1517.88. The recently modified index, which rose 5.7 percent on 
Wednesday, not only bypassed the closely watched 1,500 threshold, 
but also reached its highest closing level since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index also had a great day, rising  
459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, to 10,693.57, a seven-week high. In 
fact, the indicator has risen 9 percent since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the world's second largest economy, the Nikkei average  
of 225 selected issues rose 2.4 percent before lunch, but ended the 
day at 13,536.56, only 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Nikkei had enjoyed a 1.8 percent improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Japan's markets have been troubled by the yen's big  
gains against the dollar, which hurt giant exporters such as Sony 
Corp. Wall Street's record performance first benefited the Japanese 
electronics giant today, which saw its stock rise for the first 
time in six trading sessions. But by the end of the day, Sony 
shares slipped back into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of 1998, many Asian analysts predicted that the  
region's crisis was showing signs of ending, including falling 
interest rates, stabilizing currencies, and signs of recovery in 
some of the hardest-hit economies, such as Thailand and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But others have said it's too early to tell whether the crisis  
is winding down. Some say that fund managers who have been plowing 
cash back into Asian stock markets in the past few months are 
nervous and could easily set off another market stampede by 
withdrawing.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Markets Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As they have so often before, Asia's top three  
stock markets followed a surge on Wall Street by moving higher 
themselves today, even though no one knows for sure whether the 
region's economic crisis is bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore and Hong Kong, the key indexes soared more than 3.5  
percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei jumped 2.4 percent, but slipped as 
the day progressed, closing only a half a percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	These and many other Asian stock markets also had enjoyed a big  
rally on Wednesday, thanks in part to falling local interest rates 
and the successful launch of Europe's new euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the board, analysts and traders credited today's  
gains to the rally by the Dow Jones industrial average, which 
easily crossed the 9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the first time 
Wednesday. It rose 233.78 points, or 2.5 percent, to finish at 
9,544.97, surpassing its previous closing record high of 9,374.27 
on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also marked a continued turnaround from last fall. The  
Dow, which slid below 7,500 in early October, has now rallied more 
than 2,000 points, or nearly 28 percent, in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, the research  
manager of Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has pulled Singapore and the rest of the Asian markets  
along,'' said one trader in Southeast Asia's city-state who spoke, 
as market officials often do there, on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will continue is another question. Ever since the  
Asian financial crisis began in 1997, with wild fluctuations in 
currencies and stocks, the region's markets have often imitated 
good days on Wall Street, only to see their gains soon fade away, 
due to profit-taking and more bad economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 4.3  
percent, before closing the day up 52.91 points, or 3.6 percent, to 
1,1517.88. The recently modified index, which rose 5.7 percent on 
Wednesday, not only bypassed the closely watched 1,500 threshold, 
but also reached its highest closing level since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index also had a great day, rising  
459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, to 10,693.57, a seven-week high. In 
fact, the indicator has risen 9 percent since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the world's second largest economy, the Nikkei average  
of 225 selected issues rose 2.4 percent before lunch, but ended the 
day at 13,536.56, only 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Nikkei had enjoyed a 1.8 percent improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Japan's markets have been troubled by the yen's big  
gains against the dollar, which hurt giant exporters such as Sony 
Corp. Wall Street's record performance first benefited the Japanese 
electronics giant today, which saw its stock rise for the first 
time in six trading sessions. But by the end of the day, Sony 
shares slipped back into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of 1998, many Asian analysts predicted that the  
region's crisis was showing signs of ending, including falling 
interest rates, stabilizing currencies, and signs of recovery in 
some of the hardest-hit economies, such as Thailand and South 
Korea. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Targets U.N. Land Mine Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- After challenging U.N. weapons inspectors,  
oil-for-food monitors and ``no-fly'' zones, Iraq is targeting 
another international program -- the clearing of land mines in the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi newspapers said today that Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed  
al-Sahhaf has complained to the Security Council about U.N. 
cooperation with international groups clearing land mines from 
Kurdish areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the council, al-Sahhaf said the groups were an  
``illegitimate presence'' because they did not have permission from 
the government of Saddam Hussein to work. It charged that the 
activity was a cover for ``spies and saboteurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also compared the international mine-clearing effort  
to the no-fly zones. The United States and Britain set up the first 
zone in 1991 to protect Kurds in the north. A second one was 
established in 1992 to protect Shiite Muslims in the south after 
failed uprisings against Saddam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kurdish north is littered with what the United Nations  
estimates is at least 10 million land mines left from the 1980-88 
Iran-Iraq war and Iraqi government campaigns against the Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has been training Kurds to remove them, and  
non-governmental organizations also are working to help clear 
mines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such methods are part of the hostile conspiratorial scheme by  
the United States and Britain to threaten Iraq's security and 
territorial integrity,'' al-Sahhaf said in his letter, according to 
Al-Thawra, published by Saddam's ruling Baath Party. 
</P>
<P>
	George Somerwill of the U.N. humanitarian programs in Baghdad  
said its land mine operation was separate from that carried out by 
non-governmental organizations, and that only 10 of its 
international staff with the U.N. Office of Programs and Services 
were engaged in de-mining northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Sahhaf repeated Iraq's threat to attack American and British  
jets in the no-fly zones, saying: ``Iraq reserves its full right to 
retaliate against any action that may harm its national sovereignty 
or its territory and airspace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, a U.S. Air Force F-16 jet fired a missile at an  
Iraqi air-defense station in northern Iraq after the pilot 
determined he was about to be fired on, U.S. officials said. It was 
the fourth incident in the zones in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, U.S. Air Force and Navy jets fired on four Iraqi  
MiGs testing the ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq. The American 
jets apparently missed their targets but there was an unconfirmed 
report one Iraqi jet may have crashed after running out of fuel. 
Iraq denied it lost any jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in late December, the Americans fired air-to-surface  
missiles at Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries in the zones. 
</P>
<P>
	After the American and British airstrikes of Dec. 16-19, Iraq  
declared that it would no longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, it has told the United Nations to remove British  
and American nationals from the oil-for-food teams because their 
safety could not be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N.-approved oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell  
limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 
people. Some of the funds are used for the land mine training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Babil, which is published by Saddam's son Odai,  
charged today that the Americans were planning ``a new aggression'' 
against Iraq, possibly in connivance with Egypt and other 
pro-Western Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the last kick for the slaughtered bull if they  
attempt any other acts of aggression,'' Babil warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's editions of Iraqi dailies also carried front-page  
stories -- but not editorials -- on American news reports that U.N. 
weapons inspectors shared intelligence with the United States that 
aided U.S. plans to undermine Saddam's government. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials and chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard  
Butler denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports that U.N. weapons inspectors helped Washington  
eavesdrop on Iraqi military intelligence call into question the 
credibility of the inspection regime and its claims that Iraq still 
harbors weapons of mass destruction, Baghdad's U.N. ambassador 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	If true, the newspaper reports only strengthen Iraq's argument  
that sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 should be 
lifted, Nizar Hamdoon said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement Wednesday that  
he had no knowledge of the allegations in the reports. Both Annan 
and the weapons chief also brushed aside suggestions Butler resign. 
</P>
<P>
	But Butler, interviewed by The Sydney Morning Herald in his  
native Australia, said that while he has been ``very pleased'' to 
do the job, he is contemplating stepping down when his term ends 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always said I don't want to stay in this job forever,''  
he was quoted as saying in today's edition.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Hope To Shut Down Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Either the Arizona Cardinals are  
shellshocked after watching film of Minnesota's record-setting 
offense, or they know something the rest of the NFL doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's defense ranked just 21st in the NFL, but the Cardinals  
clawed their way into the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, defenders are quietly confident they can handle an  
offense that set an NFL scoring record (556 points) and tied San 
Francisco for most touchdown passes (41) this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy Moss makes a big difference,'' middle linebacker Ronald  
McKinnon said. ``He's the guy known around the league for making 
big plays and touchdowns, but then again we have outstanding 
defensive backs, and our key is just trying to contain them and get 
Randall Cunningham to do things he's not used to doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings (15-1) are in the playoffs for the sixth time in  
seven years, while the Cardinals (10-7), are in for the first time 
since 1982 and have never played in the second round. When they won 
the only playoff game in their history before last week, it was 
1947 and the entire postseason was one game for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Arizona can meet strength with strength when the Vikings  
deploy their three-receiver spread of Moss, Cris Carter and Jake 
Reed. The Cardinals have quality cornerbacks and excellent safeties 
in Tommy Bennett and Kwamie Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Aeneas Williams, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, might draw the  
assignment to cover the 6-foot-4 Moss, a Pro Bowl choice as a 
rookie who owns 28 Minnesota records. The most impressive is his 17 
TD catches, tying him with the number Carter put up three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis wasn't committing  
himself to any one choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have 11 players on the field, and every one of  
them playing like hell,'' McGinnis said of his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, who returned an interception 70 yards for a score  
against Philadelphia on Dec. 13, said Moss' newness in the league 
worked to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What defensive backs do is look for tendencies on receivers,  
and people really didn't have any tendencies on him,'' said 
Bennett, who believes the 5-11 Williams and 6-foot Corey Chavous 
have enough speed and leaping ability to counter Moss. ``We have 
some bigger corners, some more aggressive corners that can play 
guys like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-year veteran, Williams also has the edge on Moss in  
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether Moss would be the acid test for him,''  
said secondary coach Larry Marmie. ``Aeneas has played against a 
lot of great receivers over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams holds the franchise record for interception returns for  
a touchdown (six), but had only one interception this year because 
other teams usually avoid his side of the field. That tendency 
helped him break Michael Irvin's 117-game receiving streak on Nov. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cardinals beat the Cowboys 20-7 in the first round last  
week, Williams held Irvin to four catches for a 32 yards. Chavous, 
a rookie making only his sixth start, knocked down five passes and 
had an interception nullified by a questionable interference call. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Vanderbilt star said he wouldn't mind drawing the  
assignment on Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's me, or Tom Knight or Aeneas, that all remains to be  
seen, but whoever it is has to do a good job of maintaining 
technique, and our safeties have to play well, as they always do,'' 
Chavous said. ``We're very confident in our safeties.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Black Panther Makes Campaign Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- As a young man, David Hilliard plunged  
into the raw, radical politics of the Black Panthers. Now his 
activism is taking him in a more conventional direction: a run for 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to resurrect our dreams and return to a vision for  
progressive change,'' Hilliard said as he announced his candidacy 
Wednesday, backed by supporters that included Black Panther Party 
co-founder Bobby Seale -- his campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the steps of his old high school, an aging building  
surrounded by heavily barred houses, Hilliard said he would carry 
out the Panther goals of better schools and housing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen the dream deferred,'' he said. ``Our schools are  
failures. Much of the housing is in disrepair or unaffordable. The 
homeless are marginalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard is getting a head start on the race; the election isn't  
until November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland, a city of 396,000 with Jerry Brown as mayor, is 43  
percent black, 28 percent white, 14 percent Hispanic and 14 percent 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard, 56, said his campaign may be based on Black Panther  
ideals but isn't limited to blacks. The district he seeks to 
represent is racially mixed, covering middle-class neighborhoods 
near downtown as well as rundown west Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded in 1966 in  
Oakland by Seale and Huey Newton. Its membership reached 5,000 as 
it spread to other cities. Hilliard was the party's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The group called for an end to police brutality and tried to  
document excesses by authorities. Members had deadly shootouts with 
police, but the group also ran breakfast programs for 
schoolchildren and pushed for better housing and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard has worked as a union representative and helped create  
the Huey P. Newton Foundation in Oakland, which preserves the 
group's history and promotes its philosophy. He now works with the 
foundation and teaches the history of the Black Panthers at the New 
College in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilliard said he won't be endorsing all the Black Panther credo,  
including the practice of carrying firearms, which he said was 
particular to the civil unrest of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put our arms down when America put their arms down,'' he  
said. ``Ours was a defensive posture. When America grew up, so did 
the Panthers.''

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were mixed and soybean  
futures prices lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of 
Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures drifted lower in reaction to lower-than-expected  
weekly export sales figures. The U.S. Agriculture Department 
reports export sales for soybeans were slightly more than 216,000 
metric tons. That is at the lower end of the 200,000 to 500,000 
metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices retreated as the market consolidated  
yesterday's big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were higher on news wheat exports totaled 327,000  
metric tons, higher than the 250,000 metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery was 1 cent higher at $2.88 1/2 a bushel;  
March corn was 3/4 cent lower at $2.23 a bushel; March oats were a 1/4

<HEADLINE> Bankers Challenge Credit Union Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's bankers, who suffered defeat in  
Congress in their fight with credit unions, are taking a federal 
agency to court to challenge a new rule allowing more people to 
join the lending associations. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association, the industry's biggest trade  
group, said Thursday it would file suit in U.S. District Court in 
Washington asking for an injunction barring the National Credit 
Union Administration from putting the new rule into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent federal agency ``clearly thumbed its nose at  
Congress when it adopted this rule,'' Harley Bergmeyer, chairman of 
the ABA's credit union advisory group, said in a statement. 
``There's no doubt in our minds that the rule violates both the 
letter and intent of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time the bankers' group has gone to court over  
the issue. The first legal action led to a 1998 Supreme Court 
ruling favoring the banks over the credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, adopted by the agency on Dec. 17, codifies a bill  
enacted last summer in a stinging defeat for the banking industry. 
The legislation overrode the Supreme Court ruling by allowing 
federally chartered credit unions to continue to include more than 
one occupational group in their memberships -- as long as each group 
doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NCUA Chairman Norman D'Amours called the bankers' lawsuit  
``nothing new and no surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe they would have filed suit regardless of how our  
final regulation looked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group noted that in the Dec. 17 vote, D'Amours  
himself voted against the rule, saying he feared it would hurt 
smaller credit unions. The other two board members, Yolanda Wheat 
and Dennis Dollar, voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement Thursday, D'Amours acknowledged that he opposed  
some provisions of the rule, adding that he considered them to be 
bad policy but not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit union industry has said the new rule will allow  
millions of people -- including employees of small businesses -- to 
join lower-cost credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosemary George, a spokeswoman for the National Association of  
Federal Credit Unions, a trade group, called the bankers' new 
lawsuit ``an excellent example of abuse of the litigation system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obviously intended to disrupt the orderly process which  
began'' when the rule took effect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group maintains that the rule went beyond the  
bill's intent by promoting big, expansive credit unions with 
multiple membership groups at the expense of small, local ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions compete with banks -- especially small community  
banks -- by often providing lower-cost loans and other services at 
more favorable rates for their members. They contend they are the 
best source of help for people of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has bitterly protested credit unions'  
exemption from federal taxes, which was retained by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Company Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Chemical testing company Saybolt Inc. was ordered  
to pay $3.4 million in fines after pleading guilty Thursday to 
conspiring to violate the Clean Air Act by submitting false test 
results to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, federal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saybolt is part of a multinational group of companies that  
conducts testing of petroleum, gasoline and other petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said that Saybolt engaged in a  
2-year-long conspiracy to submit false statements of lab tests 
mandated by the Clean Air Act. The tests were conducted at the 
company's facilities in Woburn, Kenilworth, N.J., and New Haven, 
Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said Saybolt inflated the oxygen content of certain types  
of gasoline in reports submitted to the EPA in order to attract and 
keep customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying the fines, Saybolt must create a testing  
compliance program subject to EPA review. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the plea agreement, Saybolt must purchase  
advertisements in industry magazines detailing the data 
falsification charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Saybolt officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices fell Thursday as the dollar  
lost ground against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/16  
point, or $9.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.22 percent from 5.16 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds prices fell with the U.S. dollar, which diminished the  
appeal of dollar-dominated investments for foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up between 3/32 and 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up 7/32 to 13/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.69 
points to 1316.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.41 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 point to 4.32 percent from late Wednesday. 
Six-month yields were 4.48 percent, as the discount fell 0.05 point 
to 4.33 percent. One-year yields were 4.49 percent as the discount 
fell 0.03 point from late Wednesday to 4.29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.25 percent from 3.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively

<HEADLINE>  Senate Launches Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn prelude to the first presidential  
impeachment trial in 130 years, House prosecutors delivered to the 
Senate today the articles of impeachment accusing President Clinton 
of perjury and obstruction of justice. The White House declared 
there wasn't ``a compelling case'' for ousting Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the 13  
Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial walked silently 
across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast the scene 
live to the nation -- to deliver the papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators will be in order,'' 96-year-old Strom Thurmond, the  
Senate president pro tempore, hollered as he called the session to 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms, James W. Ziglar, escorted the House  
members to the well of the Senate. ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all 
persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment,'' he 
declared, reading a proclamation written by the Founding Fathers 
more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed and impeded the  
administration of justice,'' the silver-haired Hyde intoned as he 
read from the articles to a stilled Senate chamber. Hyde's 
prosecution team stood at attention in a semi-circle to his right. 
The senators sat silently, a few taking notes. About three-quarters 
of the seats in the galleries were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his  
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	When he had finished, Hyde said, ``That concludes the exposition  
of the articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton. 
The managers request that the Senate take order for the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three senators from each party were to leave later in the day  
and escort Chief Justice William Rehnquist from the Supreme Court 
to preside over the trial. Rehnquist was to be given an oath and 
then administer another oath to the 100 senators who will serve as 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of public view, but the White House made  
one last bid at trying to cut short the trial by offering to 
stipulate to ``the five volumes, 7,000 or so pages'' of grand jury 
testimony and other evidence that prosecutor Kenneth Starr sent to 
the House last fall so that witnesses would not have to be called, 
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said that ``we don't believe everything that was said  
is an accurate portrayal of events'' but that the president's 
lawyers wouldn't challenge using that record as the trial evidence. 
The White House made the offer in a late-night bargaining session 
with senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House prosecutor made clear their intention to call  
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, at a trial that could extend 
three weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said, ``If they insist on bringing witnesses it will  
significantly extend and delay this process and all bets are off. 
... We don't believe that they've made a compelling case that the 
president be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the public sessions, the House managers were negotiating  
for the right to summon a number of witnesses, including 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican senator welcomed the White House offer to  
stipulate evidence.''That would be very helpful. Stipulating to 
facts will help that process, and then if there were the need for 
witnesses, it could be on a very narrow focus on a very narrow 
subject and perhaps not at all,'' said Kay Bailey Hutchison of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Capitol, a long line of tourists formed, hoping to  
get a glimpse of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters  
Wednesday that if agreement could be reached to call witnesses, he 
would want the White House and the House to justify the need for 
each person summoned. The Senate also would have to approve each 
witness by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism that agreement was near on a procedure  
for a ``full trial .... and votes on articles of impeachment at the 
end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said it would likely be February at the earliest before 
votes were taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with Hyde,  
R-Ill., and three other lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers 
unexpectedly summoned four members of the White House legal team to 
the Capitol to discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial question was whether to allow witnesses, as demanded  
by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate would have to 
approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of the House prosecutors, said  
``five to 10 witnesses puts on a case. I suspect we will want 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others on the prosecution team said the House might try  
to summon women who have provided statements in the Paula Jones 
case ``to the degree they go to obstruction of justice and 
perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky must be called ``because she is right in the middle  
of this,'' Cannon said. Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney and 
longtime Clinton friend, ``is a player'' and should be summoned, 
Cannon said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NBA Spokesman Makes New Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Everyone wants to know what the new NBA schedule  
is going to look like. They'll have to wait until Matt Winick is 
ready to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
	Winick, a 58-year-old former public relations director for the  
NBA, is the vice president of scheduling and game operations who 
has been given the Herculean task of assembling the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is aiming to start the season Feb. 5, with every team  
playing 50 games -- including a handful of nonconference games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Matt Winick is going to be very busy over the next several  
days,'' NBA vice president Rod Thorn said. ``We'll do everything we 
can to make it as fair as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn said the schedule won't be ready until next week. Each  
team can expect to play the vast majority of its games against 
opponents from its own conference. 
</P>
<P>
	With 50 games crammed into 12 1/2 weeks, the wear-and-tear factor  
will be significant. Teams will sometimes play on three consecutive 
nights, a back-to-back-to-back grind that NBA players haven't had 
to endure in more than a decade, but never on four consecutive 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn said teams might play eight games against teams from the  
other conference, four at home and four on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have 15 teams in the East, and in the West you've got 14,  
so teams in the East may play teams in the West fewer times than 
teams in the West will play teams in the East,'' he said. ``With 
the top teams, there may be some interconference games that are TV 
games that are going to be against a real good opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could expect to see a New York-Los Angeles game, for  
instance, in one place or the other,'' Thorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn also said several referees who resigned after being  
indicted for tax evasion may get their jobs back. Among those 
referees are Mike Mathis, Joey Crawford, Steve Javie and Blaine 
Reichelt 
</P>
<P>
	``The commissioner has stated many times that it is not a death  
sentence,'' Thorn said. ``He'll look at it.''

<HEADLINE> Writer Clarke Sets Us Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Have you been worrying whether the  
millennium starts a year from now or two years from now? Let 
science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke set your mind at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the 21st century and the third millennium do not begin  
until Jan. 1, 2001. Although celebrations are planned around the 
world for Jan. 1, 2000, he doesn't want to discourage the revels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good excuse to make the whole of 2000 one long  
party,'' the British-born Clarke said Thursday from his home on 
this Indian Ocean island where he has lived since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though some people have great difficulty in grasping this,  
there is a very simple analogy which would appeal to everyone,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the scale of your grocer's weighing machine began at 1  
instead of 0, would you be happy when he claims he had sold you 10 
kilograms of tea? And it is exactly the same with time. We will 
have had only 99 years of this century by Jan. 1, 2000. We will 
have to wait until Dec. 31, 2000 for the full hundred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His best-known book may provide a key to his insistence that  
2001 is the big year -- it is ``2001: A Space Odyssey.''

<HEADLINE> China Facing Stock Market Blues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- For years, China's stock markets have  
exemplified the warning ``buyer beware.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The volatile markets have made some rich, but protection for  
investors is limited and enforcement haphazard. Complaints of 
insider trading and abuses by brokers are common. 
</P>
<P>
	Now China is trying to impose order. Last week, it replaced a  
patchwork of rules with its first comprehensive securities law, 
eight years after China's first communist-era stock exchange opened 
in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	China will pay a price to build confidence in its financial  
markets. The law, which takes effect July 1, already has begun to 
drive money out of its two slumping stock exchanges just when they 
need it most. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short term, there will be an impact on investors and  
the amount of money in the market,'' said Song Changyang, a 
researcher for Huaxia Securities Inc. in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders, satisfied with rising stock and real estate  
prices, for years put off cleaning up the exchanges in Shanghai and 
the southern city of Shenzhen. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators answered not to Beijing but to local governments of  
the two cities. Securities firms set many of their own standards 
through an industry association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system was a mess,'' said economist Yang Chengzhang of  
Shenyin Securities Ltd. in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders were spurred to action only after the Asian  
economic crisis and a string of scandals in China itself showed 
what disaster might occur if they let the industry spin out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Near-riots erupted in Shenzhen, Beijing and other cities last  
year after the failure of several brokerages. In addition, trading 
losses are believed to have contributed to the demise in October of 
a major state-owned investment trust, which shook the Chinese 
financial world when it defaulted on $2 billion in foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	To enforce the new law, the authority of the China Securities  
Regulatory Commission is expanding greatly, creating the first 
nationwide watchdog with powers like those of the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main principle of this law is to protect medium and small  
investors, and to ensure open and fair trading,'' Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, the prospect of tighter rules is pushing down stock  
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Defying regional turmoil, Chinese stock prices remained high  
through mid-1998, shielded by rules that ban foreigners from most 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Chinese economy now slowing, stock prices have fallen  
steadily since June. The Shanghai market is down 21 percent, while 
Shenzhen is off 31 percent. The total value of Chinese stocks has 
dropped 13 percent to $229 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline gathered speed in recent weeks as banks, state  
companies and stockbrokers sold off holdings in anticipation of the 
new law. Banks and state companies are to be banned from playing 
the market, while brokers can no longer use clients' money for 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	All were major sources of investment. Without them, brokers  
fear, the markets could be in the doldrums for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Song and others in the industry say that price is  
worth paying to create well-regulated markets that might attract 
some of the $600 billion in savings individual Chinese keep in 
banks for lack of safe investment alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators also hope that by discouraging speculation, they will  
stabilize markets whose main indexes routinely fluctuate by up to 8 
percent a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulations won't affect other factors behind the  
markets' volatility: the scarcity of companies traded -- fewer than 
500 each in Shanghai and Shenzhen -- and the lack of foreign money, 
which keeps the pool of investors small. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, it is unclear whether enough investors can be attracted  
to replace the banks and state companies. China is creating mutual 
funds, but so far has only 22, with total assets of just $2.2 
billion. Pension funds aren't allowed to trade stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Barriers to foreign investment could end, ``but not in the short  
term, because the current goal of Chinese leaders is to prevent 
financial risk,'' Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Words Overshadow Dolphins-Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Perhaps even 75,000 fans cheering in full throat  
at Mile High Stadium couldn't drown out the war of words being 
waged by the Miami Dolphins and Denver Broncos in advance of their 
AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game matches the only two quarterbacks in NFL history  
with 50,000 yards passing, Dan Marino and John Elway. It also pairs 
the active coaches with the highest playoff winning percentage, 
Jimmy Johnson (8-2, .800) and Mike Shanahan (4-1, .800). 
</P>
<P>
	Rising above those intriguing matchups and threatening to  
overwhelm them, however, is a cacophony of taunting and teasing. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe, as he is wont to do, appears  
to have ignited the verbal fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the preseason, Sharpe took an unprovoked shot at Marino.  
The Hall of Fame-bound quarterback responded. Sharpe followed with 
a putdown of the Dolphins just after Denver bowed to them 31-21 in 
a regular season game last month. That, in turn, triggered retorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Comparing Marino and Elway, Sharpe said last summer, ``John has  
put the Elway mystique at such a high level, and he doesn't want it 
to slip. He doesn't want to be like another quarterback I won't 
name, but he's a guy who plays in the southern part of the United 
States who is no longer the player that he was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino responded in September: ``I don't really care what  
Shannon, Sterling, what's his name, Stanley Sharpe? I don't care 
what he thinks. I believe in what I do. I will say this. He should 
give John Elway credit. Elway is the main reason he's successful in 
the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 21, after that Monday night loss in Miami, Sharpe had  
barely stripped off his uniform when he launched another salvo. 
``We are 10 to 14 points better than that football team,'' he said 
unflinchingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the Dolphins' coach, was able to keep his good humor  
this week when the odds favoring the Broncos rose from 11 1/2 to 13 1/2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of touchdowns and building,'' Johnson said.  
``Evidently the oddsmakers are listening to Shannon Sharpe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Sharpe's quote angered him, Johnson said, ``Oh, not  
really. Not when you're the defending Super Bowl champs. The New 
York Yankees probably said they're better than other teams, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Sharpe took the occasion to elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they're looking for me, I ain't hard to find,'' he said.  
``If they're looking for something to say, I'm going to give them 
something to say. I said what I said, and I'm not going to back 
down from any of my comments. If they need stuff to get them 
motivated, so be it. We come out to play hard and play physical. We 
don't put stuff on the bulletin board, but you best believe, we'll 
be ready Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharpe said the Miami defense ``did a great job'' of smothering  
Broncos receivers and stopping Terrell Davis in the first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give them credit, the utmost credit, and I am very niggardly  
with my compliments,'' he said. ``They stopped us. They won the 
ballgame. And now we get an opportunity on Saturday to see if it 
was for real or if it was a hoax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Dolphins didn't take kindly to those remarks.  
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we're a much better team than them,'' cornerback Sam  
Madison said. ``They came down here and we beat them. They were 
favored then. They're favored now. The only thing that's happened 
is we're going up there (to Denver) to play them again, same 
scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Dolphns linebacker Derrick Rodgers: ``I guess some people  
think they have something to prove. `Last time was a fluke.' All 
that's just talk. Some people talk to get themselves going. If 
that's his game, fine. We'll see who's talking at the end of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino and the Dolphins had reason to boast after the game in  
December. He threw for 355 yards and four touchdowns to help the 
Dolphins clinch a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos were left with a ``meaningless game'' excuse, since  
they had already clinched a first-round bye and home-field 
advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (11-6) comes into Saturday's game with questions about its  
ability to run the ball and to win on the road; the Dolphins are 
0-6 in their last six road playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver (14-2) has some defensive concerns -- its pass defense  
ranked 26th in the NFL this season -- and the Broncos haven't 
recaptured the offensive swagger that enabled them to obliterate 
most opponents early in the season.

<HEADLINE> Study: Fidgeting Helps Avoid Fat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some people seem to be able to fidget away  
fat, according to a Mayo Clinic study aimed at finding out why some 
stay slim when overeating, while others gain weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published today in the journal Science, involved 16  
volunteers fed 1,000 extra calories a day for eight weeks as 
instruments measured their energy use. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, some of the subjects gained as much as 16 pounds,  
others as little as two. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, says Dr. Michael D. Jensen of the Mayo Clinic in  
Rochester, Minn., was the ``fidget factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is some sort of physical activity that they (the low  
weight-gainers) are doing more throughout the day than the 
others,'' he said. ``It could be fidgeting or moving around or just 
being a little more restless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was designed to investigate why some people seem to  
relentlessly gain weight, while others, eating roughly the same 
diet, seem to stay slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen and his colleagues picked subjects for the study who had  
sedentary jobs, such as office work, and who did not engage in 
regular physical workouts. They were outfitted with accelerometers 
-- instruments that measure movements -- to determine how much energy 
they expended. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, there were special blood chemistry tests to  
measure energy expenditure that was so slight it could not be 
picked up by the accelerometers. 
</P>
<P>
	The result showed that it was not the gross movements, such as  
walking or climbing stairs, that made the difference. It was the 
small, fidgeting-like movements that separated the fast gainers 
from those who stayed slim. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who were burning a lot of extra calories were doing  
it in the activities of daily life,'' said Jensen. This could be 
fidgeting, standing up often, stretching and just the effort to 
maintain a good posture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher said that each muscle movement burns calories and  
uses some of the excess energy that might otherwise be stored as 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The take-home message is that every little motion counts,''  
Jensen said. ``Clearly the people who are doing little activities 
during the day are not gaining weight even though they were eating 
more. So it looks like the more you do, even in small activities, 
the more it counts in controlling weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies have shown that people metabolize food -- or  
break it down into chemicals used to power muscles and other bodily 
functions -- at different rates. Jensen said his study did not 
address whether that might be responsible for the differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The study used four women and 12 men, all between the ages of 20  
and 35. Jensen said the women tended to gain weight more readily 
than did the men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fidgetiness of an individual likely plays a more important  
role in daily energy expenditure than previously thought,'' Eric 
Ravussin of Eli Lilly and Co., and Elliot Danforth Jr. of the 
University of Vermont said in an analysis of the study in Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``This carefully conducted study provides an interesting  
explanation for the differences in gain of body fat in response to 
overeating,'' Ravussin and Danforth said. The fidgeting mechanism, 
they noted, ``could explain why some of us escaped gaining weight, 
whereas others did not, after overindulging during the past holiday 
season. ''

<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The end of the NBA lockout not only made Boston  
Celtics fans happy, it also elated shareholders of the only 
publicly owned team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Celtics Limited Partnership stock jumped 39 percent  
Wednesday after the news that there would be a season after all, 
after the contract agreement. The stock closed at $14.63, up $4.13.

	The Celtics LP has not released earnings for the December  
quarter, but the Boston Herald said the corporation is expected to 
post a loss. Richard Pond, Celtics chief financial officer, told 
the newspaper that lost revenue would be offset by lower salaries. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Team Has 21-Year Winning Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- The junior varsity wrestling team at  
Mater Dei High School in Evansville is trying to extend its winning 
streak to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 21 years, not 21 games.  
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats haven't lost a match since the arrival of coach  
Randy Helfrich in 1978. His team is 19-0 this season, increasing 
the school's national record for consecutive JV victories to 333 -- 
and counting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The streak is 21 years,'' the 43-year-old Helfrich said.  
``It's 1978 to present, and that's how long I've been here as 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and other Mater Dei officials discovered several years ago,  
while browsing through a national wrestling publication, that the 
team was nearing the previous record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking through the JV records and saw the record for  
consecutive wins was 222 when we were around 200,'' Helfrich said. 
``It was like, `Hmmm, we could do that,' so we started counting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't had to stop counting yet, though there have been a  
few close calls. Once, in 1996, the Wildcats had to come from 
behind to defeat Evansville Reitz High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us at 112 (pounds), 119 and 125 and we still trailed  
after 145,'' the coach recalled. ``But we came back and finished 
strong and won 39-29. I think that's as close as anyone's come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helfrich, who joined the faculty of Mater Dei last year, teaches  
economics and accounting at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	He also serves as an assistant under longtime varsity head coach  
Mike Goebel and leads that team's practices. Mater Dei, a perennial 
wrestling powerhouse, has won five state titles since Helfrich's 
arrival, including the last four. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel said Helfrich has been an essential part of the team's  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know one guy carries the title (of head coach), but I  
consider it a co-coaching situation,'' said Goebel, who is also 
head coach of the school's football team. ``Randy's the one 
responsible for our technique, and he's such a great 
communicator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Goebel ever retires from the wrestling program, there's a  
standing offer for Helfrich to take over. But Helfrich said he's 
content with his current situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike asks me about it all the time,'' he said, laughing. ``But  
I've never really had a burning desire to be a head coach.''

<HEADLINE> Jags Won't be Intimidated by Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The home-field advantage in New York in  
January could mean anything from bitter cold, high winds and snow 
to weather that won't be much of an edge at all for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
	Such as calm sunshine and temperatures above freezing.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Parcells doesn't have much of an idea what the weather will  
be like for Sunday's AFC playoff game with Jacksonville. He has a 
personal weatherman he'll call on Saturday, but even that doesn't 
guarantee anything. 
</P>
<P>
	There is something the Jets coach will guarantee, however: The  
elements, unless they are outrageous, won't bother the Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have been in some tough playoff games and won some on the  
road in past years,'' Parcells said Thursday. ``They went to 
Buffalo and won and Denver and won (in 1996). A lot of those 
players they have were playing then and that should serve them 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jets linebacker Bryan Cox totally dismisses the weather as a  
factor -- although that ignores the tricky winds that can blow at 
the Meadowlands, playing havoc with passing and kicking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is making like they are coming from this hot place  
into the cold weather and they can't deal with it,'' said Cox, who 
spent the early part of his career with the Dolphins. ``Hey, it was 
in the 20s there the other morning. That's up in the north part of 
Florida, not down in Miami. Man, it can get cold up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Cox shivered for emphasis, he added, ``They won't be shaking  
about coming up here. If it was 80 degrees down there, they might. 
But it's not like that. They'll come ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars shouldn't be bothered by playing on the road. Of  
their five postseason games, four have been away from Alltel 
Stadium, and all of them were in cold-weather sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is, they've got to play in it, too,''  
said Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith. ``They may be a little more used 
to it. They practice in it all week. But it's cold here, too, this 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells admitted getting to practice in true winter weather is  
a benefit for the Jets, who won the AFC East by taking their final 
six games to finish 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always heard a lot about teams built for a dome or this  
or that, or this is a better grass player than turf player,'' he 
said. ``I have never been able to discern that myself. You 
acclimate more to your environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't simulate the wind or the cold we might have, and we  
do get to practice in it. But it's important for the players to 
understand, particularly the quarterback, how the coaching staff 
intends to play the game, and I can't say what that is until I see 
what kind of day it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to orient the team to what we might do, particularly  
the quarterback. What will we do if there is no wind, and a warm 
and ideal field? 
</P>
<P>
	``If the wind is blowing in one direction, what do we do into  
the wind and with it at our back? If the cold is prohibitive on 
some things, how will we try to move and generate offense if we 
couldn't do the entire scope effectively?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Coughlin, Parcells' coaching counterpart, has worked in New  
York, Green Bay and New England. He recognizes the effects weather 
can have, but he doesn't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a factor, as it always is,'' he said. ``Just as much  
as the turf and the wet turf and the fact that we're in the shade 
and they're in the sun. You know the whole deal and I've explained 
it all to our players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox doesn't need any explanations.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter if it's zero degrees or 80,'' he said. ``If  
you don't execute, you don't win.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt Moves To Natural Gas Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Guiding his 1978 Peugeot taxi through puffs  
of black smoke coughed out by traffic all around him, Mahmoud 
Ibrahim is in the vanguard of Egypt's latest battle against 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the hood of his dusty jalopy purrs an engine converted  
from gasoline usage to run on natural gas. Its benefits are 
thankfully invisible: It emits virtually no carbon monoxide and 
very little of the other noxious fumes that gasoline-fueled cars 
spew. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 11,000 people in Cairo, almost all taxi drivers, have  
converted their engines to work with inexpensive natural gas since 
January 1996 under a government-sponsored project. 
</P>
<P>
	The company installing the $1,500 conversion kits says demand is  
so high that hundreds of cars are on a waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	The lure is high savings rather than environmental concern.  
Natural gas is half the price of gasoline, which sells for 1 
Egyptian pound a liter, about $1 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts are hailing Egypt's experience as a valuable  
lesson for fighting air pollution cheaply and safely in smoggy 
megacities around the world, from New Delhi to Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an exciting opportunity,'' Jeff Seisler, president of  
the International Association for Natural Gas Vehicles, said in a 
telephone interview from his office in the Netherlands. ``The 
Egyptian program is very impressive ... it has taken off so 
rapidly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This success is even causing problems for the program. Because  
so many vehicles have been converted to natural gas, drivers 
complain about long waits at the only 14 fueling stations in Cairo 
-- which could discourage others from making the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Seisler sympathizes with the authorities as well as customers.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chicken and egg situation: Which should come first,  
customers or fueling stations? To get that balance is crucial and 
takes time,'' Seisler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas was a natural solution for Egypt.  
</P>
<P>
	Its known gas reserves -- 36 trillion cubic feet -- can last at  
least 20 years. And the country's leaders are firmly behind gas, 
which is the cleanest burning hydrocarbon fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibrahim, the taxi driver, said he was persuaded by a friend to  
convert about a year ago. ``I am very happy. And proud that I am 
saving the air,'' he said at a fueling station, which looks similar 
to gasoline stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cairo's air exceeds the World Health Organization's acceptable  
limits for most pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
	The suffocating cocktail of gases emitted by the city's 1.2  
million vehicles -- two-thirds of them aging and badly maintained -- 
is the second biggest pollutant after emissions from some 800 
factories around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dust from the surrounding desert adds to the woes of the city's  
15 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial use of compressed natural gas started in 1996,  
when Egypt also banned leaded gasoline. The Natural Gas Vehicles 
Co., a joint venture of the government and the U.S. oil company 
Amoco, which recently was acquired by British Petroleum to become 
BP Amoco, operates fueling stations and converts engines so they 
can run either on natural gas or gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Chapel, managing director of the company, compares Egypt's  
success with a program he managed in Atlanta, where a busy natural 
gas fueling station would handle 10-15 cars a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Egypt many of our stations are fueling over 1,000 vehicles  
a day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the program's first year, Egypt was 37th among the 43  
countries using natural gas vehicles. Today, Egypt stands at No. 8 
among 47. Argentina is at the top, with more than 400,000 gas 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Issam Nabil el-Nawari, a taxi driver, dragged a reporter to the  
back of his Hyundai cab to show how clean natural gas burns. He 
held a white handkerchief to the exhaust pipe for 30 seconds. The 
cloth remained pristine. 
</P>
<P>
	When held up to a gasoline taxi's exhaust, it was quickly  
stained with soot. El-Nawari made a face and tossed the cloth away. 
</P>
<P>
	But el-Nawari is upset he sometimes has to wait up to two hours  
at fueling stations, joining a line that runs 100-long into the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Nawari, who bought his taxi last year, said he loses about  
$15 in fares during his twice-a-day fuel stops, limiting his daily 
earnings to about $30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy for my country, yes. But I need happiness for my  
family ... my three boys,'' el-Nawari said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some facts on natural gas as fuel for vehicles:  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	COMPARISON: Cleanest burning fossil fuel. Less expensive than  
gasoline; mileage about same. Slightly more efficient than gasoline 
at low speeds, slightly less at high speeds. Extends life of spark 
plugs and intervals between tuneups and oil changes. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SAFETY: Lighter than air, non-toxic, non-corrosive. If spilled,  
it rises and dissipates into atmosphere, minimizing the potential 
for explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FILLING STATIONS: Compressed natural gas stations connected to  
remote gas fields through pipelines, ensuring continuous supply. 
Dispensers, similar to gasoline pumps, fill vehicle tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FUEL TANK: Reinforced steel cylinder fixed in car trunk or to  
the undercarriage of trucks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	VEHICLE CONVERSION: Takes about four hours. Does not require  
removal of original equipment. Vehicles can still run on gasoline 
when dashboard switch is flipped, shutting off natural gas supply. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	USERS: 47 countries have natural gas vehicles. Top users:  
Argentina (401,000), Italy (290,000), Russia (205,000), United 
States (60,000), New Zealand (25,000), Canada (17,220), Brazil 
(14,000), Egypt (11,000).

<HEADLINE> Willey Case Witness Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grand jury investigating Kathleen Willey's  
allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton 
indicted one of her friends Thursday on charges of obstructing 
justice and lying when she cast doubt on Mrs. Willey's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hiatt Steele of Richmond, Va., was charged with three  
counts of obstruction of justice and one count of false statements 
in an indictment brought by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. 
Among other things, the indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing a 
false affidavit in the Paula Jones litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers had used Ms. Steele's testimony in an  
effort to cast doubt on the credibility of Mrs. Willey, a former 
White House volunteer who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual 
advance toward her in the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies the accusation.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit alleging that  
Mrs. Willey never told her about the alleged advance as she had 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr alleged that the affidavit and Ms. Steele's subsequent  
testimony before two federal grand juries were false. Ms. Steele 
was told about the advance by Mrs. Willey and repeated the 
information to her friends, Starr charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also contend that Ms. Steele lied to FBI agents  
working for Starr and ``attempted in the Eastern District of 
Virginia to influence the testimony of one or more witnesses in the 
grand jury investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each obstruction charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in  
prison and $250,000 in fines. The false statement charge carries a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele came to public attention when she was quoted in a  
Newsweek article a few years back that first brought Mrs. Willey's 
allegation to light. Ms. Steele contended she lied to the Newsweek 
reporter at Mrs. Willey's request, and told the reporter that Mrs. 
Willey had confided to her about the alleged episode with Clinton. 
She later told the reporter she had lied. The magazine noted the 
allegation and the switch in the same story. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele sued Newsweek in federal court for breach of  
contract, saying reporter Michael Isikoff had promised not to print 
her name and then did so. The lawsuit sought unspecified 
compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit is still pending.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Could Affect Olympic Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Track and field could take radical steps --  
including restricting Olympic competition to athletes 23 and under 
-- if soccer's World Cup is held every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Amateur Athletic Federation said Thursday it  
would protect its world championships to counter any scheduling 
conflict with soccer's championship or the Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IAAF could change the year so as not to clash with the  
World Cup,'' spokesman Giorgio Reineri said. ``If there is a clash 
with other great events, we will protect our own championships. 
Only in our event should all the best athletes be present. We need 
to have exclusivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that could mean moving the track meets from odd to even  
years, thus setting up a clash with the Summer Olympics, where 
track and field is considered the marquee sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``Naturally, the IAAF will study the best way in order to assure  
the exclusivity of the best athletes for its world championships,'' 
Reineri said in a telephone interview from IAAF headquarters in 
Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri wouldn't rule out suggestions that the IAAF could put a  
23-and-under age limit on Olympic events, just as FIFA does for the 
Olympic soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, soccer's world body, has  
proposed staging the World Cup every two years instead of four. He 
said the World Cup never would be held the same year as the Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee sports director Gilbert Felli  
said it was premature to speculate on what affect it Blatter's 
proposal and the IAAF's possible reaction would have on Olympic 
track. He said there had been no discussions with the IAAF on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF president Primo Nebiolo has in the past raised the  
possibility of restricting Olympic track to young athletes. But the 
threat never materialized as a serious option, and IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch has largely succeeded in placating Nebiolo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a concession to Samaranch, Blatter promised Wednesday that  
the World Cup won't be held in Summer Olympic years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Blatter didn't specify when the proposed biennial  
tournaments would be held, it's widely assumed they would be staged 
in odd years, probably starting in 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a schedule would put the World Cup in conflict with the  
IAAF championships, which recently changed from a four-year to 
two-year cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF championships are considered by some as the third  
largest international sports competition behind the Olympics and 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 world championships will be held in Seville, Spain, in  
August, followed by Edmonton, Alberta, in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo hopes to award the next four championships -- 2003, 2005,  
2007 and 2009 -- in a package deal. London, Paris, Berlin and Tokyo 
have been mentioned as possible sites.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japan Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Thursday amid  
renewed concern over Brazil's economy after one of its states 
declared a moratorium on debt payments. Japanese stock prices 
advanced moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 110.98 yen, down 1.54 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 68.10  
points, or 0.51 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,536.56. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially rose in Tokyo, buoyed by an overnight rally  
on Wall Street, but worries over Brazil and the possibility of a 
drawn-out trial in the U.S. Senate of President Bill Clinton later 
drove the U.S. currency lower against the yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro  
Bank, said news that a Brazilian state suspended debt payments 
prompted some investors to sell dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 110.00 yen and 113.05 yen in  
Thursday's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at $1.1642, down from $1.1740 in  
Tokyo late Wednesday but above $1.1592 overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The celebratory mood is gone and the market has settled  
down,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at CommerzBank. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro made its international debut Monday as the new common  
currency among 11 participating European nations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose as much as 2.37 percent,  
or 320 points, by the end of the morning session, after the Dow 
Jones industrial average soared 2.5 percent to close at a record 
high of 9,544.97 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nikkei shed much of its early gains in the afternoon as  
investors turned bearish following news of economic troubles in 
Brazil, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Minas Gerais state Wednesday declared a 90-day  
moratorium on debt payments to the federal government because of a 
lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-technology stocks were bought with the surge in New York  
overnight... but the rally lacked energy,'' said Kaoru Ichikawa, a 
futures and options trader at Kokusai Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurting the Tokyo market was profit-taking by institutional  
investors in the afternoon, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 383 million shares changed hands on the first  
section, up from Wednesday's turnover of 295 million shares. 
Advances outnumbered declines 673 to 469, with 151 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,069.60. The 
TOPIX closed up 10.43 points, or 0.99 percent, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.710 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.820 
percent, driving its price up to 100.73 yen from 99.83 yen.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Cops Hold Man in Rape-Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- An 81-year-old woman was killed as she  
tried to stop an intruder from raping her granddaughter. A suspect 
was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Soledad Abogado's 23-year-old granddaughter awoke  
around 2 a.m. Tuesday to find a man standing over her. He attacked 
her, choked her and forced her into the grandmother's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abogado heard the younger woman's cries and struggled with  
the attacker, who killed her as the terrified granddaughter 
watched, police said. The intruder then raped the younger woman 
before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect was arrested Wednesday evening, said Sacramento  
County sheriff's spokesman Lt. Jim Cooper. The man's name and other 
details were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there were no signs of forced entry to the home, but  
they do not believe the victims knew their attacker.

<HEADLINE> Reinsdorf: No Clue About Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf is on the  
long list of players, officials, agents and fans who don't know 
what Michael Jordan will do now that the NBA lockout has been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I talked to Michael, he was frazzled and worn  
out after the playoffs and at that time, he didn't think he was 
going to play,'' Reinsdorf said Thursday after owners unanimously 
ratified a new collective bargaining agreement in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now he's had a whole summer of golf and enjoying himself.  
Maybe he's energized again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls need to know quickly what Jordan will do. His decision  
will affect their plans and determine if they will reload or 
rebuild during what promises to be a short and hectic few weeks 
before a 50-game season begins Feb. 5. Training camps open Jan. 18 
and players will be allowed to start working out at NBA facilities 
next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to start with Michael. If Michael decides to retire,  
that changes a lot of things,'' Reinsdorf said, adding he hadn't 
spoken with Jordan since just before the lockout began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract doesn't hurt at all or help bring Michael back.  
He's grandfathered. He can make 5-percent more than last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be about $34.7 million, a figure that would be  
prorated for what will probably be a 50-game schedule starting 
around Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said his first phone call once the lockout was settled  
went to Phil Jackson, offering him another chance to return as 
coach. But Jackson, who left the Bulls after they won the 
championship last June, declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kind of chuckled. He said he had the next few months  
planned out,'' Reinsdorf said. ``He appreciated the call, but said 
he hadn't changed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd, still not sure if he will get to  
coach Jordan, said he wasn't aware of Jackson's response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about that, although that doesn't surprise me  
because that's what Phil said on several occasions,'' Floyd said as 
he headed out of the Berto Center with assistants Tex Winter and 
Frank Hamblen 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause, who must construct a team that  
currently has only four players under contract -- Toni Kukoc, Ron 
Harper, Keith Booth and Randy Brown -- declined comment from his 
suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Jordan's situation is settled, the rest of the Bulls' free  
agents remain in limbo. Mark Bartelstein, a Chicago-based agent who 
represents Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler, said he's talked briefly 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a little bit paralyzed,'' said Bartelstein, who also  
represents Brown. ``They haven't even been able to talk to Michael. 
``I'm sure when they do, they'll get a better understanding of 
where they're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when the season does begin in early February, the Bulls may  
have to wait for their home opener and ring ceremony. They'll 
likely start the season on the road because a mouse will be in 
their house. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Disney On Ice'' ice show runs Jan. 26-Feb. 7 at the United  
Center, and it takes a day to set up and take down the arena for 
the production. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the earliest the Bulls could play at home is Feb. 9 --  
which, under the prelockout schedule, was to be Chicago's first 
home game after a three-week West Coast road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitting in an exhibition game at the United Center could be  
tricky, too. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA commissioner David Stern said Thursday that each team will  
play two exhibition games, one at home and one away. But the ice 
show will begin setting up on Jan. 25, just one week after training 
camps are supposed to open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, also, was in the dark about Jordan, whose presence will  
be a buffer against fans bitter over the lockout and whose return 
will undoubtedly influence TV ratings and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not polite or appropriate for commissioners to beg, but  
Michael, please come back,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Rookie Wins Night Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHLADMING, Austria (AP) -- Benjamin Raich, a 20-year-old  
Austrian rookie on the World Cup tour, startled his experienced 
rivals Thursday by coming from 23rd place after the first run to 
win a night slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich's comeback broke a slalom record set by Swedish great  
Ingemar Stenmark, who in 1974 won a slalom after finishing 22nd in 
the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it,'' said Raich, a five-time world junior  
champion. ``I only meant to have a good second run and instead I 
won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raich completed the two runs in 1 minute, 33.32 seconds for his  
first World Cup victory. His previous best was a third place 
Wednesday, in a slalom in Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Pierrick Bourgeat, winner of the first slalom of the  
season, finished second, just .12 seconds back. Norway's Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt, who has won 14 races in his career but none this 
season, finished third in 1:33.51. 
</P>
<P>
	After a mediocre first run, Raich had the fastest time of the  
race in the second run to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part was waiting for everyone to come through the  
finish line and seeing whether they had beat me,'' Raich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep and curving course -- with one especially tricky gate --  
claimed seven of the top 30 racers, including Austrian favorite 
Thomas Stangassinger, the 1994 Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed really hard to try to win,'' said Stangassinger, who  
was in second position after the first run. ``But when you want to 
win sometimes you fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, when he was Raich's age, Aamodt won the Olympic super-G  
title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more fun beating the old guys than being beaten by the  
young ones,'' said Aamodt, now 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia's Jure Kosir, who was leading the race after the first  
run, slid to fifth. On Wednesday, Kosir won in front of his 
hometown crowd in a slalom in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia.

<HEADLINE> Mike Riley To Coach Chargers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Oregon State's Mike Riley today agreed to terms  
of a five-year contract with the San Diego Chargers, becoming the 
team's fourth head coach in as many seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved,'' Riley said as he entered Chargers headquarters  
today to sign the deal. ``These are agonizing things for me, 
especially when you talk about moving your family. It's a little 
disruptive, but it's exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final details were being worked out this morning, and a news  
conference was scheduled for 5 p.m. EST at the Chargers' 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers were 5-11 in the recently completed season.  
</P>
<P>
	Riley, 45, spent most of Wednesday meeting with Chargers'  
assistant coaches, many of whom he will inherit. The club flew his 
wife and two children from Corvallis, Ore., and the family went to 
dinner with Chargers officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley didn't seem frustrated with the pace of the process. After  
all, he has to be comfortable with the coaches who would make up 
his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Beathard was insisting that Riley retain  
defensive coordinator Joe Pascale and his staff, as well as 
offensive line coach Joe Bugel and running backs coach Ollie 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense was one of the few bright spots last season,  
ranking first in fewest yards allowed overall and against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, it isn't that simple because this is a little  
different situation, just because of coming in and not bringing all 
your own guys,'' Beathard said Wednesday. ``He wants to make sure 
it's right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley inherits a team that has had three straight non-winning  
seasons and doesn't have a first-round draft pick until 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers like Riley's offensive background -- he was coach of  
the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the pass-happy CFL from 1987-90, and 
offensive coordinator at Southern Cal from 1993 until taking the 
Oregon State job in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, they think he can develop quarterback Ryan Leaf, who was a  
bust on the field and a problem off it. 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard fired Kevin Gilbride on Oct. 13 after a 2-4 start, and  
interim coach June Jones took the vacant job at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was 8-14 in two seasons at Oregon State, including 5-6  
this year, the Beavers' best record since 1971. Oregon State, which 
hasn't had a winning season since 1970, lost by one point to 
Washington and California, played even with UCLA and beat Oregon in 
double overtime.

<HEADLINE> Woman Accused of Murdering Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRAZIER PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Two years ago, Jean Adair ran  
screaming to a neighbor's home with tape dangling from her wrists 
and red marks on her face, claiming she was bound by a robber who 
had just beaten her husband to death. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the 38-year-old mother of two was arrested on  
suspicion of murdering her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said she will be charged with lying in wait and  
committing murder for financial gain, which could bring the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Patty Ferguson said investigators chased down every  
lead since Robert Adair's 1996 slaying at the couple's condo in 
Sylmar, and ``we keep coming back to the same place: Jean Adair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adair had claimed a man disguised as a gas company worker  
talked his way into the gated condominium complex and beat the 
couple. She later collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said they believe that Adair came home for lunch  
and his wife lunged at him with a baseball bat and struck him 
repeatedly in the head. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no fingerprints. There are no fibers. There are no  
witnesses,'' prosecutor Jane Winston said. ``But we have thoroughly 
investigated her story and have come to the conclusion that it does 
not make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adair's lawyer, Richard Plotin, said she is innocent, and he  
questioned what led police to make an arrest. ``As far as I know, 
there is no new evidence,'' Plotin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members had told police that they thought Ms. Adair may  
have had something to do with the slaying. Ms. Adair's 
mother-in-law said that shortly before Adair was killed, he had 
told his wife he wanted a divorce.

<HEADLINE> World Bank OKs $1.01B Brazil Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Bank approved two loans totaling  
$1.01 billion Thursday to help Brazil stabilize its economy, which 
was threatened with collapse last year. The government is expected 
to use the funds for health care programs and pension reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans are part of a $41.5 billion package in emergency loans  
to Brazil assembled in November by the International Monetary Fund 
and other lenders to help Latin America's largest economy avoid the 
currency collapse and high inflation that has devastated Asia and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A World Bank statement said the two loans, for $757.5 million  
and $252.5 million, were to be disbursed immediately after approval 
by the Brazilian Senate, expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the bank's overall $4.5 billion support  
program for Brazil was designed to protect the gains made by the 
poor since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government lowered 
inflation from 50 percent in 1994 to 2 percent in 1998. The program 
also aims to improve government's ability to finance high priority 
social programs, such as pension reform. 
</P>
<P>
	To obtain the IMF loan package, Cardoso had to impose an  
austerity program calling for more taxes and spending cuts of $84 
billion over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	A World Bank spokesman said the two loans will have five-year  
terms with an interest rate of 9 percent, higher than normal bank 
loans. There is a three-year grace period before debt repayments 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	To put pressure on governments to implement austerity programs,  
President Clinton advocated a move away from low interest rate 
World Bank loans last October. He was supported by the central bank 
chiefs and finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in a statement that  
Brazil's poor have ``gained a great deal'' from the government's 
efforts to stabilize its currency, the real, and fight the effects 
of contagion on the Brazilian economy.

<HEADLINE>  Wedding Fever Over Royal Engagement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British media proved to be full of die-hard  
romantics as it fawned over the latest royal bride and groom -- and 
hoped this would be the marriage that lasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Edward proposed to his girlfriend of five years, Sophie  
Rhys-Jones. And she replied ``Yes, yes please,'' delighting Queen 
Elizabeth II's divorce-prone family and making the country giddy 
with royal wedding fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Royal Sensation. They're happy, madly in love, and it might  
just last!'' The Mirror tabloid declared in today's editions. 
``Will it be fourth time lucky? Why this time I'm sure the marriage 
will work,'' wrote a columnist in a 12-page souvenir pullout in the 
Daily Mail tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	The blonde, svelte Ms. Rhys-Jones posed for customary press  
photographs with her fiance, the queen's youngest son, after 
Buckingham Palace made the formal announcement Wednesday. With her 
arm wrapped through his, Ms. Rhys-Jones regularly threw back her 
head in laughter as the two answered media questions and showed off 
an engagement ring featuring a 2-carat diamond flanked by two 
smaller heart-shaped ones. 
</P>
<P>
	While the British media made much of the fact that Ms.  
Rhys-Jones can look uncannily like the late Princess Diana -- 
comparing pictures of the two in similar outfits and poses-- they 
also stressed how very different the women are. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana was a shy, awkward 20-year-old who gave up the sheltered  
life of an earl's daughter to marry Edward's elder brother Charles 
at a lavish wedding in 1981, watched by an estimated 700 million 
people worldwide. That marriage ended in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At 33, Ms. Rhys-Jones runs her own public relations business,  
mixes in celebrity circles and confidently attends public functions 
on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's very much her own woman,'' said Jennie Bond, royal  
correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Diana, who had royalty suddenly thrust upon her, Ms.  
Rhys-Jones has learned the royal business from the inside. She 
edits a magazine for the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, a 
charity set up by her future father-in-law, and has handled public 
relations for some royal events. 
</P>
<P>
	At the royal photo-call at London's St. James's Palace, the  
salesman's daughter pledged to continue working, and some tabloids 
even reported that she would be back at her desk today. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite breaking with royal tradition, the engagement was still  
inevitably compared to the ill-fated weddings of Edward's siblings, 
Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, who has since 
remarried. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 34-year-old prince denied that his sister's and  
brothers' divorces had made him altar-shy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if anybody is going to get married I hope they think  
they will get it right,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buckingham palace said both families were delighted with the  
engagement. It will be the first marriage for both. 
</P>
<P>
	The palace said the date and venue for the wedding have yet to  
be decided, but the couple hope to use the 16th century St. 
George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the queen's weekend home west of 
London, for a ceremony in late spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
	They will live at Bagshot Park, a former royal residence  
southwest of London where Edward, who produces and presents 
documentaries, took out a 50-year lease in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray Harkin, Ms. Rhys-Jones' business partner, is confident  
that if anyone can handle the whirl of royal life, Edward's new 
bride can. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is very discreet, loyal and extremely level-headed,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Senators Sworn in for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Solemnly opening the first presidential  
impeachment trial in 130 years, senators raised their hands and 
swore today to ``do impartial justice'' in judging whether 
President Clinton should be removed from office. House prosecutors 
delivered two articles charging the president with perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House declared there wasn't a ``compelling case'' for  
ousting Clinton and warned that if Republicans summoned witnesses 
``all bets are off'' for a speedy resolution of a scandal that has 
dominated the nation for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a day of ceremony televised nationwide, Chief Justice William  
Rehnquist left the Supreme Court for the Senate chamber where he 
took his own oath to preside over the trial and then swore in the 
100 senators as jurors for a proceeding that will decide the fate 
of the 42nd president. Two-thirds must vote to convict Clinton if 
he is to be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you solemnly swear that in all things pertaining to the  
trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, now pending, 
that you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution 
and laws, so help you God?'' intoned 96-year-old Strom Thurmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do,'' Rehnquist replied.  
</P>
<P>
	As Rehnquist, wearing a black robe with four gold stripes on  
each arm, administered the oath, many lawmakers responded, ``I 
do.'' Then a clerk read each senator's name in alphabetical order, 
and each stood at his or her desk, raised his right hand and said, 
``I do.'' Each then walked to the rostrum to sign the official 
``oath book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since the trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868  
that senators were asked to try a president. 
</P>
<P>
	As the ceremony unfolded, an agreement on the framework for the  
trial remained elusive. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott wanted to 
gather all 100 senators in a rare, private session in the Old 
Senate Chamber ``to decide in a bipartisan fashion how to 
proceed.'' But Democrats said they were not ready for such a 
meeting, and when the trial recessed the senators went their 
separate ways out of the chamber. Rehnquist left the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde  
led the 13 Republicans named as prosecutors for the trial in a 
silent walk across the Capitol -- followed by cameras that broadcast 
the scene live to the nation -- to deliver the impeachment papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senators will be in order,'' Thurmond, the Senate president  
pro tempore, hollered as he called the session to order. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sergeant at arms, James W. Ziglar, escorted the House  
members to the well of the Senate. ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all 
persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment,'' he 
declared, reading a proclamation written by the founding fathers 
more than 200 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``has prevented, obstructed and impeded the  
administration of justice,'' the silver-haired Hyde said as he read 
from the articles to a stilled Senate chamber. Hyde's prosecution 
team stood at attention in a semicircle to his right. The senators 
sat silently, a few taking notes. About three-quarters of the seats 
in the galleries were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his  
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of public view, but the White House made a  
new bid to cut short the trial. Clinton would stipulate to ``the 
five volumes, 7,000 or so pages'' of grand jury testimony and other 
evidence that prosecutor Kenneth Starr sent to the House last fall 
so that witnesses would not have to be called, presidential 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the most prejudicial record that could possibly exist.  
But we believe that even with this record we can effectively make 
our case,'' Lockhart said. The White House made the offer in a 
late-night bargaining session with senators. 
</P>
<P>
	But the House prosecutors made clear their intention to call  
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, at a trial that could extend 
three weeks or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said, ``If they insist on bringing witnesses it will  
significantly extend and delay this process and all bets are off. 
... We don't believe that they've made a compelling case that the 
president be removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said all Republican proposals would  
allow witnesses to be called by both the House and the White House. 
``If the House feels they need them, then we're going to give them 
leeway. That's the Republican sentiment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., denounced Hyde's demands for  
witnesses. ``We need to negotiate between senators, not senators 
and the House. We're going to be held hostage any time the House 
Republicans object to something,'' Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republican senators said they supported a plan offered  
by Lott on Wednesday that would allow the Senate to vote on a 
witness-by-witness basis on whether to allow their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can be demonstrated that a witness is needed to prove  
something, let them in. If not, keep them out,'' Sen. Robert 
Bennett, R-Utah, said, expressing his support for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors said Wednesday they intend to call as many as  
10 witnesses or more to make their case, including Ms. Lewinsky, 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie and presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan -- all of whom testified in Starr's grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were in general agreement on allowing opening  
statements by both the House prosecutors and Clinton's lawyers, 
Lott said. Gregg said there was informal agreement that there would 
be no time limits on the statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Capitol, a long line of tourists formed, hoping to  
get a glimpse of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with Hyde,  
R-Ill., and three other lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers 
unexpectedly summoned four members of the White House legal team to 
the Capitol to discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday and today with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back.

<HEADLINE> Padres To Announce Monterrey Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Padres are expected to announce  
Friday that they will play the season-opening Sunday night game 
against the Colorado Rockies at Monterrey, Mexico, on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Planning for the game, to be called the International Opener,  
has been under way for several weeks. The Padres have scheduled a 
news conference for noon Friday to discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were tabbed by major league baseball to play the game  
because of the efforts to expand baseball internationally. The 
Padres played in the first regular-season series in Mexico in 
August 1996, and have a working agreement with a Japanese club. 
They also played a series in Honolulu in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monterrey game is expected to be shown on ESPN as well as  
televised in 200 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, the teams will fly to San Diego to finish the  
series on April 6-7.

<HEADLINE> Explorers Reach Tibetan Waterfalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 75 years after explorers seeking a  
legendary waterfall in a misty Tibetan gorge gave up and concluded 
that it didn't exist, a team from the National Geographic Society 
became the first Westerners to reach it. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the great falls on Tibet's Tsangpo River first spread to  
outsiders in the 19th century and the search became the subject of 
myth and folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	Over and over Western teams sought out the falls, known to local  
hunters and Buddhist monks. Time and again they failed. Finally, on 
Nov. 8, Western explorers speaking the local language and schooled 
in Buddhism succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucked tightly between the rising cliffs of the Tsangpo gorge,  
the 100- to 115-foot falls are in shadow most of the time and 
hidden from view in a hairpin turn. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding the falls was ``an enchanting moment,'' said Ken Storm  
Jr., one of the group that found the cataract and named it Hidden 
Falls. ``We were all stunned and excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we're here, in the late 20th century, and a  
large waterfall on a major river of the world has yet to be 
recorded is a wonder in itself,'' Storm said in a telephone 
interview from his Minneapolis office. 
</P>
<P>
	Romantic tales of the great falls sparked several unsuccessful  
expeditions. The last effort, in 1924, came within a quarter-mile 
before the explorers gave up and concluded the falls didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tsangpo gorge in southeastern Tibet is a rugged wilderness  
unlike the high desert of the rest of the region. It is called 
Pemako, one of the hidden lands held sacred in Tibetan Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Chinese began allowing Westerners to visit Tibet in  
1993, Storm said, explorations were begun by members of the group 
that finally located the falls, including himself; Ian Baker, who 
lives in New York and Nepal; and Hamid Sarder of Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidden Falls is ``in a dramatic spot, deep in this gorge, beyond  
the point where earlier explorers were able to reach,'' Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1924 expedition, a gap of about five miles was left  
unexplored because the men couldn't work their way into the area 
through steep cliffs where the river disappears into a knot of 
mountains. The river reappears, 100 miles farther on and 8,000 feet 
lower, as the Brahmaputra. The ruggedness of the gorge prevented 
explorers from determining what became of the Tsangpo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believed their accounts that there probably wasn't a great  
waterfall in there,'' Storm said. ``Only in the last year were we 
able to realize from monks and hunters'' that the falls were there. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker and Sarder are Buddhist scholars fluent in Tibetan, Storm  
said. They were able to develop an understanding with local people, 
who had always known about the falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we came down into the gorge we could look upstream and see  
Rainbow Falls,'' which was found by the 1924 explorers, Storm said. 
They determined it was almost 70 feet high, nearly twice what had 
been previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also realized as we were going down the gorge that in a  
narrow, tight hairpin turn, hidden ... was another waterfall,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thrill was amazing. The river of 100 yards narrowed to 60  
to 70 feet and the water poured over this, thundering, the full 
volume of the Tsangpo, which collects water from the whole 
Himalayan region.''

<HEADLINE> Lockout End Brings New Bulls Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The post-lockout Chicago Bulls might resemble the  
six-time champions who have ruled the NBA in the 1990s. Then again, 
they might look more like a noontime pickup team at the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
	So, which one will it be? That depends on Michael Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, the dynasty was built around Michael,'' Bulls  
coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd said Wednesday, hours after the NBA and 
the players union reached an agreement to settle the six-month 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to go back to talking about Michael first and  
hoping that Michael will come,'' he said. ``If that does happen, 
which is the best-case scenario, then we can really try to put a 
team together that can try to contend for a seventh championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if Jordan doesn't come back, get ready for one of the  
biggest rebuilding jobs the NBA has ever seen. Nine of the 12 
players on Chicago's roster for last season's playoffs are free 
agents, including Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc, Randy Brown and Keith Booth are the only  
four players under contract -- that's not even enough bodies to hold 
a practice -- and Harper is the only starter of the group. If the 
Bulls do have to rebuild, they're more likely to start over with 
young players rather than try to keep some of last year's aging 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know who the coach is going to be or anybody else is  
going to be,'' Harper said. ``I just want opening night to come so 
I can get my third championship ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first question to be resolved likely will be the coach.  
Floyd was named director of basketball operations when he was hired 
so the Bulls could make one last try at getting Phil Jackson back. 
But Jackson laughed when he heard that, and his agent, Todd 
Musburger, has said repeatedly that if Jackson coaches again, it 
won't be for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf called Jackson on Wednesday to  
try to persuade him to return, but the coach once again turned down 
the offer, the Chicago Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jordan once swore he wouldn't play for anyone but  
Jackson -- he all but retired before Floyd was hired in July -- he's 
been known to change his mind before. And Floyd plans to keep 
things just as Jackson left them, right down to the triangle 
offense and punishing defense that were trademarks of Chicago's 
champion teams. 
</P>
<P>
	If the prospect of playing for a seventh championship isn't  
enough, there's money, too. Lots of it. Under the new agreement, 
the Bulls can pay Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
about $34.7 million -- far more than any other team can afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it would be natural to get in touch with Michael or  
(agent) David Falk as quick as possible,'' Floyd said. ``We want to 
talk to Michael first and go from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said he doesn't know what Jordan will decide.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' Falk said. ``I'm not 
certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Pippen, he's long felt underappreciated and undervalued  
by the Bulls. He made a paltry -- in relative terms -- $2.7 million 
last season because Chicago refused to renegotiate a long-term 
contract he signed early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Jordan, the new deal won't let Pippen cash in by  
re-signing with the Bulls. The most any team, including Chicago, 
can pay him is $14 million for next season. However, the Bulls can 
increase his salary 12 percent the following year, compared with 10 
percent increases he'd get from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Not much, but a few extra million is better than nothing. And  
Pippen might not get many better offers. Though he's one of the 50 
best players in NBA history, the 33-year-old had back surgery in 
June for the second time in 10 years. His back was so bad during 
the NBA Finals he needed cortisone shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen may be fine, but no one has seen him play since the  
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bulls have a difficult task,'' said free agent Steve Kerr,  
whose last-second shot won the Bulls their 1997 championship. 
``They have to sign 10 guys, and who knows who they will be.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Might Bid for AirTouch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. emerged Thursday as a  
potential suitor for AirTouch Communications Inc., creating a 
three-way bidding brawl for the nation's largest independent 
cellular phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	News of MCI WorldCom's interest, reported Thursday in USA Today,  
comes as AirTouch executives were hosting their first meeting with 
Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest cellular phone operator. 
Vodafone made a $55 billion offer last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic Corp. executives in New York were  
considering whether their $45 billion offer for AirTouch will pass 
muster with antitrust and securities regulators, and whether they 
will sweeten the price. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race for AirTouch is very important because the stakes are  
so high,'' said Holt Thrasher, managing director for Broadview 
International, an investment banking firm in Fort Lee, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapid pace of consolidation sweeping the entire  
telecommunications industry isn't expected to stop with the pursuit 
of AirTouch. The losing bidders likely will target other cellular 
phone companies, which pose an increasing threat to traditional 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
	As cellular phone prices decline and the technology improves,  
Thrasher expects cellular phones to become a standard way people 
call each other, send faxes and connect to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch's stock rose $2.12 1/2 to $82 on the New York Stock  
Exchange as investors did the math on reports that MCI WorldCom was 
preparing to offer more than $91 a share, or $55 billion, for 
AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Both MCI WorldCom and AirTouch declined comment, as did Bell  
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone's executives met Thursday with their AirTouch  
counterparts. The entourage from Vodafone's Britain's headquarters 
included Kenneth Hydon, financial director, while the company's 
chief executive, Chris Gent, who was in New Zealand, kept in touch 
by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone spokesman Michael Caldwell put an end to speculation  
that Vodafone was only interested in AirTouch's international 
cellular operations, and might be willing to sell off AirTouch's 
U.S. business, which is concentrated in the Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly see the U.S. included in our worldwide plans for  
a merger of the two businesses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vodafone-AirTouch deal, however, looked in jeopardy Thursday  
with the potential entrance of MCI WorldCom, which is based in 
Jackson, Miss. Vodafone's U.S. shares dropped $3.75 to $177 in 
afternoon trading on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were quick to put their bets on Bernard J. Ebbers,  
chief executive officer of MCI WorldCom and a master of convincing 
shareholders of the potential of investing in his company. 
</P>
<P>
	Since all three companies courting San Francisco-based AirTouch  
will have to pay at least a portion of the price in stock, 
investors will be looking for strong growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most likely you're going to end up with stock in the acquiring  
company, so that's a big interest to us,'' said Christopher H. 
Brown, co-manager for Pax World, which owns 700,000 shares of 
AirTouch, making it the mutual fund's largest holding. 
</P>
<P>
	So, which suitor does he like?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaning toward MCI WorldCom at the moment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But MCI WorldCom's stock fell $3.25 to $75.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market as investors worried about the cost of the deal. MCI 
WorldCom is likely to be an aggressive bidder because it one of the 
last major U.S. telecom companies to enter the $30 billion cellular 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street already was handicapping the next moves by the  
suitors AirTouch rejects. Nextel Communications Inc. of McLean, 
Va., and Mannesmann AG, a German cellular giant, were high on lists 
of takeover candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, which provides cellular and local phone service  
along the East Coast, would most likely go after a U.S. company to 
create a nationwide network, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Nextel is an industry leader and is expanding in South  
America, the company has spent heavily to build a digital network 
and is saddled with $7 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel's stock rose 93 3/4 cents to $29.31 1/4 on Nasdaq. Bell  
Atlantic's stock rose 12 1/2 cents to $56 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Book Operators Yawn at NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sports book operators reacted to the end of the  
NBA lockout with a collective yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of the first three months of the pro basketball season  
had little impact on betting business, bookies said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA hasn't been missed very much at all,'' said Joe Lupo,  
Stardust hotel-casino sports book director. ``I know we would 
rather have it, but it just hasn't been missed. We haven't lost any 
money by not booking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lupo said the NBA will be more important to sports books in  
April and May following the college basketball season, but that it 
is not a big betting sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is not a big revenue producer,'' Lupo said. ``It isn't  
like we lost a lot of revenue by not having the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excalibur hotel-casino sports book supervisor Richard Saber said  
the lockout also had little effect on his business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is any difference, in effect, if they  
played or didn't play,'' Saber said. ``Even when they were playing, 
no one seemed to care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saber said bettors had lots of other things to put their money  
on while the NBA wasn't playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking the other day how not one person has even  
mentioned it,'' he said. ``We didn't have one person come in and 
say, 'When is the NBA coming back?' We didn't have anyone who 
missed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saber said if the NBA lockout had not been settled, most of the  
money that would have been bet on the NBA would have been bet on 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NBA is not one of our bigger betting sports,'' Saber said.  
``The only thing we take less on is the NHL. (The NBA) is a very 
small percentage of our handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, the NBA settlement was good news to at least one sports  
book. Norm Kelley, assistant sports book manager at Sam's Town 
casino, said he will be glad to see the games begin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once football is over, most of our bettors turn to  
basketball,'' Kelley said. ``Although college basketball gets quite 
a bit of play, pro basketball is what most of our players play.''

<HEADLINE> Suspension Sought for Petr Korda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PERTH, Australia (AP) -- The International Tennis Federation will  
seek a one-year suspension for Czech player Petr Korda, ITF 
president Brian Tobin said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon in  
July but escaped a suspension after insisting he took the substance 
inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF has been criticized, especially by other players, for  
not imposing the one-year suspension required by its rules. Tobin 
said the decision on the punishment was made by an independent 
appeals body appointed by the ITF and did not reflect the ITF's 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said the ITF is planning to lodge an appeal of its own,  
seeking a ban, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 
Switzerland within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin held a news conference at the Hopman Cup today after a  
player backlash over the light punishment. The Australian Open 
champion lost his 199 ranking points from Wimbledon and $94,529 in 
prize money. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including American Lindsay Davenport, demanded  
an explanation from the ITF and called for a ban to apply. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals committee accepted Korda's excuse.  
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he agreed with those players who believe the excuse  
was insufficient reason for Korda to escape a ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I question if that is a legitimate reason for reducing the  
penalty,'' Tobin said Thursday. ``We did prove that he was 
positive, and if it happened to me I'd say the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said Korda had asked for the entire report of 70 pages to  
be made public but the ITF chief said that would serve no purpose.

<HEADLINE>  Senate Launching Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn moment for President Clinton and  
the nation, the Senate is launching the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868. The 
ceremonial opening comes amid intense, last-minute bargaining over 
ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With House prosecutors pressing Senate leaders to allow  
testimony from witnesses such as Monica Lewinsky, there were 
increasing indications that a full-blown trial of some weeks' 
duration was in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators today were taking an oath to ``do impartial justice,''  
and Chief Justice William Rehnquist was assuming his role as 
presiding officer for Clinton's trial on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. The 13-member House prosecution team was to 
read the two articles of impeachment on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But beyond those public sessions, the House ``managers'' were  
negotiating for the right to summon a number of witnesses, most 
notably Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair 
with Clinton triggered the impeachment investigation, and 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters  
Wednesday that if agreement could be reached to call witnesses, he 
would want the White House and the House to justify the need for 
each person summoned. The Senate also would have to approve each 
witness by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism that agreement was near on a procedure  
for a ``full trial .... and votes on articles of impeachment at the 
end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said it would likely be February at the earliest before 
votes were taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with the lead  
House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and three other 
lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers unexpectedly summoned 
four members of the White House legal team to the Capitol to 
discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial question was whether to allow witnesses, as demanded  
by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate would have to 
approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of the House prosecutors, said  
``five to 10 witnesses puts on a case. I suspect we will want 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others on the prosecution team said the House might try  
to summon women who have provided statements in the Paula Jones 
case ``to the degree they go to obstruction of justice and 
perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky must be called ``because she is right in the middle  
of this,'' Cannon said. But he added that he'd ``never seen Linda 
Tripp as essential,'' referring to Ms. Lewinsky's onetime friend 
who taped their private telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney and longtime Clinton  
friend, ``is a player'' and should be summoned, Cannon said. But 
while other prosecutors wanted to call presidential secretary Betty 
Currie, Cannon said he would be reluctant to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president placed her in a vulnerable position by  
involving her in the Lewinsky affair, adding ``It was a rotten, 
nasty thing to do to a career civil servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other House prosecutors had their own suggestions.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris to conduct a poll on Americans' 
opinion of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have the opportunity to present 12 to 14  
witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion,'' but ``we don't have to go into 
all the (sexual) details. Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if Mrs. Currie ``has a bearing on the case, it's  
important to have the jury hear her testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson added that Jordan was essential because, ``In the  
framework of the obstruction of justice case, I would say he's an 
important witnesses.''

</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have the opportunity to present 12 to 14  
witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion,'' but ``we don't have to go into 
all the (sexual) details. Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if Mrs. Currie ``has a bearing on the case, it's  
important to have the jury hear her testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson added that Jordan was essential because, ``In the  
framework of the obstruction of justice case, I would say he's an 
important witnesses.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Recommends New DNC Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Detroit's mayor, a party activist from Indiana  
and a California congresswoman are President Clinton's choices to 
join the Democratic National Committee leadership team, The 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	Current co-chairman Steve Grossman announced his resignation  
Dec. 2, less than a month after Democrats performed surprisingly 
well in midterm elections. He said he wanted to spend more time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Andrew, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party and the  
DNC's convention site selection committee, is Clinton's choice to 
replace Grossman as the full-time chairman charged with day-to-day 
operations at the DNC, several Democratic officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, one of the nation's leading black  
politicians, was tapped by Clinton to be one of three part-time 
co-chairmen, sources said. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, who was 
Grossman's co-chair and the party's main spokesman, will continue 
in that capacity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans also call for having Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., join  
Archer and Romer in the part-time leadership posts, though that 
move has not been finalized, officials said. She is a two-term 
Hispanic lawmaker who defeated conservative incumbent Rep. Bob 
Dornan in 1996 and beat him again in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's recommendations must be approved by the DNC membership  
in March, a formality. Officials said Vice President Al Gore, who 
is running to succeed Clinton, had input on the decisions. The 
party plans to announce the new team next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee has one chairman, Jim  
Nicholson, but he is being challenged in elections this month. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles is still the front-runner by far to host the 2000  
Democratic convention, but party leaders in Washington don't want 
the city to take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	They're putting out the word that Denver and Boston, the other  
finalists, continue to sweeten their bids while Los Angeles is less 
eager to please. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Los Angeles' to lose,'' said a senior party official  
involved in the selection process, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. ``And they're doing everything they can to lose it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are such matters as each city's financial commitment.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander is accusing potential White House rival George  
W. Bush of using ``weasel words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who will form a  
presidential exploratory committee Friday, said in a telephone 
interview Thursday that he has a problem with the Texas governor's 
political slogan, ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are weasel words,'' he said. ``Compassionate  
conservative is just like Al Gore talking about `practical 
idealism.' They're designed to mean nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When you say `compassionate conservative,' it sounds like  
you're saying, `I'm not like the rest of those politicians who are 
not compassionate,''' Alexander said. ``I think we need to say in 
plain words, `I am a conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Bush, responded: ``When Governor  
Bush says `compassionate conservative,' he is saying a conservative 
philosophy is a compassionate philosophy. Teaching people to read 
is both compassionate and conservative. Moving people from welfare 
to work is both compassionate and conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore last month dismissed Bush and other Republicans who talk  
about compassion. ``Compassion' is more than a pretty word,'' he 
said. Hughes said at the time that Gore's remarks were ``a little 
odd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Two Republican southern governors plan to announce their support  
of Alexander in conjunction with his Federal Election Commission 
filing Friday: Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is from Clinton's home 
state, Arkansas, and Sen. Don Sundquist is from Tennessee, which 
Gore calls home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't want the country to think that Gore and Clinton  
were the best that Tennessee and Arkansas had to offer,'' Alexander 
quipped.

	Senate Begins Clinton Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today began the historic  
impeachment trial of President Clinton on charges of high crimes 
and misdemeanors. The president was at the White House when all 100 
senators -- with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding -- swore 
somberly to render ``impartial justice.'' The White House said 
there is a ``compelling case'' for acquittal. A closed-door meeting 
of all senators was scheduled for tomorrow in an effort to decide 
on rules for the impeachment trial. 

</P>
<P>
	Indictment Issued in Willey Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A friend whose testimony cast doubt on  
ex-White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's allegation of an 
unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton was indicted today on 
charges she obstructed justice and made up her story. Julie Hiatt 
Steele was charged by an Alexandria, Va., grand jury working with 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Among other things, the 
indictment accused Ms. Steele of filing a false affidavit in Paula 
Jones' sex harassment suit against Clinton, lying to two grand 
juries and attempting to influence the testimony of other 
witnesses. 

</P>
<P>
	Tripp: Maybe I Saw Lost Records  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp says she may have seen in a safe  
in White House lawyer Vince Foster's office missing billing records 
from Hillary Clinton's law firm. Mrs. Tripp had worked as a 
secretary to Foster. Eventually, the long-sought records were found 
in the White House residence. ``I saw what I now believe to be the 
infamous billing records in that safe,'' Tripp said in a deposition 
for the conservative legal group Judicial Watch, which made her 
testimony public. It was Tripp whose tapes of Monica Lewinsky led 
to the probe of a presidential affair.

	U.S. Defends Iraq Inspection Policy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. weapons experts, including some from  
intelligence agencies, helped U.N. inspectors hunt for Iraqi 
weapons and gained information that assisted American military 
planners, Clinton administration officials admit. But the officials 
denied the Americans were proxy spies. The U.N. Special Commission 
on Iraq had requested help from dozens of countries, including the 
United States. U.S. experts in chemical, biological and nuclear 
weapons were attached to UNSCOM on temporary assignment, White 
House and State Department officials said. The information they 
collected was for U.N. use. 

</P>
<P>
	Probe Faults U.S. Embassy Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - An official panel investigating the bombings  
at two U.S. embassies in Africa found there was a ``collective 
failure'' by several administrations and congresses to safeguard 
American diplomatic missions, a senior official said tonight. The 
official said the report accused the State Department and other 
agencies of giving low priority to security at U.S. missions 
abroad. The Accountability Review Board was convened after the 
bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August. 
Twelve Americans were among the 224 people killed.

	Clinton Wants After-School Funds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed tripling to  
$600 million the budget for after-school programs. The president, 
his wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore unveiled the proposal 
in a White House ceremony. Clinton said 1 million children would 
benefit from his proposed expansion of after-school programs.

	Study: Birth Control Pill OK  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Women suffer no lasting ill effects from taking  
birth control pills, according to the biggest study ever on the 
subject and one that some experts say finally can lay to rest fears 
that have lingered since the pill was introduced in 1961. Ten years 
after they stopped using the pill, women's chances of dying from 
cancer, stroke and other side effects were the same as those of 
women who had never taken it, according to the study published in 
the latest issue of the British Medical Journal.

New York, the Dow closed at 9,537.76, down 7.21.

	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Juan Dixon made two free throws with

to beat Virginia 71-66 tonight. Maryland is 14-2. Virginia is 9-6.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Mum on Vikes' Receivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The routine rarely changes for Aeneas  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl cornerback of the Arizona Cardinals usually is  
asked to shut down the other team's best receiver. More times than 
not, he succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery about Arizona's second-round playoff game against  
Minnesota is which one of the Vikings' talented wideouts the 
Cardinals consider the best. Minnesota (15-1) set an NFL scoring 
record (556 points) and tied San Francisco for most touchdown 
passes (41) this season because of targets like Randy Moss, Cris 
Carter and Jake Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams says outsiders won't know until after the kickoff  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't talk about what we were going to do against the  
Cowboys from a secondary standpoint,'' he said. ``All I know is we 
will be ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis was just as secretive.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have 11 players on the field, and every one of  
them playing like hell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moss, a rookie, owns 28 Minnesota records, including 17 TD  
catches that tied him with the number Carter put up three years 
ago. Moss is 6-foot-4, and both Carter and Reed are 6-3, a daunting 
array of size and speed for any secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, who finished 17th against the pass this season  
and start a rookie, Corey Chavous, at the corner opposite Williams. 
But they are quietly confident that they can handle the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong safety Tommy Bennett, who returned an interception 70  
yards for a score against Philadelphia on Dec. 13, said Moss' 
newness in the league worked to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``What defensive backs do is look for tendencies on receivers,  
and people really didn't have any tendencies on him,'' said 
Bennett, who believes the 5-11 Williams and 6-foot Chavous have 
enough speed and leaping ability to counter Moss. ``We have some 
bigger corners, some more aggressive corners that can play guys 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings are in the playoffs for the sixth time in seven  
years, while the Cardinals (10-7) are in for the first time in 16 
years and have never played in the second round. When they won the 
only playoff game in their history, it was 1947 and they beat 
Philadelphia for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	But Williams will have the edge in experience if he draws the  
assignment on Moss. Williams, an eight-year veteran, was elected to 
his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl last month and holds the franchise 
record for TDs off interceptions with six. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether Moss would be the acid test for him,''  
said secondary coach Larry Marmie. ``Aeneas has played against a 
lot of great receivers over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A five-time team leader in interceptions, Williams had only one  
this year because other teams usually avoid his side of the field -- 
a tendency that helped him break Michael Irvin's 117-game receiving 
streak on Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cardinals beat the Cowboys 20-7 in the first round last  
week, Williams held Irvin to four catches for an insignificant 32 
yards. Chavous knocked down five passes and had an interception 
nullified by a questionable interference call, and Arizona's 
overall coverage was almost flawless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll do an assortment of things,'' Williams said.  
``... I guess our thinking as a secondary is that we have to 
contain these guys.''

<HEADLINE> Dolphins Hope To Ignore Elements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The first indication that this was not going  
to be a typical road trip greeted the Miami Dolphins almost as soon 
as they walked into their locker room this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want a muff for Saturday, come to the equipment room  
for fitting,'' the reminder on a message board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver in January, when many a warm-weather team has seen its  
playoff hopes sputter like a stone-cold car battery. 
</P>
<P>
	What's a warm-blooded team from the tropics to do?  
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, who visit Mile High Stadium for Saturday's AFC  
divisional playoff against the Broncos, believe the secret is to 
simply ignore the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to tell ourselves they're just distractions,''  
guard Kevin Donnalley said. ``The crowd and the weather -- that's 
all just in your mind. You just need to forget about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Places like Green Bay, Buffalo and Chicago also are known for  
their frigid conditions and fevered crowds. But throw in the thin 
air at Mile High Stadium, and Denver usually tops the list of most 
inhospitable playoff sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos are 9-2 in the postseason in Denver, three times  
using home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs as a 
springboard into the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you have a young team, those type of things can  
be a problem if you let them,'' said defensive end Trace Armstrong, 
one of only a handful of Dolphins ever to play a game in Denver. 
``A lot of our guys have not been in that stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only five Dolphins were with the squad the last time they  
traveled to Denver, for a preseason game in 1993. A few others 
visited with other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong played there in November 1990 while with Chicago, a  
16-13 Bears win in overtime. Asked to pick the most intimidating 
factor there, he said: ``The crowd. They've got one of the best 
groups of fans in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Zach Thomas occasionally visits his father's cabin  
near Westcliffe, Colo., about 80 miles southwest of Denver, so he 
has some experience with the high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've run sprints up the mountain, but I've never done it in  
the wintertime,'' Thomas said. ``I don't know how difficult that 
is. I'll try not to let it get to my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Dolphins' gear is a special $1,800 trunk with heating  
coils inside the panels. It's to keep Dan Marino's helmet warm 
between series, preventing the quarterback communication system 
from shorting out. 
</P>
<P>
	A message also was posted Thursday reminding players to pack  
seven-stud cleats -- for better traction on frozen tundra -- and 
noting special gloves made for glass cutters already had been 
packed for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some stuff they've got us trying out. You put it  
on and you forget about it,'' linebacker Derrick Rodgers said with 
a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the temperatures won't quite be freezing on Saturday.  
The National Weather Service is predicting temperatures in the high 
30s, with no snow in the forecast. Whether that's good news or not 
depends on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all a mental game,'' Rodgers said. ``The altitude, the  
weather, the size of your cleats -- those are all mental things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson is taking no chances for himself.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it gets below 75 degrees, I'm going to be bundled up pretty  
good,'' he quipped.

<HEADLINE> GM Mulls Small-Car Assembly Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. will decide by April whether  
to convert three of its small-car assembly operations into a new 
type of auto plant designed to use far fewer workers and 
dramatically cut manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker said in a statement Thursday that its board  
had conditionally approved the Delta small-car program but had not 
given final approval to the plant locations. GM is negotiating with 
the United Auto Workers over work rules and conditions that would 
govern how the plants operate at Lordstown, Ohio; Lansing, Mich.; 
and Ingersoll, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
		   The No. 1 automaker will decide by April whether to replace its  
aging small-car assembly operations in Lordstown, Ohio; Lansing, 
Mich.; and convert the GM-Suzuki plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, into 
a new type of auto plant designed to use far fewer workers and 
dramatically cut manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But all-new plants in Lansing and Lordstown, along with changes  
to the newer GM-Suzuki plant in Ingersoll, are considered a virtual 
certainty. GM Vice President Mark Hogan told The Detroit News and 
the Detroit Free Press in stories Thursday that construction could 
begin as soon as April. 
</P>
<P>
	They would be GM's first new U.S. plants in more than a decade  
and could launch a manufacturing revolution in the North American 
auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new assembly plant design, code-named Project Yellowstone,  
is based on what's known in the industry as modular assembly, in 
which preassembled parts clusters, such as an entire dashboard, are 
delivered to the plant by outside suppliers and installed on the 
chassis. 
</P>
<P>
	The suppliers typically are located near the plant, are involved  
intimately in the vehicle's design from the beginning, and deliver 
the parts modules as needed to the assembly line. In some cases 
overseas, the supplier workers take part in assembling the vehicle, 
too, though that is not anticipated in the North American 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, labor costs would be lower because fewer well-paid  
UAW assembly line workers would be needed while the suppliers, who 
generally pay less and often operate nonunion shops, can make the 
parts at lower cost than GM. The UAW is likely to demand GM's help 
in organizing its suppliers, however. 
</P>
<P>
	GM says changes in its small-car assembly operations are  
critical. The No. 1 automaker loses about $1,000 on each small car 
it sells in North America, but continues to produce them because 
they help it meet government-mandated corporate fuel-economy 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials have declined to comment on the talks or GM's  
plans. Both sides have been working behind the scenes to improve 
their damaged relationship since last summer's devastating UAW 
strikes in Flint. The talks initially are being conducted with the 
plants' union locals, though UAW leaders in Detroit are closely 
monitoring them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say the spirit's right. We're optimistic that  
we're going to have local agreements at both locations that will be 
key steps to us finalizing the decision,'' Hogan told the Free 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Hogan was unavailable for comment Thursday. He plans to  
give a major address on Project Yellowstone at the Automotive News 
World Congress in Detroit next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, GM Chairman Jack Smith announced that GM planned to  
bring modular assembly to North America but gave no details. GM has 
been working with the formula at a new plant in Brazil, a project 
Hogan spearheaded before he was named to head North American 
small-car operations in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's what is known so far about GM's modular plans for North  
America, based on interviews with GM officials and industry 
production experts: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Lansing plant, which now builds the Oldsmobile Alero and  
Pontiac Grand Am, will be designated for a new car-based sport 
utility vehicle off the Delta platform. A platform is the common 
chassis, powertrain and other major parts used for several models. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lordstown makes the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire.  
Like Lansing, its dated design means GM will need to replace it to 
accommodate a modular assembly line to make the next generation of 
those compact cars. 
</P>
<P>
	--The CAMI factory in Ontario, a joint venture with Japan's  
Suzuki Motor Corp., already has been designated the lead plant for 
the Delta program. It now builds the Chevrolet Tracker and Suzuki 
Vitara SUVs and the subcompact Chevy Metro and Suzuki Swift. The 
tiny Metro and Swift are poor sellers, so a new product is likely 
to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Delta platform will be the basis for the next generation  
Saturn small car; the Cavalier-Sunfire twins; a yet-unnamed 
``crossover'' SUV; an Astra coupe to be sold overseas under the 
Opel-Vauxhall-Holden brands; and the Zafira, a small minivan to be 
sold in Europe. Several GM plants around the world will make 
Delta-based vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- As they have so often before, Asia's top three  
stock markets followed a surge on Wall Street by moving higher 
themselves today, even though no one knows for sure whether the 
region's economic crisis is bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore and Hong Kong, the key indexes soared more than 3.5  
percent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei jumped 2.4 percent, but slipped as 
the day progressed, closing only a half a percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	These and many other Asian stock markets also had enjoyed a big  
rally on Wednesday, thanks in part to falling local interest rates 
and the successful launch of Europe's new euro currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But across the board, analysts and traders credited today's  
gains to the rally by the Dow Jones industrial average, which 
easily crossed the 9,400 and 9,500 thresholds for the first time 
Wednesday. It rose 233.78 points, or 2.5 percent, to finish at 
9,544.97, surpassing its previous closing record high of 9,374.27 
on Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also marked a continued turnaround from last fall. The  
Dow, which slid below 7,500 in early October, has now rallied more 
than 2,000 points, or nearly 28 percent, in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy days are here again,'' said Francis Lun, the research  
manager of Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dow has pulled Singapore and the rest of the Asian markets  
along,'' said one trader in Southeast Asia's city-state who spoke, 
as market officials often do there, on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that will continue is another question. Ever since the  
Asian financial crisis began in 1997, with wild fluctuations in 
currencies and stocks, the region's markets have often imitated 
good days on Wall Street, only to see their gains soon fade away, 
due to profit-taking and more bad economic news. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Index jumped 4.3  
percent, before closing the day up 52.91 points, or 3.6 percent, to 
1,1517.88. The recently modified index, which rose 5.7 percent on 
Wednesday, not only bypassed the closely watched 1,500 threshold, 
but also reached its highest closing level since April. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index also had a great day, rising  
459.77 points, or 4.5 percent, to 10,693.57, a seven-week high. In 
fact, the indicator has risen 9 percent since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the world's second largest economy, the Nikkei average  
of 225 selected issues rose 2.4 percent before lunch, but ended the 
day at 13,536.56, only 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Nikkei had enjoyed a 1.8 percent improvement.  
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Japan's markets have been troubled by the yen's big  
gains against the dollar, which hurt giant exporters such as Sony 
Corp. Wall Street's record performance first benefited the Japanese 
electronics giant today, which saw its stock rise for the first 
time in six trading sessions. But by the end of the day, Sony 
shares slipped back into negative territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Toward the end of 1998, many Asian analysts predicted that the  
region's crisis was showing signs of ending, including falling 
interest rates, stabilizing currencies, and signs of recovery in 
some of the hardest-hit economies, such as Thailand and South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	But others have said it's too early to tell whether the crisis  
is winding down. Some say that fund managers who have been plowing 
cash back into Asian stock markets in the past few months are 
nervous and could easily set off another market stampede by 
withdrawing.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Sex Harassment at Ford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found  
evidence that women were called sexually degrading names, groped 
and subjected to explicit graffiti at two Ford Motor Co. plants in 
the Chicago area. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency said it uncovered the evidence after hearing  
complaints from six current and former female workers at an 
assembly plant in Chicago and a parts factory in Chicago Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusions were contained in a commission document sent  
last month to Daniel L. Berger, an attorney representing the six 
women in their federal lawsuit against Ford. Berger said Thursday 
as many as 700 women were subjected to the harassment, although the 
EEOC did not specify a number. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings show that this is not only a problem that  
individual women are facing from a small number of co-workers but a 
large-scale problem within the second-largest car manufacturer in 
the country,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the class-action case brought by the six women,  
at least seven other current or former workers at the two plants 
have federal sexual harassment complaints pending against Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Scott Jensen declined to comment on the lawsuits  
but noted that the company has established a ``zero tolerance'' 
policy against sexual harassment and has dismissed or suspended 
employees at the two plants who have violated the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen added that Ford is in a ``conciliation process'' and has  
made proposals to the EEOC on how to improve its work environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency's conclusions suggest a pattern of behavior  
similar to what was uncovered in a Mitsubishi factory in Normal, 
Ill. Last year, Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of America Inc. 
paid $34 million to settle an EEOC lawsuit on behalf of female 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	John R. Rowe, regional director of the EEOC in Chicago, wrote in  
the document sent to Berger that there is ``cause to believe that a 
class of female employees'' was sexually harassed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invite the parties to join with the commission in reaching a  
just resolution of this matter,'' he wrote, adding that possible 
remedies include an agreement by Ford ``not to engage in unlawful 
employment practices'' as well as punitive action. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe declined to comment further Thursday and would not say  
whether the agency plans to sue the automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Ford paid a reported $1.5 million to settle sexual  
and racial harassment lawsuits brought by five women at the two 
plants in 1995. Ford also dismissed four workers and disciplined 
four managers.

	Senate Launches Impeachment Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist is being sworn  
in this afternoon to preside over the impeachment trial of 
President Clinton. Rehnquist will then swear in the 100 senators to 
act as a jury. After that, senators will hold a private session to 
discuss the framework for the rest of the trial. This morning, in a 
solemn prelude to the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 
years, House prosecutors delivered to the Senate the articles of 
impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
The two articles stem from Clinton's effort to conceal his affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

	Flynt Hustles Porn and Politics  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt says  
he wants to unmask the hypocrisy of the investigation into 
President Clinton. Flynt says he has enough sexual evidence to 
publish an embarrassing expose on a ``big fish'' Republican. Flynt 
said he will make the disclosure next week at a news conference and 
described his victim only as a GOP House member who has been a 
strong critic of Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- About 50 Tibetan protesters rushed into  
the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi today, shouting pro-independence 
slogans. They scattered before police could react. The protesters 
from the Tibetan Youth Congress also burned the Chinese flag in 
front of the embassy in New Delhi's normally calm diplomatic 
enclave. The group has taken a more extreme position than Tibetan 
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.

	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres  
Pastrana and Colombia's largest guerrilla group initiated peace 
talks today in this steamy southern town. Legendary rebel leader 
Manuel Marulanda surprised the nation by failing to attend. The 
no-show by the 68-year-old chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia, or FARC, cast a disappointing pall over what had been 
billed an historic encounter between the 44-year-old president and 
the guerrilla chieftan.

Hombach will make his visits at the end of the month, government 
spokeswoman Charima Reinhardt said today. Before taking office in

<HEADLINE> Madam Had 20,000-Name Client List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON WOODS, Mich. (AP) -- The City Council has decided to  
release the client list of the ``Huntington Woods Madam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If only she had kept a little black book.  
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000 names are contained in boxes of papers, receipts,  
Rolodex cards and a computer hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The records were kept by 33-year-old Marci Devernay, who police  
say employed 25 male and female prostitutes. She pleaded guilty 
last month to racketeering and could get up to 20 years in prison 
at sentencing Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council decision came on Tuesday after The Detroit Free  
Press threatened to sue the city for the records' release. The Free 
Press had already sued the Oakland County prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The records can't be released until next week, Police Chief  
Steve Fairman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to review all the materials to see what we can release  
in compliance with the law, and determine what the cost will be, 
which the press may be responsible for,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairman said the release will involve extensive photocopying and  
sorting and will probably cost hundreds if not thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a lot of records here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Free Press managing editor Carole Leigh Hutton said the  
newspaper wants to ``evaluate the list for its importance to the 
case and determine whether any part of it should be printed in the 
newspaper.''

<HEADLINE> Discounts Boost Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deep discounts right before and after Christmas  
finally inspired shoppers to spend enthusiastically, and that burst 
of buying lifted December retail sales from disappointing to 
respectable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounters fared the best during the holiday season, thanks to  
their affordable prices and wide selection. Specialty stores also 
reported healthy sales gains, especially home furnishing and 
clothing chains. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest retailers announced their monthly sales  
figures today. The weakest numbers came from department stores, 
including moderately priced chains like J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and 
Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a tough start, things really shaped up at the end of the  
month, and for many retailers, the results were even better than 
expected,'' said Joseph Ronning, a retail industry analyst at Brown 
Brothers Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
	Expectations had run high for Christmas, with many analysts  
predicting that sharp gains on Wall Street and a strong U.S. 
economy inspiring shoppers to spend freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But merchants started worrying shortly after Thanksgiving.  
Weather was their biggest obstacle, as a warm spell in the first 
weeks of December dampening sales of winter merchandise, from snow 
shovels to cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also clear that consumers were only going to buy when  
they thought the price was right -- and many were willing to wait 
until they spotted big discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Right before Christmas, retailers began marking merchandise down  
heavily -- especially on winter goods -- and shoppers finally began 
packing the stores. That surge in buying continued the week after 
Christmas, when there were even steeper price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that this season was made at the end,'' said  
Jeffrey Feiner, managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But December's sales gains came with a price. A number of  
merchants -- especially the department stores chains -- put their 
profits in jeopardy by taking unplanned markdowns on winter 
merchandise to clear out their inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney warned today that its fourth-quarter earnings will  
be lower than Wall Street analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounter Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported  
sales from stores open at least a year rose 9.4 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales were up 15.8 percent. Sales from stores 
open at least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the 
most accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.3 percent, total sales down 1.8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 4.2 percent, total sales up 6.2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 7.6  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 8.3 percent, 
total sales fell 4.3 percent. J.C. Penney's 1998 figures do not 
include the results of Thanksgiving weekend. A year ago, that 
weekend was tallied in the December results. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 6.5 percent, total sales up  
11.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 5.7 percent, total sales up  
4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 4.4 percent, total  
sales up 8.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 4 percent, total sales fell 2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 19 percent, total sales up 41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Couch Hopes Browns Take Him First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Tim Couch once picked Kentucky over football  
powers Penn State, Tennessee and Florida so he could prepare 
himself for a career in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	He's now choosing Cleveland over Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch announced Thursday that he would skip his senior season  
with the Wildcats for a chance to quarterback the expansion Browns, 
who own the No. 1 pick in April's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In two seasons in Kentucky, Couch shattered school records while  
taking a doormat program to its first New Year's Day bowl game in 
nearly a half-century last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably won't sound true,'' he said when he announced  
his decision. ``But to be honest with you, one of the big reasons I 
came to Kentucky was I thought I was going to have a chance to be a 
top pick in the NFL draft one day and I said, `What comes along 
with it?' And what comes along with it is rebuilding a franchise 
and having the franchise squarely fit on my shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the same responsibility with the new Browns.  
</P>
<P>
	And now that Couch has made up his mind, the Browns have to make  
up theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Cleveland pick Couch? Or should the Browns make Texas'  
Ricky Williams their running back? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's announcement Thursday that he would bypass his final  
college season for the NFL gives the Browns a wonderful problem 
with many potential solutions. Unfortunately, the league will not 
permit the team from publicly discussing any of them just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams are prohibited from commenting on any of the underclassmen  
who have declared themselves eligible for the draft until the 
league office has released a finalized list of players on Monday, 
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Browns, who seemed poised to talk about Couch's situation  
until suddenly clamming up Thursday afternoon, won't be heard from 
until next week. That will give football-crazed Cleveland fans at 
least another weekend to debate Couch vs. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Browns can't talk about Couch, the All-American  
talked about the possibility of playing in Cleveland for the team 
he grew up rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got no guarantees, but I have a chance to play for one of  
the great organizations in all of sports,'' he said. ``They have 
some great owners and they're committed to winning games. Hopefully 
I'll be fortunate enough end up in Cleveland, but if I don't I'll 
just have to make it somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his announcement in Lexington, Ky., Couch flew to  
Cleveland on Wednesday night and had dinner with former 49ers great 
Joe Montana, his boyhood hero. Montana worked with Browns president 
Carmen Policy in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me if I was fortunate enough to end up in Cleveland,  
Carmen Policy's a 49er guy, he's going to run things the right 
way,'' Couch said. ``Dwight Clark is there too, he's a 49er guy, 
they're going to build a great organization and I just hope that 
I'm fortunate enough to be with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch admits he was an easy sell for Montana.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just trust the guy,'' Couch said. ``He could probably sell  
me some of that snow outside right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Couch appears to have everything the Browns would  
want in a quarterback: size, arm strength, mobility and touch. He's 
the best of an exceptionally deep class of quality quarterbacks 
who'll be available this spring. The group, which includes Cade 
McNown of UCLA, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse, Dante Culpepper of 
Central Florida and Akili Smith of Oregon, are all expected to go 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he is eager to meet with Policy and Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations, in the next few days. 
He wants to begin showing them that the Browns' future should begin 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just really try to sell myself to them from here until  
April and try to convince them that I should be the person they 
build their franchise around,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyeing 2000 Budget Jump Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to fashion a record of legislative  
achievement, House and Senate Republicans are trying to reach an 
early, broad consensus on a fiscal 2000 budget that would include 
wide-ranging tax cuts of perhaps $500 billion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,  
chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees respectively, 
met privately Tuesday and agreed that the coming year's fiscal plan 
should set aside money for bolstering Social Security and cutting 
taxes, participants said. The two hope to meet again later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He indicated he wanted to do Social Security and a tax cut.  
I'm very encouraged,'' Kasich said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no agreement on specifics, which both sides agree will  
be difficult to achieve and is at least weeks away. But the effort 
underlines GOP hopes of moving an aggressive agenda this year to 
please the party's conservative and business supporters, and to 
counter Democratic arguments that Republicans are obsessed with the 
impeachment of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans were so divided over the size and  
type of tax reductions last year that Congress approved no major 
tax cuts, and no budget resolution for the first time since the 
current budget process began 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans still must decide which taxes they would cut, how  
deeply, and whether the reduction would be paid for entirely out of 
budget surpluses or with some savings from spending cuts. One 
Senate GOP aide said a $500 billion, 10-year cut was ``in the 
ballpark'' of what was being considered, but said it was too early 
for decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Resolving their internal stalemate would be a major breakthrough  
for Republicans. Without congressional approval of a budget 
resolution for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, Senate opponents 
of a tax cut can filibuster. That would force tax cut supporters to 
win the votes of 60 of the 100 senators to prevail, a tough margin 
to achieve in a chamber Republicans dominate by 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement would also be a plum for the new House speaker, Rep.  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wants Congress to approve a budget 
resolution by April. That resolution is a non-binding map of 
spending and tax plans that guides lawmakers' fiscal work for the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican budget analysts say they expect help from new  
projections of federal surpluses due at month's end from the 
Congressional Budget Office, Congress' official budget analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the budget office is likely to project a surplus for  
the next decade surpassing the $1.55 trillion it projected last 
July. That could make it easier for some moderate Republicans to 
break with Clinton's call to prepare Social Security for retiring 
baby boomers before the surplus is used to pay for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Wednesday, Clinton announced that the fiscal 1999 surplus  
is expected to be at least $76 billion, well above the $54 billion 
the administration projected in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to unveil his own $1.8 trillion spending plan for  
2000 on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a budget last spring calling for $101 billion  
in tax cuts over five years, while the more moderate Senate's 
version allowed $30 billion in reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Kasich, a potential 2000 presidential contender, has  
called for a 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut, which 
would cost the government more than $700 billion over 10 years. He 
acknowledged Thursday that a reduction of that size would be 
``difficult to maneuver'' through the House, where Republicans 
start this year with a narrow 11-seat majority.

<HEADLINE> Walt Disney Studios President Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Stage and animation veteran Peter  
Schneider was named Thursday to the new position of president of 
The Walt Disney Studios, the Walt Disney Co. unit singled out by 
chairman Michael Eisner for its weak performance during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider had been serving as president of Walt Disney  
Theatrical Productions and Walt Disney Feature Animation, where he 
helped revive Disney's animation business with such films as ``The 
Little Mermaid,'' ``Aladdin,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The Lion 
King'' and ``Toy Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider, 48, will report to Joe Roth, chairman of Disney's  
recently consolidated studio operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney earned $1.1 billion from movies during fiscal 1998, but  
failed to make money on many of its films. In a letter to investors 
that was released Wednesday, Eisner blamed the weak results in part 
on high salaries paid to actors and directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In too many instances, profits did not materialize from the  
revenues achieved by our films,'' Eisner wrote. ``Stated more 
bluntly, either the films and marketing cost too much, or the 
audience rejected our ideas. Whatever the reason, we're glad '98 is 
over in this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Eisner said the company will attempt to boost its  
success rate by catering to family audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Schneider joined Disney in 1985 as head of its animation  
business. He was a co-producer in 1998 of a Broadway production of 
``The Lion King'' that won six Tony awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Disney, Schneider directed plays in New York and  
was managing director of Chicago's St. Nicholas Theater.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Air Its Side NextWeek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On what was expected to be its last day  
questioning the government's final witness, Microsoft planned to 
challenge an economist's conclusions that the company acted 
illegally to crush a rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft lawyer Michael Lacovara said he wanted to quiz  
Franklin Fisher of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology today 
on some key issues in its antitrust trial, such as questions about 
the price it charges for its dominant Windows operating system and 
its Internet browser software. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends the company bundled its browser free  
into newer versions of Windows -- and pledged to make its Internet 
software ``forever free'' -- solely to undercut rival Netscape, 
whose own popular browser competed directly with Microsoft's and 
once earned millions of dollars in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal antitrust law, part of such a legal claim includes  
the expectation that Microsoft eventually would raise its prices 
once it dominated the market. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Fisher told the judge that Microsoft spent  
``hundreds of millions of dollars'' to develop its browser and that 
it set its pricing ``for the explicit purpose of depriving rivals 
of revenues needed to be viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, however, maintains that it never planned to earn  
money selling its browser but that it would profit from advertising 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That (explanation) appears to have been invented in the middle  
of this trial,'' Fisher charged today. ``As far as I know, there 
are no documents that say, 'We are doing this for the ancillary 
revenue.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara said he will finish questioning Fisher later today.  
Microsoft will begin calling its witnesses -- starting with MIT 
economist Richard Schmalansee -- next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, the judge dramatically injected himself into  
the case. He interrupted the questioning of Fisher to ask about 
statements by America Online's chairman that its planned purchase 
of Netscape won't alter Microsoft's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusual exchange was a clear illustration of the judge's  
deep unease about how the pending $4.2 billion AOL-Netscape deal 
might affect the competitiveness of the nation's computer industry, 
the main issue in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that the deal, announced in November weeks into  
the trial, illustrates that the computer industry remains viable 
and thus suggests that government intervention isn't needed to 
ensure competition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the interview published Wednesday in The Washington Post,  
AOL Chairman Steve Case said: ``AOL's merger with Netscape has no 
bearing on the Microsoft case. ... I have a lot of respect for 
Microsoft. I continue to live in fear of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that, starting in mid-1995, Microsoft  
sought to crush Netscape in part because it feared the popular 
browser might one day displace the importance of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL is the world's largest Internet provider with more than 15  
million subscribers. So, a decision by AOL to distribute Netscape's 
browser software could dramatically boost Netscape's now-flagging 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacovara had been questioning Fisher about AOL's purchase of  
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have some relevance,'' said Fisher, who called the  
deal a ``hopeful sign'' of renewed competition. But he said: ``It 
won't have changed the fact that Microsoft took actions to reduce 
the threat from Netscape's browser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson interrupted, saying  
he had read Case's comments, and briefly recessed the trial to find 
a copy of the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Case told the newspaper: ``We have no flight of fancy that we  
can dent in any way, shape or form what is a monopoly in the 
operating system business. ... It's hard to imagine that PCs won't 
be the dominant way people connect with the Internet for many years 
to come, and Microsoft has a pretty amazing lock on that 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson read aloud several paragraphs, then turned to the  
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I have of you is ... is this consistent with your  
understanding of what the impact of the consortium will be, insofar 
as developing viable competition?'' the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher replied: ``It certainly is.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson is clearly preoccupied with Netscape's purchase. Last  
month, in remarkably candid comments, he said the deal ``might be a 
very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL currently distributes Microsoft's browser software to its  
subscribers in exchange for Microsoft prominently including AOL's 
software within Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has indicated he will continue to distribute Microsoft's  
browser to AOL subscribers, but Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates 
recently said he expects AOL to distribute Netscape ``sooner or 
later.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors Look To Deal Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The NBA lockout may be settled, but the  
Golden State Warriors still have a dilemma -- Latrell Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry St. Jean, the team's general manager, is looking to trade  
Sprewell as quickly as possible and confirmed talks with several 
teams around the league -- but would not name them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't hid the fact that we're going to make a deal as  
fast as we can for Latrell,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hopes to get at least two quality players for Sprewell,  
who choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a practice session 
Dec. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors immediately terminated the remainder of Sprewell's  
three-year contract, worth as much as $24 million, and the league 
imposed a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	But an arbitrator later reinstated Sprewell to the team and cut  
his suspension to the 68 remaining games of the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we do get two people to come in, they're not going to be  
the 11th and 12th guys on the roster,'' St. Jean said. ``We think 
they're going to be guys who can play, guys that have good careers, 
and have been with good teams. We're going to feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo downplayed the choking incident but when asked if  
there was a chance of keeping the three-time All-Star, he said, ``I 
think anything is possible, but it would be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors' other concern is signing Antawn Jamison, the North  
Carolina forward they acquired with a draft-day trade. Carlesimo 
hopes Jamison can help the team turn around its dismal 19-63 record 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors don't figure to have much room under this year's  
$30 million salary cap to pursue free agents.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout Hurt Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some NBA cheerleaders had to flash their moves at a bar mitzvah  
instead of a basketball game. Around dormant arenas, empty sports 
bars closed early and parking attendants sat around in vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
	These hardships, felt in small doses around the country, are the  
most significant economic effects of the 6-month NBA lockout that 
will end with an agreement reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that while the lockout may have caused steep  
losses for individuals and small businesses, the overall economic 
impact wasn't significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout might determine where people in Chicago drink  
beer. But it clearly doesn't affect how much beer they drink,'' 
said Allen Sanderson, a sports economist at the University of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cities, economists said, the NBA lockout was the  
equivalent of a big department store closing temporarily -- 
employees and nearby businesses would be affected, but consumers 
could certainly find somewhere else to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson is part of a group that shares Chicago Bulls season  
tickets and would have attended two or three games by now. ``But 
we've just gone to more movies, we went to concerts more often, 
probably spent more on Christmas gifts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	True enough, but some who depend on basketball directly for  
their livelihood were still left scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Laker Girls, who would normally be working on their halftime  
routines, were instead banking on various public appearances -- 
including one fan's bar mitzvah several weeks ago. Each Laker Girl 
has lost thousands of dollars, despite the $75 per hour they get 
for these special events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not like the players,'' said the squad's director, Lisa  
Estrada. ``This has always been part-time work, and most of the 
girls either go to school or have other jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Mayor Edward Rendell is trying to lure people  
to city hotels for Valentine's weekend to make up for the loss of 
the NBA's All-Star Game next month. This week, the city launched a 
promotion called ``Love Is More Than a Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the league has salvaged its season, the All-Star  
Game remains canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street from Milwaukee's Bradley Center, home of the  
Bucks, the Legends sports bar had cut most of its full-time staff 
down to 20 hours a week during the lockout, manager Kathie Taglieri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't keep them here just to help them out, because we're  
also hurting,'' Taglieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday when the Bucks should have been playing the Golden  
State Warriors, the bar closed two hours early because there was 
only one customer. Usually, 300 to 900 people come before and after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, the Diamond Parking lot across from the Delta  
Center has been empty instead of pulling in the usual $10 to $12 
per car for its 100-space lot on game nights. ``The only existence 
for that location is for the Jazz,'' manager Damon Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the damage has been mostly local, the lockout has had  
some broader impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters have been forced to fill air time with movies and  
other sporting events such as golf and skiing, which are much less 
attractive to most advertisers. NBC replaced the Knicks-Bulls game 
on Christmas Day with another showing of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' 
the Jimmy Stewart classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports, which have national rights to broadcast  
NBA games, and Fox Sports Net, which has local cable rights to 26 
teams, have yet to disclose how much the lockout will cost them. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports will each be reimbursed by the league --  
either financially or with replacement games. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball shoe sales were already off before the lockout but  
the slump deepened as NBA games were canceled. Nike Inc. chairman 
Phil Knight compared the lockout to a fashion designer losing one 
of its major runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike will now resume its payments to NBA stars that endorse its  
shoes, which had been suspended last month because of the lockout, 
said spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely thrilled that the runway is open again,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike shares soared $2.93 3/4 to close at $43.62 1/2 Wednesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Competitor Reebok International Ltd. 
gained 56 1/4 cents to $16.25.

<HEADLINE>  Atypical End to Atypical Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- These weren't your typical union workers coming  
to ratify a contract. Then again, it wasn't a typical lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 NBA players descended through a sea of cameras,  
tourists and workers on lunch break Wednesday to learn details of 
the proposed deal that brought an end to a nasty six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wore white furs, leather jackets and diamond stud  
earrings along with the big blue buttons urging unity between the 
NBA and the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans squealed at the sight of Shaquille O'Neal and Charles  
Barkley. And commissioner David Stern came to try to heal the 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all family again,'' New Jersey's Jayson Williams said.  
``Guys are wearing buttons with `Solid' written on them, showing 
both sides are together again. This game won't have to go through 
something like this again for seven more years. And hopefully, I'll 
be retired then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who flew in from all over the country late Tuesday and  
early Wednesday woke up at their hotels expecting to go to their 
union's law office next to the famous FAO Schwarz toy store to vote 
on whether they supported the negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But as they shuttled over to the General Motors Building, where  
the lobby looks less like a union hall and more like Kenny 
Anderson's garage before the lockout forced him to reduce his fleet 
of luxury cars, they began to hear news of a deal from fans and 
taxi radios. 
</P>
<P>
	From the scores of fans desperately seeking autographs from any  
player -- from Kobe Bryant to Austin Croshere -- it appears as if the 
hard feelings over the lockout will end someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the players know that it will take more than  
rim-rocking dunks and ankle-breaking crossover dribbles to win back 
NBA fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I don't care,'' said one fan while checking out  
his loot of autographs. ``I'll watch because I'm a basketball fan, 
but I'd rather watch college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't blame fans who might be bitter about a dispute  
over how to divide $2 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably will be lukewarm at first and some may be  
hostile,'' Chicago's Steve Kerr said. ``I can't blame them one bit. 
They are the ones who suffered the most during this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the players in the 25th-floor conference room was  
calm as they gathered for their ratification vote -- in sharp 
contrast to the divisions that built among factions of players the 
last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a contentious vote over whether players supported  
their union, they voted on whether to approve the new deal. It 
passed, 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Williams, one of the union's biggest critics, talked  
peacefully with union president Patrick Ewing and negotiating 
committee member Alonzo Mourning -- whom Williams criticized for the 
union's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the players ratified the proposal, Stern and deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik arrived to begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that both sides had to make concessions if we  
wanted to play again,'' said Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a 
second-year player who stands to lose millions of dollars under the 
deal. ``Regardless of how much I make, I'm making more money than I 
could ever without playing. It's good to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the only outward sign of a labor dispute was when  
locked-out ABC technicians tried to disrupt interviews by 
replacement crews by holding flyers in front of cameras and yelling 
``Don't talk to ABC scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of their dispute, because I have my  
own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Clippers Trying To Get Act Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As usual, the Los Angeles Clippers are having  
trouble getting their act together. 
</P>
<P>
	With the start of the NBA's abbreviated season less than a month  
away, the long-suffering Clippers don't have a coach and won't have 
their center when the season starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clippers vice president Elgin Baylor, however, isn't worried. He  
says a new coach will be named soon, and rookie center Michael 
Olowokandi will be flying in from Europe the middle of next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to be able to name the coach at the beginning of next  
week. We're down to three (candidates),'' Baylor said Thursday, 
several hours after the NBA lifted the gag order it imposed on team 
officials during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	He confirmed that the three finalists for the job are former  
Clippers assistant Jim Brewer, former Sacramento Kings coach Eddie 
Jordan and former Milwaukee and Boston coach Chris Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer is considered the front-runner for the job left vacant  
since Bill Fitch was fired after four seasons, but Baylor would say 
only, ``He's one of the candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had further interviews scheduled, Baylor replied,  
``I've talked with the candidates and there are details to be 
worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the season starts on Feb. 5, the Clippers will be missing  
the center they made the first player taken in the last NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, a 7-foot-1 Nigerian who grew up in England and has  
played competitive basketball just three years, is in Europe after 
signing a short-term, $1 million deal with an Italian team. 
</P>
<P>
	He has an escape clause that allows him to leave on Feb. 15.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be back on the 15th of February,'' Baylor said. ``I  
talked to his agent and he said he'd be on the first plane back 
(after fulfilling his obligation with the Italian team). 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking forward to coming back and playing in the NBA.  
It's unfortunate that it (Olowokandi's agreement to play in Europe) 
couldn't have happened a few days later, but he had to do it by the 
fourth of January.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor said he didn't resent the fact that Olowokandi went to  
play in Italy, adding that the difference in the European game 
should help the young center sharpen his outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Olowokandi, who played at the University of the Pacific,  
joins the Clippers, they probably will use Lorenzen Wright at 
center. He is a 6-11, 240-pounder who is more effective at forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lorenzen has played that position (center) before, and very  
well,'' Baylor said. ``But that's going to be the coach's 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor reiterated that the Clippers are in the market for a  
point guard. Darrick Martin and Pooh Richardson shared the job last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Clippers apparently are willing to let forward Loy  
Vaught, a cornerstone of the team the past eight seasons and the 
franchise's leading career rebounder, go as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor would not comment on Vaught's status.

own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Some Choose Digital Vanity Plates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Are you tired of that boring old e-mail address  
assigned to you by America Online or Earthlink? Perhaps you want 
something that reflects your passions, your interests. Perhaps you 
want an e-mail address with -- dare we say it? -- style. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, fans of the rock bands Kiss, Megadeth or performer David  
Bowie can have that stylish e-mail address by joining the official 
Internet service providers -- commonly called ISPs -- of the 
musicians. How do gene(at)kissonline.net or 
thrasher(at)megadeath.net sound? 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of it is being associated with something that means a lot  
to you, but it's a lot more than just a vanity license plate,'' 
said Bob Goodale, a founder of UltraStar in New York, the ISP 
affiliated with Bowie. ``I think it has a lot of it has to do with 
community, a community of like-minded people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For about $19.95 these ``like-minded'' fans get a custom e-mail  
address, Web storage as well as members-only access to special 
content from the performers, such as chat, concert footage and 
touring schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Bowie, Kiss and Megadeth, the Ohio Society of  
Certified Public Accountants, the alumni association of the 
University of South Florida and the financial services firm, 
Vanguard Group, all sponsor vanity ISPs. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicians and organizations don't actually operate the ISP.  
They market them and provide extra content while contracting out 
the technical side to existing providers, such as UltraStar. 
</P>
<P>
	It's now relatively simple for an ISP to set up a national  
network. UltraStar and other companies can set up generic services 
and then let the famous folks stamp their brand on the service.

<HEADLINE> SEC Sanctions Former Bond Attorney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Orange County's former top bond  
attorney has been sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission for negligence in reviewing issues prior to the county's 
1994 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Costanza knew or should have known about omissions and  
misstatements in bond-sale documents prepared for investors, the 
SEC said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Costanza helped bring $1.4 billion in county bonds to market  
during the summer of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The following December, officials disclosed that the county's  
main investment pool had lost about $1.6 billion and sought federal 
protection from creditors in the nation's biggest municipal 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Costanza, a partner in the New York law firm LeBoeuf Lamb Greene  
&AMP; MacRae, neither admitted nor denied the findings. By agreeing to 
a cease and desist order against further violations, she avoided a 
possible lawsuit or fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange County last year agreed to accept $45 million from  
LeBoeuf Lamb Greene &AMP; MacRae to settle suits over the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	As bond counsel, Costanza reviewed the bulky offering  
statements, assuring elected officials and investors that details 
were in order. She also signed an important opinion telling 
investors that interest on $564 million of the bonds was exempt 
from federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC said the bond statements misrepresented or omitted three  
important points: 
</P>
<P>
	-- The investment pool, which the county planned to tap to pay  
the bonds, was much riskier than the official statements indicated 
and was losing money in mid-1994; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The county failed to disclose that it legally could pay no  
more than 12 percent interest on variable rate bonds; some 
investors wouldn't have bought the bonds if they had known of the 
cap; 
</P>
<P>
	-- The tax-free status of the bonds was threatened because the  
county, on Costanza's advice, borrowed more tax-free money than 
federal law allowed.

<HEADLINE> New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Send your cards and letters now, before the  
price goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal rates increase Sunday for the first time in four years,  
raising the cost of the basic first-class letter to 33 cents, up a 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
	``After four years, we needed a small increase that was just  
enough to continue our investments to maintain quality customer and 
delivery service,'' said Frank P. Brennan, postal vice president 
for corporate relations. ``We have plenty of stamps and are ready 
to serve our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase takes effect despite four straight, highly  
profitable years for the post office, which says it needs added 
cash to buy equipment, cover rising costs and reduce outstanding 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Robinson of the National Minority Business Council,  
denounced the increase, charging that ``there is not one good 
reason'' advanced by the Postal Service to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the rate increase had been expected to take effect  
last summer, but it was postponed at the urging of the Postal Rate 
Commission and Congress, which noted the continuing strong profits 
being rung up by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office made a profit of $550 million for the fiscal  
year that ended in September, following three years of profits of 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the post office says rising costs are eating into  
income and it still faces some $4 billion in losses accumulated 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 33-cent stamps went on sale Tuesday, with first-day  
ceremonies in Los Angeles. It's the Chinese New Year stamp 
commemorating the year of the hare. In addition, there are millions 
of undenominated ``H'' rate stamps available at post offices to 
cover the 33-cent rate, as well as 1-cent stamps that can be added 
to leftover 32-centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail without enough postage will be delivered postage due. If  
the recipient declines to pay the extra postage the item will be 
returned to the sender. Most businesses refuse postage-due items. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials like to point out that their domestic price is  
a bargain compared to some other countries. For example, Germany 
charges 66 cents for first-class postage, Switzerland 65 cents, 
France, 53 cents, Italy, 48 cents and Britain 44 cents. On the 
other hand, the rate is 30 cents in Canada and 23 cents in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. stamp price goes up for the basic one-ounce  
letter, for heavier letters there is a one-cent reduction -- to 22 
cents -- in the charge for each additional ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	That means someone sending a two-ounce letter would pay 55  
cents, the same as at present. And a three ounce missive, say a 
long letter with some photos, would cost 77 cents, a penny less 
than current rates. The current rates took effect Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rates cover most types of mail. In other typical price  
changes a priority mail package will rise from $3 to $3.20; sending 
a local newspaper will cost 15.7 cents, up from 14.5 cents; the 
price to mail a national magazine will rise from 27.1 cents to 29.1 
cents and a basic parcel post package that cost $2.42 to send will 
rise to $2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate increase does have a somewhat complicated impact on the  
special stamp issued last year to raise money for research on 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp costs 40 cents and is valid for 32-cents postage, with  
up to 8 cents going to research. 
</P>
<P>
	That stamp will remain on sale for 40 cents, and starting Sunday  
will be valid for 33 cents postage, meaning that up to 7 cents will 
go to research for each stamp sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, breast cancer stamps sold before Sunday remain  
valid for just 32-cents postage and people using them after Sunday 
should add a 1-cent stamp to cover the new rate. But, practically 
speaking, the post office has no way of knowing then the stamp was 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's rate increase does not affect international mail.  
</P>
<P>
	An increase is expected in July for some mail going overseas,  
though for half-ounce letters to most countries the price is 
expected to remain at the current 60 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The only expected increase for a foreign letter will be for mail  
to Canada, which now costs 46 cents for the first half-ounce. That 
new rate has not been announced.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Landlord Admits Hiring Hit Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Talk about your heartless landlords.  
</P>
<P>
	Alvin Weiss pleaded guilty Wednesday to hiring a hit man to kill  
two of his tenants who had complained about conditions in their 
apartments. Weiss also admitted planning to set fire to one of 
their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other separate cases, Weiss also pleaded guilty Wednesday  
to forging a will that made him the beneficiary of his insurance 
broker's $400,000 estate and to tax fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss' tenants were not harmed after the hit man revealed the  
plot to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors portrayed Weiss, 46, as the ultimate slumlord,  
living in a $2 million home in Brooklyn while denying basic 
services to tenants living in the nearly 30 buildings he owns on 
Manhattan's Lower East Side. Some of Weiss' tenants, however, 
defended him after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss faces up to 14 years in prison when he is sentenced Feb.  
18 on the murder plot charges. He admitted bailing Eduardo 
Almestica out of jail in the summer of 1997 and paying him $4,000 
to kill Brigette Marx and Burnell Crawford, who lived in two of his 
rent-controlled apartments, by giving them fatal doses of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	When a tenant leaves a rent controlled apartment, the landlord  
is allowed by law to raise the rent charged to the next tenant. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder plots went awry when Almestica was nailed by police  
with the heroin. He revealed the plot and agreed to record a 
damning conversation with Weiss after police faked Ms. Marx's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	When Weiss was arrested, police found passports, bank books,  
securities statements, tax returns, driver's licenses and credit 
cards with different aliases. They also found several guns, boxes 
of ammunition and some $14,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second, separate case before another judge, Weiss admitted  
he perjured himself in order to cover up a bogus will scam. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss said he and two others were witnesses to the 1994 signing  
of the will of Abraham Thau, his insurance broker. Thau actually 
died in 1995 without leaving a will, prosecutors said, and the 
three men created one and filed it after his death. Weiss' passport 
and other documents show he was in Hungary on the date of the 
supposed will-signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss will be sentenced to up to one year in that case.  
</P>
<P>
	In a third case before a third judge, Weiss pleaded guilty to  
tax fraud and agreed to pay almost $700,000 in back taxes, fines 
and other penalties.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Still Says No to Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf reportedly  
made one more attempt to persuade Phil Jackson to coach the team. 
And once again, Jackson turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported today that Reinsdorf called Jackson  
on Wednesday to offer him a chance to return as head coach of the 
six-time NBA champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who left the Bulls after they won the championship last  
June, declined the offer, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls coach-in-waiting Tim Floyd said he wasn't aware of  
Jackson's response. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't talked to Jerry Krause or Jerry Reinsdorf yet  
today,'' Floyd said as he departed the Berto Center on his way to 
lunch today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about that, although that doesn't surprise me  
because that's what Phil said on several occasions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls have many players to try to sign before the season  
begins in February. That includes Michael Jordan, even though he 
has said he might retire if Jackson is not the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's agent, David Falk, said he's not sure when the world's  
greatest player will make a decision.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 86.51 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower at mid-afternoon after  
enthusiasm was dampened by a prominent stock analyst and Brazil's 
economic troubles heightened. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 86.51 at 9,458.46, clipping a New Year's rally that sent it up 
233.78 points Wednesday to a record 9,544.97. The Dow got as low as 
9,426.28, down 118.69, in early afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The market opened lower after well-known market bull Abby Joseph  
Cohen of Goldman Sachs recommended that investors trim their stock 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
	It got hit with another bit of bad news after it became widely  
known that Brazil's third-wealthiest state, Minas Gerais, had 
declared a 90-day moratorium on federal debt payments late 
Wednesday. Brazil, an important importer of U.S. goods, has been 
mired in an economic slump so severe it has required a $42 billion 
bailout by the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, broader stock indicators were lower as well. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.01 at 1,262.33. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 12.25 at 2,308.61, 
despite a huge rise in Internet-related stocks again today. The 
NYSE composite index , which closed at a record high Wednesday of 
611.01, was off 5.01 at 606.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by better than 2 to 1 on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 581.24 million 
shares, off from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying stocks had become too expensive, Cohen recommended this  
morning that investors trim the equities portion of their 
portfolios by 2 percent, to 70 percent from 72 percent, and at the 
same time add to their bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
	That would bring her recommended bond allocation to 27 percent  
from 25 percent earlier this week. As of earlier this week, Cohen 
recommended the remaining 3 percent of her model portfolio be put 
in commodities. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's comments didn't help bonds, which were lower on a weak  
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	One bright spot in the stock market was Internet stocks, which  
were flying high again on no particular news. In Nasdaq trading, 
Amazon.com was up 15 5/8 at 153 5/8. Lycos was up 5/58 at 71 5/8 after the 
company announced that it would provide an Internet connection 
function on IBM's new Aptiva personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a sign that investors' confidence in the economy  
may not be misplaced, the Commerce Department reported that new 
orders to American factories rebounded in November, rising 0.6 
percent to a seasonally adjusted $337 billion, following a 1.7 
percent plunge in October. However, workers filed a seasonally 
adjusted 350,000 unemployment claims during the week ended Jan. 2. 
That represented a drop of 22,000 but it only partially made up for 
a big jump of 83,000 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch Communication's shares were up 2 13/16 at 82 11/16 in  
heavy trading on the Big Board, following reports that MCI WorldCom 
was preparing a bid for the company, making a three-way bidding 
war, with Bell Atlantic and Vodafone Group. MCI's shares were down 
4 at 74 3/8 in leading Nasdaq volume.

<HEADLINE> Reducing C-Sections May Be Harmful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Aggressive efforts to lower the number of Caesarean sections in  
the United States could lead to more injuries and deaths among 
mothers and babies, obstetricians warned today in the New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion piece, four doctors at Harvard teaching hospitals  
in Boston said that pressure from HMOs and policymakers is leading 
some doctors to encourage women to try vaginal delivery even when 
the risks are higher than those of a C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstetricians said they are concerned about an increase in  
uterine ruptures, as well as injuries to babies caused by vacuum 
devices and forceps used during difficult labor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration recently reported a tiny but  
growing number of head injuries and deaths of babies caused by 
vacuum devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Uterine ruptures also are increasing, according to data from  
four states. Serious uterine rupture during labor, which usually 
occurs in women with previous C-sections, can lead to brain damage 
or death for the baby and loss of the uterus or death for the 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some parts of the country, some people have tried to  
mandate a trial of labor and not given women the option of a repeat 
Caesarean delivery,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chairman of 
obstetrics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ``There is 
enormous apprehension in the medical community about these mandates 
and approaches, for safety reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctors especially criticized a campaign coordinated by the  
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to bring the nation's 
C-section rate down to 15 percent by 2000, from a high of 25 
percent in 1988. In 1995, five years after the goal was announced, 
the rate was 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting a 15 percent target is an ``authoritarian approach to  
health care delivery,'' the obstetricians wrote. ``It implies that 
women should have no say in their own care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the Department of Health and  
Human Services, said the 15 percent goal was based on consultation 
with hundreds of groups, and is only a target, not a quota. He said 
studies have shown that hospitals can lower the C-section rate 
without compromising safety. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pointed out that studies show vaginal deliveries are  
safer than C-sections for most women, though vaginal deliveries are 
slightly riskier in women with a previous Caesarean. Also, women 
who deliver vaginally spend much less time in the hospital and 
generally recover more quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 15 percent goal has led health maintenance  
organizations to put a lot of pressure on hospitals to keep the 
number of Caesareans down, said Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, chief of 
obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, another one of the 
doctors who wrote the opinion piece. He said a low C-section rate 
is considered the ``gold standard'' of a maternity ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Many HMOs discourage C-sections by paying doctors the same  
amount for vaginal and Caesarean deliveries. Others pay a flat fee 
per mother, regardless of how complicated the birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some HMOs consider a hospital's C-section rate when deciding  
whether to include it in their networks, and doctors consider it 
when deciding where to refer patients, the obstetricians said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists did not  
sign on to the 15 percent goal ``because there is no adequate 
science upon which to recommend an ideal national Caesarean rate,'' 
according to the organization's director of practice activities, 
Dr. Stanley Zinberg.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Steel Report Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee chairman who favors free  
trade is urging President Clinton to stand firm against powerful 
unions that seek more aggressive actions to curb steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration planned to release a report today on its  
efforts to combat the rising tide of imported steel, White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Sources have indicated that a draft of 
the report is largely an update that stops short of outlining new 
policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was due on Tuesday. Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill.,  
chairman of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said 
Wednesday that he hoped the delay did not open the door for union 
interests to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``On an issue this critical to millions of U.S. workers and  
consumers and the U.S. and global economy, I urge you to stand firm 
by not putting politics before principle in your decision-making,'' 
Crane wrote Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the Asian economic crisis, imports into the  
United States reached record levels in 1998, resulting in thousands 
of layoffs and other cutbacks at steel mills across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and their unions already have filed  
formal trade complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, accusing 
them of illegally flooding the U.S. market with steel products at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the steel industry, saying more jobs could be lost by the  
time rulings are made this summer, also has asked the 
administration to initiate other forms of relief, including reviews 
that could lead to quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend that fulfilling the industry's request could  
undercut the administration's desire to promote free trade 
globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share a common agenda to boost jobs and economic growth  
here at home by opening markets for U.S. goods and services 
overseas,'' Crane said. ``We must remember that any action we take 
will set an example to troubled economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials insisted that the steel report could  
still be released this week. Officials attributed the delay to 
Clinton's desire to consult more fully with members of Congress. 
Clinton said he had a two-hour meeting on the issue Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has strong support on Capitol Hill among  
steel-state lawmakers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus,  
criticized the administration's inaction Wednesday. He said he 
would propose legislation to allow courts to step in to block 
imports sold below market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't stopped all the steel from coming in,'' Specter  
said of administration officials. ``They have the authority to stop 
it (through such means as) quotas. They haven't done that.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Futures Rally Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures prices continued their march higher Thursday  
on the New York Mercantile Exchange in what analysts say is a rally 
based on technical factors. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the strength of crude did not spill over to other  
segments of the energy market as natural gas prices fell in 
reaction to forecasts of warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures prices rose, frozen concentrated  
orange juice futures continued their tumble, grain futures were 
mixed and soybeans prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in crude oil was choppy, opening strong on  
follow-through buying from Wednesday's strong close, with the rally 
cut short by profit-taking at mid-session before recovering to 
finish higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifting crude oil higher were the weekly American Petroleum  
Institute inventory report, out late Tuesday, which showed a 14.9 
million barrel decline to 318.5 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	There is usually a drop in crude oil inventories at this time of  
year, according to analyst Tim Evans of Pegasus Econometric Group, 
who noted the decline was larger than normal. He said there is no 
explanation for the inventory drop, such as a decline of crude oil 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (inventory drop) may not indicate a shift in the supply and  
demand balance,'' Evans said. ``No refinery will have to curtail 
production as a result of a lack of inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures prices fell in reaction to the National  
Weather Service's' six-to-10 day forecast released Wednesday which 
calls for above normal to much above normal temperatures for the 
entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for February delivery was 29 cents higher at  
$13.09 a barrel; February heating oil was .06 cent higher at 35.79 
cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline was .43 cent higher at 
38.86 cents a gallon; February natural gas was .95 cent lower at 
$1.836 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices continued their  
plunge on New York's Cotton Exchange. Fund selling led the market 
lower, extending the losses from Wednesday's weak close. Reaction 
continues from a freeze in Florida earlier this week which did not 
cause serious damage to the orange crop. 
</P>
<P>
	March frozen concentrated orange juice was 2.10 cents lower at  
99.90 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures prices were higher and cattle futures prices were  
lower in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogs futures traded the limit-up on news the USDA will urge  
Congress to aid hog producers ravaged by low prices due to a glut 
of hogs raised and shipped to market. A small rebound in the prices 
meatpackers are paying farmers also gave a boost to futures prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures prices rallied on belief retailers may be  
forced to lower prices, which could spur increased consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	March live cattle were .45 cent lower at 61.72 cents a pound;  
January feeder cattle were .22 cent lower at 71.45 cents a pound; 
February lean hogs were 2 cents higher at 36.72 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 1.85 cents higher at 48.90 cents a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices settled lower on the Chicago  
Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor export sales figures pushed soybean futures prices lower.  
The U.S. Agriculture Department reports export sales for soybeans 
were slightly more than 216,000 metric tons. That is at the lower 
end of the 200,000 to 500,000 metric tons that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hurting soybean prices were weather forecasts for South  
America. The forecast calls for rain in southern Brazil and 
Argentina over the weekend, which is expected to help the region's 
soybean crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures prices were fractionally higher on  
better-than-expected export sales of 327,000 metric tons and the 
purchase by Egypt of 165,000 metric tons of hard red winter wheat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures for March delivery were unchanged at $2.87 1/2 a  
bushel; March corn was 4 cents lower at $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats 
were 1 3/4 cents lower at $1.10 1/2 a bushel; January soybeans were 8 3/4 
cents lower at $5.44 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Newsrooms Raided for Suspect Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Executives of Reno's three television stations  
and its newspaper are baffled following office raids by sheriff's 
deputies seeking copies of jailhouse interviews with an alleged 
freeway sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is that it's an illegal warrant. It violates the  
federal privacy protection act of 1980,'' KOLO-TV News Director Ed 
Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Washoe County District Attorney Richard Gammick said he  
requested search warrants Wednesday after observing media 
interviews with Christopher Merritt, the suspect in the shootings 
along Interstate 80 earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday, I was told that he had no intention to kill people.  
Today, I opened up the newspaper and there it is, right there, `I 
intended to kill people. I didn't care,''' Gammick said. ``In my 
mind, this is evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gammick said he was not ``declaring war on the media.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to make the media our agents. But it's my  
belief that once a newsperson goes up and interviews a defendant in 
the jail about the crime, they become a witness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt was arrested in Las Vegas late Monday, about 12 hours  
after allegedly shooting one man in the chest and hitting five 
other vehicles on the outskirts of Reno. No one was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Merritt initially said he wanted to shoot people so he could rob  
them after they wrecked their cars. In the subsequent media 
interviews, he said the shootings were a dress rehearsal for a 
cross-country odyssey of carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The original purpose was just to maim, injure and kill people,  
because I wanted to, I guess,'' Merritt told The Associated Press 
in an interview at the Washoe County jail on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That interview was tape recorded and videotaped by deputies.  
Gammick said he did not know if deputies handled those duties 
during media interviews on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno Gazette-Journal Editor Ward Bushee was dismayed by the  
appearance of the authorities, which led to what he called a 
``senseless showdown between sheriff deputies and newspaper 
people.'' He and Publisher Sue Clark-Johnson agreed to lock up its 
reporter's notes until a subpoena was issued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all wanted to avoid a confrontation no one wants to have,''  
she told reporters. ``We want to avoid deputies rummaging around 
the newsroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gammick said he resorted to search warrants because a subpoena  
can be served only after a court date is set; that hadn't happened 
by Wednesday in Merritt's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce said he turned over a copy of the interview with Merritt.  
He said the station's lawyer believes the district attorney's 
office, the sheriff's office and the officers themselves may be 
subject to legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	KRNV-TV sent a copy of its interview to Justice of the Peace  
Edward Dannan, who signed the warrants, and KTVN-TV gave a copy to 
its attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney John Ohlson, who represents KRNV, said he found the  
warrants constitutionally worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can tell you when you can go, when you can print, what  
you get to keep and what materials of yours they can take, they can 
tell you what you can put on the air,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Michele does `Homicide' Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Her smile would soften the heart of Saddam  
Hussein. Her willowy frame is a striking counterpoint to her 
masculine name. Her burning desire: to play roles that have nothing 
to do with her being drop-dead gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
	Recognition as a character actress? ``How badly I want that!''  
says Michael Michele. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as a regular on her dream show, ``Homicide: Life on the  
Street,'' she holds her own in a squad room with the likes of 
Richard Belzer, Yaphet Kotto, Callie Thorne and Clark Johnson -- 
superb character actors who, in stark contrast to Michele, look 
like everyday people. 
</P>
<P>
	The message she advances -- both as Rene Sheppard, a Baltimore  
homicide detective, and as Michael Michele, a star of this splendid 
crime drama -- is that a beautiful woman can rightfully claim a job 
without letting that beauty define her. In other words: ``How dare 
you! Because YOU think I'm attractive, I can't do the job?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in her native Manhattan recently to shoot a  
``Homicide''-''Law &AMP; Order'' crossover scheduled for the February 
sweep, Michele is spiffy in a gray pantsuit that sets off her mocha 
complexion (her mom is black, her dad white). 
</P>
<P>
	``Does she look like a cop? That's what we thought viewers would  
wonder when Sheppard was introduced,'' Michele says. ``So we 
addressed that issue at the start of the season. We showed how the 
men in the squad room related to her, what they would say -- 
`Ummmmm, baby!' -- and how she would respond to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've since worked beyond that ooh-la-la stuff.''  
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, ``Homicide'' takes Sheppard a giant step past ooh-la-la  
with the story arc beginning this week (Friday at 10 p.m. EST on 
NBC). 
</P>
<P>
	``We said, let's see what happens if she is doing her job  
effectively, efficiently, and gets caught in a very brutal 
beat-down,'' says Michele, clearly savoring the dramatic 
consequences. ``Then, after she gets out of the hospital, we get to 
see what happens to her psychologically back in the squad room, 
when those same men who were oohing and aahing see a woman who has 
been physically altered, at least for a little while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, she says, ``is why I fought so hard to be on 'Homicide.'''  
</P>
<P>
	The drama premiered in January 1993, and ever since, Michele  
says, ```Homicide' has been my shining star. `I gotta get on it,' I 
kept telling myself.'' She knew it was the ideal showcase for the 
kind of acting she wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's because ``Homicide'' defies assumptions. With  
veteran producer Tom Fontana and feature filmmaker Barry Levinson 
at the helm, it brashly -- sometimes perversely -- plays against 
type. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the cast -- TV's most ethnically and racially diverse --  
seems happenstance in its makeup. No tokenism here. No time for it: 
There are cases to clear, stories to tell. Meanwhile, leave it to 
``Homicide'' to sign a pretty face, then bloody it. Just chalk the 
whole thing up as initiation -- Sheppard's and Michele's. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Fontana does so brilliantly is get into the minds not  
only of the viewers, but of the actors,'' says Michele. ``When he 
wrote Sheppard, he totally played into that inner struggle that she 
has with others on the force -- being taken seriously, wanting to be 
able to do the job just as well as the next person. I think he 
recognized that this is an issue for me, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can, as my mom says, clean up when I need to,'' she says  
with a laugh. ``But I wasn't a cheerleader or the prom queen. I 
don't move through the world with a mirror in front of my face, and 
I've never been attracted to projects that had an emphasis on what 
I look like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She got them anyway. Maybe you remember Michele from her  
recurring role as J.C.'s girlfriend on ``New York Undercover.'' Or 
as glamorous gallery owner Nikki Sheridan on the short-lived 
prime-time soap ``Central Park West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, she did commercials for Clairol and Kentucky Fried  
Chicken (or was it Burger King?). 
</P>
<P>
	But a year ago, she heard about a sort-of casting call at  
``Homicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were thinking about bringing on one or two new characters  
-- not specifically a woman or a man -- or maybe no one at all.'' She 
rolls her eyes at the vagueness. 
</P>
<P>
	She made an audition tape. Months passed. Finally she got her  
meeting with Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing I said to him was, `Look, I've waited SIX  
YEARS to be on the show. I know this show. I know what I would have 
to deliver to be on this show.' And then it started to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been much easier to go to Hollywood,'' Michele  
says, her thumb stabbing the air past her shoulder. ``Maybe get on 
a sitcom or some splashy action show. But I said, `No, no, no.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The next moment, she could have been speaking for Sheppard as  
well as herself: ``The worst thing in the world is to have to live 
by another person's idea of who you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	`48 HOURS: In 1979, Donald Miller, a criminal justice major at  
Michigan State University, was sentenced to 30 to 50 years for rape 
and attempted murder. But he was suspected of four other unsolved 
murders. In an unusual plea bargain, Miller agreed to work with 
police to recover his memories. The deal? Were he successful in 
remembering, Miller would plead guilty only to manslaughter charges 
and no additional time would be added to his sentence. ``48 Hours: 
The Killer Next Door'' picks up the story today with the 
possibility of Miller's release into society, and with the victims, 
their families and prosecutors -- all convinced that Miller will 
kill again. ``48 Hours'' airs tonight at 10 p.m. EST on CBS.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Decline / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 6.79 percent this week, down from 
6.83 percent last week, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 30th consecutive week that the average remained below  
7 percent. It reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early 
October. Its peak for 1998 was 7.22 percent in late April. 
Economists expect it to remain low this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Low mortgage rates continue to help the housing industry  
thrive,'' said Freddie Mac economist Robert Van Order. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 6.43 percent this week, down from 6.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.61 percent, down from 5.63 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged around 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of 
mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Web Site Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Abortion doctors listed as ``baby  
butchers'' on a Web site that reads like a wanted poster live in 
constant fear for their lives, attorneys said Thursday in a case 
accusing the site of being an invitation to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just like bounty hunters of the Old West, the defendants want  
to stop the doctors by any means -- dead in their tracks,'' said 
Maria Vullo, who represents a group of doctors listed on the site 
called The Nuremberg Files. 
</P>
<P>
	The site lists the names of hundreds of doctors who perform  
abortions, their addresses, their license numbers, even the names 
of their children. Those killed are crossed off. Those merely 
wounded are shaded in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers for the defendants maintained the site stops short  
of making outright threats and is merely a form of political 
protest protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case about the threat to kill or injure, which is  
simply not there,'' said attorney Chris Ferrara. ``Opinions? Yes, 
sometimes harsh. But no violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs, including Planned Parenthood and a women's health  
center, claim the site violates a federal law that bars activists 
from inciting violence against abortion doctors and their patients. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vullo noted that the site and a set of ``wanted posters''  
distributed by the site's backers stop short of making explicit 
threats, she said the message was clear in a pattern of ``posters 
and murders and murders and applause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site drew attention in October, when the name of Dr. Barnett  
Slepian was crossed off the list shortly after he was killed at his 
suburban Buffalo, N.Y., home by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
	Vullo noted that the site chronicles a doctor's personal  
history, property, physical appearance and wedding anniversary 
dates. And it invites readers to send in photos, videotapes and 
background data on doctors, their cars, their house, their friends 
and their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants have just gone too far, beyond the realm of  
protected speech,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants include the American Coalition of Life Advocates, an  
umbrella group for several anti-abortion groups nationwide, and 
Advocates for Life Ministries, a radical Portland-based group.

<HEADLINE> Japan Oil Refiner To Make Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Cosmo Oil Co., a major Japanese refiner and  
distributor, will cut 40 percent of its work force and reduce about 
20 percent of its assets under a four-year restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drastic steps will be taken to beef up cost-performance  
and remain competitive,'' Cosmo Oil spokesman Hozumi Tokita said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of gasoline and other oil products in Japan have fallen  
sharply in recent years, especially since the liberalization of 
gasoline imports in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the restructuring plan, Cosmo's payroll will be gradually  
reduced to 1,500 from the current total of 2,700 by March 2003. Its 
assets will be trimmed by $1.8 billion by the same date. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokita said the asset-reduction will be made through various  
measures, including the sale of real estate, the securitization of 
various assets and integration of related plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosmo, Japan's third-largest oil distributor after Nippon Oil  
Co. and Idemitsu Kosan Co., has current assets of about $10 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Tobacco Dealers Take On Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cigar and pipe tobacco dealers have asked  
the state Supreme Court to overturn a voter-approved tobacco tax 
that they claim pays for programs unrelated to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative narrowly approved last November raised state  
taxes on cigarettes by 50 cents a pack on Jan. 1 and added an 
equivalent tax to other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	The money -- $700 million a year -- will pay for a variety of  
programs related to early childhood development. The lawsuit filed 
Wednesday by the California Association of Retail Tobacconists said 
the efforts have no reasonable relationship to health problems from 
cigars and pipe tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday the  
childhood programs are ``designed to educate young people on the 
dangers of smoking and stop the cultivation of a fresh crop of 
smokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also said it is illegal to direct state funds to a  
commission not directly supervised by the governor or Legislature. 
One-fifth of the money will be distributed at the state level by an 
appointed commission. The other four-fifths will go to commissions 
in each county. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Legislature feels there's too much money being spent,  
they can't do anything about it,'' said the association's lawyer, 
Edward Lozowicki. 
</P>
<P>
	Connell said other state agencies such as the University of  
California receive state money without direct management.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Edwards Has Three Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Way back in a corner of the locker  
room, hidden and guarded on both sides by linemen, is the only 
regular member of the Minnesota Vikings with a Super Bowl ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, linebacker Dixon Edwards has three rings, miniature  
trophies from his days as a member of the Dallas Cowboys' 1990s 
dynasty. That's a big reason the Vikings paid $10 million to sign 
Edwards three years ago, the most they ever paid for a free agent 
from another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards hasn't always been worth the investment, and it's  
possible this season will be his last with the Vikings even though 
he has two years left on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, with the Vikings enjoying home-field advantage  
throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time since 1976, they 
hope Edwards' championship experience will help them through 
unchartered territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you flash a ring up and the players don't have one,  
they say, `Whoa, he's got one.' I mean, as soon as you do that you 
have credibility,'' defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said. ``And 
having three of them, you have a heck of a lot of credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards doesn't want to talk about the future. Taking the  
company line espoused by Brad Johnson, Jake Reed and other players 
whose futures in Minnesota are uncertain, Edwards said Thursday 
he'd address that issue whenever the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards talks freely about the past, and this season reminds him  
a lot of 1992, when the Cowboys were young and emerging and on the 
way to the first of three titles this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, it's a lot of guys that are very, very hungry and not  
knowing, very curious,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where he can help.  
</P>
<P>
	Although he's generally quiet by nature and has had an  
unremarkable season -- he is tied for eighth on the team in tackles, 
has no sacks and only one tackle for a loss -- he still knows what 
it takes to win this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys had home-field advantage during two of their three  
Super Bowl seasons and enjoyed first-round byes all three years. 
The Vikings' first-round bye this season was their first since 
1989, and they are the first dome team ever to have home-field 
advantage throughout the playoffs.

	Minnesota (15-1) opens the playoffs Sunday at home against  
Arizona (10-7) and is favored by 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys will feel it Sunday exactly what that means to have a  
week off, because you come in there fresh,'' said Edwards, whose 16 
postseason games are more than any of the Vikings. ``Just imagine 
having a bye week and another team not. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just struggling through training camp and everything, and you  
have a week off to prepare for them. I mean, that's the best way I 
can point to it. But that was huge, and then the whole home-field 
advantage is really huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of their first trip to the Super Bowl since '76  
-- and the first title in team history -- has become tantalizingly 
close for the Vikings now that the playoffs are under way. Edwards 
has helped his teammates understand they need two more victories to 
earn that trip to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys like to ask him what it's like to be in a Super  
Bowl, what it's like actually to be in that week,'' linebacker Ed 
McDaniel said. ``But you're talking about the Super Bowl. That's 
something we can't even see yet. We've got two more games. So 
everybody's excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Dixon has pretty much been telling us is you've got to  
take this and be calm, take it as any other game, but bring it to 
another level.''

<HEADLINE> Refs Angry at Knight's Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- College basketball referees angered by  
Indiana coach Bob Knight's suggestion that some officials bet on 
games are demanding he either prove his accusation or take it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He either needs to come forward with specific names and games,  
or he needs to retract his comments. This is outrageous,'' said 
Hank Nichols, the national coordinator for men's basketball 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight brought up the issue of referees betting on games in an  
interview last month with ESPN analyst and former Notre Dame coach 
Digger Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and I have always thought this,'' Knight told Phelps.  
``The most susceptible guy in any gambling scheme is an official, 
without any question. I mean, if we only knew the truth about games 
that were controlled by officials having gambling interests, I 
think it would be amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight would not comment further about the issue when contacted  
by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols said he has received numerous calls from officials  
throughout the country. He described them as irate and incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent 25 years as a college basketball official and I  
don't know one official who ever gambled on a game,'' Nichols said. 
``And all the people I've talked to don't know anyone either.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jet Lageman Must Watch on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Of all the games he's sat out and all  
the road trips he's missed this season, this week will be the 
toughest for Jeff Lageman of the Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are these the playoffs -- a time of year that has come  
around all-too-rarely for the 10th-year defensive lineman -- but the 
game is being played at the Meadowlands against his former team, 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Lageman has been on injured reserve since September with a  
biceps tear he suffered in the first quarter of the first game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a lot of fun to go up there and play in a  
playoff situation,'' Lageman said Thursday. ``It's their first 
playoff game in a long time. It would have been a great feeling. 
But that's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Coughlin told all 13 of the Jaguars on injured reserve  
this week that they would not be allowed on the sideline for 
Sunday's playoff game due to a request from the NFL to weed out 
crowds around the benches. So Lageman won't be around for the Jets' 
first home playoff game since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still love New York,'' Lageman said. ``We could go if we  
want to, but we just couldn't be on the sidelines. And I'm not 
going to go up just to sit in the stands up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he did, he would probably get a great reception.  
</P>
<P>
	Lageman was a favorite among Jets fans from 1989-94, leading the  
team in sacks for three of those seasons and playing with a dogged 
consistency that stood out in the days when the team was never 
better than mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	Some considered him the heart and soul of the Jets, and he gave  
everything he had in return. 
</P>
<P>
	His patience with the Jets ran out, however, when they fired  
Pete Carroll after the 1994 season -- a one-year stint -- and hired 
Rich Kotite in his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Lageman took the free agency route. And to show how serious he  
was about leaving, he chose the Jaguars, who were entering their 
expansion season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave everything I could to that organization for six years  
and I wanted to see it go in the right direction,'' Lageman said. 
``When I saw it wasn't, I wasn't going to sit there until the 
organization finally figured out they didn't make the right 
decision. So it was time to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be a great decision. While the Jets were  
suffering through 3-13 and 1-15 humiliations under Kotite, Lageman 
was becoming the cornerstone of a Jaguars team that progressed much 
more quickly than anyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
	He averaged about 60 tackles and four sacks a season and brought  
a leadership quality that Coughlin leaned upon heavily. After last 
season, Lageman signed a one-year contract, feeling this would be 
his final season and his last shot at a Super Bowl ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that dream is still alive for the Jaguars, it ended  
early for Lageman. 
</P>
<P>
	On just the fourth defensive play of the season opener against  
the Chicago Bears, he stuck his left arm out to tackle Edgar 
Bennett. Bennett's knee came up and popped him in the arm. The next 
day, Lageman was diagnosed with a biceps tear, an injury that takes 
4-6 months of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	During rehab, he has remained a steady presence both in the  
community -- performing charity work and hosting a weekly Jaguars TV 
highlights show -- and in the locker room, where a replacement for 
Lageman's leadership was never truly found this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been very resilient, he's done everything we've asked him  
to do,'' Coughlin said. ``I know this is a very tough week for him. 
Jeff would certainly want to be involved in this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next, the question is whether Lageman will come back for another  
year. It's one he has been reluctant to address all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing,'' Lageman said when asked about a possible return.  
``I haven't even thought about it.''

<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- After months of negotiating with the Vatican,  
Bishop Francis X. DiLorenzo is allowing hula and other Native 
Hawaiian ``sacred gestures'' to be performed during Roman Catholic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Rome banned these central elements of the Hawaiian culture from  
local churches earlier this year after a parishioner complained 
they were being used for entertainment, not worship. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo went to Rome last summer to appeal Hawaii's case. Now,  
with the Vatican's approval, the Honolulu bishop has issued new 
guidelines for allowing sacred gestures during Mass. They took 
effect Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Psalm 149 offers Scriptural support, saying, ``Let them praise  
his name in the dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacred gesture is a way for Pacific Islanders, Asians and  
those who have embraced the culture to worship as baptized 
Catholics,'' DiLorenzo said in directives mailed to all 66 parishes 
in the islands. ``For many, their cultural and religious experience 
are interwoven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo specifically avoided the word ``hula'' because other  
cultures here -- Asian, Filipino, Samoan and Tongan, for example -- 
use native expressions during Mass, diocese spokesman Patrick 
Downes said. Of the 1.2 million residents of Hawaii, about 730,000 
are Pacific Islanders or Asian. About 215,000 residents are 
Catholic, Downes said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200,000 people in Hawaii claim some Hawaiian ancestry.  
And it was the use of hula, a Native Hawaiian dance, at a Maui 
church that hatched the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hula uses the hands, body and feet to tell a story. Ancient  
Hawaiians danced for their kings in both religious and secular 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
	The dance now has been performed during all types of church  
services, including First Communion, weddings and funerals, by both 
men and women. It even was performed at DiLorenzo's installation as 
bishop in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The dance can be accompanied by religious chanting and the  
playing of native instruments such as the ipu, a drum made from a 
gourd, and the nose flute. 
</P>
<P>
	The hula performed during liturgies is not the same hula danced  
by women wearing coconuts, leis and grass skirts at the famous 
Kodak Hula Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Church hula is performed in the ``strictest, most beautiful,  
spiritual sense,'' said John K. Lake, a hula teacher for more than 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some movements are done in church only and wouldn't be done  
outside the church,'' Lake said. ``The dance changes according to 
the knowledge that's presented in the context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Maui woman was offended by a hula performance  
during Mass and complained to the diocese. She then took her 
complaint to Rome. The church won't release her name. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Sister Mary Lange of the diocese's Office of Worship  
told parish priests the Vatican said ``there should be no dance of 
any kind in the churches of the Diocese of Honolulu.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That touched a nerve among Hawaiians, whose language and  
cultural practices were banned by New England missionaries in the 
1820s. Hula was banned from public and private performances because 
it was considered ``enchanting,'' Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the missionaries, anything Hawaiian was debasing  
Christianity,'' he said. Hawaiian traditions ``were considered 
valueless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii newspapers also criticized the Vatican's ban.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, if the church is to continue to be relevant in an  
increasingly cynical age, it cannot keep itself at a distance from 
the people it serves by sending down orders that deny an important 
part of their culture,'' The Honolulu Advertiser said Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	DiLorenzo said the church's ban on dance within the liturgy  
remains in effect ``as entertainment has no place within the sacred 
liturgy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is allowed is sacred gesture -- defined as movement that  
expresses praise, thanksgiving, adoration, petition and penitence. 
It is permitted during designated Masses, at certain times in the 
ceremony and with appropriate attire that respects the liturgy, the 
congregation and the culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``This form of gesture is considered as a form of praying with  
one's whole being,'' DiLorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Advertiser on Dec. 29 praised the ruling, saying ``the  
church is promoting openness and inclusiveness in the best 
tradition of the Islands. Accommodation rather than fiat has 
thankfully carried the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Native expression and dance during Catholic services is used by  
churches in Africa and Oceania, and sometimes is performed for the 
pope. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this past November, barefoot, shirtless tribal people  
performed for Pope John Paul II during a Vatican synod for bishops 
from Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul told worshippers then that the church is ``searching  
for new impulses ... in the drive to announce the kingdom of Christ 
in the diversity of culture and of human tradition, social and 
religious, and in the marvelous multiplicity of their people.''

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 7.21  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A sharp, last-minute rally partially fueled by  
bank shares, pulled the stock market out of a slump today, slashing 
sharp losses to nearly nothing in the final 30 minutes of trading. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss 7.21 points at 
9,537.76. The blue-chip index had been down 50 points at 3:30 and 
off nearly 120 points in early afternoon. The market opened lower 
and stayed lower all day, as investors sold shares to extract 
profits from a sparkling three-day rally that took major indexes to 
record levels. The selling was encouraged by comments from Abby 
Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., a well-known bull, and from 
U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Alice Rivlin, suggesting that 
stocks were overvalued. It was also spurred by discouraging 
economic news in Brazil. Most broad stock indexes retreated from 
yesterday record levels. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.24 
to 2,326.10.

	Factory Orders Rise 0.6 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories rebounded in  
November, partially recovering from a sharp decline the month 
before, but analysts are watching a worrisome year-end spike in 
unemployment benefit applications. Factory orders rose 0.6 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted $337 billion, following a 1.7 percent 
plunge -- the sharpest in five months -- in October, the Commerce 
Department said today. It was the fifth increase in six months. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing 
applications for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 last week, 
partially recovering from the week before when claims recorded the 
worst increase in six years. A seasonally adjusted 350,000 jobless 
workers filed claims during the week ended Jan. 2, down from 
372,000 the week before.

	Late Buying Boosts Retail Sales

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Final sales figures from the holiday season  
released today showed that last-minute price slashing by merchants 
ignited a burst of buying that lifted receipts for the most 
important part of a retailer's year from disappointing to 
respectable levels. But there still were weak spots. Department 
stores, especially moderately priced chains like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; 
Co, continued to lose business to the discount chains. J.C. Penney 
Co. Inc. warned today that its fourth-quarter earnings will be 
lower than Wall Street analysts' estimates.

	Microsoft To Air Its Side Next Week  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft's questioning of the government's  
final witness in its antitrust case turned combative today over the 
software giant's promise to make its Internet software ``forever 
free.'' Microsoft's lawyer, Michael Lacovara, even offered to pause 
so the witness -- economist Franklin Fisher of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology -- could control his blood pressure. The 
government contends the company bundled its browser free into newer 
versions of Windows -- and pledged to keep its Internet software 
``forever free'' -- solely to undercut rival Netscape. Microsoft 
will start presenting its case next week.

	Bank Chief Happy With Euro Launch

<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Smiling but obviously tired, European  
Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg said today he was satisfied with 
the launch of Europe's new currency. He said there had been some 
``teething troubles'' resulting from human errors and sometimes 
human ignorance, but not structural problems. In all, he said, 
there were fewer glitches than expected.

	Singapore Outlook Seen Improving

	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Aggressive pro-growth policies, as well as  
signs of economic recovery in the region, have brightened 
Singapore's prospects to recover in the second half of this year 
and grow 3.5 percent in 2000, a report by Merrill Lynch says. The 
report, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires today, predicts that 
Singapore interest rates are likely to ``head for historic lows,'' 
which along with cost-cutting policies should speed recovery.

	FCC Reviewing Telecom Mergers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission hopes to  
decide the fate of three proposed telecommunications mergers within 
six months, the agency's chairman said today. The FCC is reviewing 
the planned mergers of AT&AMP;T Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc.; SBC 
Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp.; and Bell Atlantic Corp. 
and GTE Corp. It wants to determine whether the deals would serve 
the public interest.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's bankers, who suffered defeat in  
Congress in their fight with credit unions, took a federal agency 
to court today to challenge its new rule allowing more people to 
join the lending associations. The American Bankers Association, 
the industry's biggest trade group, said it was filing suit in U.S. 
District Court in Washington asking for an injunction barring the 
National Credit Union Administration from putting the new rule into 
effect.

	Morgan Stanley, Lehman Beat Outlook  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's investment banking firms shared in  
the spoils of the stock market's recovery at the end of last year, 
with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; 
Co. reporting profits that topped expectations. Morgan Stanley 
reported fourth-quarter earnings of $879 million, or $1.49 a share, 
excluding a one-time gain. The record profits dwarfed analysts' 
estimates of 96 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. Lehman 
Brothers reported fourth-quarter earnings of $74 million, or 51 
cents a share, more than twice the 21 cents analysts expected. The 
results, however, fell 60 percent from Lehman's quarter of $185 
million, or $1.30 a share, in 1997.

	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Attorneys for one of three men accused of  
dragging a black man to his death have asked to be taken off the 
case because their client has ignored advice and been 
uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	C. Haden Cribbs and his co-counsel, Brack Jones Jr., filed a  
motion seeking to withdraw from the case after their client, 
William J. King, refused to attend a pretrial hearing Wednesday. 
The judge could have forced King to attend but declined to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputy Curtis Frame testified that King, in a diatribe  
filled with curses and insults against Cribbs, said he had no 
intention of going to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	King, 24, is one of three ex-convicts facing capital murder  
charges in the June dragging death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd was beaten, chained to a pickup and dragged to his death  
along a rural road near Jasper. The three defendants are accused of 
killing the 49-year-old man because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy said prosecutors will  
fight Cribbs' motion because there are fewer than 10 certified 
lawyers in southeast Texas qualified to defend death penalty cases 
and Cribbs is one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
	King's trial is scheduled for Jan. 25. It was unclear whether  
the trial would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial dates have not yet been set for the other two defendants,  
Shawn Berry, 23, and Russell Brewer, 31.

<HEADLINE> Knee Complicates Rice's Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jerry Rice's surgically repaired left knee has  
held up just fine. It's his other knee that's causing problems now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier this week, I said to myself, `No way,''' said the  
49ers' receiver, who now expects to play in Saturday's divisional 
playoff at Atlanta despite continuing soreness from a partially 
torn ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in so much pain, I could hardly put pressure on it. But  
as the week is progressing, I'm starting to feel better. It's 
something I've endured, but it's really slowed me down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Rice, the NFL's career leader in touchdowns,  
receptions and yards receiving, missed most of last season when he 
tore ligaments in his left knee in the opener and then cracked a 
kneecap in his first game back 3 1/2 months later. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice earned his 12th trip to the Pro Bowl this season, finishing  
with a team-high 82 catches. But he has struggled in the last seven 
weeks since banging his right knee on the Georgia Dome's artificial 
turf Nov. 15 and causing the latest injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been in rehab for a year and a half,'' Rice  
complained. The partial tear won't heal completely until he has a 
chance to rest it after San Francisco's season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a very, very trying season for me,'' said Rice, who  
never missed a game gue to injury in his first 12 seasons. 
``There's nothing I can do. You say to yourself, `Why is this 
happening?' Because this is the type of year I really love. We're 
in the playoffs, where I can just go out there and have a good 
time, but it's been different this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Young, who set an NFL record with Rice when the two teamed  
up for their 80th touchdown Nov. 1 at Green Bay, said Rice has set 
such high standards that it's hard to live up to them while he's 
playing hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``His good knee now is the bad knee from last year,'' Young  
said. ``I think he's really done remarkably well, the catches and 
yards and everything, with what he's struggled with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait for him to get healthy, and I'm sure he can't  
either because he's still capable of being a dynamic, dominant 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice's frustrations were underscored last week against Green  
Bay. He couldn't shake free from coverage and was nearly shut out, 
making one catch on the last drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed he fumbled, although officials ruled him down.  
Four plays later, Young finished the drive in dramatic fashion, 
throwing a 25-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens with three 
seconds left to beat the Packers in the NFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just say I'm dealing with it,'' Rice said. ``I'm trying to  
rest and be smart about this, but I'll be there Saturday. I'm going 
to line up. Basically, if I am on the football field, I believe I 
can help this team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in recent weeks, that's been primarily as a decoy, drawing  
defensive coverage away from Owens, J.J. Stokes and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``They keep doubling me,'' Rice said. ``But when I'm out there  
running around on a football field, somehow I can block things out, 
even the pain and try to get the job done, so I'm hoping for the 
same thing this weekend.''

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Billy Andrade took on a regimented  
workout schedule during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been out of shape,'' he said. ``I just felt like  
once the season was over, I wanted to get fired up for this year, 
so I decided to just get in better shape. I did it for a better 
life than better golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got both in the first round of the Mercedes Championships  
after his 6-under 67 left him one stroke out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``A golf course like this, it really helps you,'' said of the  
hilly Plantation course at Kapalua Resort. ``I just think over the 
course of a year or a career, it can't do anything but help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrade, whose victory in the Canadian Open was his first since  
1991, certainly has good examples of what kind of rewards can be 
reaped from working out. David Duval lost about 40 pounds a couple 
of years ago and has seven victories since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only going to help down the road,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *O'MEARA MENU:* The Masters champions dinner figures to be an  
upgrade from cheeseburgers and milkshakes, but Sam Snead and Doug 
Ford might prefer to skip the appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara hasn't decided what he'll put on the menu this  
April, but he says it probably will reflect his Southern California 
roots -- fajitas with a good salsa, and maybe a little sushi to 
start things off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm leaning toward chicken and steak fajitas,'' O'Meara said  
at the Mercedes Championships. ``That's one of my favorite meals, 
and I don't think it's ever been on the menu before. It may be a 
step up from last year's menu (served by Tiger Woods). I think most 
of the past champions would go for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of months ago, O'Meara hinted that his choice of dinner  
would be Italian, another one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife suggested lasagna, but that's too bland,'' he said.  
``I want to do something a little different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the sushi?  
</P>
<P>
	``That could be a starter,'' O'Meara said. ``That's a very  
strong possibility -- a little tuna sashimi. I could see guys going 
for that, like Sam and Bob Goalby.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEW YEAR, NEW DEALS:* Jim Furyk used to play the Callaway  
clubs, wear the Callaway hat and carry a Callaway bag. He still has 
the irons and a fairway wood, but none of the logos. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk, who has won twice, had 28 top-10 finishes and earned $4.5  
million over the last three years, did not re-sign with Callaway in 
the offseason and instead took on a conglomerate of deals that 
allows him to play what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty comfortable with what I'm doing right now,'' he  
said. ``I'm not a guy who likes to tinker with clubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk recently signed a deal with Orlimar, and will carry its  
bag and use its headcovers, even though the only Orlimar club is a 
19-degree fairway metal. He has kept the Callaway irons (3-PW) and 
a Callaway 3-wood, but recently switched to a Titleist driver. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has a deal with the Johnnie Walker Clothing collection,  
which makes its debut this spring, to wear its shirts, pants and a 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
	Furyk's deals are typical of the direction several players are  
going at a time when the endorsement market is tight because of the 
downturn in the golf equipment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always see a lot of jumbling around, but I think you're  
seeing more players become more diversified,'' Mark O'Meara said. 
``Instead of signing with one company, they might be with two or 
three companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GLOBAL O'MEARA:* Mark O'Meara plans to play in several  
tournaments overseas this year, just like he has done throughout 
his 19-year career on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on his schedule is the Dubai Desert Classic, which  
he said was a direct result of his winning the Masters and British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy playing overseas, but it's a financial thing, too,''  
O'Meara said of the appearance fees. ``I'm not by no means a big 
draw, but by winning major championships there is a better demand. 
And when I do go overseas, I generally do well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara has won seven international events, including the World  
Match Play Championship last year in England when he rallied to 
defeat Tiger Woods, 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of his worldwide schedule isn't set, but it appears  
he'll play in Japan in the spring and in the fall, along with 
Europe on at least two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's time to get my own plane, but I can't afford it,''  
O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he doesn't really need one as long as he sticks with a  
certain neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got TWA -- Tiger Woods Airways,'' O'Meara said. ``I don't  
get any points, but the service is pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* The first shot of the 1999 season was struck by Steve  
Elkington, a driver to the middle of the fairway. The first birdie 
belonged to Steve Pate, and the first bogey to Elkington. ... Of 
the 30 players in the Mercedes field, 20 will stick around for next 
week's Sony Open in Honolulu. ... Local residents are having to buy 
tickets to a PGA event for the first time. The unofficial Kapalua 
International, which used to be played in November, and the nearby 
Kanaapali Classic, played at the end of the Senior Tour schedule, 
have always been free of charge.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Probe Receives More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors received nearly $80,000  
Thursday to help finance the grand jury investigation into the 
JonBenet Ramsey slaying through March. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes beyond that date, we will be back looking for more  
money,'' Assistant District Attorney Bill Wise said. ``It is not 
meant to predict when the grand jury is going to end'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the  
basement of her family's elegant home in Boulder. Authorities said 
JonBenet had a fractured skull and may have been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made. Police say her parents, John and  
Patsy Ramsey, remain under suspicion. The Ramseys have maintained 
their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury, whose work is kept secret, began meeting in  
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County, which funds the district attorney's office,  
approved the new money despite a bill for the case that already had 
reached nearly $390,000. It is the most ever spent by the office on 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city already has spent more than $1 million in its  
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Senate Faces First Day of Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist  
presiding, the Senate somberly placed William Jefferson Clinton on 
trial Thursday on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors in the 
first presidential impeachment in 131 years. The White House 
promised a ``compelling case'' for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's 42nd president -- and only the second to face a  
trial -- was at the White House when all 100 senators stood at their 
desks in the Capitol, raised their hands and swore to render 
``impartial justice'' in his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentous events unfolded as Senate leaders struggled for an  
elusive accord on guidelines for the trial, setting an 
extraordinary closed-door meeting of all senators for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is some common ground,'' said the Democratic  
leader, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Still, he and Majority 
Leader Trent Lott added there had been no bipartisan accord on the 
thorny question of whether to permit testimony by witnesses, a step 
Republicans favor and Democrats oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	No person now living had ever witnessed events like those that  
unfolded during the day in a hushed Senate chamber, a script 
written by the Founding Fathers two centuries ago and adapted now 
for the television age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye,'' announced James W. Ziglar, the  
Senate sergeant at arms, a few moments after 10 a.m. ``All persons 
are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment,'' he said, 
reading a proclamation used in a presidential trial only once 
before, in Andrew Johnson's case in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice,  
allegations that stem from his long campaign to cover up a sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The charges were brought in the 
name of the House of Representatives and ``of the people of the 
United States of America,'' intoned Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois 
Republican who led fellow GOP lawmakers into the chamber to 
formally present the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation tuned in on television, lines of visitors formed at  
the Capitol, and a lucky few dozen people got seats in the 
galleries overhanging the Senate chamber for the opening of the 
trial. ``I came here to show my support for the Constitution and, I 
guess, the pageantry of it all,'' said Todd Marks, a law student 
from Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an awesome responsibility,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,  
the Senate GOP whip. 
</P>
<P>
	And one without clear guidelines -- or any understanding of how  
long the trial would take, or whether witnesses would testify -- as 
lawmakers continued to struggle for agreement on a blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
	After several hours of behind-the-scenes discussions, Lott and  
Daschle made a rare joint appearance before reporters to declare 
their willingness to make one more attempt at a bipartisan 
agreement on procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that the best way to keep calm and cool and dignified  
is to look at each other and talk to each other,'' said Lott. The 
two sides were exchanging proposals in advance of the scheduled 
Friday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde and other Republicans have prepared a list of potential  
witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon 
Jordan and White House secretary Betty Currie, central figures in 
the sex-and-cover-up case put together by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Republican sources who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said GOP lawmakers may also want to have several current 
and former White House officials subpoenaed, including John 
Podesta, the chief of staff; Harold Ickes, a former aide, and 
adviser Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans crafted a plan that would give first the House and  
then the White House up to 24 hours each -- three eight-hour days, 
for example -- to present evidence, after which senators would have 
16 hours for questions to lawyers. After that, the Democrats would 
be permitted to seek the adjournment of the trial, and the House or 
White House free to seek permission to call witnesses. A final vote 
would occur by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats responded with a timetable that called for the trial  
to end on Jan. 26, without possibility of witnesses, although there 
appeared to be some softening within the caucus. Sen. John Kerry, 
D-Mass., a member of the leadership, said he was willing to listen 
to Republican arguments on the issue, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations ebbed and flowed during the day, and one plan for  
an all-Senate closed-door meeting was scrapped, as was Lott's plan 
to submit the issue to the full Senate for a pair of votes. Some 
Republicans expressed concern about the political impact of a 
highly partisan vote occurring on such a historic day. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove  
him, and Clinton has solid Democratic support in the Senate. 
Republicans outnumber Democrats 55-45. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters, ``We  
are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead the 
United States Senate not to remove the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the president's lawyers are ``ready to go'' and  
ready to stipulate to evidence in the case in exchange for a ban on 
witnesses. But, he added, if the House insists on calling witnesses 
it will cause a delay ``because bringing witnesses in and not 
stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions, discovery 
and depositions. And that takes time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde then led 12 other Republican lawmakers into the chamber a  
few minutes after 10 a.m., where he read the articles of 
impeachment aloud. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours afterward -- nearly 20 minutes after the appointed  
hour of 1 p.m. EST -- all senators rose at their seats and turned to 
face the doors at the rear of the chamber. Rehnquist was escorted 
in, wearing his black judicial robe with four gold bands on each 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
	He took his oath from Sen. Strom Thurmond, the 96-year-old  
Senate president pro tempore, and then proceeded to administer the 
oath in which senators -- jurors now -- pledged to render justice 
``according to the Constitution and laws, so help me God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said ``I do,'' in unison, but then a clerk read  
each name in alphabetical order and each senator rose at his or her 
seat and again uttered, ``I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, they walked to the front of the chamber where they  
signed their names in an ``oath book'' to record their presence. 
One hundred pens were laid out, mementos for the senators -- from 
the veterans like South Carolina Republican Thurmond, a senator 
since the 1950s, to newcomers like North Carolina Democrat John 
Edwards, who awoke Wednesday morning as a private citizen and was 
sworn in for his first term a few hours later.

<HEADLINE> Closing Arguments in Trammell Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A passenger suffered a ``manic episode'' when  
he tossed a flight attendant over two rows of seats as the plane 
flew at 40,000 feet, according to a psychiatrist testifying for the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were scheduled today in the unusual federal  
trial against Dean Trammell, charged with assault and interfering 
with a crew member. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On board the US Airways Flight 38 from Los Angeles to Baltimore,  
witnesses said Trammel called himself Jesus, roamed the aisles 
offering eternal salvation and threw flight attendant Renee Sheffer 
over the seats. 
</P>
<P>
	It took four people to control Trammel and put him in restraints  
as he thrashed and attempted to bite those holding him, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense expert, psychiatrist Dr. Carol Kleinman, testified  
Thursday that Trammel suffered from manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had the stewardess been less confrontative,'' she said, ``that  
would have had a more calming effect on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Psychiatrist Dr. John Lion, who testified as an expert for the  
prosecution, agreed that Trammel had lost ``some'' touch with 
reality on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trammel was competent enough to exchange pleasantries with  
flight attendants early in the flight, apologize to a flight 
attendant when he allegedly touched her breast and write a 
statement for police after the plane landed, Lion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delusion was not so powerful that all reason was lost,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffer testified earlier this week that she suffers  
post-traumatic stress along with persistent knee and shoulder 
problems due to injuries she suffered.

<HEADLINE> Falcons: 'Team of New Millennium' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers have history on their  
side. The Atlanta Falcons believe the future belongs to them. 
</P>
<P>
	One player went so far as to predict the Falcons will be the  
``team of the new millennium.'' Bold talk, considering the 49ers 
have won more Super Bowls (five) than Atlanta has won playoff games 
(two). 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, I think that will be to our advantage,'' said  
cornerback Michael Booker, taking his eye off the next century for 
a moment. ``We're more hungry than they are because we haven't been 
here before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the league's most pitiful franchises through most of  
their 33-year existence, the Falcons will be playing just the 
eighth postseason game in team history Saturday when the 49ers 
visit the Georgia Dome for the NFC divisional round. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco is the ultimate postseason team, going 15-6 since  
1988 -- four of those losses coming in the NFC championship game. 
Atlanta? It has never played for a conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers know they can't look past a team that went 14-2  
during the regular season and beat San Francisco by two games for 
the NFC West title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chased them for two months and they didn't blink,''  
quarterback Steve Young said. ``I've got to give them credit for 
winning the division title. We wanted that division title and they 
won it, rightfully so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Falcons take a break from the dance floor -- the ``Dirty  
Bird'' has done for this team what the ``Tomahawk Chop'' did for 
baseball's Braves in the early '90s -- they are supremely confident 
their record isn't a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere feels the same to me as it did in Green Bay,''  
said safety Eugene Robinson, who played in the last two Super Bowls 
for the Packers. ``There's a nice chemistry. Things are kind of 
clicking right now. The same thing happened up in Green Bay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco handed the Falcons one of their two losses,  
rolling to a 31-20 victory at 3Com Park in Week 4. But Atlanta 
ended the season with a nine-game winning streak, including a 31-19 
victory over the 49ers in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	From Robinson's point of view, that second game was the key to  
the Falcons' season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is about confidence and mindset,'' the defensive  
back said. ``We've already been in this situation and won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Falcons got last week off, San Francisco was locked in  
a wild-card death match with the Packers. Terrell Owens caught a 
25-yard touchdown pass from Young with three seconds remaining for 
a 30-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, just six days later and on the opposite side of the  
country, the 49ers have to face the rested, healthy Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked any coach if he had his druthers, he'd rather  
have a bye week and freshen up, rather than play a real physical 
and emotional game, then have a short week and travel,'' coach 
Steve Mariucci said. ``That's a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``But while the bye week can freshen you up physically, it's not  
bad playing a game, either, especially with all the things that 
came from that (Green Bay) game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key for the 49ers is shutting down All-Pro Jamal Anderson,  
who set a Falcons record with 1,846 yards rushing and an NFL mark 
with 410 carries. He ran for 123 yards in the game at San 
Francisco, 100 in the return match at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to get a lot of people around him,'' linebacker  
Ken Norton Jr. said. ``We have to almost attack this guy like you 
would attack a Barry Sanders. He's that powerful and he means that 
much to the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Anderson is running the ball, the 49ers' powerful offense  
can't get on the field. Young was the NFL's third-rated passer and 
is surrounded by offensive weapons. Owens, Jerry Rice and J.J. 
Stokes all caught at least 63 passes, while Garrison Hearst 
finished second to Anderson in the NFC with 1,570 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 49ers defensive line is so battered that Charles Haley  
was coaxed out of retirement for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of Atlanta's injury list is coach Dan Reeves, who  
underwent heart bypass surgery on Dec. 14. He missed the final two 
games of the regular season, but lists himself as probable for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting a two-hour practice Thursday, Reeves admitted  
that he was ``probably a little bit more tired'' than he was the 
previous two days. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I've got some time to recover now,'' the NFL's coach of  
the year said, ``and be ready to go on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Harold Richardson will stand alongside Reeves,  
serving as his personal bodyguard and watching for any wayward 
players coming his way. Richardson also will be ready to take over 
as the sideline coordinator should Reeves have a health setback 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He might have to take a bullet for me,'' Reeves quipped.

<HEADLINE> Report: Women Groped at Ford Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says  
women at two Ford Motor Co. plants were routinely groped and 
harassed by male co-workers and bosses, the Chicago Tribune 
reported today. The company says it has already fired some 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC finding described the environments at Ford's Taurus  
assembly plant in Chicago and its stamping plant in Chicago Heights 
as sexually hostile and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC report was to be released today by attorneys  
representing six women who sued Ford in federal court in Chicago in 
August after complaining to the EEOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The six women said they were groped and grabbed, and sexually  
explicit posters, calendars and graffiti covered walls and lockers 
at the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed supervisors and management condoned the harassment  
and that Ford retaliated against the women when they complained. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford would not address the EEOC's finding but noted that last  
year it fired workers who violated the company's ``zero tolerance'' 
policy regarding sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken these complaints very seriously since they've been  
brought to our attention, and we didn't wait for the EEOC to 
complete their investigation,'' said Ford spokesman Scott Jensen. 
``We were pretty quick to take action and conduct our own 
investigation. That resulted in the dismissal of some employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,700 workers -- including 650 women -- are employed at the  
two plants. 
</P>
<P>
	John P. Rowe, EEOC regional director, wouldn't discuss specifics  
of the Ford case but said that in general, companies and 
complainants must go through a conciliation process. If it fails, 
the EEOC decides whether to bring its own suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations at Ford are similar to those in a class-action  
lawsuit filed in 1996 against Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of 
America Inc. The lawsuit filed by 29 women who worked at the 
Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill., led to an unprecedented $34 
million settlement out of court.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Many Russians Exhaust Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- More than half of the people in Moscow questioned  
by a poll have exhausted their savings -- and the situation may be 
even worse in the rest of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Thursday found that 54 percent of about 800  
residents surveyed said they no longer had any savings. The Russian 
Center for Public Opinion Research did not provide a margin of 
error for its poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is in its worst economic crisis since the fall of the  
Soviet Union being hit in August by the global crisis in emerging 
markets. Many Russians lost their jobs and have been living on 
their savings, while others saw their money disappear when dozens 
of Russian banks collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation is likely to be more serious outside Moscow, one  
of the few places in Russia to have experienced significant 
prosperity in recent years. Other parts of Russia have endured 
years of economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if they would deposit money in a foreign bank because they  
no longer trust Russian banks, 34 percent of those surveyed said 
they would do so, the poll said. Of those who would use a foreign 
bank, 63 percent said they would choose a Swiss bank, it said. The 
poll was conducted at the end of December.

<HEADLINE> Broncos: Defense Cannot Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The most popular game in town late in the season  
was knocking the Denver Broncos' defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been playing well, it's as simple as that,'' safety  
Tyrone Braxton said. ``Everybody has been slapping us around. Our 
criticism is deserved. But it's something that we can correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's defense, shredded by Miami's Dan Marino on Dec. 21,  
must do an about-face in Saturday's AFC divisional playoff against 
those same Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, John Elway will be heading off to retirement on a  
harsh note. 
</P>
<P>
	Braxton knows the secondary must do a better job.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were in great position on all those plays that Marino made  
on us,'' he said. ``We just didn't make the play; we didn't knock 
the ball down or pick it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the game is at Mile High Stadium, where the Super  
Bowl champions have won 17 straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's offense set a slew of records this season, and Terrell  
Davis won his first NFL rushing title, becoming the fourth back in 
league history to top 2,000 yards rushing in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos (14-2) also made a strong bid to match the 1972  
Dolphins as the only unbeaten team in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 11 games, the Broncos had no discernible  
vulnerabilities, building big leads and beating opponents at will. 
</P>
<P>
	They won their next two games, too, but with difficulty. Then  
came two straight losses on the road -- 20-16 to the New York Giants 
and 31-21 to Miami -- and the air of invincibility was suddenly 
displaced by self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	A 28-21 win over Seattle in the regular-season finale appeared  
the proper tonic, but much soul-searching has ensued since the 
Dolphins emerged as Denver's first playoff opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino's torching of the Denver defense for 355 yards passing  
and four touchdowns exposed a weak pass rush and soft secondary. 
The Broncos did, after all, finish 26th in the NFL in pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
	And what to make of Davis' worst game of the season? He had 29  
yards rushing on 16 carries against the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Do the Broncos have matchup problems against Miami, or did the  
one-sided meeting last month result simply from Denver having 
nothing to play for and Miami needing a win to reach the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
	``We just flat got beat,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said.  
``They just outplayed us. But this is a new season. And it's always 
nice to get another chance to play somebody that you played poorly 
against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins (11-6) advanced with a 24-17 wild-card win over  
Buffalo last week. They capitalized on five Buffalo turnovers, 
Marino completed 23 of 34 passes for 235 yards and a touchdown, and 
Karim Abdul-Jabbar ran for 95 yards and a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo had the ball at the Miami 5-yard line with 17 seconds  
left when Trace Armstrong sacked Doug Flutie, forcing a game-ending 
fumble. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins finished the regular season with the NFL's  
third-best defense and allowed the league's fewest points (265). 
But they're missing two key defensive linemen since the previous 
game with Denver -- end Jason Taylor (broken collarbone) and tackle 
Tim Bowens (torn biceps tendon). 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's running game ranked only 24th in the NFL. Against  
Denver, Abdul-Jabbar rushed for only 5 yards on 15 carries, and the 
Dolphins as a team had just 36 yards on 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	If Marino is to get a shot at a Super Bowl ring, the Dolphins  
also must improve their play on the road. Discounting neutral-site 
Super Bowls, the Dolphins have gone 0-6 in their last six playoff 
games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't play well in cold weather,'' coach Jimmy Johnson  
said. ``This year we haven't played well on the road. Physically, 
we're really beat up. We're playing in a place that is a tremendous 
home-field advantage for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``So anything you can think of, it doesn't make for a positive  
towards us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, however, aren't about to skip the trip.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a feeling our guys will show up,'' Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> No Volvo Comment on Sale Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Swedish car- and truck-maker Volvo AB  
declined comment Thursday on continuing rumors that it is looking 
to sell off its automobile division. 
</P>
<P>
	The speculation of a sale started last month, with Ford, Fiat  
and Volkswagen seen as possible bidders. The Financial Times 
newspaper reported Thursday that Volvo has appointed an 
unidentified U.S. investment bank to explore a possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We neither confirm or deny the information,'' Volvo spokesman  
Mats Edenborg told the Swedish news agency TT. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors have pushed Volvo's stock up, with shares rising 3.8  
percent to 220 kronor ($27.50) in early trading on Stockholm's 
market Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo is one of Europe's smallest automobile manufacturers and  
its size is seen as an increasing disadvantage in the consolidating 
car business. Selling off the automobile division would allow Volvo 
to expand its truck and bus divisions.

<HEADLINE> Stern Won This Poker Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern ought to enter that annual Las Vegas  
World Series of Poker. 
</P>
<P>
	The man's a born bluffer.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern presented the deal that ended the six-month NBA lockout  
and got a 29-0 vote to approve the contract from his Board of 
Governors. Then he explained some of its details at an hour-long 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he was asked the question that was on everyone's mind.  
When he set Jan. 7 as a deadline for canceling the NBA season, was 
he bluffing? 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioner smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``You didn't pay to find out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	And neither did the players.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern got his settlement the hard way, by setting a time bomb,  
and challenging the union to count down with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Would he really cancel an entire season?  
</P>
<P>
	Try him.  
</P>
<P>
	Stern played Cool Hand Luke at the end, hardly ruffled by the  
circumstances. He went off to his winter home in Aspen, Colo., 
turning his back on talks, letting the players stew for a while. He 
declared negotiations over with a take-it-or-leave-it final offer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, he agreed to one last conversation with  
union chief Billy Hunter, an all-nighter like the ones college kids 
indulge in before a major exam. And when he had a deal, he was 
smart enough not to lord it over the union, choosing instead to be 
conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern showed up for his Board of Governors meeting wearing a  
black suit, white shirt and red tie, the subliminal power color. He 
got the 29-0 vote for his deal and then said all the right things, 
like reaffirming a partnership with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It guarantees NBA players will be the highest paid athletes in  
the world, deservedly,'' he said. ``As a basketball fan and 
particularly a fan of the NBA, I am elated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He might have been just as elated about a deal that caps  
salaries and creates virtual cost certainty for the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hunter seated at his side, Stern chose to put some spin on  
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish there were cost certainty,'' he said. ``There's not.  
Our players will get 55 percent of an ever-increasing pie. that 
will push the average in excess of $5 million. What it guarantees 
NBA teams is the opportunity to make a profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sat with his hands folded, like a teacher lecturing a class.  
He talked about open scrimmages, free exhibition games, $10 seats 
for games ``so that families can enjoy our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Stern at his best, working at rebuilding the shattered  
image of his league and not wasting any time getting to it, either. 
``We're comfortable that if we work hard, our fans will give us the 
opportunity to redeem ourselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the NBA in 1978, the league was on shaky ground,  
some franchises in danger of folding. He was largely responsible 
for building it into a $2 billion business. Now he was eager to 
begin repairing it again, remembering to include advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked about the lockout's impact on merchandise  
revenues, Stern began by giving the address of the glitzy NBA Store 
on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. It sounded like a paid political 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was asked about makeup games for the league's television  
partners, he reminded listeners to tune in on Feb. 5 to TNT and 
Feb. 7 to NBC. Seated at the side of the ballroom was Dick Ebersol, 
chairman of NBC Sports. He positively glowed. 
</P>
<P>
	As Stern continued to talk, he became more animated. ``With that  
much at stake, the armies are going to collide on the 
battlefield,'' he said, bringing his clenched fists together. 
</P>
<P>
	He nodded as Hunter and deputy commissioner Russ Granik talked  
about the settlement, then shook his head when he was asked about 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing this a bit on the run,'' he said. ``We're happy to  
be planning the season. We were planning for a non-season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a throwaway line, and yet it was included, perhaps for  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Why did it take so long to reach a settlement?  
</P>
<P>
	``These were two formidable adversaries, 29 owners and 400-plus  
NBA players,'' Stern said. ``The dynamic has to work out. It takes 
a long time. Ultimately both sides recognized the season was at 
risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But was it really?  
</P>
<P>
	The poker player wasn't saying.

<HEADLINE> European Central Bank Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank's  
policy-making council met today for the first time since the smooth 
launch of Europe's single currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The council faces more calls from Germany to lower the benchmark  
interest rate for the 11-nation euro bloc but is not expected to do 
so today. ECB President Wim Duisenberg and other top officials have 
said the rate will hold at 3 percent for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro began trading strongly against the dollar on Monday,  
prompting speculation from analysts of a rate cut as a too-strong 
currency could hurt the bloc's exports. Today however the euro was 
weaker, trading at $1.1645, below its launch rate of $1.1668. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has pushed for a lower interest rate, possibly down to  
2.75 percent, to stimulate growth and create jobs. The German 
Economic Research Institute on Tuesday predicted growth for the 
euro bloc will fall to 1.9 percent in 1999, compared to 2.8 percent 
in 1998. It, too, called for an interest rate cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro countries are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,  
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and 
Spain.

not joining for now.

<HEADLINE> Ozolinsh Returns to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Four months ago, the Colorado Avalanche were  
waving $10 million at Sandis Ozolinsh in hopes of signing the 
three-time All-Star defenseman to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to his prowess on the power play, Ozolinsh insisted on  
at least $4 million per season and returned to his native Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight missed games and countless accusations later,  
Ozolinsh decided that $6.8 million for two years was enough to get 
him off the golf course and back on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't count how much money I lost,'' Ozolinsh said  
Wednesday, about 12 hours after agreeing to his new contract. ``I 
didn't really care about it. Basically it's a principle and being 
treated as I thought was fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh's return ended a contentious dispute that included  
trade demands and unwavering stubbornness on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	How ugly did it get? In October, Colorado general manager Pierre  
Lacroix actually lowered the three-year offer from $10 million to 
$9.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we are concerned, since Day 1 we always believed  
that we made a very fair proposal,'' Lacroix said. ``The key thing 
is we found a solution. I pride myself as a guy that needs to find 
solutions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Avalanche saved more than $3 million because of  
Ozolinsh's initial contract rejection, neither side could claim 
much of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which tied Florida 2-2 Wednesday night, was 17-18-3  
without Ozolinsh and has been inconsistent on the power play, 
suffering from a recent 0-for-27 slump before scoring with a man 
advantage in six straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes us a stronger team,'' defenseman Aaron Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Avalanche have the NHL's 12th-ranked power play at  
16.6 percent. With Ozolinsh as their point man last season, the Avs 
converted 17.4 percent of their power-play chances, and Ozolinsh's 
35 points on the power play ranked third in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring a lot of offensive scoring chances to  
us,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``We're going to exploit his style to 
the maximum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado will have to manage a few more days without Ozolinsh as  
he gets back into shape following several months of playing golf 
and working out with his junior team in Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not play against Florida, and there is not set timetable  
for his 1999 debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to practice 5-on-5 and get more contact where I have to  
make quick decisions, then we'll see,'' said Ozolinsh, who was a 
restricted free agent. ``I'm in pretty good shape. I actually 
played golf a bit. Hey, that's a sport. They show it on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ozolinsh's holdout was the second of his career. After failing  
to reach an agreement with San Jose before the 1995-96 season, the 
Sharks traded him to Colorado for right wing Owen Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be back,'' he said. ``It was never personal. It  
was business. We're not calling anybody names.''

	Two children were among those killed when the truck swerved off

miles southeast of Lima in the department of Ayacucho. The bus 
rolled down a 500-foot slope, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was carrying passengers from the town of San Miguel to

	Some Mexico City radio stations had reported a spill. The tanker

<P>
	The mishap, apparently caused by mechanical failure, occurred

<HEADLINE>  White Names AP Defensive Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Reggie White played like he was a young  
man in 1998, capping his illustrious career as The Associated Press 
NFL Defensive Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won the award in 1987 while with the Philadelphia  
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
	So, which does he consider the greater accomplishment,  
collecting 21 sacks in 12 games in '87 at age 25 or 16 sacks at age 
36 in his farewell season? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the highlight,'' White said without  
hesitation. ``Back then I was young. This is probably a bigger 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White, who planned to retire a year ago, came back to the Green  
Bay Packers for one last season and led the NFC with 16 sacks. He 
also served as an off-field teacher for young defensive linemen 
Vonnie Holliday and Keith McKenzie, who finished with eight sacks 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reggie this year was phenomenal,'' Packers quarterback Brett  
Favre said. ``No one expected him, first of all, to play in the 
offseason, then he comes back and everyone's like, `Well, he'll 
give us his five, six sacks and his leadership in the locker room.' 
But he just blew everybody away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No player has retired after winning the defensive or offensive  
player of the year award, but two MVPs did -- Norm Van Brocklin, 
co-winner in 1960, and Jim Brown in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	White, the most honored defensive end in NFL history, insisted  
once again Wednesday that this was it, even though he said he 
thought he could play until he was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some people who don't understand how I could walk away  
from the game having as good a year as I did, and No. 2 how I could 
walk away from so much money,'' said White, who could have made 
another $5 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
	White recently was voted to the All-Pro team for the seventh  
time. The 37-year-old defensive end is the career sacks leader with 
192 1/2 and is generally recognized as the first significant 
free-agent signing of the 1990s, when he left the Eagles for Green 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers general manager Ron Wolf has said White's signing  
convinced other players to come to Green Bay, which won the Super 
Bowl after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go out on top like this is an honor and a privilege that  
God would allow me to come through and play the way I did,'' said 
White, an ordained minister who around football is known as the 
``Minister of Defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play for the people who doubted me. When the Lord  
spoke to me about coming back, that was the only reason I came 
back. No. 2, all of us have team goals and individual goals; my 
prayer was that God would make me defensive player of the year and 
to get 16 sacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press during training camp  
when the pain from his bad back began to diminish, White predicted 
exactly that: ``I'm not coming back to be a part-time player or 
have a mediocre season. I told God, `If You're telling me to come 
back, let me have a great season.' My goals are 16 sacks and to be 
Defensive Player of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hadn't had that many sacks in a decade.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's come to pass and I praise the Lord for it,'' White said.  
``It's an honor not only to go out my last year being Defensive 
Player of the Year and of course ... being the only Packer to ever 
be Defensive Player of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White easily won the award in balloting by a nationwide panel of  
47 sports writers and broadcasters. He received 20 votes, far ahead 
of Minnesota tackle John Randle's six. 
</P>
<P>
	Next in the voting were Miami linebacker Zach Thomas and New  
England cornerback Ty Law with four, and Dallas cornerback Deion 
Sanders, who received three votes despite missing the final month 
of the season with a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
	White began playing pro football in the USFL and spent 14  
seasons in the NFL. He says he has no fear of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people who don't have a purpose, they end up  
dying twice,'' White said. ``They don't know what they're going to 
do. I think that's why among ex-athletes, the divorce rate is so 
high because they left the game with no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a purpose, No. 1 my family, my wife and my kids. I want  
to spend more time with my kids. I want to go to their basketball 
games more, go to their band concerts more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in five years, he can head for Canton and the Hall of Fame.  
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, White will focus on sacking sin and not quarterbacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably more excited about doing the things that He's  
called me to do than I have been about playing football,'' White 
said. ``Because I know and I believe it's going to help a lot of 
people, and that's all I really ever wanted to do.''

<HEADLINE> Heart Research Pioneer Zoll Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Dr. Paul M. Zoll, a heart specialist whose  
research led to the pacemaker and the defibrillator devices that 
have helped millions of patients, has died at 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoll died Tuesday of respiratory arrest.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 45 years ago, he was credited with showing for the  
first time that electrical stimulation can restart human hearts. A 
Boston Globe story in February 1953 -- headlined ``Three dead 
brought back to life'' -- recounted how he had restarted the hearts 
of three patients at Beth Israel Hospital through noninvasive 
electric stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Seigo Izumo, director of cardiovascular research at Beth  
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, called Zoll a ``revolutionary'' 
who was the first to use electricity for cardiac therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoll's research led to developing the electrocardiogram and  
making open-heart surgery possible, Izumo said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Zoll won the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research  
Award, considered the leading scientific prize in the United 
States, for his contributions to the treatment of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The citation noted that Zoll's work led to the development of  
the closed-chest defibrillator, which shocks the heart to restore a 
normal rhythm, and cardiac monitors as well as the pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Zoll developed the theory and technique of continuous  
cardiac monitoring of heart rhythm, and was the first to apply this 
method clinically,'' it said. ``The coronary care unit now found in 
every well-equipped hospital is a further development of this 
life-saving concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, a half million people worldwide receive pacemakers to  
keep their hearts pumping in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoll, born in Boston, graduated from Harvard College and Harvard  
Medical School. He interned at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and 
Bellevue Hospital in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his cardiology work after returning to Boston and  
joining the medical research department at Beth Israel in 1939. For 
many years he was a clinical professor at Harvard Medical School 
and a physician at Beth Israel Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote many articles for professional journals and in 1956 was  
named associate editor of the medical journal Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, he founded Zoll Medical Corp., which  
manufactured defibrillators. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, a son and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Telecom Buys Thai Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Telecommunications has announced its  
second largest foreign investment ever with the planned purchase of 
20 percent of Thailand's largest cellular phone operator, Advanced 
Info Service. 
</P>
<P>
	SingTel said in a statement late Wednesday that its wholly owned  
overseas investment arm, Singapore Telecom International, has 
reached in-principle agreement with Advanced Info Service and 
Shinawatra Computer and Communications for the share purchases, 
worth about 11.6 billion baht ($315 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced Info is the largest mobile phone operator in Thailand  
with more than 970,000 subscribers on its analog and digital 
cellular networks. 
</P>
<P>
	With an estimated 6.3 billion Singapore dollars ($3.8 billion)  
in cash on its books, SingTel has been actively scouting for 
investment bargains in the recession-stricken Asian region. 
</P>
<P>
	SingTel's stake in Advanced Info will help it establish a  
foothold in the Thai telecommunications market and bring it a step 
closer to becoming a regional player, analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is their first significant investment in Thailand,'' said  
Neil Juggins, a regional telecommunications analyst at Paribas Asia 
Equity in Singapore. ``Advanced is well-placed to expand in the 
recovery of the Thai market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SingTel's earnings should grow 1 percent the company's next  
fiscal year because of the acquisition, said analyst Michael Millar 
of brokerage SG Securities in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	SingTel posted a net profit of 1.89 billion Singapore dollars  
($1.13 billion) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Trooper Reinstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A highway patrolman accused of having an  
improper relationship with Lt. Gov. Mary Fallin while serving as 
her bodyguard was reinstated today after officials concluded their 
relationship was platonic. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Safety Commissioner Bob Ricks reinstated Trooper Greg  
Allen, a month after Allen had resigned when the allegations were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen underwent a four-hour interrogation and polygraph  
examination on Wednesday, Ricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities concluded that Allen went somewhat beyond a  
professional bodyguard role when he tried to comfort the lieutenant 
governor as she experienced problems in her marriage. But they 
concluded that the relationship did not develop into an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trooper Allen lost sight of his protective responsibilities.  
This conduct is not something that is going to be allowed on the 
protective detail,'' Ricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``We are confident that there was no sexual  
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricks said Allen will receive a letter of admonishment and will  
be suspended for two days without pay before he is reinstated. And 
he will be transferred from the executive protection detail to 
traffic patrol duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very happy,'' Allen's attorney, Gary James, said. ``He's  
been on a roller coaster. It's been physically and mentally 
trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fallin, a Republican who was elected to a second term in  
November and had been touted as a possible GOP gubernatorial 
candidate, has filed for divorce from her husband, dentist Joe 
Fallin. Her husband's attorney had characterized her relationship 
with the trooper as an affair.

<HEADLINE> Apathy Reigns for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- During a midday lull at Squire Stylist on  
Main Street, barber Charles Dispenza filed his fingernails with 
alarming vigor as he pondered President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's like a lynching,'' he pronounced, looking  
restless in one of his plush leather thrones. ``It shouldn't have 
gone this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, neither Dispenza nor any of his customers at this rarest  
of moments in history seemed eager to catch even a glimpse of the 
Senate's proceedings on a television turned down low in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could care less!'' called out Marick Schwartz, 36, from  
behind the partitions of a tiny tanning room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't watch it,'' the law-firm secretary elaborated as she  
emerged minutes later. ``He did lie on the stand. That's a grave 
mistake. But the way they went about getting him to admit he had 
sex, that's just ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As senators were sworn in Thursday for the first presidential  
impeachment trial since 1868, many Americans stifled yawns. Some 
were simply tuckered out from trying to keep up with the extended 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on overload on this stuff,'' said an exasperated Judy  
Rosso, 61, a purchaser at City Hall. ``The numbers are wrong for 
him to get convicted. He's going to get off, he'll get his wish. 
Nice country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rosso had no kind words, others filtering in for their  
hair appointments were quick to point fingers in excusing Clinton's 
efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. So did  
President Nixon,'' said Mike Perry, 47, who is self-employed in the 
construction business. ``When John F. Kennedy was doing it, people 
just kept their mouths shut back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a Republican, thinks enough harm has been inflicted on  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows what he's done -- he has admitted it in so many  
words, in a roundabout way,'' he said. ``I think the senators will 
realize that. He's been publicly humiliated enough. They've now got 
to go forward and keep the reputation of the presidency intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With customers from both sides of the political aisle, Dispenza  
prefers to label himself a ``nonpartisan,'' but his sympathy 
clearly lies with the embattled Democratic president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right-wing has been wanting to get this man for six years,  
for almost anything,'' he said. ``Everyone says he did wrong, but 
how wrong was it?''

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Desegregation Deal Made </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A tentative deal aimed at resolving a nearly  
30-year-old desegregation lawsuit would allow the St. Louis school 
system to continue sending 13,000 inner-city students to suburban 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	If city voters approve the plan, federal supervision of the  
school system would end and the Missouri state government would 
save some $30 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got justice,'' said Minnie Liddell, whose suit in  
1972 led to the current court-enforced desegregation plan. ``My 
son, Creighton, was 12 when I filed this lawsuit. He just turned 40 
on Sunday. I'm glad I lived to see a settlement in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current plan was put in place in 1983 after the state was  
held partially responsible for creating an unlawfully segregated 
school system in St. Louis. In recent years, state officials have 
sought to reduce the $70 million a year obligation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the tentative deal announced Wednesday, city voters in  
February would need to approve a tax increase that would contribute 
$20 million a year. The state would still pay the city about $40 
million a year, said William Danforth, who coordinated the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board already has approved the deal, saying they can  
make do even with a $10 million drop in funding. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would keep intact the currently court-supervised  
program that involves busing roughly 13,000 black inner-city 
students to predominately white St. Louis County schools. In 
addition, about 1,300 county students attend 26 city magnet 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to broker a settlement began after Missouri Attorney  
General Jay Nixon went to court in January 1996 to have the school 
system declared desegregated, thus ending state funding. Nixon said 
he approves of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement will effectively end decades of litigation and  
save the state significant fees,'' Nixon said. ``It allows 
educators and parents to worry about education not litigation.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in $20M Investment Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The head of the Quincy-based Boston Investment  
Group has been charged in connection with a Ponzi scheme that 
allegedly bilked millions of dollars from investors nationwide, the 
U.S. Attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said that Arthur F. Good duped investors by  
capitalizing on the names of two well-known companies: the Marriott 
Foundation and Fidelity Investments. Neither company was working 
with him, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 43-count criminal information -- similar to a grand jury's  
indictment -- charges Good with fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Good allegedly cheated investors out of at least $7 million by  
telling them he would invest their money safely with very high 
return rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of investing the money, he used some to pay off previous  
investors and divided the rest between his partners and himself, 
U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the money was invested in what Stern described as  
``extremely speculative offshore investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, Good allegedly took in more than $20 million from at  
least 100 victims across the country, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the so-called Ponzi scheme, early investors in the scam  
would get back money they believed to be returns on their 
investments. In reality, the funds used to pay them was from new 
investors, Stern said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Probe Receives More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Boulder County commissioners have endorsed  
the work of the grand jury investigating the JonBenet Ramsey 
murder, authorizing nearly $80,000 more for its work. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was requested to fund the grand jury's work through  
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're pretty well committed as a community to doing  
everything we can to solve the crime if it can be solved,'' 
Commissioner Paul Danish said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Bill Wise said he will be back to ask for more money  
if the work isn't completed by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in the  
basement of her family's home in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made.  
</P>
<P>
	Police say her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain under  
suspicion. The Ramseys, who have maintained their innocence, 
haven't yet been called by the grand jury, which began its work in 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder County, which funds the district attorney's office,  
approved the new money despite a bill for the case that already had 
reached nearly $390,000. It is the most ever spent by the office on 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	City police already have spent more than $1 million on their  
probe.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philadelphia Cop Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The city's first openly gay police recruit,  
hired through a campaign to reach out to homosexuals, shot himself 
to death near Independence Hall a month after graduating from the 
police academy. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend says Thomas Kalt Jr. was despondent over the recent  
breakup with his boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt, 26, died of a single gunshot wound to the head from his  
own service revolver Wednesday afternoon. He had shot himself in a 
park near Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He left two notes at his residence, the contents of which  
clearly denote suicide,'' said police Capt. Linda MacLachlin. 
``They indicate he was troubled by personal issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Philadelphia lost a fine officer,'' Mark Segal, publisher of  
the Philadelphia Gay News, said in a statement. ``Officer Kalt was 
a pioneer for our community and will always be remembered for his 
courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt resigned from the force Monday, an action that became  
effective Tuesday, police said. He was one of 326 officers to 
graduate from the academy Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication whatsoever that his death was the  
result of any problems he had with the police department, with his 
assignment, with the men and women he worked with,'' Police 
Commissioner John Timoney said. ``It is really just a sad day for 
this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt was depressed over breaking up with a boyfriend about a  
week ago, Mark Chumley, a gay activist who said he had known Kalt 
for four or five years, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was really not taking it well,'' Chumley said. ``He didn't  
deal well with the breakup at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt was still in possession of his service revolver and badge  
while counselors were talking to him about options short of 
resigning, such as taking a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for recruits to rethink their career shortly  
after leaving the academy, which is a protected environment in 
which they are not exposed to the stresses of the street,'' Ms. 
MacLachlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recruitment campaign began in 1989, with fliers and speeches  
to gay organizations, but Kalt was the first recruit to openly 
declare his homosexuality, said Sgt. Fred Cotton, supervisor of the 
police recruiting unit. There was no way of knowing if other gays 
had signed up because of the campaign but stayed in the closet, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A female officer revealed her homosexuality a few years ago, but  
she was already a member of the force. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton said he had been looking forward to having Kalt help in  
future recruitment efforts.

<HEADLINE> Dems Add Woman to Party Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt moved  
Thursday to add a woman to the party's leadership, asking Rep. Rosa 
DeLauro, D-Conn., to run for the new position of assistant to the 
party leader. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLauro, beginning her fifth term representing the New Haven  
area, would fill a void created when the only woman in the 
leadership in the last Congress, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, also of 
Connecticut, retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's office said DeLauro, to be formally elected later  
this month, will oversee the coordination of policy, communication 
and research, sit on a new Democratic Leadership Council and serve 
as a liaison to first-year members. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLauro has been chief deputy whip since 1995 but lost last  
month in the race for Democratic caucus chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	With the new position, there will be five elected jobs in the  
leadership: Gephardt of Missouri is the Democratic leader, David 
Bonior of Michigan is the whip, Martin Frost of Texas is the caucus 
chairman and Robert Menendez of New Jersey is replacing Kennelly as 
caucus vice-chairman.

<HEADLINE> Doug Flutie: AP Comeback Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For anyone wondering where Doug Flutie went, he answered so  
emphatically in his return to the NFL that he was honored as The 
Associated Press NFL Comeback Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, who won the Heisman Trophy in college and six most  
outstanding player awards in Canada, was selected Thursday as the 
first winner of the award. 
</P>
<P>
	He easily outdistanced a strong field in what was a banner year  
for comebacks. The Buffalo Bills quarterback received 23 votes from 
a nationwide panel of sports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other quarterbacks who revitalized their careers, Randall  
Cunningham of Minnesota and Vinny Testaverde of the New York Jets, 
were next with six and five votes, respectively. Cunningham was 
retired and laying tile just two years ago. Testaverde, a Pro 
Bowler in 1996, was cut by Baltimore after a mediocre 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Rice, the game's premier receiver for a decade, also got  
five votes. Rice sustained two serious knee injuries during the 
1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive Player of the Year Reggie White of Green Bay got the  
other two votes. White, coming off an injury-plagued season, said 
he was retiring after last season, then changed his mind. The 
league's career sacks leader returned to have one of his best 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all had phenomenal years,'' he said. ``Mine is a bigger  
comeback story because of my absence from the league for so long. 
Vinny had a better year than I did throwing the ball; Randall had a 
phenomenal year throwing the ball. ... The only difference is that 
I was way away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randall might have retired for a year or two, but people lost  
sight of Doug Flutie and what he was doing for eight years. I had 
to really come back from a long way away. I wasn't even in the 
stadium. They were sitting in the bleachers and jumped back down. I 
was outside selling popcorn and had to come in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, signed as a free agent to back up Rob Johnson, became a  
starter in the sixth game of the season after Johnson went down 
with a rib injury. He replaced Johnson early in a victory over 
Indianapolis and led the Bills to a 10-6 record and a wild-card 
playoff berth after they started the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, he captured the imagination of a nation with his  
scrambling style, innovative performances and ability to lead his 
team back from the depths. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Flutie has experienced the depths, too. He went to  
the USFL after winning the 1984 Heisman. When that league folded, 
Flutie wound up in New England and Chicago, where he found limited 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered too short -- he's listed at 5-foot-10 but is shorter --  
Flutie overcame such criticism when he moved to the CFL. He became 
a star on the wider field in the liberal passing attacks featured 
by Canadian teams. 
</P>
<P>
	And then he took the NFL by storm this year with his flair. He  
completed 57 percent of his passes for 20 touchdowns. He also 
rushed for 248 yards and a TD to beat out some impressive 
competition for comeback honors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought all along that I could play down here,'' Flutie  
said. ``That was one element that was missing. I thoroughly enjoyed 
playing up there, and I was very happy with that, but I didn't like 
the average guy out there thinking that I couldn't get it done down 
here. That didn't sit well with me. 
</P>
<P>
	``So maybe this will put an end to that. But it probably never  
will. You're only as good as your last pass or your last game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, the runner-up to Denver's Terrell Davis for AP  
Offensive Player of the Year, led the league in passing efficiency, 
threw for 3,704 yards and had 34 touchdown passes. He was the 
All-Pro quarterback this year, guiding the Vikings to the league's 
best record, 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde took New York to a 12-4 record and the AFC East  
title. He was 12-1 after replacing Glenn Foley as starter, and 
threw 29 TD passes with only seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, already the owner of most of the significant NFL receiving  
marks, wasn't quite the dangerous threat of previous years. Still, 
he made 82 catches, third in the NFC, and scored nine times. Rice 
averaged 14 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
	White paced the NFC with 16 sacks and provided significant  
tutoring to young defensive linemen Vonnie Holliday and Keith 
McKenzie. He made the All-Pro team for the seventh time.

<HEADLINE> Report: GM To Replace 2 Ohio Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to replace its  
assembly plants in Lansing and Lordstown, Ohio, with new, more 
efficient facilities, possibly as early as this spring, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 automaker has completed the design of both plants and  
wants to begin construction in April, GM vice president Mark Hogan 
told the Detroit Free Press during an interview at the North 
American International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
	The new design would allow both plants to cut costs and, GM  
hopes, help it begin making money on compact models like the 
Chevrolet Cavalier that is built at the 30-year-old Lordstown plant 
in northeast Ohio. GM now loses $200 to $300 on every small car it 
sells, according to industry experts cited by the Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plants, being developed under the name Project  
Yellowstone, could cut GM's production costs by $2,000 per car, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker will build the new factories if it can negotiate  
new work rules with the United Auto Workers union -- rules that 
would allow the factories to operate as efficiently as they are 
designed. Talks are being held with UAW locals at both plants, and 
union executives also must approve the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Free Press said it could not reach UAW officials for comment  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hogan said, ``There are things they're going to want that we  
don't like and vice versa, and we're looking for compromise. I'd 
have to say the spirit's right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say we're optimistic that we're going to have  
local agreements at both locations that will be key steps to us 
finalizing the decision on putting new plants in those areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Lansing and Lordstown factories would be about  
one-third the size of a conventional assembly plant and cost 
one-third as much to build -- $300 million to $400 million, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other features of the proposed plants include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Operating on three shifts, and hiring outside companies to  
maintain and clean the factories. Between 15 percent and 20 percent 
of the 12,600 employees at the existing two factories are 
UAW-represented maintenance and janitorial workers on the GM 
payroll -- at $21 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Buying major pieces of cars that are pre-assembled by  
suppliers, and having independent parts suppliers located within a 
30-minute drive. The UAW in the past has sought to protect union 
jobs by resisting GM's efforts to buy more parts, and fully 
assembled components, from independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	GM negotiated a local contract with more efficient work rules  
before it opened its last new assembly plant in this country -- the 
Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Capano Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- On the final day of his defense, a  
prominent lawyer brought forward two family members whose testimony 
could bolster his claim that his mistress died accidentally at the 
hands of another, jealous lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Thomas Capano, a politically connected lawyer on  
trial in the death of Anne Marie Fahey, on Wednesday questioned 
Capano's older sister, Marian, and her husband, Lee Ramunno. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors contend Capano, 49, murdered Ms. Fahey, the  
governor's scheduling secretary, because she wanted to end their 
secret affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Both defense witnesses said Wednesday that Capano told them on  
July 4, 1996 -- a week after Ms. Fahey's disappearance -- that he had 
taken Ms. Fahey home after dinner on June 27 and never saw her 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I can't go to the police because it would involve  
someone else,''' Mrs. Ramunno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano has testified that a second mistress, Deborah MacIntyre,  
accidentally shot Ms. Fahey. He said she found the two of them at 
his house, and, in a jealous rage, produced a gun, threatening 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano has said he lunged for the gun and it went off, killing  
Ms. Fahey. Later, he said, he dumped the body at sea to protect 
himself and Ms. MacIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's sister and his brother-in-law said they never asked him  
specifically what had happened to Ms. Fahey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre has denied the story, saying she wasn't even at  
his house that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, a former state prosecutor, did not make his version of  
Ms. Fahey's death public until his trial began in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who began their rebuttal case Wednesday, are to  
continue their case when court resumes today.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the impeachment drama shifted to the  
Senate, the House found itself getting back to business as usual 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the 106th Congress opened, several House committees  
held organizational meetings, even as House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., walked across the Capitol to read on 
the Senate floor the pair of impeachment articles approved by the 
House at the end of the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	House committee chairmen also held a private planning meeting  
with the new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., practically 
ignored by the media. 
</P>
<P>
	So, where was the usual media horde?  
</P>
<P>
	Where else? In the Senate, covering the ceremony, never seen by  
anybody now alive, associated with Thursday's opening of President 
Clinton's impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, a statement pinned to a press room bulletin  
board: 
</P>
<P>
	``At today's daily briefing, a question was asked regarding the  
use of the tickets provided to the White House for today's 
proceedings in the Senate. Following is the answer to that 
question: 
</P>
<P>
	``The tickets were not used.''  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Before the trial's official opening came a ceremonial walk from  
one side of the Capitol to the other by the 13 House Judiciary 
Committee members who will argue the case for Clinton's removal. 
</P>
<P>
	At approximately 9:58 a.m., Hyde led the group down an aisle in  
the Capitol rotunda that was cordoned off by wine-colored velvet 
ropes clipped to brass poles. His prosecutorial team followed, 
two-by-two. 
</P>
<P>
	After reading the perjury and obstruction of justice charges  
from a dark-colored binder, pausing once during the second article 
to take a deep breath, Hyde flipped the folder shut and led the 
group out. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in the House, he told his colleagues, ``Thanks everybody,''  
</P>
<P>
	And to reporters, he said: ``We're doing what we have to do.  
Nobody enjoys it, but we feel it's our constitutional duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist was led into the Senate chamber  
about two hours later to continue the trial's largely ceremonial 
opening day. But not even this day's historic business nor the rare 
appearance by Rehnquist, a stickler for punctuality, could get the 
Senate to stay on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice arrived at the Capitol at 12:35 p.m., a minute  
after his chauffeured Cadillac left the Supreme Court's underground 
parking garage, for his scheduled 1 p.m. oath-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	But in keeping with the often slow pace with which the Senate  
conducts its affairs, Rehnquist received his oath some 20 minutes 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara Boxer was taken from the Senate chamber in a  
wheelchair to see a Capitol nurse after feeling faint. She did not 
appear seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a cold, but she's fine,'' said David Sandretti, a  
spokesman for the California Democrat and Clinton relative by 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer returned about 30 minutes later and was sworn in as a  
juror to sit in judgment on Clinton, a relative by marriage, on 
impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Boxer's daughter, Nicole, married Tony Rodham, younger brother  
of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a 1994 White House 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	What happens to a motorized cart, parked illegally at the  
entrance of a Senate doorway being kept clear for the chief justice 
of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle gets moved.  
</P>
<P>
	As reporters and photographers awaited Rehnquist's arrival, a  
smiling and waving Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., whizzed by on the 
motorized cart he's used since before surgery last summer to 
replace both knees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Helms parked the cart outside an entrance to the  
Senate chamber, but its location appeared to offend a TV news 
producer assigned to provide pool footage of the comings and 
goings. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Capitol Hill police officers eventually hoisted the  
machine with two pairs of bare hands and moved it about 30 feet 
away -- well out of camera range. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Could the trial foster a case of congressional sibling rivalry?  
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Republican brothers from Clinton's home state of  
Arkansas -- one a senator, the other a congressman -- are playing 
roles in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson serves on the House Judiciary Committee that  
cleared articles of impeachment later approved by the full House. 
He's also one of the 13 committee members chosen to argue the case 
for Clinton's removal when the Senate trial resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Tim, was sworn in Thursday as a juror for the  
proceeding.

<P>
	CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) -- A lost soul seeking spiritual guidance  
wanders into church. No one greets him. The sermon makes him 
sleepy. When he looks up from his Bible, he sees cracked paint on 
the sanctuary walls. 
</P>
<P>
	In just 11 minutes, he decides never to return.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some churches have signs that are unspoken: We don't want you  
here,'' says Daniel Allen, a church ``coach'' who advises 
congregations on ways to attract new members. ``In our 
consumer-driven society, churches need signs that say, `We are a 
warm and loving place.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, 39, and his wife, Lainie, 38, encourage ministers to use  
modern marketing to bring more people to God. Guided by studies of 
American views on religion and the customer service emphasis of 
successful businesses, the Cleveland, Tenn., couple travel the 
country inspecting everything from the condition of church 
bathrooms to the ``spiritual energy'' in the churches that hire 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business thinking says you've got to reach your target  
group,'' says Mrs. Allen, who has a master's degree in education. 
``The little signs on the church that say, `Y'all come to our 
church,' aren't going to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Allens, who led a congregation in California while Daniel  
earned his Ph.D. at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, 
decided to move to the Bible Belt after learning the region had few 
church consultants. They have worked with about 500 clients from 
several denominations since 1990. They charge about $1,000 for a 
one-day review and between $6,000 and $10,000 for yearlong 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show people avoid church because they feel pressured to  
give money, or find services boring and sermons irrelevant. 
Newcomers decide in the first 11 minutes whether to return, so 
details such as cleanliness and good music count, the Allens say. 
</P>
<P>
	Churches, they say, need to recognize their competition:  
television and the Internet, the relative ease of New Age worship, 
even the lure of a Sunday morning at a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Church consultants aren't new. Since the 1920s, denominations  
have appointed administrators to advise congregations on how to 
grow, says Dave Travis of Leadership Network, a Dallas-based group 
that supports church innovation. Independent fee-for-service 
consulting emerged in the 1970s and has grown, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some church leaders fear that taking cues from the business  
world dilutes the Bible's message, but the Allens say not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal philosophy is you need to know God loves you,''  
Daniel Allen says. ``If I am putting obstacles in the way, I'm 
going to need to figure out how to remove those obstacles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Daniel Allen arrives at a church, he takes an inventory.  
</P>
<P>
	Is the parking lot paved? Are the bathrooms well marked and  
clean? Is the church bulletin appealing? Are there designated 
greeters? Are the sermons relevant?

<P>
	``It needs to be biblical, but you need to deal with where  
people live,'' he says. ``People in the pews are asking, `So what? 
How does this help me in my daily life?''' 
</P>
<P>
	At one congregation that hired the Allens, the Valley Spring  
Church of God in Peoria, Ariz., the pastor's habit of praying in 
his car inspired them. They suggested he start a commuters' prayer 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Gary Hawkins now distributes cards that hang from the  
dashboard to about 30 people who recite the prayers while driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier to ask for people to pray in their cars than to  
come to a one-hour prayer meeting,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allens also suggested Hawkins ask first-time visitors not to  
donate when the collection plate is passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It blows people away when we say don't give,'' Hawkins says.  
``They say, `What do you mean you don't want our money?' We're more 
interested in their spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The church has grown from 20 to about 150 members in four years,  
and Hawkins credits the Allens for helping. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Ron Hill arrived eight years ago at the Church of God in  
rural Rocky Mount, Va., a congregation he described as ``dying.'' 
He tried to revive the church for three years, with little luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mindset of people was do it like we've always done it,''  
he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Allens' urging, he replaced hymns with contemporary music  
and started a Bible study on local cable television. About 180 
people now attend Sunday services, up from 30 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allens, he says, ``helped me to have the confidence to  
challenge tradition and institutional barriers that kept the church 
inwardly focused.''

<HEADLINE> Profiles of Clinton Legal Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Key members of President Clinton's legal team:  
</P>
<P>
	CHARLES F.C. RUFF -- White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff's  
legal career has included stints as Watergate prosecutor, associate 
attorney general and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. He 
arrived at the White House in January 1997 during the Whitewater, 
Paula Jones and campaign finance imbroglios; still to come were the 
investigations of the Monica Lewinsky affair and Chinese missile 
technology. Known for his political savvy, Ruff's clients have 
included Anita Hill, Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., and former White 
House aide Ira Magaziner. Ruff uses a wheelchair as a result of 
polio. He is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Columbia Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GREG CRAIG -- As a new special counsel, Craig ventured into the  
spotlight as one of Clinton's defenders during the House Judiciary 
impeachment hearings. Craig coordinates the president's impeachment 
defense inside the White House and is the lead spokesman on the 
issue. Previously, he worked for the State Department as special 
coordinator overseeing U.S. policy toward Tibet. He also was an 
aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and helped represent John 
Hinckley Jr. after Hinckley attempted to assassinate President 
Reagan in 1981. Craig is a former law partner of Clinton attorney 
David Kendall. He is a graduate of Harvard University and Yale Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DAVID KENDALL -- The president's personal attorney, Kendall faced  
off with Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr in his 
cross-examination during the House impeachment hearings. Kendall is 
the architect of Clinton's legal defense both for Starr's criminal 
investigation and the House impeachment inquiry. He negotiated the 
agreement for Clinton to testify by videotape before Starr's grand 
jury. He works for the Washington firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly. A 
Quaker who grew up in Indiana, Kendall graduated from Wabash 
College. While at Yale Law School, he became friends with Hillary 
Rodham. He went to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship two years ahead 
of the president. He has another high-profile client: the National 
Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LANNY BREUER -- A White House lawyer who remains largely behind  
the scenes, Breuer has been a quiet but dedicated member of 
Clinton's damage-control team. Breuer worked for Manhattan District 
Attorney Robert Morgenthau and joined the law firm of Covington &AMP; 
Burling after his move to Washington. One of his most publicized 
cases was a successful lawsuit against the Clinton administration 
involving a gay Marine who broke Pentagon rules. Breuer began 
working at the White House in 1997 on the recommendation of Charles 
Ruff, who also worked at Covington &AMP; Burling. Breuer was forced to 
testify before the Kenneth Starr grand jury to certify that the 
Clinton administration had complied with subpoenas in the Starr 
investigation. He graduated from Columbia University and Columbia 
Law School.

<HEADLINE> Reno: U.S. Weighs Pinochet Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department is reviewing whether  
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet could be tried in the 
United States for a 1976 car bombing here, Attorney General Janet 
Reno acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has said previously that U.S. officials were trying to help  
Spain obtain secret U.S. documents about Chile during Pinochet's 
17-year rule that began with a 1973 coup. Spanish prosecutors have 
requested the data in their effort to have the 83-year-old general 
extradited from Britain to face trial on charges of genocide, 
terrorism and torture. 
</P>
<P>
	And she has said the U.S. investigation of a deadly 1976 car  
bombing at a traffic circle on Embassy Row here ``was never 
closed'' and is being reviewed ``to see just where we stand with 
respect to the status of the investigation and the circumstances 
that apply now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno was asked if the  
reviewers were looking at ``whether Mr. Pinochet could ever be 
tried in the United States, if it should ever come to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno replied: ``That's what we have under review.''  
</P>
<P>
	The bombing killed former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier, a  
prominent Pinochet critic, and Letelier's colleague, Ronni Moffitt, 
who was a U.S. citizen. A Chilean intelligence operative, Michael 
Townley, was convicted in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Moffitt's relatives have been pressing for a U.S. prosecution of  
Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States remains cautiously neutral about Spain's  
pending prosecution of Pinochet and about a British court's denial 
of immunity for the general, who remains in custody in Britain. A 
recently announced U.S. effort to declassify the papers Spain wants 
has added momentum to the prosecution effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish also are requesting blacked-out portions in U.S.  
documents that already have been partially declassified. For 
example, an April 15, 1975, defense attache intelligence report 
from Chile that identifies Pinochet as sole authority over the 
much-feared DINA, or Chilean internal security apparatus, was 
heavily edited by U.S. censors before its release. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI cable, dated Sept. 28, 1976, says that Operation Condor,  
a joint effort by Chile, Argentina and Uruguay to stamp out leftist 
opposition in exile. The cable notes that the ``most secret phase 
of `Operation Condor' involves the formation of special teams from 
member countries who are to travel anywhere in the world to 
nonmember countries to carry out sanctions up to assassination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable was written a week after the Letelier assassination in  
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI official, writing from Buenos Aires, Argentina, says it  
is ``not beyond the realm of possibility'' that the assassination 
was part of Operation Condor. U.S. prosecutors quickly linked the 
killings to Pinochet's secret police.

<HEADLINE> US, UNSCOM Shared Iraq Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Intelligence cooperation between the United  
States and U.N. inspectors has blurred the line between gathering 
information to counter Iraq's secret weapons work and using it to 
target Saddam Hussein, intelligence experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the overlap rests with the Iraqi president's use of  
special Republican Guard troops both to protect himself and to 
conceal chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs. Also a 
factor is the dual missions of the CIA: gathering information for 
the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, and looking for ways to 
undermine the Saddam regime, which President Clinton says should be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CIA is involved with supporting UNSCOM and on finding ways  
to get rid of the guy (Saddam), which is causing a blurring of 
boundaries,'' said Michael Eisenstadt, an expert on the Iraqi 
military with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practical matter, the UNSCOM inspection regime could not  
have operated without intelligence provided by the United States 
and other countries,'' said Vincent Cannistraro, a former CIA 
official no longer in the government. ``But it's a symbiotic 
relationship. They're (U.N. inspectors) giving you feedback, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Did the U.S. intentionally use UNSCOM for its own national  
intelligence gathering? I don't think that they did, but it's a 
close line, no question,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and U.N. chief weapons inspector  
Richard Butler on Wednesday denied using UNSCOM for U.S. spying 
purposes, but American officials acknowledged gaining valuable 
information about Iraq as a byproduct of cooperation. Even 
published reports by U.N. weapons teams provide plenty of detailed 
information about Iraq's weapons programs, military and internal 
security structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who's shocked -- shocked -- that people who go into Iraq  
come out hopefully better understanding the Iraqi regime I think 
are naive in the extreme,'' State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin said, noting that diplomats from other countries who visit 
the United States also file cables home about what they've learned. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin disputed reports published Wednesday in The Washington  
Post and the Boston Globe suggesting U.S. intelligence directly 
used UNSCOM to penetrate Iraq's security forces and undermine the 
Iraqi regime. ``Our support was specifically tailored to facilitate 
the U.N. Special Commission's mission and for no other purpose,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin noted that U.N. Security Council resolutions call for  
member nations to assist the United Nations in carrying out its 
work in Iraq and that UNSCOM requested intelligence help after Iraq 
tried to ``obstruct and deceive'' weapons inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence provided technical and logistical support to  
U.N. teams, said Rubin, who would not confirm published reports 
that the assistance included eavesdropping on sensitive Iraqi 
communications among Saddam's Republican Guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations, Butler told a news conference that none  
of the U.S. intelligence equipment used to help U.N. weapons 
inspectors included eavesdropping devices. 
</P>
<P>
	UNSCOM first sought intelligence help from other countries in  
1995 because U.N. inspectors ``had been flagrantly deceived by 
Iraq,'' Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 40 countries, including the United States, have provided  
information to UNSCOM with the sole purpose of uncovering weapons, 
Butler insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never accepted or used any of that assistance for any  
other purpose, not for any member state's national purposes,'' 
Butler said, denying persistent Iraqi accusations that U.N. weapons 
inspectors, especially Americans, are spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam agreed to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as  
part of the cease-fire that ended the 1991 Gulf War. Eight-year-old 
economic sanctions can't be lifted until the United Nations affirms 
that Iraq is free of such doomsday devices. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. arms experts pulled out of Iraq Dec. 16 after Butler  
declared that Iraq was not cooperating with his inspectors. The 
report led to four days of U.S. and British missile attacks and 
airstrikes against Iraq. Now, the fate of UNSCOM remains uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Air Sued by Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Planes were blocked at gates, unable to depart. Others were  
backed up on taxiways, unable to reach gates. Passengers said they 
were stuck on board some planes for up to eight hours, exhausted 
and enraged. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly the way Northwest Airlines had hoped to ring in the  
new year. 
</P>
<P>
	But its performance at Detroit Metropolitan Airport during and  
after last weekend's monster snowstorm unleashed a fresh barrage of 
complaints about the nation's fourth-largest carrier, which is 
coming off a rough 1998 that included a costly pilots strike. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, attorney Larry Charfoos filed suit in Wayne County  
Circuit Court against Northwest on behalf of Timothy and Susan 
Koczara of Grosse Pointe, who claim they were on a plane detained 
for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Charfoos said he would seek to have the complaint declared a  
class-action suit so other disgruntled passengers could join. 
Although the county and the airport are named as co-defendants, he 
contends Northwest was primarily at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Northwest has hit a new low ... keeping people prisoner in  
their little containers,'' Charfoos said. ``No passengers have ever 
been locked into airplanes for that long unless there was a hostage 
taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest insists it did the best it could under unusually  
trying circumstances, and says others had a hand in the fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them: the airport, its snow removal contractor and the  
city of Detroit, whose policy of not plowing residential streets 
may have prevented some Northwest employees from getting to work. 
About half of the airline's workers didn't show up Sunday, when 
Northwest resumed incoming flights after canceling them the 
previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at any employer over the weekend, they had the  
same problems,'' Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a blizzard-of-the-decade kind of event. I think  
everybody was frustrated to find themselves in a situation out of 
their control. ... But most people I talked to recognized that, try 
as we might, we don't control the weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts agreed that any airline would have been  
hard-pressed to cope with the storm, which dumped a foot of snow on 
the Detroit area Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airlines are great scapegoats for problems and sometimes they  
bring it on themselves, but it's not always their fault,'' said 
Laurie Berger, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter. 
</P>
<P>
	From April through September of last year Northwest, based in  
Eagan, Minn., was rated the least likely major carrier to arrive on 
time, according to the government's Air Travel Consumer Report. It 
improved to No. 3 in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest also regularly placed near the bottom in handling  
baggage and consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials blamed the poor showing on bad weather and  
labor slowdowns, including the 15-day pilots' strike last summer, 
which produced a third-quarter loss of $223.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline tried to improve public relations in Detroit, its  
largest hub, hiring an additional 208 employees for the summer 
travel season and taking out full-page newspaper ads to apologize 
for the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But even some of its fence-mending efforts have proven  
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest gave away hundreds of flight vouchers to civic and  
business leaders last May during the Detroit Regional Chamber 
Mackinac Conference. Some politicians returned them when critics 
said the handout might violate state lobbying laws. 
</P>
<P>
	To some extent, the complaints about Northwest probably result  
from its dominant position at Detroit Metro, where it accounts for 
75 percent of all flights, said Berger. Similar criticism is 
directed at other airlines in their hub cities, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a lack of competition that does not give airlines  
incentive to provide customer service above and beyond the call of 
duty,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Clammer Dies in Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. (AP) -- The Coast Guard mounted an  
overnight search for three missing crew members of a clamming boat 
that sank off the New Jersey coast. Another man died after an hour 
in the frigid Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard found the 84-foot Beth Dee Bob about 7:30 p.m.  
Wednesday, two hours after the vessel radioed to say it was taking 
on water 15 miles from the Manasquan Inlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Paul Bjornestad, 38, was plucked unconscious from the ocean  
after an hour in 39-degree water. Bjornestad, found wearing a life 
vest and holding onto a flotation ring and strobe light, was 
pronounced dead at 9 p.m. at Jersey Shore Medical Center in 
Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard searched for the remaining crew members with two  
helicopters and two motorized boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Brown, who lived with Bjornestad, told the Star-Ledger  
of Newark that he had survived a similar incident six years ago, 
when a shrimp boat sank off Florida. The entire crew was rescued 
after a wave swamped the vessel 57 miles from shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard petty officer Nicholas Bondarew said he did not know  
what ocean conditions were at the time of Wednesday's accident, but 
there were 12-foot swells during the search. 
</P>
<P>
	William Robbins Jr., a worker for Point Pleasant Packing Inc. in  
Point Pleasant Beach, where the clammer docks, said the Beth Dee 
Bob radioed a distress call to coworkers on shore about 5 p.m. The 
crew reported that bad weather would keep them past their expected 
7 p.m. arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbins said the boat sent a more ominous call a half-hour  
later: ``The last thing we heard, they were taking on water fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that, a signal came in from an electronic  
shipboard device that alerts the Coast Guard when it breaks away 
from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beth Dee Bob caught shellfish for Cape May Foods Inc.  
Company supervisors could not be reached Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> House Opens Congress' 106th Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new Congress convened with promises to  
cooperate on big issues such as Social Security and education, but 
only after first concentrating on the highly partisan impeachment 
trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The House opened the 106th session of Congress on Wednesday by  
electing as its new speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, a soft-spoken 
Midwesterner who urged Democrats to join him in ending the 
political wars that have divided Congress in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	After conducting some housekeeping matters and reappointing the  
13 lawmakers who will prosecute the impeachment case, the House 
recessed until Jan. 19, when the president is scheduled to deliver 
his State of the Union address to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate stayed behind, taking formal steps to begin the trial  
on whether to remove Clinton from office for allegedly lying under 
oath and obstructing justice while trying to conceal his affair 
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., was to  
formally present articles of impeachment to the Senate and Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist was to be sworn in to preside over the 
trial. Rehnquist in turn was administering an oath to the 100 
senators who will sit as a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, an Illinois Republican beginning his seventh term in  
the House, made clear that he wants a change from the 
contentiousness that marked the four years of his predecessor, Rep. 
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of  
bitterness,'' he said in his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will meet you halfway, maybe more so on occasion,'' he told  
the Democrats. ``I expect you to meet me halfway too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, in handing the  
gavel to Hastert, said, ``let's bury the hatchet. ... Let's join 
together, not only in words but in deeds, to do right by the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation will be necessary in a House where Republicans hold  
one of the smallest majorities in recent history. After losing five 
seats in the November elections, Republicans have 222 seats while 
the Democrats have 211. There is one independent who generally 
votes Democratic. Gingrich resigned his seat along with the 
speakership, so there is one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the Republicans maintained their 55-45 majority,  
but that's still well short of the 60 needed to give the party in 
power a free hand to overcome filibusters and move their bills 
through. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,  
said Republicans have four general goals for this session: 
reforming the Social Security system and Medicare; improving 
education, with the emphasis on more local control; tax relief; and 
bolstering the national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to advance on all four fronts -- to enhance  
security, to promote responsibility, to strengthen freedom and to 
foster opportunity for all,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Action in the Senate on Wednesday was mostly behind the scenes,  
as senators struggled to come up with a formula on the length and 
structure of Clinton's impeachment trial. Democrats wanted a short 
trial without witnesses, but many Republicans pressed for a longer 
proceeding with some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief business session, the House voted by voice to ease  
three-year-old rules under which members and staff were barred from 
accepting any gifts from constituents or lobbyists, no matter how 
small. Instead, they adopted Senate rules that allow gifts valued 
at up to $50, with a $100 cap on gifts from any one source in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us, members and staff, have a whole lot more important  
things to do than sit around trying to decide whether a gift of a 
pie or a can of popcorn is acceptable,'' said Rep. James Hansen, 
R-Utah, chairman of the ethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also reappointed 13 House Republicans first named in  
the last session to act as ``managers'' in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats urged rejection of the reappointment, saying it was  
the last chance for the House to end the impeachment process so 
lawmakers could turn to a censure resolution. Members should ``cast 
a vote to really in my view end this nightmare,'' said Rep. Robert 
Menendez, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The managers were reappointed 223-198, with all 218 voting  
Republicans and five Democrats supporting the motion.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls, Japan Stock Prices Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Thursday amid  
renewed concern over Brazil's economy after one of its states 
declared a moratorium on debt payments. Japanese stock prices 
advanced moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 110.98 yen, down 1.54 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 112.66 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 68.10  
points, or 0.51 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,536.56. On 
Wednesday, the average closed up 235.72 points, or 1.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially rose in Tokyo, buoyed by an overnight rally  
on Wall Street, but worries over Brazil and the possibility of a 
drawn-out trial in the U.S. Senate of President Bill Clinton later 
drove the U.S. currency lower against the yen, traders said.

	Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-Amro  
Bank, said news that a Brazilian state suspended debt payments 
prompted some investors to sell dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 110.00 yen and 113.05 yen in  
Thursday's trading.

<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at $1.1642, down from $1.1740 in  
Tokyo late Wednesday but above $1.1592 overnight in New York.

Jones industrial average soared 2.5 percent to close at a record 
high of 9,544.97 points on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley, Lehman Beat Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's investment banking firms shared in  
the spoils of the stock market's recovery at the end of last year, 
with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; 
Co. reporting profits that topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers and acquisitions helped offset the industrywide drop  
in the business of underwriting stocks and bonds. Last year saw a 
record of deal-making, with auto, telecom and oil industries 
consolidating fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley, which ranked third in merger activity in the  
United States last year, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $879 
million, or $1.49 a share, excluding a one-time gain. The record 
profits were 15 percent above the final quarter of 1997, and 
dwarfed analysts' estimates of 96 cents a share, according to First 
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the gain, Morgan Stanley posted profits of $1.22  
billion, or $2.07 a share, for the quarter, compared with $810 
million, or $1.30 a share, in fourth quarter of 1997. The company's 
fiscal year ends Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We achieved a full year record performance despite some very  
difficult conditions,'' said Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's 
chairman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $4 billion, a 6 percent jump from  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Flush with cash, Morgan Stanley said it would buy back $1  
billion of its stock to boost its flagging price, and boost its 
quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share, from 20 cents previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman Brothers reported fourth-quarter earnings of $74 million,  
or 51 cents a share, more than twice the 21 cents analysts 
expected. The results, however, fell 60 percent from Lehman's 
quarter of $185 million, or $1.30 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the period was $665 million, down from $1.02 billion  
in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of both companies were encouraging to investors,  
after reports of the industry's exposure to risky investment funds 
known as hedge funds like Long Term Capital Management, as well as 
rumors about Lehman's financial weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped $2.62 1/2 to $83.31 1/4 in morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Lehman's stock was up 
$1.50 to $55.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Morgan Stanley's net income was $3.05  
billion, or $4.95 a share, excluding non-recurring charges and 
gains. In 1997, Morgan Stanley earned $2.65 billion, or $4.27 a 
share, excluding costs related to its merger with Dean Witter 
Discover. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all costs and charges in 1998, Morgan Stanley earned  
$3.28 billion, or $5.33 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the firm was $16.4 billion, up 11 percent from 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehman's full-year profits were $736 million, or $5.19 per  
share, compared with $647 million, or $4.72 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $4.11 billion vs. $3.87 billion.

<HEADLINE> National Missile Defense Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to put about $7  
billion over a six-year period toward building a national missile 
defense to guard against a ``limited'' missile attack, the 
Pentagon's spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is supposed to protect the nation against ballistic  
missile attack, but the technology for building it has not yet been 
proven. Proponents say a limited missile shield is needed to 
protect against an accidental launch of a nuclear missile or an 
attack by a rogue nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters at a  
briefing that Clinton will not make any decision about building 
such a system until several critical tests are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of decision points ahead of us,'' Bacon  
said, noting in particular a critical test scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds will be part of Clinton's new budget for the year  
2000, which will be sent to Congress next month. It also includes 
long-term spending plans for up to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon declined to specify how the $7 billion would be dispersed  
among those years within the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Capitol Hill have made increased funding for  
national security spending and missile defense top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Although $40 billion has been spent toward developing such a  
system since former President Reagan announced his ambitious 
Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983, no working system is yet in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan -- criticized by Republicans -- has been  
to develop a national ballistic missile defense by 2000. Then, 
depending on an assessment of threat levels, it could put the plan 
in place within another three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue it should be put in place as soon as  
technologically feasible, arguing that Iran and North Korea are 
developing weapons that could threaten the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon defended the administration's plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our basic program is on track, which is to develop, work to  
develop a national missile defense system that has the capability 
of providing defense against a limited attack; that is, a 
relatively small attack,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The development phase is set to continue to the year 2000, and  
at that point we'll make a decision whether to begin deploying the 
system, or it could be made after that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said, ``There will be money included in the future year  
defense plan, approximately $7 billion, to give us the option of 
moving toward deployment should that decision be made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system envisioned under the Clinton plan differs  
substantially from the ``Star Wars'' system proposed by Reagan in 
1983. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative proposed a space-based 
shield against massive attacks involving thousands of warheads 
launched simultaneously by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan would consist of ground-based radar and  
ground-launched interceptor rockets. Infrared detectors in space 
would pinpoint the plume of an attacking missile and use satellites 
to convey information about an incoming missile track to the 
interceptors.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Look To Deal Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The NBA lockout may be settled, but the  
Golden State Warriors still have a dilemma -- Latrell Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry St. Jean, the team's general manager, is looking to trade  
Sprewell as quickly as possible and confirmed talks with several 
teams around the league -- but would not name them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't hid the fact that we're going to make a deal as  
fast as we can for Latrell,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hopes to get at least two quality players for Sprewell,  
who choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a practice session 
Dec. 1, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors immediately terminated the remainder of Sprewell's  
three-year contract, worth as much as $24 million, and the league 
imposed a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	But an arbitrator later reinstated Sprewell to the team and cut  
his suspension to the 68 remaining games of the 1997-98 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we do get two people to come in, they're not going to be  
the 11th and 12th guys on the roster,'' St. Jean said. ``We think 
they're going to be guys who can play, guys that have good careers, 
and have been with good teams. We're going to feel good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlesimo downplayed the choking incident but when asked if  
there was a chance of keeping the three-time All-Star, he said, ``I 
think anything is possible, but it would be difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors' other concern is signing Antawn Jamison, the North  
Carolina forward they acquired with a draft-day trade. Carlesimo 
hopes Jamison can help the team turn around its dismal 19-63 record 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors don't figure to have much room under this year's  
$30 million salary cap to pursue free agents.

<HEADLINE> Latin Americans Awarded Reparations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A settlement approves cash reparations to some  
but not all ethnic Japanese Latin Americans held in American 
detention camps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department and a group of former internees settled a  
class-action lawsuit Thursday after a federal judge and several 
people in the aging group said even a flawed settlement is better 
than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the real world we make compromises. We try to do the best  
we can,'' said Federal Claims Court Judge Loren Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,200 ethnic Japanese were taken from their homes in  
13 Latin American countries and taken by the American military to 
camps in Louisiana, Texas and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, thousands of ethnic Japanese living in the  
United States, the overwhelming majority of them U.S. citizens, 
were interned in separate camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Latin Americans of Japanese descent were excluded from the  
$1.6 billion reparations program established in 1988 to compensate 
Japanese-Americans who were relocated or had property seized by the 
government after Japanese warplanes bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement approved Thursday, 676 eligible former  
Latin American internees are entitled to payments of $5,000 each, 
but only about half the aging former internees will get any money. 
The fund set up to pay reparations is almost dry, and Congress has 
not added to it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department will pay the oldest of the group first  
and work backward, attorney Elizabeth Strange told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement also includes a letter of apology from President  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a significant step in that we're trying to right some  
wrongs, ... yet it is a small step,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of Latin American former internees sued for reparations  
in 1996. The settlement was proposed in June last year, and former 
internees had about two months to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The money to pay the $5,000 settlements is essentially the dregs  
of the fund established to pay $20,000 settlements to eligible 
Japanese-Americans. The 10-year reparation program officially ended 
last summer, and the office that administered it will close next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to the ethnic Japanese Latin Americans, Clinton  
noted the fund may not be large enough and said he supports adding 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think for me and my family it does give a sense of  
finality,'' said Kazuo Matsubayashi, who was taken captive in Lima, 
Peru, in 1943, when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't relive the life again, so you have to go on,'' said  
Matsubayashi, now 62 and living in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Matsubayashi does not know whether he will be among between 375  
and 400 former internees the Justice Department expects to 
compensate.

<HEADLINE> QB Couch Leaves Kentucky for NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Late in the season, Kentucky football fans  
chanted, ``One more year.'' It was not to be -- Tim Couch is heading 
to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	He is skipping his senior season to enter the NFL draft, where  
millions of dollars await him as a potential No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made my decision and I'm going into the NFL draft,''  
Couch said at a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's announcement, just one day before the NFL's deadline for  
early entries to its draft, ended months of questions and weeks of 
speculation that had reached high pitch in the days since 
Kentucky's season ended Jan. 1 with a 26-14 loss in the Outback 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's decision to turn pro will give the expansion Cleveland  
Browns an opportunity to make him the No. 1 pick. Browns president 
Carmen Policy has said he is open to taking a franchise quarterback 
if one is available. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL prohibits teams from commenting on underclassmen who are  
leaving school early until the league releases its list of players 
on Monday. So the Browns, who could be torn between taking Couch or 
Texas running back Ricky Williams, won't be able to discuss their 
plans with the No. 1 pick until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scouts believe Couch -- with his size (6-foot-5, 225  
pounds), accuracy, touch and experience in Kentucky's pro-style 
passing offense -- is that kind of prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as last Friday, after the Outback Bowl, Couch said  
he was ``50-50'' on whether to turn pro or return to Lexington for 
a fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a competitive person, and I want to compete  
at the highest level,'' Couch said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was big news in Lexington, where four local  
television stations carried Couch's announcement live -- even on a 
day when the U.S. Senate was beginning a presidential impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildcat fans had made their feelings known in November, when  
they serenaded the quarterback with a chant of ``One more year! One 
more year!'' as he stood on the sideline late in Kentucky's final 
home game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In conversations and on Internet forums, though, most were  
resigned to the inevitability of Couch's departure and 
understanding of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wore No. 2 on his jersey, Couch has been No. 1 in the  
heart of Kentucky football fans since 1996, when the record-setting 
high school quarterback from the Appalachian town of Hyden spurned 
scholarship offers from Penn State, Florida and Tennessee to attend 
his home-state university. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch did not enjoy immediate success in then-coach Bill Curry's  
conservative offense, and considered transferring after his 
freshman season. Curry was fired midway through the season, 
however, and Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton replaced him 
with Hal Mumme, a pass-oriented coach from Division II Valdosta 
(Ga.) State. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch stayed and blossomed under Mumme and his wide-open ``Air  
Raid'' attack. In two seasons, he passed for 73 touchdowns and more 
than 8,500 yards. He leaves Kentucky with 26 school records, 14 
Southeastern Conference records and four NCAA marks. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns and  
completed Kentucky's transformation from an SEC doormat to 
contender. The Wildcats finished with a 7-4 regular-season record 
and earned a berth in the Outback Bowl, the school's first bowl in 
five years and first Jan. 1 bowl since 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch finished fourth in balloting for this year's Heisman  
Trophy. He also was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award as the 
nation's top college quarterback and was chosen SEC Player of the 
Year.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Soccer Tycoon Gil Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARBELLA, Spain (AP) -- Marbella's mayor Jesus Gil was jailed  
Thursday on suspicion of funneling municipal funds to Atletico de 
Madrid, the soccer team he owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Santiago Torres, an investigating magistrate in this  
Mediterranean resort, ordered Gil held without bail after the 
tycoon was charged with embezzlement and fraud, Spanish news 
agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil's lawyer said he would file an appeal and denied the charges  
against his client. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil, speaking to reporters as he entered prison in the town of  
Alhaurin de la Torre, dismissed the judge's move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is fine, and I am relaxed,'' Gil said. ``I am going  
to jail. This way the lynching campaign against me is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor said there was evidence  
that in 1991 and 1992 Gil diverted $3.1 million to Atletico de 
Madrid, the soccer team of which he is president and owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor also said Gil tampered with contracts signed by  
the town hall and Atletico de Madrid, which is one of the top teams 
in the first division of the Spanish soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Gil broke in October when police raided the  
Marbella city hall and the team's offices in Madrid. No arrests 
were made. 
</P>
<P>
	Gil is no stranger to controversy. He already faced a fine for  
publicly accusing the chairman of another club, FC Barcelona's 
Josep Lluis Nunez, of ``buying off'' referees. 
</P>
<P>
	A court ruled that Gil had made ``insidious insinuations,'' and  
``directly offensive comments,'' during a radio interview almost a 
year ago that amounted to ``an illegitimate attack on the honor of 
Nunez,'' Spanish daily El Periodico reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the amount of the fine had not been determined.  
</P>
<P>
	Gil was fined $10,000 in March for insulting officials FIFA,  
soccer's international governing body.

<HEADLINE> Stopping Moss Key for Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Stop Randy Moss from going deep? Sure, it can  
be done. The Washington Redskins did it, or at least Darrell Green 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most intriguing individual duels of the regular  
season for the Minnesota Vikings, Green gave away 8 inches to Moss, 
but still repeatedly kept the talented rookie from scoring on a 
long pass. 
</P>
<P>
	So if you've got one of the NFL's best cornerbacks it is  
possible to keep Moss, whose 17 touchdown catches led the league, 
from breaking a game open. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news for the Arizona Cardinals this weekend, right? They've  
got Aeneas Williams, who was voted to his fifth straight Pro Bowl 
and had two interceptions in last Saturday's playoff upset at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	That day Green outdueled Moss? The Vikings won 41-7.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven other Vikings caught at least one pass in that game, and  
Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard combined for three rushing TDs. It 
stands as a perfect example of the balance that led the Vikings 
(15-1) to the most points in NFL history and the league's best 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	That's also the reason the Vikings are expected to crush the  
Cardinals (10-7) on Sunday -- the spread is 15 points, whopping by 
playoff standards -- and advance to the NFC championship game for 
the first time in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Moss) is going to be a challenge back there, and we're  
looking forward to the challenge,'' said Williams, who ended 
Michael Irvin's string of consecutive games with a catch at 117 
this season. ``I think we'll do an assortment of things, but 
certainly we're looking at it from the standpoint of an entire 
receiving corps, including the tight end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess our thinking as a secondary is that we have to contain  
these guys, and that's our main focus this week. Moss is a big part 
of the package, but you can't dismiss the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, yeah. The other guys.  
</P>
<P>
	Six members of Minnesota's offense were chosen for the Pro Bowl,  
including Moss and three-fifths of the offensive line. Kicker Gary 
Anderson hasn't missed a kick all season -- no kicker ever had a 
perfect year before -- and scored 164 points, the second-most in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings, who have never won a Super Bowl and haven't even  
gotten there in 22 years, also expect receiver Jake Reed to return 
Sunday after a five-game layoff following back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	They are healthy, confident and rested, and are looking forward  
to re-introducing their overwhelming offense to the rest of the 
league following their first postseason bye week since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to come out and hit them with everything  
we've got,'' Moss said. ``There is no holding back. ... We've got 
to come out and hit whoever is open, because we're going for it 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giving themselves even a chance to win Sunday will be a  
monumental task for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	They dominated Dallas for the organization's first playoff win  
in 51 years, but the Cowboys are an aging team seemingly on the 
decline. The Vikings are an emerging, hungry team with withering 
speed throughout the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals know they must run the ball effectively, something  
they have struggled to do this season, against a Minnesota defense 
that has allowed an average of 77 yards rushing the last six games. 
Carried out over a full season, that would have ranked third in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also are hoping the Vikings might be a little  
sluggish following their week off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's one advantage that we have right now,'' tackle  
Lomas Brown said. ``The thing about being off is you're not at that 
level you need to be at, meaning you haven't been going to 
meetings, you've been kind of lax, sitting back and watching other 
people play. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you haven't had to get your motor going and revved up to  
get ready for this, and it might take them a couple of series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bet on it, say the Vikings.  
</P>
<P>
	They've won their last seven games by at least 10 points each,  
and have only trailed twice since taking their only loss at Tampa 
Bay on Nov. 1. They have done a remarkable job of steering clear of 
letdowns all season and believe there is little chance of that 
happening now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go out there and we're going to play and we're  
going to do what we want to do offensively,'' Pro Bowl receiver 
Cris Carter said. ``We plan on dictating the tempo of the game and 
the style of the game to the defense.''

<HEADLINE> Frazier Wishes Jones a Happy 30th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Rick Frazier was happy to wish Roy Jones  
Jr. a happy birthday because his presence in Jones' hometown means 
he's getting a ``gift'' all fighters long for -- a title shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the New York City police officer is given little  
chance of taking the WBC-WBA light heavyweight titles from Jones on 
Saturday night could not sour his mood Thursday at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're 30 now, you don't look so young,'' said Frazier, who  
will be 40 on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones wanted to fight in his hometown to mark his birthday, but  
he won't be 30 until Jan. 16. He wanted to fight then, but couldn't 
because Mike Tyson begins his latest comeback in a pay-per-view 
fight on that date against Francois Botha at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jones-Frazier fight at the Pensacola Civic Center will be  
the second half of an HBO doubleheader. The telecast will begin at 
10 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first match, 27-year-old Shane Mosley will defend the IBF  
lightweight title against 24-year-old Golden Johnson, who got his 
title shot three weeks ago after Australian Justin Rowsell, who was 
Mosley's scheduled opponent, got knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones insisted that Mosley be on the card.  
</P>
<P>
	``Shane has everything,'' Jones said of Mosley (30-0, 28  
knockouts). ``He's one of the best fighters out there. People 
should see him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Mosley could be the second-best pound-for-pound fighter  
in the world, Jones said, ``Easily.'' Jones (38-1 with 32 
knockouts, a former middleweight and super middleweight champion) 
is considered by many boxing people, including himself, to be the 
No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second time Mosley, of Pomona, Calif., has  
preceded Jones on an HBO doubleheader. He stopped James Leija in 
the ninth round last Nov. 14 before Jones stopped Otis Grant in the 
10th round at Foxwoods Resort Casino at Mashantucket, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy he's welcomed me to fight in his hometown on the  
same card with him,'' Mosley said. ``We complement each other's 
style. He's a boxer-puncher. So am I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frazier, a cop for 17 years, has fought only 22 times. He's  
18-3-1 with seven knockouts in a pro career that began in 1992, and 
there has been criticism of his No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed Frazier shrugs off the criticism. It only  
matters to him that he's getting a title shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (15-2-2, 10 knockouts), of Wichita Falls, Texas, also is  
happy to be in Pensacola -- and a bit surprised because he lost his 
last fight on a 12-round decision to Israel Cardona in a non-world 
title fight Oct. 16 in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson believes he won that fight, and so does Jack Mosley,  
Shane's father, manager and trainer.

<HEADLINE> No Deaths on US Air Carriers in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. airline and commuter carriers flew 615  
million passengers in 1998, and for apparently the first time in 
the history of commercial aviation, they did so without a single 
passenger fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least two other years no one died in the crash of a U.S.  
jetliner, most recently 1993. But since the National Transportation 
Safety Board began compiling statistics in 1967, such zeros have 
always been offset by deaths in smaller, generally 
propeller-driven, commuter airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, however, no passenger died in an accident involving a  
scheduled U.S. commercial flight. That silent achievement stands in 
contrast to the public outcry after the TWA and ValuJet crashes in 
1996 killed a combined total of 340. The same year a United Express 
commuter accident in Quincy, Ill., killed all 12 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Government, aviation safety and airline officials were heartened  
by the latest news, but they were also quick to say that even in 
years when there are passenger deaths, the U.S. aviation system 
remains the safest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there is an accident, it's just by the grace of God  
whether there are a lot of people killed or not,'' Stuart Matthews, 
president of the Flight Safety Foundation, an industry trade group, 
said this week. ``The truth is, these are very random things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokesman Les Dorr said 1998's zero-fatality count ``was the  
result of the things that we and our industry partners have been 
doing every day to make sure that flying remains the safest form of 
transportation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the FAA, the airlines and the aerospace industry  
announced a goal to cut the aviation accident rate by 80 percent by 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the things they are targeting are crashes in which pilots  
become disoriented and fly perfectly workable planes into terrain 
around an airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that safety commitment, experts say, a coming boom in  
worldwide aviation could result in an airplane crash each week. 
</P>
<P>
	The safety drive came two years after ValuJet Flight 592 plunged  
into the Florida Everglades, killing 110, and TWA Flight 800 
exploded off Long Island, killing 230. The crashes prompted 
criticism of the FAA and Federico Pena, then transportation 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators later traced the ValuJet crash to a cargo fire,  
prompting the FAA to order airlines to install systems that detect 
and fight cargo fires. Investigators still do not know what caused 
the TWA explosion, but they suspect sparks from wiring around the 
plane's center fuel tank. That has prompted a series of new 
inspection orders for U.S. aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board deferred comment on the  
lack of fatalities in 1998, waiting for official confirmation from 
the FAA. The airlines were pleased by the news, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the final numbers are in, we expect we will have carried  
615 million passengers last year,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman 
for the Air Transport Association, which represents the major 
airlines. ``Without a fatality, that's a wonderful statistic. Zero 
fatalities have to be our goal every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 numbers do not include the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair  
Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, which killed all 229 aboard. While that 
flight departed from New York bound for Geneva, it did not involve 
a U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures also do not include a Nov. 4 incident in which a  
Northwest Airlines baggage handler was killed when she walked into 
the turning propeller blades of a commuter plane as it readied for 
takeoff in Memphis, Tenn. The plane was carrying eight passengers, 
none of whom was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB said the last time a passenger died in a U.S. airline  
accident was Dec. 28, 1997, when a woman suffered a fatal head 
injury after a United Airlines plane hit turbulence during a flight 
from Tokyo to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The last fatal commuter crash in NTSB records occurred on Nov.  
8, 1997, when a Hageland Aviation Services Cessna 208B crashed in 
Barrow, Alaska, killing seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary figures show that 598 people were killed in general  
aviation accidents in 1998, including crashes of private and 
corporate planes. Also, 17 people were killed -- 15 in Alaska alone 
-- in crashes of air taxis. They are not scheduled airlines, but 
for-hire commercial airplanes.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Molesting Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two teen-age boys told police that an episode of  
``The Jerry Springer Show'' about incest gave them idea to molest 
their 8-year-old half-sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 13 and 15, were arrested Dec. 11 in nearby  
Hollywood and charged with sexual battery and lewd and lascivious 
acts. Police said the older boy confessed to having sex with the 
girl, whose disclosures to a teacher led to police involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This 15-year-old showed no emotion, he showed no concern, he  
showed no remorse,'' Detective Curt Navarro said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State attorneys will decide whether the 15-year-old will be  
prosecuted as an adult. His brother is charged as a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro said he asked the older boy, ``How did you learn this?''  
The teen responded that he saw a Springer show on incest. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Shafran, a spokeswoman for the controversial syndicated  
talk show, said she cannot specifically recall any show on incest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never had a show that is even remotely close to this  
situation, and unfortunately there are situations in the world for 
which we are blamed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurned lovers, cross-dressers and people in dysfunctional  
relationships get into confrontations that turn into brawls on the 
show that has challenged Oprah Winfrey's program for top ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed last year in Connecticut, a 16-year-old boy  
claimed the Chicago-based show sparked a fight that left him with a 
broken jaw and other injuries. In another case, four girls in New 
York City were suspended after beating their sixth-grade teacher 
for refusing to turn on the show on a classroom television. 
</P>
<P>
	A threatened boycott of the show last April prompted producers  
to issue a no-violence pledge, but the fights resumed as ratings 
began to slide.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Senate Run Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could the first lady soon be a junior senator?  
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters are quietly circulating her  
name as a possible candidate to run for the Senate from New York in 
2000, replacing retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
She has not ruled out a Senate campaign, and casually has discussed 
the possibility with intimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's aware that people are speculating about what she might  
do in 2000, but at this point she has no plans to run for elective 
office,'' said spokeswoman Marsha Berry. ``For the next two years, 
she wants to make the most out of being first lady. I'm not in the 
position to rule it out. I'm just telling you I can't tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all of whom spoke on  
condition of anonymity, said she is not actively considering the 
campaign -- at least not yet. But they say there is something to all 
the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	One close friend said this week that she has talked to the first  
lady about possibly running for the Senate seat. The conversations 
were casual and not substantial, but Mrs. Clinton knows friends are 
circulating her name, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading Democratic official in New York said allies of Mrs.  
Clinton have discussed a possible bid with state leaders. It does 
not appear to be an organized, aggressive operation, but the talk 
helped sparked the recent spate of rumors, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official close to the Clintons said the first  
lady would not rule out a campaign because she cannot give it 
serious consideration until after the Monica Lewinsky controversy 
subsides. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, she probably will take a look at it, though the  
official said his best guess is she will not run. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment was echoed by several others close to the first  
lady, who say no polling or political organizing has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are definite signs of a whisper campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York Democratic Party, said  
Mrs. Clinton asked her several months ago not to encourage 
speculation about running for the Senate. ``I would be surprised if 
this is what she chose to do,'' Hope said Thursday, echoing her 
comments to other news organizations in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, she called back to say, ``I have reason to  
believe that my comments have been too negative. If she decides to 
run, it would be terribly thrilling. ... I have reason to believe 
this possibility has not been ruled out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hope would not say what prompted her to suddenly view a  
Hillary-for-Senate campaign in a less negative light, though a 
spokesman later said she had talked to state politicians, including 
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel has urged Mrs. Clinton to run for the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	Friends say Mrs. Clinton has several political options opened to  
her, including seeking Senate seats in Illinois or California and 
even a presidential race somewhere down the line. Given the 
family's massive legal debt, they say, she may instead join 
corporate boards, return to practicing law or write a book to make 
serious money. 
</P>
<P>
	She has never been a hotter political commodity.  
</P>
<P>
	With the scandal-ridden president a liability to most campaigns,  
Mrs. Clinton was a big draw in the 1998 midterm elections and 
addressed fawning New York audiences. Polls show a healthy majority 
of Americans view her favorably. In New York, one poll on 
prospective Senate candidates showed her in a dead heat with 
Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is not the only potential New York Senate candidate  
with White House ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov.  
Mario Cuomo, is expected to announce by early next week whether or 
not he will run. If Cuomo sought the seat, Mrs. Clinton would be 
unlikely to challenge him, say allies of both. If Cuomo bows out, 
speculation about a first lady candidacy would skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, no longer  
is giving the race a serious look. 
</P>
<P>
	John Marino, former New York party chairman, said he would love  
to see Mrs. Clinton run but she must decide quickly. Other 
potential Democratic candidates need a heads up, he said, and she 
cannot wait much longer to start raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency would not be a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the state Board of Elections, said  
she would have until Election Day to rent or buy in New York. 
Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New York when he won a Senate 
seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting elected would be tougher. Party leaders say New Yorkers  
would not be dazzled by the ``first lady'' title. The state media 
would be typically hard-knuckled. No politicians, Democratic or 
Republican, would pull their punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bill Cunningham, a Moynihan adviser: ``I don't know if  
everybody will put their ambitions on hold just because the first 
lady wants to become senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on a possible Senate campaign for Mrs. Clinton  
intensified when Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said Sunday that 
Mrs. Clinton might run, though his spokeswoman said Wednesday that 
the senator has no inside knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli has used intermediaries to urge the first lady to  
run, White House aides say.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Children Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. JOHN, Fla. (AP) -- A 13-year-old girl and her  
12-year-old brother shot their father's live-in girlfriend to death 
because they thought she was taking their father away from them, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Jones and Curtis Fairchild Jones were charged with killing  
Sonya Nicole Speights, 29, a teaching assistant at a junior high 
school. She was shot in the chest and found dead Wednesday in the 
master bedroom at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said the youngsters confessed to the crime.  
</P>
<P>
	``For the last week or two weeks they had planned to kill the  
victim and make it look like a burglary or an accident,'' said 
sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Evers. 
</P>
<P>
	The children used their father's gun, which they had taken  
several days before the slaying, Evers said. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor called 911 to report the shooting after one of the  
children went to the neighbor's home. The neighbor said the 
children claimed they were playing with the gun when it went off 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
	The children ran away when the neighbor called 911 but were  
found Thursday in the woods a few miles from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will decide what degree of murder the children will  
be charged with and whether they can be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amazed,'' Evers said. ``I can't imagine a 12- and a  
13-year-old making such a heinous plot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children's attorney, Tony Hernandez III, said the children  
were remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in total shock -- extremely remorseful,'' Hernandez  
said. ``They could not understand what had happened, especially the 
younger boy -- constant tears, shaking, crying incredibly.'' He said 
he will challenge the legality of the children's confession.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Wait To View Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shivering from the cold and perhaps from  
excitement, too, Suzanne Garrow said she felt lucky to be in line 
today for the opening of President Clinton's impeachment trial in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to see what could be the trial of the century,'' said  
Garrow, a 36-year-old lawyer from Northampton, Mass. ``I've been 
involved in a lot of trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people waited in clear, cold weather outside the East  
Front of the Capitol for the 50 impeachment trial tickets set aside 
for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	At least on this first day, Senate officials planned to rotate  
the seats every few minutes so that more people would get a chance 
to witness the first impeachment trial since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those interviewed said they were drawn by history and a  
chance to see the Constitution brought to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Marks, 28, a George Mason University law student from  
Cincinnati, said he was hoping the proceedings ``are not a sham 
process and that the Constitution is respected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here to show my support for the Constitution and, I  
guess, the pageantry of it all,'' Marks added. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to check out the scene and be a part of  
history,'' said Stevan Johnson, 31, of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Capitol, there were many more news cameras than usual  
with photographers scrambling when anyone moved outside the main 
Senate door. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 13 House managers waited to be admitted into the chamber,  
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., came by. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the bank of cameras, frustration briefly flashed across  
his face, but that was quickly replaced by a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crowding our door,'' he said, turning to go through  
another entrance around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Although history was surely in the air, the Senate began its  
morning in the same mundane way it often does -- with a ``quorum 
call,'' which is usually a holding action that uses up time until 
business is ready to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes before 10 a.m., Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,  
rapped the Senate into order with a warning: 
</P>
<P>
	``Either take your seats or be in the cloakroom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Backs Stricter Nasdaq Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have approved a sweeping  
proposal by the dealers' group that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market to 
tighten disclosure requirements for companies seeking special 
over-the-counter listings of their stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the National Association of Securities Dealers is  
aimed at distancing the nation's second-largest stock market from 
cheap, high-risk stocks, sometimes called ``penny stocks,'' that 
are thinly traded and loosely regulated and have had problems with 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The change could result in the removal of thousands of small and  
speculative stocks from the listings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday approved the  
proposal made a year ago by Nasdaq's parent organization to strip 
from the OTC Bulletin Board, an electronic market of about 6,800 
securities, stocks of any companies that don't file financial 
disclosure statements with the SEC or banking or insurance 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the stocks listed on the Bulletin Board do not submit  
such reports, according to the NASD, which announced the SEC's 
approval on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq runs the Bulletin Board, but its stocks are not actually  
listed on the Nasdaq market because they don't meet Nasdaq listing 
standards or don't file disclosure statements with the SEC. The 
Bulletin Board stocks often are linked with Nasdaq's name, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The new filing requirement for companies will protect investors  
in Bulletin Board stocks by giving them access to companies' 
financial information, the NASD said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thorough and accurate information is the foundation of sound  
investment decisions,'' Frank Zarb, NASD's chairman and chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. He called the move ``a 
major step toward improving the quality'' of the market for 
small-company stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman John Heine declined comment on the matter.  
</P>
<P>
	The new requirement also means that the companies will be  
subject to closer oversight by the SEC and other watchdog agencies. 
The filing requirement will be phased in over a 12-month period 
beginning in July and continuing through June 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Market analysts have said the stocks that are removed could  
still be listed on the so-called Pink Sheets, a less automated 
system not affiliated with Nasdaq -- but would be more difficult to 
trade.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom May Bid for AirTouch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom reportedly plans to offer more than  
$55 billion for AirTouch Communications Inc., potentially creating 
a three-way bidding brawl for the nation's largest independent 
wireless phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported in today's editions that the bid could be  
announced as early as this week. MCI WorldCom spokesman Jim Monroe 
declined comment on the report this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based AirTouch previously confirmed it was in  
separate merger discussions with Bell Atlantic Corp., the Baby Bell 
company providing local and cellular phone service in the East, and 
with Britain's biggest mobile phone company, Vodafone Group PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	AirTouch shares have climbed this week amid the reports of the  
buyout talks, rising $2.37 1/2 a share to close at a 52-week high of 
$79.87 1/2 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic was reportedly discussing making an offer of $45  
billion in stock for AirTouch, and Vodafone was reportedly prepared 
to top that offer with a mix of cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the product of WorldCom's acquisition last year of  
MCI Communications Corp., is the nation's second largest 
long-distance carrier after AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said MCI WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers  
decided this week to break from his earlier resistance to entering 
the wireless market. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the MCI WorldCom bid would be entirely in  
stock.

<HEADLINE> USDA Searching for Black Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major advertising campaign will kick off  
soon to locate black farmers who may be eligible to join a 
multimillion-dollar settlement with the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys announced late Tuesday that a settlement had been  
reached in the 1997 racial discrimination lawsuit, ending more than 
two years of sometimes-contentious negotiations. Black farmers sued 
because they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge gave preliminary approval to the deal, which  
covers black farmers from 1981 to 1996. Final approval is expected 
at a hearing on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
	To let farmers know about the settlement, the advertising  
campaign will include commercials on Black Entertainment Television 
and CNN as well as newspaper ads in 18 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Ads are also being placed in TV Guide and Jet Magazine. An  
800-telephone number has been set up to take calls from farmers 
wanting to join the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA also plans to work with community organizations in getting  
the word out to black farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings are being scheduled in Mississippi, Alabama, South  
Carolina and Arkansas so that attorneys can meet with farmers and 
review their cases. A meeting in Albany, Ga., has been scheduled 
for Feb. 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``This expedited procedure is truly unique,'' said plaintiffs'  
attorney Phil Fraas, adding that it should take less than six to 
eight months to process cases. ``It is designed to give farmers 
speedy action on complaints that have languished at USDA for years 
-- or in some cases decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement has several tracks under which farmers who have  
documented their discrimination can get relief. The majority of 
farmers are expected to take a simpler provision that would give 
them tax-free payments of $50,000 each and forgive their government 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers with more documented evidence of their discrimination  
can opt to go before an independent arbitrator and seek larger 
damages. Farmers may also choose to opt out of the lawsuit and have 
their cases settled administratively within USDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The exact cost of the settlement is unclear because it is not  
yet known how many farmers will join the class and which settlement 
options they will choose. It could surpass $300 million to $400 
million, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Alexander Pires said he expects a class of  
about 5,000 black farmers, 10 percent of the 50,000 black farmers 
in the country in the early 1980s. He says attorneys have located 
almost 2,000 black farmers. To help locate more, a major 
advertising campaign will kick off on television, in magazines and 
in hundreds of newspapers within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $450,000 advertising campaign is being paid for by the  
Agriculture Department under the settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- The toll-free number for black farmers wishing  
to join the settlement is 1-800-646-2873.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Considers White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Former Gov. Lamar Alexander is inching  
closer to a second run for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he would form a presidential exploratory  
committee Friday and announce his political intentions ``in a 
month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press in Washington on  
Thursday, Alexander took a swipe at another potential Republican 
presidential candidate -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 1996,  
said he has a problem with Bush's political slogan, ``compassionate 
conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are weasel words,'' he said. ``Compassionate  
conservative is just like Al Gore talking about `practical 
idealism.' They're designed to mean nothing ... I think we need to 
say in plain words, `I am a conservative.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for Bush, responded to Alexander's  
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Governor Bush says `compassionate conservative' he is  
saying a conservative philosophy is a compassionate philosophy,'' 
she said. ``Teaching people to read is both compassionate and 
conservative. Moving people from welfare to work is both 
compassionate and conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesperson Chris Lehane also deflected Alexander's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that former Gov. Alexander has joined the  
Republican attack pack by engaging in this politics of personal 
destruction, rather than following Vice President Gore's lead which 
is focusing on the best way to prepare America for the 21st 
century,'' Lehane said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 59, was Tennessee governor from 1979-87. He also was  
president of the University of Tennessee and the U.S. secretary of 
education under President George Bush, the Texas governor's father.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Accused of Negligence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly five years after 16-year-old Robert  
Robles was slain during a fight over a neighborhood baseball game, 
his death has raised a high-stakes question in a federal courtroom: 
Was it the gun industry's fault? 
</P>
<P>
	The families of Robles and six other shooting victims have sued  
the firearms industry, accusing dozens of manufacturers and 
distributors of feeding an underground market that puts guns in the 
hands of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a simple case about accepting responsibility,''  
plaintiffs' attorney Elisa Barnes told jurors as the trial opened 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry lawyer Anne Kimball countered by labeling the suit an  
attempt to ``to shift the blame away from the cold-blooded killers 
in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit -- brought in 1995 by Freddie Hamilton, a Brooklyn  
woman whose son was gunned down two years earlier -- is viewed as a 
precursor to upcoming legal challenges by cities hoping to recover 
the costs of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit's central claim is that about 30 gun manufacturers and  
15 gun distributors ``oversupply'' certain markets where gun laws 
are lax, all the while knowing that the extra guns end up in the 
hands of criminals in states with stricter controls -- like New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those expected to testify is Stephen Fox, 19, the sole  
survivor among the seven victims. Fox -- who still has a bullet 
lodged in his head -- was shot by a neighbor who had bought the 
handgun off the black market, Barnes told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to ask you why was that gun so easily available, out  
of the trunk of a car, on a street in Queens,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense said gun manufacturers should not be held  
accountable for criminal sale and use of a heavily regulated item. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns used in crimes are bad -- we're all in agreement on  
that,'' Kimball said. ``Nonetheless, guns are a legal, legitimate 
product in America ... This case is not a referendum on handguns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Beretta USA Corp., Ruger &AMP;  
Co., Accu-Tek and the other defendants also complained that the 
plaintiffs have never conclusively linked the weapons used to harm 
their relatives to specific gun manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Court Judge Jack Weinstein has allowed the  
plaintiffs to argue the ``chain of title'' is irrelevant. What 
matters, they argue, is that the industry creates a widespread risk 
with indiscriminate marketing -- a concept know as collective 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley used similar logic in filing a  
$433 million lawsuit against the firearms industry late last year. 
That suit accuses gun makers of saturating his city with more 
weapons than could ever be sold to law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans is pursuing a similar suit, while other cities,  
including Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, are also 
considering taking gun makers to court.

<HEADLINE> Previous Impeachment Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Previous impeachment efforts against presidents:  
</P>
<P>
	--Andrew Johnson, 1868: Accused of violating the Constitution and  
the Tenure of Office Act by removing the secretary of war. The 
Senate fell one vote short of ousting Johnson, who completed his 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	--Richard Nixon, 1974: Accused of crimes stemming from the 1972  
Watergate break-in. After months of preliminary hearings, the House 
Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974, voted 27-11 in favor of the 
first article, obstruction of justice. On July 29, it passed the 
second, abuse of power. The following day, it approved a third and 
final article, defiance of committee subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon's fate was sealed Aug. 5, when he was forced to surrender  
tape-recorded conversations in which he is heard ordering the CIA 
to obstruct and halt the FBI investigation of the break-in. He 
resigned Aug. 9 rather than face almost certain ouster.

<HEADLINE> Tintin Going Strong in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)-- Tintin turns 70 on Sunday, and though he  
has almost outgrown his target audience -- children from 7 to 77 -- 
his appeal remains timeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the reporter with the blond tuft of hair first appeared  
January 10, 1929 in the ``Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the 
Soviets,'' he and his talking dog Snowy have confronted mad 
scientists and spies around the globe -- and earned the adulation of 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tintin is there to keep justice and promote friendship, so it  
is a very humanitarian theme,'' said Tchang Yi-Fei, who runs a 
boutique in Brussels devoted to Tintin. She also is the daughter of 
Chang Chong-Jen, the consultant who became a character in the 
Tintin adventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting ever more popular,'' said Yuriko Naruse, a fan  
from Nagano, Japan, who was at the store perusing Tintin birthday 
cards and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	To commemorate the anniversary, publisher Casterman is  
republishing the original Tintin book, long out of print. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the book is artistically removed from the beauty of  
later volumes and features an elementary -- sometimes incoherent -- 
storyline, some, like French lawmaker Andre Santini, calls Tintin 
creator Herge ``a visionary'' considering the later breakup of the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	In the book, Tintin's newspaper sends him to the Soviet Union to  
check out what's happening. The Soviets are seen showing off 
thriving factories to British Communists who all take it in with 
comments like ``very nice'' and ``beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dashing Tintin, however, does investigating reporting and finds  
out factories are fake, Potemkin plants, with nothing behind the 
facade. 
</P>
<P>
	He goes on to protect farmers from soldiers who come and steal  
their wheat, making sure they will not starve. Later, he finds 
wheat is used for export with the proceeds used for Soviet 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the Russian people are dying, vast amounts of wheat are  
being exported to show the so-called riches of the Soviet 
paradise,'' Tintin comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500,000 printing is only in French however, unlike some  
volumes, which have been published in 58 languages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russians have been asking for a translation, but they still  
have to wait,'' Tchang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tintin's adventures took him to the Soviet Union and Africa, the  
opium dens of the Far East and the skyscrapers of America, and even 
the moon. Herge, the pen name for Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, 
used a unique style of solid, unbroken lines that make dramatic 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
	Tintin may be Belgian to the core, but the French have adopted  
him as their fictive son. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, the National Assembly is preparing a Feb. 3 discussion  
with the heady title ``Tintin: Is he from the left or from the 
right?'' The Socialists and the right-wing parties are already 
sharpening their knives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be some trial,'' said Santini. ``If you wanted, you  
could let it go on for days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late French President General Charles De Gaulle even once  
grumbled that ``deep down, my only international rival is Tintin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series was so successful that after the end of Tintin's  
adventures in the Soviet Union, his return home from Russia to 
Brussels was re-staged in 1930 with actors. Hundreds of children 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an early indication of Tintin's mass appeal. Each year 3  
million books are still sold worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty of the drawings is also a major reason for Tintin's  
timeless appeal. The rounded, clear lines have inspired artists 
like Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. 
</P>
<P>
	``Herge has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney.  
For me, Herge was more than a comic strip artist,'' Warhol once 
said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Reviewing Telecom Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators may decide the fate of  
three major telecommunications mergers by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is reviewing the planned  
mergers of AT&AMP;T Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc., SBC 
Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp., and Bell Atlantic Corp. 
and GTE Corp. The FCC must determine whether the deals would serve 
the public interest, a broad legal standard that can include the 
impact on competition. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard told reporters Thursday that he hopes  
to issue decisions on each of the mergers in the first half of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The AT&AMP;T-TCI merger ``has the prospect of being a very exciting  
transaction,'' Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not comment on the prospects for the two other deals,  
including whether conditions would be imposed on them. ``I'm not 
prepared to say what the definitive cuts are'' because the review 
is not complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard did say it was important for all the companies to be  
more specific about when residential consumers will see the 
benefits of more competition, choices and new services being 
promised through the mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T plans to upgrade TCI's cable lines to offer local phone and  
other services, a move that could crack open the regional Bell 
companies' lock on local phone service. But opponents, including 
America Online, want the FCC to provide it and other companies with 
guaranteed access to TCI's upgraded, high-speed cable lines to 
provide competing services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department on Dec. 30 approved AT&AMP;T's $40 billion  
takeover on the condition that TCI sells its stake in a mobile 
phone company, called Sprint PCS. The department is reviewing the 
other two deals. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, the FCC will take steps at its Jan. 28  
meeting to ease congestion on the Internet by giving 
telecommunications companies incentives to build more high-speed 
connections into U.S. homes, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC, as one incentive, is expected to adopt rules that give  
the Bell companies and other major local phone providers, such as 
GTE, some regulatory relief in the delivery of high-speed data 
services. But they would have to provide the new services through a 
separate affiliate, something the Bells oppose, saying it is 
unwarranted, costly and burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also plans this year to revise federal ownership  
rules for broadcasters, make telephone bills easier to understand 
and promote more competition for cable companies, which are 
scheduled to have rates deregulated on March 31, Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable rates have been rising sharply even though they are  
regulated. In retrospect, ``the commission was probably too 
liberal'' in letting companies raise rates for increases in 
programming and other business costs, Kennard conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also is ``putting the finishing touches'' on an order  
that will resolve a dispute over how phone companies compensate 
each other for customers' calls to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard hopes 1999 is the year the FCC lets a Bell company offer  
long-distance service to local customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC has not approved any such requests and none is pending.  
But analysts believe that Bell Atlantic has the best chance of 
winning FCC approval to provide long-distance service in New York. 
Bell Atlantic is expected to file a request with the FCC later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm encouraged that 1999 could be a breakthrough year in that  
respect,'' Kennard said.

	Clinton Trial Opens in Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today began the historic  
impeachment trial of President Clinton. The nation's 42nd president 
was at the White House when all 100 senators took an oath to render 
``impartial justice'' in his case. Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist is presiding at the trial. The White House vows there is 
``compelling case'' for acquittal. After opening procedures, the 
trial recessed so senators can decide on rules. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate Mulls Trial Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Final guidelines for the impeachment trial of  
President Clinton remain uncertain. A closed-door meeting of all 
senators is planned for tomorrow to consider trial rules. ``I think 
there is some common ground,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Tom 
Daschle. But Majority Leader Trent Lott and Daschle said there had 
been no bipartisan accord on whether to permit testimony by 
witnesses.

	Willey Case Witness Indicted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grand jury helping prosecutor Kenneth Starr  
investigate Kathleen Willey's allegation that President Clinton 
made an unwanted sexual advance toward her indicted one of her 
friends today. Julie Hiatt Steele was charged with obstructing 
justice and lying when she cast doubt on Mrs. Willey's story. Among 
other things, Ms. Steele is accused of filing a false affidavit in 
the Paula Jones litigation. 

</P>
<P>
	Tripp: Maybe I Saw Lost Records  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ex-aide Linda Tripp says she may have seen  
billing records from Hillary Clinton's law firm in a safe in White 
House lawyer Vince Foster's office. Later, the missing records 
mysteriously turned up in the White House residence. ``I saw what I 
now believe to be in the infamous billing records in that safe,'' 
Tripp said in a deposition this week for the conservative legal 
group Judicial Watch, which made her testimony public. Mrs. Tripp 
was secretary to Foster. It was Tripp whose tapes of Monica 
Lewinsky led to the probe of a presidential affair. 

</P>

	Probe Faults U.S. Embassy Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - An official panel investigating the bombings  
at two U.S. embassies in Africa has concluded that there was a 
``collective failure'' by several administrations and congresses to 
invest sufficient resources to protect U.S. diplomatic missions, a 
senior official said tonight. The Accountability Review Board was 
convened after the near simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania last August. Twelve Americans were among the 
224 people killed in the bombings. The panel was directed by 
retired Navy Admiral William Crowe, a former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff.

	U.S. Gen. Discusses Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the U.S. forces in the Persian  
Gulf, Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, leader of U.S. Central Command, 
said Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's grip on power appears to be 
slipping. Zinni said Saddam is trying to assert control by 
repeatedly challenging ``no-fly'' zones, executing traitorous 
military and civilian leaders and lashing out at Arab leaders. An 
American warplane returned safely today after firing a missile at

	LONDON (AP) -- Women suffer no lasting ill effects from taking  
birth control pills, according to the biggest study ever on the 
subject and one that some experts say finally can lay to rest fears 
that have lingered since the pill was introduced in 1961. Ten years 
after they stopped using the pill, women's chances of dying from 
cancer, stroke and other side effects were the same as those of 
women who had never taken it, according to the study published in 
the latest issue of the British Medical Journal.

<HEADLINE> NBA Reconciliation Process Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It is time for the NBA to undo some of the  
damage, and the league wasted no time getting started. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the first moves toward appeasing fans, commissioner David  
Stern announced that there will be free exhibition games this 
season and $10 seats at all games next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be more than just a slogan,'' Atlanta Hawks  
president Stan Kasten said. ``Hopefully by next season we can get 
the fans back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day after the lockout was settled, Thursday was a day for  
the owners to have the deal explained to them, for the players to 
begin preparing for the season and for the league as a whole to 
reach out to the apathetic masses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA Board of Governors approved the settlement 29-0, and  
Stern said the league hopes to start the season Feb. 5, with each 
team playing 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some winning back of fans to do, and we're going to do  
it,'' Stern said at a news conference where he was joined by union 
director Billy Hunter and deputy commissioner Russ Granik. ``Most 
important to us is that basketball games will be upon us again, and 
as a basketball fan and particularly a fan of the NBA, I am 
elated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each team will play two exhibition games -- one home and one away  
-- and admission will be free. Preseason scrimmages also will be 
open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington Wizards owner Abe Pollin, who took an active part in  
the negotiations as the league's senior owner, said tougher drug 
policy and player conduct clauses in the new deal were ``at least 
as important'' to him as the more publicized issue of how to split 
billions among players and owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find that the players have changed,'' said the  
75-year-old owner, who bought the then-Baltimore Bullets in 1964. 
``I think players will realize that fans are the ones who pay their 
salaries and therefore are the people we have to look to. I told 
them, you may or may not want to be role models, but you are role 
models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-month lockout ended early Wednesday following an  
all-night bargaining session between Stern and Hunter. An agreement 
was reached just one day before the Board of Governors would have 
voted whether to cancel what was left of the 1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The league, meantime, lifted its gag order on coaches, general  
managers and owners, all of whom were eager to get back to the 
business of playing ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just the beginning stages of being able to start to do  
the work that all of us enjoy,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. 
``Obviously, we're happy about the lockout being over. Happy is an 
understatement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players can start using team facilities beginning Monday,  
although coaches will be prohibited from working with them until 
the lockout is officially over. And that won't happen until the 
agreement is put into writing and signed by both sides -- a process 
that should take a week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm shocked they think they can get it done in 10 days,'' said  
Kasten, noting that lawyers have a tendency to bring the process to 
a halt once they start fighting over contract language. 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, however, even the opposing attorneys mingled and  
joked with each other, joining in on the collective sense of relief 
at having a settlement at last. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter talked about repairing the partnership between the  
opposing sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad this is over,'' he said. ``Our players are anxious  
to play, and we're anxious to join hands with David, Russ and the 
owners of the 29 teams to really create a strong and familial 
relationship -- one that will take the NBA to another level and to 
bring back the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only regret I have is that is took us so long to get where  
we are,'' Hunter said. ``We're glad to be back, and we'll do 
whatever we have to do in order to demonstrate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern and Granik opened Thursday's Board of Governors meeting by  
addressing representatives from each of the 29 teams, and league 
attorney Joel Litvin explained the details of the new pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanimous vote by the Board of Governors was taken by a show  
of hands, rather than secret ballot, and Hunter then was brought 
into the room and as given a chance to speak to the owners -- just 
as Stern was permitted to speak to the players a day earlier when 
they ratified the deal 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``No applause was asked for or offered,'' New Jersey Nets  
president Michael Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Granik said the agreement should be in written form by Jan. 18,  
after which training camps will open and teams will be permitted to 
sign free agents and make trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will last through the end of April, and the  
playoff format will remain unchanged. The NBA Finals should 
conclude by June 29 or 30.

<HEADLINE> Couch Declares for NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Tim Couch knows the questions about him.  
</P>
<P>
	Questions about his arm strength. Questions about whether the  
big numbers he put up as Kentucky's quarterback the last two 
seasons were a result of the pass-happy offense of Wildcats coach 
Hal Mumme. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing Thursday that he will pass up his final year of  
college eligibility to enter the NFL draft, Couch said he is ready 
to start answering those questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the exciting part to it,'' Couch said. ``It's a  
brand-new challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I came out of high school, a lot of people said, `He  
played at Leslie County High School. They didn't play anybody. He 
put up these big numbers because of this and that,''' Couch said. 
``Then I come to the best conference in America and I put up even 
better numbers than I did in high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they're going to have more questions: that I was a product  
of coach Mumme's system and can I really do it in a system that 
doesn't throw the ball that many times in a game?'' he added. 
``That's going to be another challenge, and I accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's decision, announced the day before the NFL's deadline  
for early entry to the draft, clears the way for the native of the 
Appalachian town of Hyden to make millions as the potential No. 1 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Cleveland Browns own the selection, and Browns  
president Carmen Policy has said he is open to taking a franchise 
quarterback if one is available. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL prohibits teams from commenting on underclassmen who are  
leaving school early until the league releases its list of players 
on Monday. So the Browns, who could be torn between taking Couch or 
Texas running back Ricky Williams, won't be able to discuss their 
plans for the No. 1 pick until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scouts believe Couch -- with his size (6-foot-5, 225  
pounds), accuracy, touch and experience in Kentucky's pro-style 
passing offense -- is the kind of prospect around whom the Browns 
could build a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch made no effort Thursday to hide his desire to play in  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to know that's where I want to be,'' Couch said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch's announcement ended months of questions and weeks of  
speculation that reached high pitch in the days since Kentucky's 
season ended Jan. 1 with a 26-14 loss in the Outback Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he decided to leave earlier this week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a competitive person, and I want to compete  
at the highest level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lexington, four local television stations carried Couch's  
announcement live -- even on a day when the U.S. Senate was 
beginning a presidential impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch choked up several times Thursday, once as he talked about  
having the chance to take care of his parents financially, and 
again as he talked about his pride in getting Kentucky to its first 
New Year's Day bowl in 47 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And he spoke of his sadness in losing his childhood best friend,  
Scott Brock, who was killed in a Nov. 15 truck crash that also took 
the life of one of Couch's teammates, transfer defensive end Artie 
Steinmetz. Kentucky center Jason Watts, who was driving, has been 
charged with second-degree manslaughter and drunken driving in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Kentucky, the fans, they've seen me at my  
lowest points, my freshman year, they've seen me at one of the 
hardest times in my life, when my best friend got killed, and 
they've seen me at my highest points, when we go to LSU and beat 
LSU, when we beat Alabama,'' Couch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he wore No. 2 on his jersey, Couch has been No. 1 in the  
hearts of Kentucky football fans since 1996, when he spurned 
scholarship offers from Penn State, Florida and Tennessee to attend 
his home-state university. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch did not enjoy immediate success in then-coach Bill Curry's  
conservative offense and considered transferring after his freshman 
season. Curry was fired midway through the season, however, and 
Kentucky athletics director C.M. Newton replaced him with Mumme. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch stayed and blossomed under Mumme's wide-open ``Air Raid''  
attack. He leaves Kentucky with 26 school records, 14 Southeastern 
Conference records and four NCAA marks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without him (Mumme), I probably wouldn't be at the University  
of Kentucky right now, and I definitely wouldn't have had the 
chance to show what I could do on the football field,'' Couch said. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Couch threw for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns, and  
completed Kentucky's transformation from SEC doormat to contender. 
The Wildcats finished with a 7-4 regular season record and earned a 
bowl berth for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch finished fourth in balloting for this year's Heisman  
Trophy. He also was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award as the 
nation's top college quarterback and was chosen SEC Player of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he has narrowed his choice of agents to Tom Condon of  
Cleveland-based IMG and Gary Wichard of Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> IOC Prober Dismisses Gift of Rifles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Criticism of some $2,000 worth of firearms  
accepted by the Olympics' top official is irrelevant to the current 
probe of corruption in awarding the games, the IOC's chief 
investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy surrounding the gifts to International Olympic  
Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch by the Salt Lake City 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games ``completely misses the point'' 
because Samranch does not vote, vice president Richard Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it's a different thing when a president of an organization  
gets protocol gifts,'' Pound said. ``(Samaranch) is forever getting 
gifts and statues in the course of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever he gets, if it's any interest it would go to the  
Olympic Museum, or if it can be displayed, in his office. If it's 
particularly hideous, it would go in storage. He would need a 
10-acre house to keep all the presents he gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described Samaranch, the wealthy son of a Spanish textile  
family who lives most of the year in a hotel suite in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, as ``practically monastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he recalled that during one of Salt Lake City's  
Olympic bids, officials contacted Samaranch and asked for his 
wife's ring size. He said Samaranch contacted Salt Lake officials 
before his trip and said, ``We prefer no gifts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the investigation of alleged corruption during Salt  
Lake City's Olympic bid should be finished by the end of the month. 
He said one of his panel's key tasks is to distinguish between 
gifts or perks and actual vote-buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most difficult part of all this,'' he said. ``I  
don't think personally that gifts really influence somebody to vote 
for a city or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought the best job in the world to have would be  
chambermaid the day after an IOC session,'' he said. ``All this 
stuff is left because nobody wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get a whole bunch of stuff. You only have two suitcases.  
You're dealing with somebody else's tastes. Some of it is awful. 
You don't want it. You don't ask for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the items, though, ``would be patently beyond the norm  
of customary gifts,'' he said. ``There, you would have to ask 
yourself whether somebody would be trying to influence you.''

<HEADLINE> Healthy, Rested Teams Have Big Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jacksonville's Mark Brunell and San Francisco's Garrison Hearst  
are limping. So is Miami's Troy Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
	But Denver's Terrell Davis is feeling so spry going into the  
four-game NFL divisional playoff weekend that if he wears a flak 
jacket to protect his bruised ribs, it will only be because he's 
been used to wearing one. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, even though the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl as a  
wild-card team last season, there's a lot to be said for having a 
week off in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If not for the extra week, I would have had a lot of  
discomfort and probably would not be feeling as well as I would 
have liked,'' says Davis, only the fourth 2,000-yard rusher in NFL 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this time of year I feel great. I've had a week to rest my  
legs. I'm ready to play football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So are the other three teams that had byes last week: the New  
York Jets, Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons begin the weekend as host to NFC West rival San  
Francisco in the early game on Saturday. Then Miami is at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Jacksonville is at the New York Jets and Arizona at  
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                *San Francisco (13-4) at Atlanta (14-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere else might the fatigue factor be so important.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers spent huge amounts of energy beating Green Bay, going  
down to the final seconds last Sunday, and must play cross-country 
six days later. To compound things, they're not the NFL's youngest 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't discount all the playoff experience they've had and  
the magic of Steve Young, whose 25-yard pass to Terrell Owens with 
three seconds left beat the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams split the season series with a combined score of  
Atlanta 51, San Francisco 50. It would have been a tie, but the 
49ers went for two points and failed in a 31-19 loss in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	This could mark the changing of the guard in the NFC West.  
</P>
<P>
	It also should mark the return of Dan Reeves to the sidelines a  
little over three weeks after quadruple heart bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves supervised practices all this week and said afterward:  
``I feel fine.'' 

</P>
<P>
                    *Miami (11-6) at Denver (14-2)    	
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins beat the Broncos 31-21 in Miami on Dec. 21, the  
last game of a four-game stretch in which Denver played badly -- two 
humdrum wins and two losses. Davis was held to 29 yards in 16 
carries by the Miami defense and John Elway had by far his worst 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt sick about it,'' says Howard Griffith, the fullback and  
blocking back. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Denver is a 13-point favorite in this one, largely because  
Miami is 3-5 on the road, is missing defensive linemen Jason Taylor 
and Tim Bowens and could be missing Drayton, the tight end. And the 
Broncos have won 17 straight at Mile High since an upset loss to 
Jacksonville at this stage of the playoffs two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything you can think of, it doesn't make for a positive  
toward us,'' says Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The sideshow is the second meeting in 19 days between Dan Marino  
and Elway, the stars of the quarterback class of 1983. Before this, 
they had only met once in 16 seasons. 

</P>
<P>
              *Jacksonville (12-5) at New York Jets (12-4)    	
</P>
<P>
	There are a lot of people who make the Jets, rather than the  
Broncos, the favorites to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl. They 
finished the regular season with three wins over their three 
closest division rivals, and seem to have the momentum of Bill 
Parcells' three other Super Bowl teams. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Jacksonville's Tom Coughlin knows Parcells  
well. He was an assistant under the Tuna with the Giants from 
1988-1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He operates like Parcells. Assistant coaches don't speak to the  
media, not even Chris Palmer, Jacksonville's offensive coordinator, 
who was Parcells' quarterbacks coach in New England and is a prime 
candidate for one of the current head coaching vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the key to this game will be Brunell, who returned to  
quarterback for Jacksonville in last week's 25-10 win over New 
England. Brunell was rusty and immobile on the sprained ankle that 
cost him three late-season games. The artificial turf at the 
Meadowlands won't help, either. 

</P>
<P>
                  *Arizona (10-7) at Minnesota (15-1)    	
</P>
<P>
	If any game this weekend looks like a blowout, it's this one.  
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have won four straight including a 20-7 upset in  
Dallas last week, their first postseason win in 51 years. ``We've 
won eight straight,'' counters Minnesota coach Dennis Green. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona defense shut down Dallas last week, but there's a  
lot more to shut down in Minnesota, where the Vikings are unbeaten 
this season. Jake Reed should be back to complement Cris Carter and 
Randy Moss for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals' best bet is to stay close, easier said than done.  
They won their last three regular-season games on late field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, it's been a big season for Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is awesome to experience,'' says cornerback Aeneas  
Williams a standout for seven losing seasons in Arizona. ``To see 
guys having fun is something I haven't seen in the past.''

<HEADLINE> NY Parking Lot Attacker Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A white man pleaded guilty to beating a black  
man into a coma during a nightclub parking lot melee. 
</P>
<P>
	A former police officer still awaits trial, accused of waving a  
gun to keep the victim's friends at bay while Austin Offen attacked 
him with a metal anti-car-theft device. 
</P>
<P>
	Offen, 28, of Queens, had been charged with attempted murder,  
but pleaded guilty Wednesday to assault and a weapons possession 
charge in the May 1996 beating that left Shane Daniels in a coma 
for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, prosecutors said, he will be sentenced to 10 years in  
prison at a hearing Feb. 4. He could have gotten a 39-year 
sentence, defense lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Offen, who is white, shouted racial epithets  
while he beat Daniels, who is black, with the bar outside Club 
Marakesh in Westhampton, on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Trial is to start Monday for Constantine Chronis, 37, a white  
former policeman accused of keeping Daniels' friends at bay. 
Chronis resigned from the force after he was charged with assault 
and official misconduct.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Tough Task in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After acknowledging the United States received  
intelligence information from U.N. weapons inspectors, the Clinton 
administration is faced with a far tougher task in trying to keep 
the pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	With Russia, China and France already skeptical about using  
force to punish Saddam for blocking U.N. inspectors in their search 
for banned weapons, the administration must work harder to keep the 
U.N. inspection commission intact and Richard Butler at its head. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are not ruling out some reshaping of the commission  
that has uncovered caches of biological and chemical weapons; that, 
in the final analysis, is up to the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as James P. Foley, the deputy State Department spokesman,  
put it Thursday, turning the U.N. Special Commission into ``UNSCOM 
lite'' would be unacceptable to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States could be faced with a difficult choice if the  
flurry of disclosures of ties between the commission and American 
intelligence enhances a mood of compromise within the Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In that event, the Clinton administration would have to fight  
for terms that impose only limited damage to a comprehensive 
inspection system or give up entirely on UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	If necessary, Foley said, ``we are prepared to act alone'' in  
punishing Iraq if it is found to be rebuilding its arsenal of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping tabs on Iraq with overflights and other  
intelligence-gathering measures would be more difficult if the U.N. 
commission, set up at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, were 
dissolved or sharply curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of the fact that we are involved in a very  
concerted national effort to support UNSCOM in its Security 
Council-mandated work to uncover Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic offensive, Iraq, which had accused U.S.  
monitors all along of spying, on Thursday broadened its allegations 
by asking the United Nations to cut ties with international groups 
clearing land mines in northern Iraq. ``Spies and saboteurs'' were 
using the world body as a cover, Iraq insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad said nongovernmental organizations working to clear an  
estimated 10 million land mines in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq 
were an ``illegitimate presence'' because they did not have 
government permission to work in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration claims there is universal support for  
disarming Iraq of weapons of destruction. But officials do not 
dispute that even some U.S. allies would reshape UNSCOM in the hope 
a compromise could be struck with Saddam to permit the resumption 
of inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of Butler, the commission chairman and target of  
Iraqi ire, is clouded. Repeated affirmations of U.S. confidence in 
him may not ensure the Australian diplomat will stay on after his 
term ends in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley praised him warmly on Thursday and denied reports that  
U.S. intelligence agents worked undercover with UNSCOM. 
``Absolutely not,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Foley said the U.N. commission drew on several  
U.S. agencies for expertise and also requested help from dozens of 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Butler said he asked U.S. officials Thursday  
``what they might have done unbeknownst to us'' in possibly using 
U.N. weapons searches in Iraq to undermine Saddam Hussein's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want our system misused in that way,'' Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he also discussed his concerns with U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who in turn has been in phone contact 
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	American experts on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons  
were attached to UNSCOM on temporary assignment, White House and 
State Department officials said. The information they collected was 
controlled entirely by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business of weapons of mass destruction arms control is  
extremely serious and cannot be carried out by amateurs,'' Foley 
said. ``The United States has sent UNSCOM our best weapons experts, 
both from the government and private organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But once these officials returned to their U.S. agencies, they  
carried with them valuable information that vastly improved the 
U.S. intelligence picture of Iraq, information useful to strike 
target planners, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the experts sent to UNSCOM came from U.S. intelligence  
agencies, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Chicago, Pacific Exchanges End Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board Options Exchange has called off  
a proposed merger with the San Francisco-based Pacific Exchange 
that would have created the first equity derivatives exchange in 
the world to trade, on average, more than 1 million contracts a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange's board of directors voted unanimously to  
end the talks after learning last month that the U.S. Justice 
Department would require an extensive review of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``CBOE's decision to terminate discussions with PCX was made  
strictly on the basis of our available time and resources,'' CBOE 
Chairman William J. Brodsky said in a statement Thursday. ``The 
board's decision reflects in no way on the high regard we have for 
the PCX.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBOE officials said they want to concentrate on developing a  
screen-based trading program, expanding capacity and handling any 
potential Year 2000 computer programming problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago facility is the world's largest options exchange,  
while the Pacific Exchange is the world's third-largest.

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Wrestle Over Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and Democrats differ on timing and  
whether witnesses should testify at the impeachment trial. The two 
sides will meet Friday to discuss differences. 

</P>
<P>
	THE REPUBLICAN PLAN: GOP senators propose allowing each side a  
total of 24 hours to present its case, beginning next Thursday, 
after which senators could submit questions to Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist to ask of the lawyers. Senators would decide 
whether to call witnesses, with a majority vote required. After 
testimony of any witnesses, including questions from senators, the 
House prosecutors and President Clinton's lawyers would have eight 
hours each for closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also would require both sides to submit their  
written trial arguments by 5 p.m. EST Monday. The Senate would act 
on the motions on Thursday and then hear opening arguments, first 
from the House and then from the president's lawyers. GOP House 
prosecutors are pressing to call several witnesses, including 
Monica Lewinsky, presidential secretary Betty Currie and Clinton 
confidant Vernon Jordan. 

</P>
<P>
	THE DEMOCRATIC PLAN: Democratic senators are backing a proposal  
under which the House managers would present their case on Tuesday 
and Wednesday, Jan. 12 and 13. The president's lawyers would 
present their defense the next two days. On Jan. 19 and 20, 
senators could question both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side would have three hours for closing arguments on Jan.  
21 and then House managers get an additional hour for rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate would begin its deliberations on Jan. 22 and conclude  
on Jan. 25. It would vote on the articles of impeachment on Jan. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan has no provision for calling witnesses.  
Instead, Democrats propose an up-or-down vote on the articles of 
impeachment after the cases are presented or, at the very least, a 
vote to set aside the trial and move to censure.

	U.S. Fighter Plane Attacks Iraq Site  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter attacked an  
air-defense radar installation in northern Iraq today after the 
pilot determined he was about to be fired on by a surface-to-air 
missile, U.S. officials said. The F-16 launched a high-speed 
anti-radar missile at the site at about 11:15 a.m., Iraq time, 
according to a statement issued by U.S. European Command, the U.S. 
headquarters for Air Force planes involved in enforcing a 
``no-fly'' zone over northern Iraq. There was no immediate 
indication whether the missile damaged the radar. The F-16 was not 
fired upon and returned safely to base, officials said.

	Senate Launching Impeachment Trial  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is set today to launch the first  
presidential impeachment trial since the case of Andrew Johnson in 
1868. With House prosecutors pressing Senate leaders to allow 
testimony from witnesses such as Monica Lewinsky, there were 
increasing indications that a full-blown trial was in the offing. 
Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice. The 
13-member House prosecution team was to read the two articles of 
impeachment on the Senate floor. 

</P>
<P>
	Aides: White House Wants Early Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House advisers are discussing a strategy  
to stage an early vote in the Senate to show that the two-thirds 
majority required to remove President Clinton from office doesn't 
exist. Presidential advisers said such a vote, even if it failed, 
would give Clinton's defenders a potent political weapon if 
Republicans press ahead with a lengthy trial that the public has 
indicated it does not want. 

</P>

	Turkish Leader Seeks New Government  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's president today asked pro-secular  
leader Bulent Ecevit to try to form a coalition, the politician's 
second try during the nation's six-week-government crisis. Ecevit, 
the leader of the Democratic Left Party, received the mandate from 
President Suleyman Demirel a day after an independent deputy, Yalim 
Erez, abandoned his efforts to form a Cabinet. Ecevit indicated his 
chances of succeeding were better this time around.

	YAMHILL, Ore. (AP) -- Investigators today picked through the  
wreckage of a twin-engine plane that crashed about 30 miles 
southwest of Portland, killing all four people aboard and narrowly 
missing a farmhouse and barn. The six-seat Beechcraft Baron BE-58 
went down in the wooded hills of Yamhill County about 6 p.m. 
yesterday, said Debbie Taylor, a Federal Aviation Administration 
spokeswoman in Seattle. The cause of the crash wasn't yet known and 
the names of the victims were not released.

custody. Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor, in a 
statement put out by the national news agency Bernama, said his

<HEADLINE>  Senate Launching Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a solemn moment for President Clinton and  
the nation, the Senate is launching the first presidential 
impeachment trial since the case of Andrew Johnson in 1868. The 
ceremonial opening comes amid intense, last-minute bargaining over 
ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With House prosecutors pressing Senate leaders to allow  
testimony from witnesses such as Monica Lewinsky, there were 
increasing indications that a full-blown trial of some weeks' 
duration was in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators today were taking an oath to ``do impartial justice,''  
and Chief Justice William Rehnquist was assuming his role as 
presiding officer for Clinton's trial on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. The 13-member House prosecution team was to 
read the two articles of impeachment on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	But beyond those public sessions, the House ``managers'' were  
negotiating for the right to summon a number of witnesses, most 
notably Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern whose affair 
with Clinton triggered the impeachment investigation, and 
presidential friend Vernon Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters  
Wednesday that if agreement could be reached to call witnesses, he 
would want the White House and the House to justify the need for 
each person summoned. The Senate also would have to approve each 
witness by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott expressed optimism that agreement was near on a procedure  
for a ``full trial .... and votes on articles of impeachment at the 
end of the process.'' One GOP source, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said it would likely be February at the earliest before 
votes were taken on the president's fate. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators met Wednesday night with the lead  
House prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and three other 
lawmakers on his team. Then the lawmakers unexpectedly summoned 
four members of the White House legal team to the Capitol to 
discuss proposals for conducting the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who consulted separately Wednesday with Hyde and  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle, said he expected opening statements 
in the case sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial question was whether to allow witnesses, as demanded  
by the House but opposed by Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Senate Republicans, according to sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, one proposal was to give each side in the 
trial, the House and the White House, three to five days to present 
evidence, most likely beginning next week. At the end of that time, 
a vote would be permitted to adjourn the trial, or either side 
could seek permission to summon witnesses. The Senate would have to 
approve each witness to be called by majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Without witnesses, the timetable would place final votes on the  
articles in the first week of February. Summoning witnesses to 
testify would push the date back. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, one of the House prosecutors, said  
``five to 10 witnesses puts on a case. I suspect we will want 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and others on the prosecution team said the House might try  
to summon women who have provided statements in the Paula Jones 
case ``to the degree they go to obstruction of justice and 
perjury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky must be called ``because she is right in the middle  
of this,'' Cannon said. But he added that he'd ``never seen Linda 
Tripp as essential,'' referring to Ms. Lewinsky's onetime friend 
who taped their private telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, a prominent Washington attorney and longtime Clinton  
friend, ``is a player'' and should be summoned, Cannon said. But 
while other prosecutors wanted to call presidential secretary Betty 
Currie, Cannon said he would be reluctant to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the president placed her in a vulnerable position by  
involving her in the Lewinsky affair, adding ``It was a rotten, 
nasty thing to do to a career civil servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other House prosecutors had their own suggestions.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., indicated that he might want to  
hear from onetime presidential adviser Dick Morris about Clinton's 
state of mind when he asked Morris to conduct a poll on Americans' 
opinion of his conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have the opportunity to present 12 to 14  
witnesses,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., said Ms. Lewinsky should be  
questioned ``in limited fashion,'' but ``we don't have to go into 
all the (sexual) details. Much of the questioning could be on 
obstruction of justice issues, such as the attempt to find her a 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if Mrs. Currie ``has a bearing on the case, it's  
important to have the jury hear her testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson added that Jordan was essential because, ``In the  
framework of the obstruction of justice case, I would say he's an 
important witnesses.''

<HEADLINE> Zanardi Chases 1st Formula One Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- Alex Zanardi can't wait for his first  
Formula One donut. 
</P>
<P>
	Famed for spinning his car on the track to celebrate victories,  
the two-time CART champion has returned to Formula One with 
Williams and is confident he'll improve on his best previous Grand 
Prix result, a sixth-place finish in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Williams has fallen behind McLaren and Ferrari in the  
last 12 months while it awaits the arrival of BMW engines next 
year, the team has two new drivers this season -- Zanardi and Ralf 
Schumacher -- and the 33-year-old Italian is confident of his first 
F-1 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi recalls his donut-spinning celebration after winning at  
Cleveland in July 1997, when he charged from 22nd in the field to 
win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it because I saw how happy the fans were for my  
victory,'' he said Thursday. ``When I saw the checkered flag, I 
finally let it go like the steam goes from a pressure cooker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it happens in Formula One, I may come up with something  
crazy again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi admits he might have to wait awhile before he celebrates  
his first Grand Prix win, having so far struggled to readapt to a 
different kind of driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cars are completely different from the ones I drove the  
last time in Formula One in 1994,'' he said ``They were heavier and 
now you have the grooved tires and other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``In practice I was driving as fast as I could, but it was not  
fast enough. It's very frustrating. But if it doesn't happen in 
Melbourne when the season starts (March 7), there will definitely 
be an improvement as the year goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the car's at the top of its game, hopefully I will win some  
races and in time the championship,'' said Zanardi, who has a 
one-year contract with Williams at a reported $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first went to America, I was uncompetitive, and then I  
won two championships in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the experience of winning two titles in the United  
States should help him in F-1. Jacques Villeneuve won the F-1 title 
in 1997, two seasons after moving from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also the case of Michael Andretti, who arrived in  
Formula One as an IndyCar champion, but struggled in F-1 racing and 
soon went back to America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence is something I have learned driving a car at the  
top of its game,'' he said of his U.S. wins with the Target-Chip 
Ganassi Racing team. ``I did win a lot of races, and that helped a 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's very difficult to draw a line between expectations  
and dreams. If the car performs as well as we all hope, that can 
change the picture completely,'' Zanardi said. ``If it doesn't, you 
can't put the car on your back and try and run faster than the 
others.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered Thursday to help the  
beleaguered U.S. steel industry with $300 million in proposed tax 
breaks but stopped far short of the sweeping trade protections 
sought by the industry and its unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Congress and the industry expressed disappointment  
that the administration's action did not go much further in efforts 
to stem a flood of cheap steel coming into the United States as a 
result of the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very disappointing report,'' said Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa. and chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. ``You have 
a steel industry hemorrhaging with the flooding of our markets with 
foreign dumped steel, causing the loss of thousands of jobs, and 
the administration is applying a small Band-Aid to that massive 
hemorrhage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration insisted that a variety of steps it has  
already undertaken and the new proposals, outlined in a report 
released Thursday, would provide a ``comprehensive response to the 
steel import situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tax relief proposed by the administration will take the form  
of expanding the number of years that steel companies can spread 
out operating losses in order to lower their tax bills. Currently, 
all companies can ``carry back'' losses to previous years for only 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration proposal will expand the ``carry back''  
period to five years for steel companies at an estimated cost in 
lost tax revenue to the government of $300 million over five years. 
Administration officials said the proposal will be included in 
Clinton's new budget to be submitted to Congress on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration missed a Tuesday deadline imposed by Congress  
to complete the plan as it sought to reconcile an internal debate 
between supporters of the industry's demands for protectionist 
barriers and other officials, led by Treasury Secretary Robert 
Rubin, who argue that such an action would set back efforts to pull 
Asian nations and Russia out of steep recessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The report indicated that Rubin's side prevailed in efforts not  
to grant the industry's request for the United States to launch a 
broad attempt to force other countries to enter into ``voluntary 
restraint agreements'' to curb imports into the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry and its unions have already filed three cases  
against Japan, Russia and Brazil accusing those nations of 
``dumping'' steel in this country at unfairly low prices and asking 
the government to impose penalty tariffs of up to 200 percent on 
certain types of steel. The administration's report pledged those 
cases would be handled on an expedited basis. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the tax relief, the Clinton plan contains a  
pledge to appoint a high-level White House coordinator to speed 
trade adjustment assistance already approved by Congress to steel 
workers who have been laid off following production cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But various members of Congress from steel producing states were  
unsatisfied, saying the administration was offering too little to 
combat a growing problem that has resulted in layoffs and reduced 
hours for thousands of steel workers and millions of dollars in 
lost profits for U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Thursday, Bethlehem Steel announced plans to permanently  
close its Washington Steel stainless sheet and strip operations, 
eliminating 540 jobs in Washington, Pa., and Massillon, Ohio. The 
company cited sustained losses and the impact of ``unfairly 
traded'' steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, said: ``The president has clearly turned  
his back on the steel workers.'' Fellow Ohio Republican Rep. Ralph 
Regula, a chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, said the 
administration was making a mistake in not pushing for voluntary 
restraint agreements with foreign steel producers similar to ones 
negotiated during the Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	While the White House has considered such an approach, Rubin and  
other officilas argued it would violate rules of the World Trade 
Organization, the Geneva-based body created in 1995 to enforce the 
rules of world trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did underscore efforts to reach a voluntary restraint  
agreement with Russia, which is permissible under WTO rules because 
it is classified as a nonmarket economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And the report held out a threat of action against Japan unless  
it lives up to informal pledges it has made to restrain its steel 
shipments to the United States, which have soared by 480 percent 
through the first nine months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Late Buying Boosts Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Christmas came a bit late for the nation's  
retailers, but it helped salvage what was threatening to be a bleak 
holiday sales season for many chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Final sales figures from the season released Thursday showed  
that last-minute price slashing by merchants ignited a burst of 
buying that lifted receipts for the most important part of a 
retailer's year from disappointing to respectable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that this season was made at the end,'' said  
Jeffrey Feiner, managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But there still were weak spots. Department stores, especially  
moderately priced chains like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co, continued to 
lose business to the discount chains. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. warned 
Thursday that its fourth-quarter earnings will be lower than Wall 
Street analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Santa flew over most of the department stores this Christmas,  
but went down the chimneys of the specialty stores and discount 
stores,'' said Tara Schuchmann, who runs the Dallas-based hedge 
fund Tara Capital Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants expected that sharp gains on Wall Street and a  
strong U.S. economy would inspire shoppers to spend freely this 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	But success didn't come easy. The biggest obstacle was a warm  
spell in the first weeks of December, which dampened sales of 
winter merchandise, from snow shovels to cashmere sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Storeowners also faced a growing number of value-conscious  
consumers, who blatantly said that they were waiting for prices to 
drop before they would buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Business finally picked up right before Christmas, once the  
weather turned cold and merchants began offering deep discounts. 
That surge in buying continued the week after Christmas, when there 
were even steeper price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last weeks saved the season, the same thing as last  
year,'' said Thomas Tashjian, senior managing director at 
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``We are seeing more and more 
that smart value-pricing attracts the consumer. They buy when the 
see good value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what drove holiday sales at the discount stores, which  
are known for their affordable prices and wide selection. Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., Kmart Corp., and Dayton Hudson's Target division all 
reported stronger-than-expected sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores also showed healthy sales gains, especially  
those specializing in home furnishing, jewelry, electronics and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, was 
up a moderate 3.6 percent in December. It rose 2.8 percent in 
November and was up 5.3 percent in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	While retailers touted December's sales gains, a number of  
merchants -- especially the department stores chains -- put their 
profits in jeopardy by taking unplanned markdowns on winter 
merchandise to clear out their inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounter Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, reported  
sales from stores open at least a year rose 9.4 percent from a year 
earlier, while total sales were up 15.8 percent. Sales from stores 
open at least a year, known as same-store sales, are considered the 
most accurate measure of a retailer's strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Other retailers' reports:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears: Same-store sales down 0.3 percent, total sales down 1.8  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart: Same-store sales up 4.2 percent, total sales up 6.2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney: Same-store department store sales fell 7.6  
percent, same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 8.3 percent, 
total sales fell 4.3 percent. J.C. Penney's 1998 figures do not 
include the results of Thanksgiving weekend. A year ago, that 
weekend was tallied in the December results. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson: Same-store sales up 6.5 percent, total sales up  
11.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated: Same-store sales rose 5.7 percent, total sales up  
4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores: Same-store sales up 4.4 percent, total  
sales up 8.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited: Same-store sales up 4 percent, total sales fell 2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap: Same-store sales up 19 percent, total sales up 41 percent.

<HEADLINE> Government Sets Up Y2k Info Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers fretting about how they will fly  
come January 2000 or whether their Social Security checks will 
arrive on time now have a new resource for addressing their 
millennium woes: a toll-free information line. 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Council on Year 2000 on Thursday announced the  
creation of the toll-free line, which will be supported by the 
Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Information Center of the 
General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	By dialing 1-888-USA-4-Y2K, consumers can access prerecorded  
messages seven days a week, 24 hours a day on how personal 
computers, small business, telephones and other products or 
services will be affected by the approaching year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to providing consumers the latest information  
on how the problem may, or may not, affect government services, 
banks, household appliances and other things they depend upon in 
their daily lives,'' said John Koskinen, chairman of the council. 
</P>
<P>
	The information on the line comes from government agencies,  
companies or industry groups, reporting on what measures they are 
taking to prepare for 2000. That's when computer systems performing 
calculations involving dates may begin generating incorrect data if 
they recognize only the last two digits of a year because they will 
assume that 2000 is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, high-rise building tenants worried they might get  
stuck in the elevator because of Y2K problems can use the 
information line to allay some of their fears. According to the 
line, major elevator manufacturers say elevators are not 
date-dependent and should not experience problems. But elevators 
tied into larger building control systems could be in trouble if 
those systems don't meet Y2K compliance standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Information specialists supported by researchers also will be on  
hand to answer consumer questions from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST Monday 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the month, the line will provide a  
``fax-on-demand'' system, enabling callers to receive printed 
material on the Y2K problem with the touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar consumer information also can be obtained through the  
council's Web site at www.y2k.gov.

<HEADLINE>  Filipinos Protest at Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Hundreds of angry Filipinos marched  
to the Supreme Court today demanding that it overturn its decision 
to postpone the execution of a convicted child rapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted in 1994 of  
repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, was to have been 
the first Filipino executed in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long live the victim, kill the rapist,'' the protesters  
chanted outside the gates of the court, which has been put under 
heavy security because of bomb threats after its ruling Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 members and supporters of Volunteers Against Crime and  
Corruption, an organization of relatives of victims of ``heinous'' 
crimes, marched to the court carrying banners reading ``Justice is 
Dead'' and ``Abolish the Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its 8-5 decision, the court ordered a six-month delay in  
Echegaray's execution, just three hours before he was to be killed 
by lethal injection. The court said it wanted to give Congress a 
chance to review the death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
	However, following an uproar over its decision, the court said  
Wednesday that the six-month postponement could be cut short if it 
becomes clear Congress will not repeal the death penalty law. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers have asked the court to withdraw its order.  
</P>
<P>
	``He should be put to death as soon as possible to stop other  
people from following his example,'' said 42-year-old Ligaya 
Salasa, who joined the protesters. ``The number of rapes in the 
country is rising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters also called for the impeachment of the eight  
judges who voted for a stay of execution. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada has expressed dismay over the court's  
decision, calling it a ``sad day for law enforcement and the rule 
of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers have recently questioned whether capital  
punishment would deter crime and sought a congressional review of 
the law that restored capital punishment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada, who has pledged to solve the country's crime problems,  
said the court overstepped its role of enforcing existing laws, and 
promised to veto any new law repealing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to  
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row 
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children 
or other close relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people. In  
1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave 
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes. 
Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, brought back capital 
punishment in January 1994.

<P>
	December sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers.

	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the

<HEADLINE> Study: Humans Caused Extinctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The arrival in Australia of humans, who  
brought the controlled use of fire, caused most of the large 
animals in the land down under to become extinct thousands of years 
ago, a new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Age dating and chemical analysis of fossilized egg shells from a  
huge extinct bird suggest that the animals disappeared after humans 
spent centuries burning the forests and shrubs in the central areas 
of Australia, according to the team of researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird, called Genyornis newtoni, died out 50,000 years ago.  
At the same time, more than 85 percent of the Australian animals 
weighing more than 100 pounds also disappeared, according to the 
team led by Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The study appears Friday in the journal Science.  
</P>
<P>
	Just what killed off the Australian animals has long been  
debated by scientists. Some propose the extinctions were caused by 
climatic changes, while others blame early humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Humans arrived in Australia 53,000 to 60,000 years ago. They  
brought to that continent the controlled use of fire and with it 
burned vast areas of the outback more frequently than natural 
burning caused by lightning, the researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire was used as a hunting tool, as a way to promote new plant  
growth and as a signal between groups, the researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
	This burning was extremely destructive in what was already a  
fragile and dry environment, said Beverly Johnson, a co-author of 
the study. It so disrupted the normal growth cycles of shrubs and 
trees that the plants eventually died out and deprived the huge 
birds and other animals of their primary food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frequent burning pushed the ecosystem beyond the point  
where it could regenerate,'' said Johnson, now a researcher at the 
University of Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge birds were so specialized in what they ate that they  
simply died from malnutrition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genyornis relied primarily on shrubs and trees,'' she said.  
``Emus (another large bird) that lived at the same time had a more 
variable diet, feeding on grasses, trees and shrubs. It survived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extinctions have occurred naturally on all continents over the  
last tens of thousands of years, but Australia has suffered the 
most. About 60 distinct species disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were 19 types of marsupials, some weighing more than  
220 pounds; a hippo-sized animal related to the wombat; a 
25-foot-long snake; a 25-foot-long lizard; and a horned tortoise 
the size of a small car. 
</P>
<P>
	Genyornis was, itself, a huge bird, weighing more than 200  
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found evidence of the ecosystem change by  
analyzing the fossil shells of the bird. The tests, on shells found 
in three different locations, determined the type of food the bird 
ate and documented age. 
</P>
<P>
	The birds, they found, appeared about 100,000 years ago, then  
abruptly disappeared about 50,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The team eliminated climatic change as the cause of the  
extinction because the bird endured extreme changes in climate over 
its 50,000 years and perished only after humans arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy F. Flannery, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, said  
the study poses ``a major challenge'' to scientists who believe the 
Australian extinctions were caused by climate.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer DiMaggio Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Joe DiMaggio was pictured as doing very  
well Thursday as he continued his recovery from lung cancer 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He beat pneumonia,'' said Morris Engelberg, the spokesman for  
the New York Yankees Hall of Fame outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The infection is gone, his vital signs are good.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 84-year-old DiMaggio survived a series of major setbacks  
which followed his operation on Oct. 14, including serious lung 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelberg said no decision had been made on when DiMaggio would  
leave Memorial Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's day to day,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A visit from Yankees owner George Steinbrenner last week buoyed  
DiMaggio, according to Engelberg, an attorney and DiMaggio's 
longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``George had been calling three or four times a week, but this  
was the first time Joe was well enough to have him visit,'' 
Engelberg said. ``They had a couple of laughs and both enjoyed 
themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Baffled by Pfiesteria / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Last year, scientists waited nervously for  
another outbreak of Pfiesteria piscicida, the toxic microbe blamed 
in 1997 for killing huge numbers of fish and leaving others with 
bloody lesions. 
</P>
<P>
	The outbreak never happened and scientists now are trying to  
figure out why. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, South  
Carolina, Georgia and Florida met in Baltimore this week to share 
data at a conference led by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, a rainy spring may have helped prevent Pfiesteria  
microbes from reproducing in great numbers, said Robert Magnien of 
the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The altered flow of water changed the factors required for  
Pfiesteria to grow. Those factors include the salt content of the 
water and the greater amount of water, which dissipated nutrients 
that can spur algae growths. Algae draws fish and, in turn, the 
Pfiesteria microbe, which feeds on algae when the microbe is in its 
nontoxic stage. 
</P>
<P>
	When oily fish such as Atlantic menhaden gather together,  
outbreaks of Pfiesteria and Pfiesteria-like microbes sometimes 
follow, possibly due to the fishes' secretions and excretions. 
</P>
<P>
	Menhaden ``are doing something wrong by being there,'' Magnien  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although a number of factors such as rainfall, salt content and  
chlorophyll can contribute to outbreaks of Pfiesteria-like 
organisms, scientists concentrate on reducing nutrients because 
that is one factor humans can control. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Maryland introduced the strictest agricultural runoff  
laws in the country. That has outraged smaller farmers in the 
region, who say they are being squeezed by tighter regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``And in the absence of good science, there was a rush to  
judgment,'' said Bill Satterfield, executive director of the 
Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc., a trade association. ``There were a 
lot of people making speculation on incomplete and invalid science. 
And it's driving Maryland farmers out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fish kills were scant in other states, although some fish were  
found with the bloody lesions that characterize an outbreak of a 
Pfiesteria-like disease. Often the fish were menhaden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still trying to figure out why,'' said David Saveikis, a  
member of the Delaware Pfiesteria Monitoring Team. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pfiesteria-like microbe was blamed for a fish kill and two  
crab kills in Delaware in 1998, but scientists are trying to 
determine why it was not a large-scale outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	The microbe can lie dormant in sediment for years. Tests are  
being run to determine if Pfiesteria has settled into these 
sediment layers, waiting to emerge when the conditions are right, 
Saveikis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, more than a billion fish, mostly menhaden,  
have died from Pfiesteria in coastal estuaries since the early 
1990s, said Joann Burkholder, a researcher at North Carolina State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a Pfiesteria outbreak killed an estimated 500,000  
fish in the Neuse River, and another outbreak killed several 
thousand fish in a tributary of the New River. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish with lesions were found in Virginia and Florida. There were  
scattered fish kills, but none was attributed to Pfiesteria-like 
organisms.

<HEADLINE> Job Cuts May Weaken Strong Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid signs the American economy finished 1998  
on a strong note, a jump in unemployment benefit applications and a 
huge increase in layoff announcements pointed to a weaker economy 
in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job indicators are starting to blink big warning signs,''  
said economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International 
Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans claiming unemployment checks fell by  
22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 350,000 during the week ended Jan. 
2, the Labor Department said Thursday. But that only partly 
reversed a surge of 83,000, the biggest in six years, to 372,000 
the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims had fallen to an eight-month low of 289,000 during the  
week ended Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports from states suggested weather -- including flooding in  
the Northwest -- contributed to the big jump during Christmas week. 
All 12 states registering increases of 6,000 or greater are in the 
Midwest, Northwest and Northeast. Many cited layoffs in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	But some states also mentioned job losses in manufacturing,  
which has suffered most of the year from spillover from the world 
economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes  
fluctuations, rose by 5,500 to 327,500 last week, the most in a 
year and a half, excluding June and July when the General Motors 
strikes swelled unemployment numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are widespread indications that the labor market will  
weaken further in the months ahead,'' said economist Gerald D. 
Cohen of Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	The outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc., said  
announced layoffs totaled 103,166 in December, a five-year high and 
double November's job cuts of 51,642. Fourth-quarter layoff 
announcements totaled 246,339, the most since the firm began 
compiling the report in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports on Thursday highlighted the economy's resilience.  
</P>
<P>
	Major retail chains said deep discounts just before Christmas  
and right after the holiday lifted retail sales in December to 
respectable levels following a disappointing start. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Commerce Department said new orders to American  
factories rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $337 billion in 
November, partly recovering from a sharp 1.7 percent decline the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth increase in six months. But for the first 11  
months of the year, factory orders still were only 2 percent higher 
than the same period of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector is really just stagnating,'' said  
economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``Two 
percent year over year is pedestrian. Orders are really just 
hanging in there, treading water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite gloomy news from Asia and elsewhere, American consumers  
spent freely in 1998. Their confidence was supported by an 
unemployment rate averaging 4.5 percent, the best since 1969; the 
lowest mortgage rates in three decades, and a rebound rally in the 
stock market following a scare during late summer and early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average retreated just 7  
points to 9,538 following Wednesday spectacular 234-point rally to 
a record 9,545. 
</P>
<P>
	Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, said 30-year, fixed-rate  
mortgages averaged 6.79 percent this week, marking the 30th 
consecutive week under 7 percent. 
</P>

	The Labor Department was scheduled to report the December  
unemployment rate on Friday. Analysts were looking for a 4.5 
percent rate, up from 4.4 percent in November. They warn it could 
push past 5 percent by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE>  Agreement Saves NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The lockout is settled, the season is saved and  
the NBA has survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The most divisive labor battle in league history finally ended  
at dawn Wednesday on the 191st day of the lockout when commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter compromised on the 
remaining issues keeping them apart and shook hands on a collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still has to be reduced to writing, meaning the lockout  
hasn't yet officially been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring any unforeseen snags, the season will begin no  
earlier than Feb. 2, with each team playing no more than 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can exhale now, without a doubt,'' said Alonzo Mourning of  
the Miami Heat. ``The deal is done and we can just focus our mind 
right now on starting back up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just 29 hours before the NBA Board of  
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. It 
came during an all-night bargaining session at NBA headquarters 
between Stern and Hunter. Union president Patrick Ewing was not 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did we blink? I guess we both blinked,'' Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I will say that I am elated that we will be  
playing basketball this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. The players, for their part, came away with their 
dignity intact and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the deal was ratified by players in a 179-5 vote  
after being approved by both negotiating committees. It gives 
owners the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on 
individual salaries and will be in place for six years, with owners 
having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors scheduled a vote on the agreement for  
this morning, and the league said it would not comment until then. 
The process of putting the agreement on paper could take 10 days, 
meaning training camps would open around Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized, it will unleash a three-week frenzy  
of teams scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of 
the 200 free agents while running abbreviated training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis  
Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the games get started, players will be faced with an  
exhausting schedule until playoffs start in late April. Teams will 
be asked on occasion to play three games in three nights, something 
that hasn't happened in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to play back-to-back-to-back games, but  
that's something we have to do as athletes,'' Jimmy Jackson, a free 
agent who last played for Golden State, told The New York Times. 
``But if you love the game, you'll do whatever it takes to be ready 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal was ratified, Stern spoke to the almost 200  
players who had flown in to vote on the owners' latest proposal -- a 
vote that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us Billy was a tough guy, but a good guy, and how glad  
he was to get it over with and to start playing again,'' Aaron 
Williams of the Seattle SuperSonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the players' response was polite, but not  
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	The players did, however, give Hunter and Ewing a standing  
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of about $2 billion in  
annual revenue in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of the 
agreement, according to several sources involved in the talks who 
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option  
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit 
on the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agreement includes a ban on marijuana, with all  
players undergoing drug testing once per season, and tougher player 
discipline penalties and conduct rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed to form a joint committee of three owners  
and three players to discuss the growth of the league and improving 
the relations between players and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, but not quite as high as the union had been demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA pushed for one throughout the lockout. The 
union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax be charged to 
any owner who signed a player for more than $15 million. The league 
kept holding out, and eventually the players relented. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys can still make $14 million, and that's a lot of money,''  
said Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors. ``If you can't live off 
that, something's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide  
the estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout went into effect July 1, just 2 1/2 weeks after Jordan  
and the Bulls won their sixth championship in a riveting Game 6 
that put up the largest TV viewer numbers ever for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s and especially since Jordan arrived, the league  
has enjoyed unprecedented popularity here and abroad. On the labor 
front, Stern and the NBA lived a relatively charmed life, while 
baseball struggled through a strike that caused thousands of fans 
to turn away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the lockout that for the first time caused the NBA  
to miss games because of a labor dispute. The first three months of 
the season were scrapped and players lost about $500 million in 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the remainder  
of the 1998-99 season, although details were still unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is tell the fans,'' Mourning said, ``that I'm  
sorry about the inconvenience. I appreciate their patience, and I'm 
sorry about any of the bad impressions that they've gotten from 
this whole ordeal, but that's what business is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that going into this thing that we were gonna step on  
some peoples' toes and upset some people, but we had to do what's 
best for the guys in this league.''

<HEADLINE> NASA End Moscow Charter Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin pulled the  
plug Thursday on a Houston-to-Moscow air charter program criticized 
by the space agency's own investigators as being far more expensive 
than commercial travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldin's action came hours after Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., called on him to ``halt 
this waste immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's inspector general, in a report released Thursday,  
estimated that the agency spent $3 million in ``excessive costs'' 
on the charter service last year. The report said the charter 
service is ``not cost effective to NASA.'' The charter flights, 
typically on Boeing 727s that seat up to 143 travelers, sometimes 
carried as few as nine people, investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldin ``decided to terminate this program as soon as  
practical,'' said NASA associate administrator Peggy Wilhide. She 
denied public scrutiny or political pressure played a role, saying, 
``There were several factors taken into consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson welcomed the action. ``We only wish they had seen the  
light before three million taxpayer dollars were squandered,'' the 
senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, NASA's Office of Space Flight rejected the  
inspector general's recommendation to terminate the charter 
service, saying the program provided ``tangible and intangible'' 
benefits to workers on the International Space Station program. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson derided the program as ``wasteful Washington  
spending,'' saying seats on the charters averaged as much as 
$20,000. ``NASA is paying at least 10 times what an average flight 
costs to Moscow,'' he said. ``NASA dollars should be devoted to 
science, not lost to bureaucratic waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA contracted with the Defense Department early last year for  
chartered flights to Russia for work on the multibillion-dollar 
space station program. 
</P>
<P>
	In proposing the charter flights -- which originate in Houston  
for Johnson Space Center workers and generally stop in Huntsville, 
Ala., and Washington, D.C., to pick up other employees -- NASA said 
the program would prove cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
	But the charters, averaging fewer than 50 people, are falling  
well short of the 90-passenger threshold NASA estimated necessary 
to provide savings, the inspector general said.

<HEADLINE> Couch Might Be Browns Bound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Decisions, decisions. Tim Couch has made up his  
mind, and now the Browns have to make up theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Cleveland, which owns the first pick in April's NFL  
draft, pick Couch, the can't-miss Kentucky quarterback? Or should 
the Browns make Texas' Ricky Williams their next great running 
back? 
</P>
<P>
	Will they trade down with the pick? Can they? What will the  
expansion draft bear? Are there any good free-agent QBs out there? 
And come to think of it, forget Couch, isn't Cleveland still 
looking for a coach? 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's announcement Thursday that he would bypass his final  
college season for the NFL gives the Browns a wonderful problem 
with many potential solutions. Unfortunately, the league will not 
permit the team to publicly discuss any of them just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams are prohibited from commenting on any of the underclassmen  
who have declared themselves eligible until the league office has 
released a finalized list of players on Monday, NFL spokesman Greg 
Aiello said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Browns, who seemed poised to talk about Couch's situation  
until suddenly clamming up Thursday afternoon, won't be heard from 
until next week. That will give football-crazed Cleveland fans at 
least another weekend to debate Couch vs. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the Browns can't talk about Couch, the All-American  
talked about the possibility of playing in Cleveland for the team 
he grew up rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got no guarantees, but I have a chance to play for one of  
the great organizations in all of sports,'' he said. ``They have 
some great owners and they're committed to winning games. Hopefully 
I'll be fortunate enough to end up in Cleveland, but if I don't 
I'll just have to make it somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before making his announcement in Lexington, Couch flew to  
Cleveland on Wednesday night and had dinner with former 49ers great 
Joe Montana, his boyhood hero. Montana worked with Browns president 
Carmen Policy in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me if I was fortunate enough to end up in Cleveland,  
Carmen Policy's a 49er guy, he's going to run things the right 
way,'' Couch said. ``Dwight Clark is there too, he's a 49er guy, 
they're going to build a great organization and I just hope that 
I'm fortunate enough to be with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch admits he was an easy sell for Montana.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just trust the guy,'' Couch said. ``He could probably sell  
me some of that snow outside right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being driven past the Browns' new stadium and the Rock and  
Roll Hall of Fame Thursday morning, Couch met with representatives 
of International Management Group, which is headquartered here. 
Couch has narrowed his choice of agents to IMG's Tom Condon, and 
Gary Wichard of Los Angeles-based Pro-Tect Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Condon, who represents Montana and Indianapolis Colts rookie  
quarterback Peyton Manning, did not return phone calls to his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Couch appears to have everything the Browns would  
want in a quarterback: size, arm strength, mobility, and touch. 
He's the best of an exceptionally deep class of quality 
quarterbacks who'll be available this spring. The group, which 
includes Cade McNown of UCLA, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse, Dante 
Culpepper of Central Florida and Akili Smith of Oregon, are all 
expected to go in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their expansion package, the Browns were given 14  
picks in this year's college draft, none as important as their 
first one. 
</P>
<P>
	From the outset, Policy has insisted that the team's foundation  
would be built with an offensive-minded coach and a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have those two blocks in place, it's almost like you  
can construct the entire building on the basis of that 
foundation,'' Policy said at a civic luncheon last month. ``So that 
gives you a little hint as to where we're looking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said he is eager to meet with Policy and Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations, in the next few days. 
He wants to begin showing them that the Browns' future should begin 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just really try to sell myself to them from here until  
April and try to convince them that I should be the person they 
build their franchise around,'' he said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators solemnly opened the first  
presidential impeachment trial in 130 years, raising their hands 
and swearing today to ``do impartial justice'' in judging whether 
President Clinton should be removed from office. House prosecutors 
delivered two articles charging the president with perjury and 
obstruction of justice. Chief Justice William Rehnquist entered the

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt says  
he wants to unmask the hypocrisy of the investigation into 
President Clinton. Flynt says he has enough sexual evidence to 
publish an embarrassing expose on a ``big fish'' Republican. Flynt 
said he will make the disclosure next week at a news conference and 
described his victim only as a GOP House member who has been a 
strong critic of Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

out, club sources said, and a news conference was scheduled for 5 
p.m. EST at the Chargers' headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy Supercluster Found Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The largest structure in the universe is a  
supercluster of thousands of galaxies that may stretch for up to a 
billion light-years across the heavens, astronomers report. 
</P>
<P>
	David Batuski and Chris Miller, University of Maine astronomers,  
said Thursday that a long filament in one end of the constellation 
Aquarius may contain more than 100,000 galaxies that are slowly 
collapsing into an immense structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the national meeting of the American Astronomical  
Society, Batuski said new studies of the supercluster show that it 
may be linked to a second filament of galaxies that is about 300 
million light-years long. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronomers first discovered the supercluster in 1997.  
Further study showed it to be at least 400 million light-years 
across and Batuski noted, ``We have some indication it may extend 
even further,'' perhaps to 1 billion light-years. 
</P>
<P>
	A light-year is about 6 trillion miles. The Aquarius structure  
is about a billion light-years from Earth and is seen from the 
Southern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Batuski said the Aquarius supercluster includes 14 groups, or  
clusters, of bright galaxies. These are called ``rich'' because of 
their brightness and because they contain at least 50 galaxies of 
stars. The rest of the supercluster is made of about 100,000 dimmer 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
	The supercluster is like a major continent in the vast ocean of  
space. Its parts are grouped in a density 20 times greater than an 
average slice of the universe. In most of the sky, there are 
immense amounts of space between galaxies or groups of galaxies, 
but in a supercluster the objects are bunched together, relatively 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Superclusters are thought to be very rare. They were unknown  
until astronomers realized in recent years that groups of galaxies 
seemed to form patterns of density instead of being randomly 
scattered about the sky. At least four other superclusters have 
been found, but none matches the mass of the Aquarius formation, 
Batuski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of superclusters may be the next stage in a  
process that is shaping and forming fundamental units in the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers believe the process began after the Big Bang,  
thought to be the origin of the universe. Matter in the universe 
expanded out rapidly, and continues to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	But some matter clumped together to form stars. Then gravity  
took over and the stars formed galaxies, then groups, then clusters 
and, now, superclusters. Most astronomers believe that supercluster 
formation is only at an early stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``These objects may be at the critical point of resisting the  
expansion and are collapsing'' into an increasingly dense super 
structures, Batuski said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth and its sister planets orbit an ordinary star, the  
sun, that is part of the Milky Way galaxy. The Milky Way, in turn, 
is one of a dozen or so galaxies that make up what is called the 
Local Group. There are smaller groups of galaxies nearby. The 
nearest cluster, containing hundreds of galaxies, is in the Virgo 
constellation, about 72 light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical galaxy can contain vast clouds of dust and gas, along  
with billions of stars such as the sun.

<HEADLINE> Panel Prepares Medicare Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission considering Medicare reforms is  
narrowing its focus to a few proposals, including raising the 
eligibility age and improving prescription drug coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope ... to try and compile a document to present so  
we can actually start making some decisions,'' said Sen. John 
Breaux, D-La., who heads the National Bipartisan Commission on the 
Future of Medicare along with Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas said at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on  
Wednesday that they want future discussions to focus on the 
proposals they believe have the best chance of getting 
commissioners' approval. 
</P>
<P>
	That will include a plan to have private health insurance  
companies compete for government contracts to provide at least a 
basic package of Medicare benefits -- making it easier for the 
government to limit its costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior citizens could choose to contribute more money of their  
own -- or health care vouchers that employers could offer as a 
retirement benefit -- if they wanted additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members, however, are far from reaching any final  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even asked Thomas and Breaux to consider pushing back the  
panel's March 1 deadline for making recommendations to Congress and 
President Clinton -- in part because of the distraction of Clinton's 
Senate impeachment trial, which was beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
	``For anybody to think that senators are going to be able to  
spend much time thinking about this issue ... I think is overly 
optimistic to say the least,'' said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Five senators are among the Medicare commission's 17 members.  
The rest are House members or private health care experts. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 11 members must approve the advisory panel's final  
report suggesting changes to prevent the cash shortage that is 
expected to hobble the nation's health care program for the elderly 
and disabled by 2008. That's just before the huge baby boom 
generation begins to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and Clinton would ultimately decide whether to enact  
any changes the commission recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, the panel has no analysis showing that any  
proposals it is considering -- or even all together -- can completely 
avert Medicare's looming financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Medicare administrator Bruce Vladeck, who was appointed  
to the commission by Clinton, said this week that he believes it 
will be impossible to solve Medicare's problems without a tax 
increase or some other injection of money, such as from the 
government budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a possibility the group has not yet seriously considered,  
partly because House Republican leaders required the commission 
members they appointed to swear off a tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux, however, said he believes the panel is making progress  
and, for now, declined to delay its deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we get closer to that date and find out we need another few  
days or a couple of weeks ... we can make that decision at the 
time,'' Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission leaders said the proposal to raise Medicare's  
eligibility age to 67 was for doing it slowly -- by about a month a 
year. People already age 62 or older would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaux and Thomas also said they were likely to suggest that  
people who still need to -- or want to -- retire at 65 should be 
allowed to buy Medicare insurance from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare does not cover most prescriptions. Private supplemental  
insurance that many senior citizens buy, known as Medigap, offers 
only limited drug coverage and is increasingly expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Options for improving drug coverage for senior citizens include  
adding it to Medicare, or requiring Medigap insurers to expand what 
they offer.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Business As Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton once found it necessary to  
deny that he had been rendered irrelevant by the Republican 
Congress, a point he seeks to prove now with business as usual 
despite his impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at that task as Congress convened, with his Senate trial  
a first order of business: Clinton announced a record $76 billion 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The era of big deficits is over,'' Clinton said, and reeled  
off a 1999 agenda of Social Security changes and programs in 
education, health care and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say that this task will be too complicated for the  
Congress and the administration to achieve, that the will is too 
weak, the political system too divided,'' he said. ``I do not agree 
with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the party lines that hardened in angry struggles over  
impeachment will not be bridged easily, despite Congress-opening 
vows of bipartisan cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a time of political defeat with Republicans dominating  
the congressional stage, Clinton declared that he was relevant to 
what happened, that his performance and proposals guaranteed it. 
</P>
<P>
	These times are worse. His comeback strategy is essentially the  
same. 
</P>
<P>
	So as the Senate begins his trial, Clinton promotes his agenda  
for action in Congress this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a selective preview of proposals to come in the State of  
the Union address he is due to deliver Jan. 19 to a joint session 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been suggestions in Congress that he ought to delay  
it because of the trial, but waiting is not to the advantage of a 
president determined to show that he is on the job, doing ``the 
work of the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, under the gathering cloud of the Monica Lewinsky  
case, Republicans speculated that he would have to postpone the 
1998 State of the Union address or deliver it in writing. The idea 
was repeated this year and rebuffed by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did neither last year, nor did he mention the Lewinsky  
case, which he had just denied but would have to confess eight 
months later. In the speech, his performance eclipsed the scandal, 
and his job approval ratings soared in the polls and have stayed up 
through it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the annual cycle repeats, with the president's nationally  
televised address on where he sees things and what he wants 
Congress to do, and then, on Feb. 1, the budget that fills in the 
blanks with numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, the White House is staging a series of events at  
which the president puts items of his agenda on display, among them 
a $6.2 billion, five-year plan to help Americans pay for long-term 
health care of their elders and disabled dependents and a $12 
billion increase in defense spending next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say help for long-term care was their idea first,  
and they want Pentagon spending increased more substantially than 
Clinton recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	That sounds like regular business, too. They've often said that  
the Democratic president claims their ideas as his and bristled at 
his success in taking credit for achievements like the budget 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also wants increased federal aid for the homeless, a  
stringent national standard against drunken drivers and action to 
curb drug abuse among prisoners and parolees, with more proposals 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will save Medicare for the 21st century,'' he said.  
``I hope we will use the surplus to save Social Security for the 
21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll need new appropriations toward the goal of hiring 100,000  
new elementary school teachers, the one major piece of his 1998 
package that actually got through the Republican Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Every president has the early advantage in framing an agenda and  
putting his proposals at the top of it, but keeping them there is 
another matter, especially in a politically divided government. 
</P>
<P>
	This president is doing it in circumstances like none before  
him, impeached, in the second half of a second term he vows to 
serve until the last hour. Only a two-thirds Senate vote to convict 
him would bar that. 
</P>
<P>
	But short of conviction, he's still the second president ever  
impeached, and he could face the censure he had invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Compromise, especially on sensitive issues like Social Security  
reform, takes mutual trust, and that is not the mood now. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994, and  
pressed their proposals in a theatrical 100-day House drive, 
Clinton insisted he was still a player, an improbably plaintive 
claim for a president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is relevant here,'' Clinton said. ``Especially  
an activist president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That remains to be tested for an impeached president on Senate  
trial. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Agent: Flutie Should Get Big Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Doug Flutie's agent is preparing to discuss  
a contract extension with the Buffalo Bills that could increase the 
quarterback's salary to $5 million or $6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Mula told The Buffalo News he plans to discuss Flutie with  
Bills general manager John Butler in Mobile, Ala., during the week 
leading up to the Jan. 23 Senior Bowl college all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I think that Doug has earned his way into an  
extension,'' Mula said. ``I want to find out how committed they are 
to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie, who guided the Bills to the playoffs after replacing Rob  
Johnson as the starter, signed a two-year incentive-laced contract 
last January that will pay him about $2.4 million for the 1998 
season and a minimum of about $2.75 million in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	With an extension, Flutie could move ahead of Johnson, who  
receives $5 million per season, on the Bills' payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Mula would not discuss specifics about the kind of deal he would  
seek for Flutie, but said his client deserved to be in the same pay 
range as fellow Pro Bowl and playoff quarterbacks Vinny Testaverde 
of the New York Jets and Randall Cunningham of the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde recently received a new contract that reportedly will  
pay him an average of $6.2 million per season. Cunningham's deal 
pays him an average of $5.6 million per year.

<HEADLINE> Nanny Pleads Guilty to Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A nanny Thursday admitted abducting a 6-year-old  
ultra-Orthodox Jew with cerebral palsy and taking him to South 
Carolina, saying the boy wasn't getting enough attention from his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Goldberg, 40, and her husband, David, originally faced  
federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges in the abduction last 
October of Chaim Weill, who is in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy. Her husband  
pleaded guilty to not reporting the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jerome Karp denied initial reports that Mrs.  
Goldberg, a Jehovah's Witness, had wanted to take the boy south for 
``holistic healing.'' She simply felt the boy needed better care, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents arrested Mrs. Goldberg in a hotel parking lot in  
Richmond, Va., two days after they disappeared. She and the boy 
were found sleeping in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaim's parents said the boy's sidelocks had been cut off and  
his yarmulke thrown away so that he wouldn't be recognized. Hasidic 
Jews observe a biblical prohibition against cutting males' side 
curls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under sentencing guidelines, Mrs. Goldberg will probably get no  
more than five years, 11 months in prison. Her husband could get up 
to a year and nine months. Sentencing was set for March 23.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Has Strong Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- 1998 proved to be a surprisingly strong year for  
the auto industry, as U.S. sales surged with the economy and the 
intense competition that generated deep discounts for new cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans bought 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year,  
the most in 12 years, the third-highest total ever and a 3 percent 
improvement over 1997. Figures released Wednesday also show 
automakers ended the year with a bang, with December sales up 7 
percent compared with the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the last major automakers who reported their results, No.  
1 General Motors Corp., which is still dealing with the effect of 
last summer's strikes on its inventory, managed a 3 percent 
improvement last month. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. both 
posted double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, foreign automakers made the biggest gains: Asian  
companies were up 4 percent while the Europeans, which have the 
smallest share of the U.S. market, improved 29 percent thanks to a 
wide array of new models. GM, Ford Motor Co. and the American 
products of DaimlerChrysler AG combined for just a 1 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The totals were better than anyone anticipated a year ago. The  
15.6 million vehicles sold were third to the 16.3 million in 1986 
and 15.7 million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year,'' said Mike DiGiovanni, head of  
market research at GM. ``No one I know forecast that level of 
sales. There's not much to complain about in terms of how the 
industry's performing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was cause for concern behind the numbers. Much of the  
increased demand was due to rebates, cut-rate financing and other 
incentives that reduced transaction prices. GM began the rise in 
incentives in April with its ``loyalty coupon'' program for 
previous customers after dismal first-quarter sales results. 
</P>
<P>
	The ploy worked, but incentives remained high the rest of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales in 1998 were more dependent on incentives than sales of  
any of the past three or four years,'' said analyst Susan Jacobs of 
Jacobs &AMP; Associates in Rutherford, N.J. ``The need for incentives 
is flagging some emerging softness in the market, even though the 
economy's strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs noted that the industry placed discounts even on some of  
the vehicles it redesigned for '99 shortly after they were 
introduced in the fall, something that's rarely been done in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reached a point where the ink wasn't even dry on the '99  
price increases before we had incentives,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most automakers are optimistic about 1999. They expect  
sales to be down slightly, but still near the 15 million level 
where they have been for an unprecedented five consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for light trucks, the classification that includes sport  
utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, continued to surge at the 
expense of cars. For the year, truck sales were up 8 percent while 
car sales fell 2 percent. Trucks represented a record 48 percent of 
the market; buyers chose more trucks than cars in November -- the 
first month that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's truck sales set a company record and surpassed the 2  
million mark for the third consecutive year, despite the 
strikes-related slowdown in production and the fall plant 
changeover for GM's redesigned full-size pickup, its biggest 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also were blamed for causing GM's market share to  
fall to 29.2 percent from 31.1 percent in 1997. DiGiovanni 
estimated that the strikes cost GM about 1.3 share points last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is producing its new pickups at full speed, but demand has  
been so strong that inventories remain half of what they were a 
year ago, DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker wants to get its market share up to 30 percent in  
the first quarter and has set what it calls a ``stretch goal'' of 
32 percent for the year. ``It will be difficult to attain 32, but 
it gives us a target to shoot for,'' DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's sales increased 19 percent for December and 11 percent  
for the year. Honda was up 6 percent in December and 7 percent for 
the year. Both automakers posted strong gains in sales of their 
SUVs and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are indications of a gradual slowdown in '99,  
the sales surge in December fueled one of the industry's best-ever 
yearend closeouts,'' said Yale Gieszl, a Toyota vice president.

<HEADLINE> Cult Expert Louis Jolyon West Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dr. Louis Jolyon West, a psychiatrist and  
cult expert who conducted court-ordered examinations of Jack Ruby 
and Patricia Hearst, has died of cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	West, who died Saturday at his home here, headed the psychiatry  
department and the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of 
California at Los Angeles for 20 years. He retired in 1989, but 
remained active in research and mentoring students. 
</P>
<P>
	West began studying torture and brainwashing during the Korean  
War, and eventually expanded his research to include post-traumatic 
stress syndrome, alcohol and drug abuse, pain, sleep problems, 
dreams and hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	West frequently served as a court-appointed expert psychiatrist.  
He testified that Ruby, killer of President Kennedy's assassin, Lee 
Harvey Oswald, suffered from ``major mental illness apparently 
precipitated by the stress of his trial and its aftermath.'' That 
opinion forestalled Ruby's death sentence, and he died of cancer in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	West was also one of four psychiatrists who examined Hearst, the  
kidnapping victim turned bank robber, before her 1976 trial. The 
panel found she was sane and able to stand trial but 
``psychologically damaged as a result of torture.'' It recommended 
she should be treated before the trial, a recommendation ignored by 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech after Hearst's conviction, West said, ``The  
government finished the destruction of her life started by an 
anti-government group.'' Her sentence was eventually commuted. 
</P>
<P>
	West was sought out by the news media for insight on cults as  
recently as 1997, when the group Heaven's Gate staged a mass 
suicide in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil rights activist, West was the first white psychiatrist  
to go to South Africa to testify on behalf of black prisoners 
during the attempt to end apartheid. He was a member of the White 
House Conference on Civil Rights in 1966, and he worked for years 
to abolish the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Study: Humans Caused Extinctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most of the large animals in Australia were  
driven to extinction by the early humans who colonized the 
continent and began using fire to burn the forests, a new study 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of researchers led by Gifford Miller of the University of  
Colorado at Boulder reports today in the journal Science that an 
analysis of fossilized egg shells from a huge extinct bird suggests 
that the animals disappeared after humans repeatedly scorched the 
earth in the central regions of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The bird, called Genyornis newtoni, died out 50,000 years ago.  
More than 85 percent of the Australian animals weighing more than 
100 pounds disappeared at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Just what killed off the Australian animals long has been  
debated by scientists. Some propose the extinctions were caused by 
climatic changes, and others blame early human colonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have compelling evidence that the Genyornis  
extinction date is applicable to the vast majority of Australian 
megafauna (large animals),'' Miller said in a statement. ``There 
are certainly no secure dates to refute this supposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humans arrived in Australia 53,000 to 60,000 years ago and  
brought to the continent the controlled use of fire. Miller and his 
co-authors said the humans burned vast areas of the outback more 
frequently than natural burning caused by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire was used as a hunting tool, as a way to promote new plant  
growth and as a signal between groups, the researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
	This burning, said Beverly Johnson, a co-author, was extremely  
destructive in what was already a fragile, dry environment. She 
said it so disrupted the normal growth cycles of shrubs and trees 
that the plants eventually died out and deprived the Genyornis and 
other animals of their primary food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The frequent burning pushed the ecosystem beyond the point  
where it could regenerate,'' said Johnson, now a researcher at the 
University of Washington in Seattle. Genyornis was so specialized 
in what it ate that it simply perished from malnutrition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genyornis relied primarily on shrubs and trees,'' she said.  
``Emus (another large bird) that lived at the same time had a more 
variable diet, feeding on grasses, trees and shrubs. It survived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extinctions have occurred naturally on all continents over the  
last tens of thousands of years, but Australian fauna has suffered 
the most. About 60 distinct species disappeared. Among them were 19 
types of marsupials, some weighing more than 220 pounds; a 
hippo-sized animal that was related to the wombat; a 25-foot-long 
snake; a 25-foot-long lizard, and a horned tortoise that was the 
size of a small car. 
</P>
<P>
	Genyornis was a huge bird, weighing more than 200 pounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller, Johnson and their co-authors found evidence of the  
ecosystem change by analyzing the fossil shells of the Genyornis. 
The tests, on shells found in three different locations, determined 
the types of food the bird ate and documented their age. 
</P>
<P>
	Genyornis, they found, appeared about 100,000 years ago and then  
abruptly disappeared about 50,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said that the team eliminated climate change as the  
cause of the Genyornis extinction. She said the animal endured 
extreme climates changes over its 50,000 years of existence and 
died out only after humans had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy F. Flannery, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, said  
the study by Miller and his colleagues has ``broken new ground in 
dating megafaunal extinction in Australia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flannery, writing an analysis in Science, said the eggshell  
studies ``represent a major challenge'' to scientists who believe 
the Australian extinctions were caused by climate.

<HEADLINE> Are Schools Accountable for Results? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools get report cards now and more students  
take tests to prove they've mastered their lessons, but a new study 
reveals that few states have tough policies to hold schools 
accountable for results. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide study released Thursday by the publication  
Education Week says 48 states now test students to see if they've 
learned material taught, and 36 states publish report cards on 
individual schools, but only a handful have comprehensive policies 
to reward success and identify failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``An analysis of statewide efforts shows that most are skirting  
the edges of a serious accountability system,'' the study says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, states began to set education standards for  
the knowledge and skills educators believe students should know at 
certain grade levels. States developed tests to find out whether 
students, teachers and schools were making the grade. Now, the 
focus has shifted to figuring out what to do when students or 
schools don't meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the 50-state picture, we're at a very, very  
perilous stage,'' says Richard Elmore, a professor at Harvard 
University's Graduate School of Education. ``The progress at the 
state and local levels is very uneven, and the systems are much 
slower to develop and much more complicated than a lot of reformers 
expected them to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the study's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Nineteen states, or fewer than half, publicly rate the  
performance of all schools, or at least identify low-performing 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sixteen states have the authority to close, take over or  
overhaul failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Fourteen states offer financial rewards for individual schools  
based on performance. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nineteen states require students to pass state tests to  
graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
	--Two states have tried to tie the evaluation of individual  
teachers to student performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Chester Finn Jr., an education official under President Reagan  
and president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation in Washington, 
said people generally have two schools of thought on 
accountability: Those -- often educators -- who think that 
performance will improve if students are given enough resources and 
support, and those -- often business people and elected officials -- 
who think schools need external pressure to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, for instance, publishes report cards on all  
schools, including their marks on statewide tests. The state also 
offers grants to school districts that have improved over time, but 
has no explicit sanctions for schools that don't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Texas schools and districts can receive cash awards  
for top performance, but also could be taken over if their 
achievement falls below a certain level. High school students in 
Texas must pass state graduation tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Education schools can lose their accreditation if too many of  
their students fail teacher-licensing tests. There also is a system 
to link teachers' evaluations to schoolwide test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey by Public Agenda, a public opinion research group, also  
published in Education Week, indicates that most teachers 
disapprove of tying financial incentives for teachers to student 
improvement or replacing the faculties at failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's 2,600 interviews were done with public school  
teachers, parents of public school students, children in public 
middle or high schools, college professors who taught freshmen and 
sophomores in the last two years and employers who hire for 
entry-level positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Done in October and November 1998, the survey had a margin of  
error of plus or minus 6 percentage points for employers and 
college professors and 4 percentage points for other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In the survey, 60 percent of employers and 53 percent of parents  
favor tying financial incentives for teachers and principals to 
student improvement. But only 22 percent of teachers said this was 
a good idea.

<HEADLINE> Coming: A Big Impact on Your Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You had better prepare yourself because this can  
have a big impact on your finances and your way of life, and there 
are signs already that it is relentlessly advancing upon us. 
</P>
<P>
	It is deflation, something most people have never experienced  
and, had they ever given it a thought, never thought they would 
see. But it is not far away, and some experienced viewers say they 
can see it even now. 
</P>
<P>
	Deflation, popularly defined, is when consumer prices actually  
drop rather than merely disinflate, the latter meaning prices 
rising at a lesser and lesser rate. As a result, deflation raises a 
dollar's purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	So why worry? You needn't, for the time being anyway. In fact,  
you should be considering how you might take advantage of the 
situation to build up your assets, now that jobs are plentiful and 
wages rising. 
</P>
<P>
	After a while, however, it could become a matter of very serious  
concern. As is sometimes pointed out, there is good deflation and 
bad deflation, but more about that later. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the prices of some consumer products are deflating. You  
know they are, for example, if you purchased a computer six years 
ago and now view advertisements for better products at literally 
half the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition is one explanation. Competition has never been on a  
global scale as it is now. Low-wage countries can cut prices by so 
much that their counterparts in more advanced countries have little 
choice but to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	In the more advanced industrial nations the only way they can do  
this is to cut their own costs, which more than ever before they 
are attempting to do. They must, in order to get more product for 
the same expense. 
</P>
<P>
	A drop in the prices of commodities or raw materials, many of  
them from less-developed nations, aid in cost-cutting. And 
productivity-improving electronics and low interest rates make a 
very big dent in costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Edward Yardeni adds another factor in accounting for  
low prices. It is peace. ``Wars are inflationary,'' he says, 
``while peace tends to be deflationary.'' It is a simple historical 
observation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another factor is involved. It is you, the consumer, who  
won't buy anything if it isn't on sale. For instance buying clubs, 
increasingly popular, can cut a quarter from each dollar spent on 
supermarket items. 
</P>
<P>
	This can be a wonderful state of affairs, up to a point. What  
happens, for example, if a company has to keep cutting prices but 
still cannot maintain volume? It begins cutting jobs. It cuts 
capital spending. 
</P>
<P>
	When that happens to a consumer the first impulse is to cut back  
wherever possible. And, because companies have already cut back on 
equipment and plant additions, their suppliers must cut back on 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	This, you'll agree, is when deflation goes bad. Budgets  
everywhere are cut, except perhaps in government. Cutting becomes 
everyone's defense, and the competition to do so leads to less and 
less of everything but problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone will agree with Yardeni, Deutsche Bank's chief  
economist, that ``deflation is no longer a risk,'' but ``a clear 
and present danger.'' Or that a Year 2000 recession could be the 
deflation trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it can't be denied that general disinflation already is  
upon us and that there is spotty evidence of deflation. The 
challenge for policy-makers is to keep it the good kind, and the 
question is, can they?

	Factory Orders Rise 0.6 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New orders to U.S. factories rebounded in  
November, partially recovering from a sharp decline the month 
before, but analysts are watching a worrisome year-end spike in 
unemployment benefit applications. Orders rose 0.6 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted $337 billion, following a 1.7 percent plunge -- 
the sharpest in five months -- in October, the Commerce Department 
said today. It was the fifth increase in six months, suggesting the 
economy was winding up 1998 on a strong note. For the first 11 
months of the year, factory orders were 2 percent higher than in 
the same period of 1997. 

</P>
<P>
	Jobless Claims Fall by 22,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing applications  
for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 last week, partially 
recovering from the week before when claims recorded the worst 
increase in six years. A seasonally adjusted 350,000 jobless 
workers filed claims during the week ended Jan. 2, down from 
372,000 the week before, the Labor Department said today. Claims 
had hit an eight-month low of 289,000 during the week ended Dec. 19 
but during Christmas week shot up by 83,000, the biggest increase 
since July 1992. 

</P>

	Discounts Boost Retail Sales  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deep discounts right before and after Christmas  
finally inspired shoppers to spend enthusiastically, and that burst 
of buying lifted December retail sales from disappointing to 
respectable levels. Discounters fared the best during the holiday 
season, thanks to their affordable prices and wide selection. 
Specialty stores also reported healthy sales gains, especially home 
furnishing and clothing chains. The nation's largest retailers 
announced their monthly sales figures today. The weakest numbers 
came from department stores, including moderately priced chains 
like J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.

before 11 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 79.55 
at 9,465.42. Broader stock indicators were lower as well. Just 
before the hour, the Nasdaq composite index was down 10.70 at 
2,310.16. Yesterday, the Dow ended 233.78 higher to close at

	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom reportedly plans to offer more than  
$55 billion for AirTouch Communications Inc., potentially creating 
a three-way bidding brawl for the nation's largest independent 
wireless phone company. USA Today reported in today's editions that 
the bid could be announced as early as this week. MCI WorldCom 
spokesman Jim Monroe declined comment on the report this morning. 
San Francisco-based AirTouch previously confirmed it was in 
separate merger discussions with Bell Atlantic Corp., the Baby Bell

	Eisner Bonus Is Cut in Half  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Eisner's 1998 bonus was cut by nearly  
half after Walt Disney Co. registered weak earnings growth amid the 
Asian financial crisis, poor box office performance and costly new 
ventures. The bonus was $5 million, down from $9.9 million in 1997, 
according to Disney documents filed yesterday with the federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission. Disney earnings grew just 4 
percent in 1998, compared with 48 percent in 1997. Eisner blamed 
the company's sluggish growth on big investments in projects such 
as Animal Kingdom near Walt Disney World in Florida and the new 
Disney Cruise Line.

rate for loans to commercial banks to 6 percent from 6.25 percent. 
The move followed cuts of a half percentage point in November and 
December, and a quarter percentage point cut in October. 
Separately, Denmark's central bank cut its key securities 
repurchase rate on Thursday by 0.2 percentage points to 3.75 
percent.

	HONG KONG (AP) -- Share prices across Asia got a lift today from  
Wall Street's record close, but news of economic troubles in Brazil 
wiped away some of the gains in Tokyo and Singapore while pushing 
shares lower in Bangkok. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average 
closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent, at 13,536.56, after giving 
up strong early gains as investors saw their sentiment dampened by 
bad news from Brazil, where the state of Minas Gerais declared a 
90-day moratorium on debt payments to the federal government 
because of a lack of money. Singapore's Straits Times Index managed 
to retain a strong gain of 3.6 percent, or 52.91 points, to close 
at 1,517.88. In Bangkok, the Brazil news knocked 1.2 percent, or 
4.84 points, off the SET index, which closed at 397.72 points.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Favorite Crashes in Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHLADMING, Austria (AP) -- Austrian favorite Thomas  
Stangassinger crashed. But his 20-year-old teammate gave 30,000 
Austrian ski fans what they wanted: a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Raich, a rookie on the World Cup tour, came from the  
23rd position after the first run Thursday to capture the first 
victory of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is sensational,'' said Raich, a five-time World Junior  
Champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich's comeback went down in the record books. The biggest  
previous comeback in slalom dated to 1974, when Swedish star 
Ingemar Stenmark came from 17th place to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only meant to have a good second run, and instead I won,'' a  
jubilant Raich said. 
</P>
<P>
	After blazing down the second run, Raich waited anxiously at the  
finish line to see the times of the skiers who came after him. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered wildly as, one by one, Raich's rivals finished  
behind him or crashed before reaching the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	Raich showed reporters the blue Superman t-shirt he bought to  
wear under his race suit in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brought me luck,'' Raich said.  
</P>
<P>
	The steep course -- with one especially tricky gate -- claimed  
seven of the top 30 racers, including Stangassinger, the 1994 
Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed really hard to try to win,'' said Stangassinger, who  
was in second position after the first run. ``But when you want to 
win, sometimes you fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raich, at his first full season on the World Cup tour, completed  
the two-run race in 1 minute, 33.32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Austrian has been improving race by race. On  
Wednesday, he finished third in a World Cup slalom in Kranjska 
Gora, Slovenia, won by hometown favorite Jure Kosir. 
</P>
<P>
	France's Pierrick Bourgeat, 22, winner of the first slalom of  
the season, finished second, just .12 back. 
</P>
<P>
	Norwegian Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who has won 14 races in his  
career, but none this season, finished third in 1:33.51. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992 -- when he was Raich's age -- Aamodt won the Olympic  
super-G title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more fun beating the old guys than being beaten by the  
young ones,'' said Aamodt, now 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosir, who was leading the race after the first run, slid to  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Italian star Alberto Tomba won the previous two editions  
of the Schladming slalom, which is run under floodlights. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his crash Thursday, Stangassinger kept his lead in the  
World Cup slalom standings. Bourgeat moved into second position, 
and Kosir is third. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian powerhouse Hermann Maier, who does not race slalom,  
holds a 59-point lead in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's next race is a super-G Saturday in Schladming.

<HEADLINE> Chicago, Pacific Exchanges End Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A proposed merger between the Chicago Board  
Options Exchange and the San Francisco-based Pacific Exchange was 
called off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange's board of directors voted unanimously to  
end the talks after learning last month that the U.S. Justice 
Department would require an extensive review of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``CBOE's decision to terminate discussions with PCX was made  
strictly on the basis of our available time and resources,'' CBOE 
Chairman William J. Brodsky said in a statement. ``The board's

<HEADLINE> Gardener `Mania' Defense Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A gardener who strangled and raped a  
14-year-old girl in 1962 failed Thursday in an attempt to get his 
life sentence thrown out on the grounds he suffered ``episodes of 
mania'' from exposure to insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
	James R. Moore, 64, said he should be freed because his symptoms  
have vanished. He said he thought he was being sent to an 
institution for the criminally insane, rather than a prison, when 
he pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has tried repeatedly to have his sentence set aside. This  
is the first time, however, that he cited exposure to dieldrin. 
</P>
<P>
	The insecticide was banned in New York in 1985 because it can  
cause damage to the liver and central nervous system. Rachel 
Carson's 1962 book ``Silent Spring'' said dieldrin causes mania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know now that they were the true cause of the `depraved act'  
on the young girl I murdered,'' Moore said at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe County Judge William Bristol rejected the argument.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Robert Mastrocola said Moore's overture was  
irrelevant. ``He admitted what he did and accepted the sentence,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was spared execution when he pleaded guilty in exchange  
for a life sentence without parole.

<HEADLINE> Gay Philadelphia Cop Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The first city police officer recruited  
through a new campaign to reach out to gays shot himself to death 
near Independence Hall a month after graduating from the police 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Kalt Jr., 26, died of a single gunshot wound to the head  
from his own service revolver Wednesday afternoon. He had shot 
himself in a park near Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell 
pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He left two notes at his residence, the contents of which  
clearly denote suicide,'' said police Capt. Linda MacLachlin. 
``They indicate he was troubled by personal issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Philadelphia lost a fine officer,'' Mark Segal, publisher of  
the Philadelphia Gay News, said in a statement. ``Officer Kalt was 
a pioneer for our community and will always be remembered for his 
courage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt resigned from the force Monday, an action that became  
effective Tuesday, police said. He was one of 326 officers to 
graduate from the academy Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication whatsoever that his death was the  
result of any problems he had with the police department, with his 
assignment, with the men and women he worked with,'' Police 
Commissioner John Timoney said. ``It is really just a sad day for 
this organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kalt was still in possession of his service revolver and badge  
while counselors were talking to him about options short of 
resigning, such as taking a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unusual for recruits to rethink their career shortly  
after leaving the academy, which is a protected environment in 
which they are not exposed to the stresses of the street,'' Ms. 
MacLachlin said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout Hurt Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some NBA cheerleaders had to flash their moves at a bar mitzvah  
instead of a basketball game. Around dormant arenas, empty sports 
bars closed early and parking attendants sat around in vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
	These hardships, felt in small doses around the country, are the  
most significant economic effects of the 6-month NBA lockout that 
will end with an agreement reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that while the lockout may have caused steep  
losses for individuals and small businesses, the overall economic 
impact wasn't significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lockout might determine where people in Chicago drink  
beer. But it clearly doesn't affect how much beer they drink,'' 
said Allen Sanderson, a sports economist at the University of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cities, economists said, the NBA lockout was the  
equivalent of a big department store closing temporarily -- 
employees and nearby businesses would be affected, but consumers 
could certainly find somewhere else to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson is part of a group that shares Chicago Bulls season  
tickets and would have attended two or three games by now. ``But 
we've just gone to more movies, we went to concerts more often, 
probably spent more on Christmas gifts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	True enough, but some who depend on basketball directly for  
their livelihood were still left scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Laker Girls, who would normally be working on their halftime  
routines, were instead banking on various public appearances -- 
including one fan's bar mitzvah several weeks ago. Each Laker Girl 
has lost thousands of dollars, despite the $75 per hour they get 
for these special events. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not like the players,'' said the squad's director, Lisa  
Estrada. ``This has always been part-time work, and most of the 
girls either go to school or have other jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Philadelphia, Mayor Edward Rendell is trying to lure people  
to city hotels for Valentine's weekend to make up for the loss of 
the NBA's All-Star Game next month. This week, the city launched a 
promotion called ``Love Is More Than a Game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the league has salvaged its season, the All-Star  
Game remains canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the street from Milwaukee's Bradley Center, home of the  
Bucks, the Legends sports bar had cut most of its full-time staff 
down to 20 hours a week during the lockout, manager Kathie Taglieri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't keep them here just to help them out, because we're  
also hurting,'' Taglieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday when the Bucks should have been playing the Golden  
State Warriors, the bar closed two hours early because there was 
only one customer. Usually, 300 to 900 people come before and after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, the Diamond Parking lot across from the Delta  
Center has been empty instead of pulling in the usual $10 to $12 
per car for its 100-space lot on game nights. ``The only existence 
for that location is for the Jazz,'' manager Damon Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the damage has been mostly local, the lockout has had  
some broader impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters have been forced to fill air time with movies and  
other sporting events such as golf and skiing, which are much less 
attractive to most advertisers. NBC replaced the Knicks-Bulls game 
on Christmas Day with another showing of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' 
the Jimmy Stewart classic. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports, which have national rights to broadcast  
NBA games, and Fox Sports Net, which has local cable rights to 26 
teams, have yet to disclose how much the lockout will cost them. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports will each be reimbursed by the league --  
either financially or with replacement games. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball shoe sales were already off before the lockout but  
the slump deepened as NBA games were canceled. Nike Inc. chairman 
Phil Knight compared the lockout to a fashion designer losing one 
of its major runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike will now resume its payments to NBA stars that endorse its  
shoes, which had been suspended last month because of the lockout, 
said spokeswoman Vizhier Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely thrilled that the runway is open again,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike shares soared $2.93 3/4 to close at $43.62 1/2 Wednesday on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Competitor Reebok International Ltd. 
gained 56 1/4 cents to $16.25.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Iraq Inspection Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American weapons experts, including some from  
intelligence agencies, helped U.N. inspectors hunt for Iraqi 
weapons and gained information that assisted U.S. military 
planners, Clinton administration officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials rejected suggestions that the Americans were  
proxy spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to handle the arms inspection job on its own, the U.N.  
Special Commission on Iraq requested help from dozens of countries, 
including the United States. U.S. experts in chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons were attached to UNSCOM on temporary 
assignment, White House and State Department officials said. The 
information they collected was controlled entirely by the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business of weapons of mass destruction arms control is  
extremely serious and cannot be carried out by amateurs,'' said 
State Department deputy spokesman James Foley. ``The United States 
has sent UNSCOM our best weapons experts, both from the government 
and private organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But once these officials returned to their U.S. agencies, they  
carried with them valuable information that vastly improved the 
U.S. intelligence picture of Iraq, information useful to strike 
target planners, among others. Some of the experts sent to UNSCOM 
came from U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a U.S. official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The identity of the agencies 
sending U.S. officials to work with the United Nations was not 
disclosed to the Iraqis, making officials, in effect, undercover 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Butler, UNSCOM's chief weapons inspector, said he asked  
U.S. officials Thursday ``what they might have done unbeknownst to 
us,'' in using U.N. weapons searches in Iraq to undermine Saddam 
Hussein's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Butler said he  
expected to have another ``relevant conversation about it'' on 
Friday with U.S. officials and that he ``wanted real answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want our system misused in that way,'' Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he also discussed his concerns with U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who in turn has been in phone contact 
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern at the United Nations that ostensibly international  
inspections benefited U.S. intelligence threatens to undermine the 
basis for administration policy on Iraq. More than a year of 
tension between Washington and Baghdad began in the fall of 1997 
when Iraq demanded an end to U.S. participation in the weapons 
inspections, charging that they were espionage operations. Iraq's 
lack of cooperation with the U.N. inspectors since then culminated 
in the pre-Christmas U.S. and British airstrikes on scores of 
targets in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said critics now endorsing  
Iraq's repeated charges of espionage are ``looking through the 
wrong end of the telescope.'' The intensive inspections, with the 
help of U.S. experts, Crowley said, became necessary only after 
Iraq failed to live up to the promises it made at the end of the 
1991 Persian Gulf War. Continued Iraqi resistance to the 
inspections ``has required UNSCOM to go to enormous lengths'' to 
collect information. 

</P>
<P>
	Press reports this week about the U.S. role in the inspections  
have exposed a widening rift between the administration and U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Administration officials suspect 
Annan's aides leaked the story to undercut Butler, whose aggressive 
style has led to sharp criticism from Baghdad and support from 
Washington. Annan, administration officials fear, is trying to 
manufacture a reason for replacing the UNSCOM inspection team with 
a less intrusive body, one that would lack any U.S. involvement. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also voiced concern that some members' of Annan's  
inner circle have been openly supportive of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials and diplomats from France and Russia, on the  
other hand, say the United States is simply looking for ways to 
maintain economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely. The best way, 
they say, appears to be for the makeup of UNSCOM to remain 
unacceptable to Iraq and for no inspections to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can accept the status quo right now,'' Foley said at the  
State Department. ``We would like to see an effective UNSCOM going 
back in there, and only an effective UNSCOM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence officials, meanwhile, have been dismayed at  
the level of detail reported this week on the methods of 
information collection used in the weapons inspection effort. The 
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, for example, that the United 
States installed a ``black box'' listening device that intercepted 
signals from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's presidential 
communications network. 
</P>
<P>
	The encrypted messages were beamed via satellite to the U.S.  
National Security Agency center for decoding and translation. 
Material relating to Iraqi weapons was forwarded to the United 
Nations. But other information, including details on the 
whereabouts of Iraqi leaders, was kept by U.S. intelligence.

<HEADLINE> ITF Seeks One-Year Ban for Korda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Tennis Federation admitted  
Thursday that it own appeals committee was wrong in not suspending 
Australian Open champion Petr Korda after he failed a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	After complaints from some top players, the ITF said Thursday it  
would seek to overturn the ruling and impose a one-year suspension 
on Korda, who tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone at 
Wimbledon in July. 
</P>
<P>
	ITF president Brian Tobin, speaking at the Hopman Cup in Perth,  
Australia, said the federation was unhappy with the Dec. 22 
decision of the appeals committee and would seek to overturn it at 
the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis has been criticized for a lenient policy toward drugs and  
Korda's case was seen as the latest example, coming just weeks 
before the Feb. 2-4 IOC-sponsored world anti-doping summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF appeals committee acknowledged Korda had tested positive  
for a steroid on July 1 at Wimbledon, but cited ``exceptional 
circumstances'' in deciding against any suspension. Korda was only 
stripped of his Wimbledon prize money and ranking points. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee accepted Korda's explanation that he had no idea  
how the drug got in his system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tobin said the appeals committee's decision did not reflect  
the ITF's wishes. He said he agreed with players who believe the 
excuse was insufficient reason for Korda to escape a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I question if that is a legitimate reason for reducing the  
penalty,'' Tobin said Thursday. ``We did prove that he was 
positive, and if it happened to me I'd say the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ITF, at Korda's urging, Thursday released the full findings  
of the appeals committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, which received a character reference in Korda's  
defense from three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, concluded 
that Korda acted ``innocently and reasonably'' and described him as 
an ``honest, open and reliable witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- acknowledged there were minor flaws in the testing and custody  
procedures of Korda's urine sample, but said it was satisfied with 
the positive results ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- dismissed arguments by Korda's lawyer that the steroid may  
have entered his system by eating meat from animals that had 
ingested the steroid. 
</P>
<P>
	-- dismissed the defense argument that a mixup may have occurred  
with the sample of a female player who was taking oral 
contraceptives containing norethisterone. 
</P>
<P>
	-- noted that Korda's was the only positive test at Wimbledon.  
</P>
<P>
	ITF spokesman Alun James said the federation expected to lodge  
its initial appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sports on 
Friday or Monday. He said a ruling could take up to four months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Korda is free to defend his title in this  
month's Australian Open and to play in any tennis event, James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked women's player Lindsay Davenport criticized tennis  
officials, saying, ``It seems that in tennis there's always 
exceptions made for players for whatever it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Swedish player Jonas Bjorkman claimed that tennis officials  
``cover up'' positive tests and accused authorities of being 
``scared'' to act.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton May Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Democrats are urging Hillary Rodham  
Clinton to run for the Senate from New York in 2000, and the first 
lady is not ruling out the idea. Friends are quietly circulating 
her name as a possible candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, her closest aides and confidants say Mrs. Clinton is not  
actively considering the Senate bid -- at least not yet. It is one 
of many options on the table, one that is as likely to be discarded 
as explored, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's aware that people are speculating about what she might  
do in 2000, but at this point she has no plans to run for elective 
office,'' said spokeswoman Marsha Berry. ``For the next two years, 
she wants to make the most out of being first lady. I'm not in the 
position to rule it out. I'm just telling you I can't tell you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about a Hillary-for-Senate campaign intensified when  
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., told NBC on Sunday that he wouldn't 
be surprised if Mrs. Clinton ran for the seat long held by 
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is not seeking 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli's spokeswoman, Joy Howell, said her boss doesn't know  
what Mrs. Clinton will do. As chairman of the Senate campaign 
committee, Torricelli is just trying to recruit a good candidate, 
Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say Torricelli was acting on his own, not  
on Mrs. Clinton's behalf. They say he has repeatedly urged her to 
run, mostly through intermediaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York Democratic Party, said  
Mrs. Clinton asked her several months ago not to encourage 
speculation about a Senate bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised if this is what she chose to do,'' said  
Hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet several confidants of Mrs. Clinton, all of whom spoke on  
condition of anonymity, said there is something to the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	One close friend said this week that she has talked to the first  
lady about possibly running for the Senate seat. The conversations 
were casual and not substantial, but Mrs. Clinton knows friends are 
circulating her name, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	A leading Democratic official in New York said allies of Mrs.  
Clinton have discussed a possible bid with state leaders. It 
doesn't appear to be an organized, aggressive operation, but the 
whisper campaign helped sparked the recent spate of rumors, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	An administration official close to the Clintons said the first  
lady won't rule out a campaign because she can't give it serious 
consideration until after the Monica Lewinsky controversy subsides. 
After that, she likely will take a look at it, though the official 
anticipated that Mrs. Clinton won't run. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment was echoed by several others close to the first  
lady, who say no polling or organizing has begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say Mrs. Clinton has several political options opened to  
her, including seeking Senate seats in Illinois or California and 
even a presidential race somewhere down the line. Given the 
family's massive legal debt, they say, she may instead join 
corporate boards, return to practicing law or write a book to make 
serious money. 
</P>
<P>
	She has never been a hotter political commodity.  
</P>
<P>
	With the scandal-ridden president a liability to most campaigns,  
Mrs. Clinton was a big draw in the 1998 midterm elections and 
addressed fawning New York audiences. Polls show her national 
approval rating is higher than ever, rising on a tide of sympathy 
during the Lewinsky inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is not the only potential New York Senate candidate  
with White House ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the son of former New York Gov.  
Mario Cuomo, will soon decide whether to run. If Cuomo sought the 
seat, Mrs. Clinton would be unlikely to challenge him, say allies 
of both. If he bows out, speculation about a first lady candidacy 
would skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Shalala, secretary of the Department of Health and Human  
Services, is no longer giving the race a serious look. 
</P>
<P>
	John Marino, former New York party chairman, would love to see  
Mrs. Clinton run but said she must decide quickly. Other potential 
Democratic candidates need a heads up, he said, and she can't wait 
much longer to start raising money. 
</P>
<P>
	Residency wouldn't be a problem. Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the  
state Board of Elections, said she would have until Election Day to 
rent or buy in New York. And Robert Kennedy was a latecomer to New 
York when he won a Senate seat in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting elected would be tougher. Party leaders say New Yorkers  
wouldn't be dazzled by the ``first lady'' title. The state media 
would be typically hard-knuckled. And no politicians, Democratic or 
Republican, would pull their punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Bill Cunningham, a Moynihan adviser: ``I don't know if  
everybody will put their ambitions on hold just because the first 
lady wants to become senator.''

<HEADLINE> WB Head Says Young Is Where It's At </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The future belongs to young television  
viewers and networks that know how to attract them, said the head 
of WB, the home of such teen-heavy shows as ``Felicity'' and 
``Dawson's Creek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisers' preference for the under-35 crowd will only grow,  
further eroding the traditional broadcast networks and boosting 
so-called niche operations like WB, its chief executive officer, 
Jamie Kellner, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's going to be a fragmented marketplace, make sure the  
fragment you're hanging onto is valuable in terms of advertisers,'' 
Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner, noting that he was in his 50s, concurred with the  
advertising community's firmly held belief that young viewers are 
more susceptible to commercials than older ones and thus worth 
paying higher ad rates to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB does not dismiss all older viewers, he said: adults 35 to  
49 make up 22 percent of WB's audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner made his remarks to the Television Critics Association,  
which opened its annual winter session Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Any gloating done by the network is understandable. Among  
competitors including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and UPN, WB is the only 
one to show a ratings increase from last season. WB is up in both 
households and in the 18-49 categories. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the No. 1 network with teen-agers.

<HEADLINE>  Agreement Saves NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The lockout is settled, the season is saved and  
the NBA has survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The most divisive labor battle in league history finally ended  
at dawn Wednesday on the 191st day of the lockout when commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter compromised on the 
remaining issues keeping them apart and shook hands on a collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still has to be reduced to writing, meaning the lockout  
hasn't yet officially been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring any unforeseen snags, the season will begin no  
earlier than Feb. 2, with each team playing no more than 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can exhale now, without a doubt,'' said Alonzo Mourning of  
the Miami Heat. ``The deal is done and we can just focus our mind 
right now on starting back up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached just 29 hours before the NBA Board of  
Governors was to vote on canceling the remainder of the season. It 
came during an all-night bargaining session at NBA headquarters 
between Stern and Hunter. Union president Patrick Ewing was not 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did we blink? I guess we both blinked,'' Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Said Stern: ``I will say that I am elated that we will be  
playing basketball this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side made significant compromises to close the deal, but  
the owners clearly walked away with a much better agreement than 
the old one. The players, for their part, came away with their 
dignity intact and with more money for the non-superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the deal was ratified by players in a 179-5 vote  
after being approved by both negotiating committees. It gives 
owners the unprecedented concession of a maximum limit on 
individual salaries and will be in place for six years, with owners 
having an option for a seventh year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm so relieved it's unbelievable,'' Milwaukee Bucks coach  
George Karl said. ``It's like I let a balloon out of my stomach. 
The knots are already loosening up in my neck. I get to do what I 
love to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Governors scheduled a vote on the agreement for  
this morning, and the league said it would not comment until then. 
The process of putting the agreement on paper could take 10 days, 
meaning training camps would open around Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the deal is finalized, it will unleash a three-week frenzy  
of teams scrambling to fill rosters, make trades and sign some of 
the 200 free agents while running abbreviated training camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the free agents are Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis  
Rodman, Charles Barkley, Antonio McDyess, Rod Strickland and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably have eight months of NBA basketball squeezed  
into four months, with trades and signings,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the new agreement, a grandfather clause allows  
any player to re-sign with his team for 105 percent of his previous 
salary. That means Jordan, who made about $33 million last year, 
could get about $34.7 million from the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can offer him more than $14 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to analyze the deal, see what Chicago wants  
to do and then make an informed decision,'' agent David Falk said. 
``I'm not certain what his time frame is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the games get started, players will be faced with an  
exhausting schedule until playoffs start in late April. Teams will 
be asked on occasion to play three games in three nights, something 
that hasn't happened in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be tough to play back-to-back-to-back games, but  
that's something we have to do as athletes,'' Jimmy Jackson, a free 
agent who last played for Golden State, told The New York Times. 
``But if you love the game, you'll do whatever it takes to be ready 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal was ratified, Stern spoke to the almost 200  
players who had flown in to vote on the owners' latest proposal -- a 
vote that never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us Billy was a tough guy, but a good guy, and how glad  
he was to get it over with and to start playing again,'' Aaron 
Williams of the Seattle SuperSonics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the players' response was polite, but not  
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
	The players did, however, give Hunter and Ewing a standing  
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The union agreed to accept 55 percent of about $2 billion in  
annual revenue in the fourth, fifth and sixth years of the 
agreement, according to several sources involved in the talks who 
spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Players would get 57 percent if the league exercises its option  
for the seventh year. In the first three years, there is no limit 
on the percentage of revenues players can receive. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agreement includes a ban on marijuana, with all  
players undergoing drug testing once per season, and tougher player 
discipline penalties and conduct rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides also agreed to form a joint committee of three owners  
and three players to discuss the growth of the league and improving 
the relations between players and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other compromises:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a $14 million maximum salary for players  
with 10 years' experience. Players with one to five years' 
experience can get a maximum of $9 million, and players with six to 
nine years' experience can get $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams  
holding an option for the fourth year and the right of first 
refusal in the fifth year. First-round draft picks will be grouped 
into three categories by where they were selected -- 1-9, 10-19 and 
20-29 -- with the highest picks eligible for higher percentage 
increases in their salaries from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league accepted the union's proposal for an ``average''  
salary exception and ``median'' salary exception, with both being 
phased in during the next three years. As a result, every team will 
have the right to sign two additional players each season, even if 
they are over the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The league agreed to higher minimum salaries than it had been  
offering, but not quite as high as the union had been demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary  
before, but the NBA pushed for one throughout the lockout. The 
union initially refused, then suggested a luxury tax be charged to 
any owner who signed a player for more than $15 million. The league 
kept holding out, and eventually the players relented. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA players have the highest average salary in professional  
sports, about $2.6 million annually, and the median salary is about 
$1.3 million. NFL players average about $900,000, and major league 
baseball pays an average of $1.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys can still make $14 million, and that's a lot of money,''  
said Kevin Willis of the Toronto Raptors. ``If you can't live off 
that, something's wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league and the union had been fighting over how to divide  
the estimated $2 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout went into effect July 1, just 2 1/2 weeks after Jordan  
and the Bulls won their sixth championship in a riveting Game 6 
that put up the largest TV viewer numbers ever for the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s and especially since Jordan arrived, the league  
has enjoyed unprecedented popularity here and abroad. On the labor 
front, Stern and the NBA lived a relatively charmed life, while 
baseball struggled through a strike that caused thousands of fans 
to turn away from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	But then came the lockout that for the first time caused the NBA  
to miss games because of a labor dispute. The first three months of 
the season were scrapped and players lost about $500 million in 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An entirely new schedule will be put in place for the remainder  
of the 1998-99 season, although details were still unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is tell the fans,'' Mourning said, ``that I'm  
sorry about the inconvenience. I appreciate their patience, and I'm 
sorry about any of the bad impressions that they've gotten from 
this whole ordeal, but that's what business is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that going into this thing that we were gonna step on  
some peoples' toes and upset some people, but we had to do what's 
best for the guys in this league.''

<HEADLINE> Photographers Denied Senate Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- News photographers they missed an opportunity  
to record an important moment in American history Thursday when 
they were denied access to the Senate floor at the start of the 
impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, several Senate staff photographers took photos of the  
swearing-in of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and the 100 
senators. Those photos were later distributed to news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of not having still photography of an event that has  
only happened once in the last 130 years in our history is 
absurd,'' said Mary Anne Golon, director of photography at US News 
&AMP; World Report. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional standing committee of press photographers  
earlier this week wrote Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
urging him to agree to change the usual rules barring photographers 
from the Senate floor because of the historical significance of the 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that the rules were waived at least once before, for  
the swearing-in of Nelson Rockefeller to be vice president in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeff Kent, supervisor of the Senate Press Photographers  
Gallery, said the Senate Rules Committee had decided to keep the 
usual ban on access. ``We have encouraged photographers to lobby 
individual senators'' to reverse that decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., on Wednesday wrote Lott and Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., urging access for still 
photographers, noting that TV, print and radio reporters could 
chronicle the event, but photographers wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``A situation as historic as this one needs to be documented for  
the American public by professional news photographers so that we 
have archival quality photographs that will live on,'' said Fred 
Sweets, Associated Press assistant chief of bureau for photos in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the photos supplied by the official photographers were  
``not the quality that would be used in our newspapers and 
magazines.''

<HEADLINE>  Agreement Saves NBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The lockout is settled, the season is saved and  
the NBA has survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The most divisive labor battle in league history finally ended  
at dawn Wednesday on the 191st day of the lockout when commissioner 
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter compromised on the 
remaining issues keeping them apart and shook hands on a collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal still has to be reduced to writing, meaning the lockout  
hasn't yet officially been lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	But barring any unforeseen snags, the season will begin no  
earlier than Feb. 2, with each team playing no more than 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can exhale now, without a doubt,'' said Alonzo Mourning of  
the Miami Heat. ``The deal is done and we can just focus our mind 
right now on starting back up again.''

<HEADLINE>  Atypical End to Atypical Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- These weren't your typical union workers coming  
to ratify a contract. Then again, it wasn't a typical lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 NBA players descended through a sea of cameras,  
tourists and workers on lunch break Wednesday to learn details of 
the proposed deal that brought an end to a nasty six-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The players wore white furs, leather jackets and diamond stud  
earrings along with the big blue buttons urging unity between the 
NBA and the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans squealed at the sight of Shaquille O'Neal and Charles  
Barkley. And commissioner David Stern came to try to heal the 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all family again,'' New Jersey's Jayson Williams said.  
``Guys are wearing buttons with `Solid' written on them, showing 
both sides are together again. This game won't have to go through 
something like this again for seven more years. And hopefully, I'll 
be retired then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who flew in from all over the country late Tuesday and  
early Wednesday woke up at their hotels expecting to go to their 
union's law office next to the famous FAO Schwarz toy store to vote 
on whether they supported the negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But as they shuttled over to the General Motors Building, where  
the lobby looks less like a union hall and more like Kenny 
Anderson's garage before the lockout forced him to reduce his fleet 
of luxury cars, they began to hear news of a deal from fans and 
taxi radios. 
</P>
<P>
	From the scores of fans desperately seeking autographs from any  
player -- from Kobe Bryant to Austin Croshere -- it appears as if the 
hard feelings over the lockout will end someday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even the players know that it will take more than  
rim-rocking dunks and ankle-breaking crossover dribbles to win back 
NBA fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point I don't care,'' said one fan while checking out  
his loot of autographs. ``I'll watch because I'm a basketball fan, 
but I'd rather watch college basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players don't blame fans who might be bitter about a dispute  
over how to divide $2 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably will be lukewarm at first and some may be  
hostile,'' Chicago's Steve Kerr said. ``I can't blame them one bit. 
They are the ones who suffered the most during this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the players in the 25th-floor conference room was  
calm as they gathered for their ratification vote -- in sharp 
contrast to the divisions that built among factions of players the 
last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a contentious vote over whether players supported  
their union, they voted on whether to approve the new deal. It 
passed, 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Williams, one of the union's biggest critics, talked  
peacefully with union president Patrick Ewing and negotiating 
committee member Alonzo Mourning -- whom Williams criticized for the 
union's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the players ratified the proposal, Stern and deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik arrived to begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that both sides had to make concessions if we  
wanted to play again,'' said Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a 
second-year player who stands to lose millions of dollars under the 
deal. ``Regardless of how much I make, I'm making more money than I 
could ever without playing. It's good to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the only outward sign of a labor dispute was when  
locked-out ABC technicians tried to disrupt interviews by 
replacement crews by holding flyers in front of cameras and yelling 
``Don't talk to ABC scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of their dispute, because I have my  
own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

They are the ones who suffered the most during this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood among the players in the 25th-floor conference room was  
calm as they gathered for their ratification vote -- in sharp 
contrast to the divisions that built among factions of players the 
last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a contentious vote over whether players supported  
their union, they voted on whether to approve the new deal. It 
passed, 179-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Williams, one of the union's biggest critics, talked  
peacefully with union president Patrick Ewing and negotiating 
committee member Alonzo Mourning -- whom Williams criticized for the 
union's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the players ratified the proposal, Stern and deputy  
commissioner Russ Granik arrived to begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize that both sides had to make concessions if we  
wanted to play again,'' said Vancouver's Shareef Abdur-Rahim, a 
second-year player who stands to lose millions of dollars under the 
deal. ``Regardless of how much I make, I'm making more money than I 
could ever without playing. It's good to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the only outward sign of a labor dispute was when  
locked-out ABC technicians tried to disrupt interviews by 
replacement crews by holding flyers in front of cameras and yelling 
``Don't talk to ABC scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the details of their dispute, because I have my  
own situation to worry about,'' said Phil Barreca, a locked-out ABC 
electrician. ``The levels of money are obviously different, but it 
is still a classic labor dispute.''

<HEADLINE> Gulf Forces Focus on Job, Not Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) -- The sailors aboard this U.S.  
aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf say the impeachment 
proceedings against President Clinton are a distant -- and not very 
distracting -- event. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members of the USS Carl Vinson said Thursday that they were  
focused on their jobs supporting the U.S. jets flying patrols over 
southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Scott Galow, 37, of San Diego, was following the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are certainly bothered about the leader being impeached,''  
said Galow, who maintains ship-board equipment for the aircraft. 
``But we are here on a mission, and we are going to follow through 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott Shand said ``most of us are  
focused on our jobs,'' which can require up to 14 hours of work a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	That means ``we don't have time to follow the impeachment,''  
said Shand, 38, of Port Orchard, Wash., who is in charge of 
assembling and storing weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty Officer 3rd class Shannen Case of Merritt Island, Fla.,  
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to do a job that pays my bill, so I have to make  
sure I do it well,'' said the aviation electrician, one of some 500 
women who live and work on the 5,000-crew carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions remain high in the region.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a U.S. Air Force fighter jet attacked an  
air-defense radar installation in northern Iraq after the pilot 
determined he was about to be fired on, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days earlier, pilots off the Carl Vinson were involved in an  
encounter with about a dozen Iraqi jets over southern Iraq -- the 
first confrontation in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of fighter jets roared off the deck Thursday for a  
variety of chores, including patrolling the ``no-fly'' zone over 
southern Iraq. The zone was set up in 1992 to protect Shiite 
Muslims after a failed uprising against Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 100 sorties are flown by F-14 and F-18 jets each day.  
</P>
<P>
	Rear Adm. Alfred Harms, commanding officer of the nine-ship Carl  
Vision battle group, said: ``There is an obvious threat out there 
... and we have to maintain our focus on the mission here, so we 
don't have much time to think of what's going on back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described the impeachment proceedings as having ``zero impact  
on the battle group.''

<HEADLINE> Apathy Reigns for Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- During a midday lull at Squire Stylist on  
Main Street, barber Charles Dispenza filed his fingernails with 
alarming vigor as he pondered President Clinton's impeachment 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's like a lynching,'' he pronounced, looking  
restless in one of his plush leather thrones. ``It shouldn't have 
gone this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, neither Dispenza nor any of his customers at this rarest  
of moments in history seemed eager to catch even a glimpse of the 
Senate's proceedings on a television turned down low in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could care less!'' called out Marick Schwartz, 36, from  
behind the partitions of a tiny tanning room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't watch it,'' the law-firm secretary elaborated as she  
emerged minutes later. ``He did lie on the stand. That's a grave 
mistake. But the way they went about getting him to admit he had 
sex, that's just ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As senators were sworn in Thursday for the first presidential  
impeachment trial since 1868, many Americans stifled yawns. Some 
were simply tuckered out from trying to keep up with the extended 
drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on overload on this stuff,'' said an exasperated Judy  
Rosso, 61, a purchaser at City Hall. ``The numbers are wrong for 
him to get convicted. He's going to get off, he'll get his wish. 
Nice country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rosso had no kind words, others filtering in for their  
hair appointments were quick to point fingers in excusing Clinton's 
efforts to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. So did  
President Nixon,'' said Mike Perry, 47, who is self-employed in the 
construction business. ``When John F. Kennedy was doing it, people 
just kept their mouths shut back then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a Republican, thinks enough harm has been inflicted on  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knows what he's done -- he has admitted it in so many  
words, in a roundabout way,'' he said. ``I think the senators will 
realize that. He's been publicly humiliated enough. They've now got 
to go forward and keep the reputation of the presidency intact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With customers from both sides of the political aisle, Dispenza  
prefers to label himself a ``nonpartisan,'' but his sympathy 
clearly lies with the embattled Democratic president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right-wing has been wanting to get this man for six years,  
for almost anything,'' he said. ``Everyone says he did wrong, but 
how wrong was it?''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Iraq Inspection Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American weapons experts, including some from  
intelligence agencies, helped U.N. inspectors hunt for Iraqi 
weapons and gained information that assisted U.S. military 
planners, Clinton administration officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials rejected suggestions that the Americans were  
proxy spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to handle the arms inspection job on its own, the U.N.  
Special Commission on Iraq requested help from dozens of countries, 
including the United States. U.S. experts in chemical, biological 
and nuclear weapons were attached to UNSCOM on temporary 
assignment, White House and State Department officials said. The 
information they collected was controlled entirely by the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business of weapons of mass destruction arms control is  
extremely serious and cannot be carried out by amateurs,'' said 
State Department deputy spokesman James Foley. ``The United States 
has sent UNSCOM our best weapons experts, both from the government 
and private organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But once these officials returned to their U.S. agencies, they  
carried with them valuable information that vastly improved the 
U.S. intelligence picture of Iraq, information useful to strike 
target planners, among others. Some of the experts sent to UNSCOM 
came from U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a U.S. official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The identity of the agencies 
sending U.S. officials to work with the United Nations was not 
disclosed to the Iraqis, making officials, in effect, undercover 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Butler, UNSCOM's chief weapons inspector, said he asked  
U.S. officials Thursday ``what they might have done unbeknownst to 
us,'' in using U.N. weapons searches in Iraq to undermine Saddam 
Hussein's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Butler said he  
expected to have another ``relevant conversation about it'' on 
Friday with U.S. officials and that he ``wanted real answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want our system misused in that way,'' Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he also discussed his concerns with U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who in turn has been in phone contact 
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern at the United Nations that ostensibly international  
inspections benefited U.S. intelligence threatens to undermine the 
basis for administration policy on Iraq. More than a year of 
tension between Washington and Baghdad began in the fall of 1997 
when Iraq demanded an end to U.S. participation in the weapons 
inspections, charging that they were espionage operations. Iraq's 
lack of cooperation with the U.N. inspectors since then culminated 
in the pre-Christmas U.S. and British airstrikes on scores of 
targets in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said critics now endorsing  
Iraq's repeated charges of espionage are ``looking through the 
wrong end of the telescope.'' The intensive inspections, with the 
help of U.S. experts, Crowley said, became necessary only after 
Iraq failed to live up to the promises it made at the end of the 
1991 Persian Gulf War. Continued Iraqi resistance to the 
inspections ``has required UNSCOM to go to enormous lengths'' to 
collect information. 

</P>
<P>
	Press reports this week about the U.S. role in the inspections  
have exposed a widening rift between the administration and U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Administration officials suspect 
Annan's aides leaked the story to undercut Butler, whose aggressive 
style has led to sharp criticism from Baghdad and support from 
Washington. Annan, administration officials fear, is trying to 
manufacture a reason for replacing the UNSCOM inspection team with 
a less intrusive body, one that would lack any U.S. involvement. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials also voiced concern that some members' of Annan's  
inner circle have been openly supportive of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials and diplomats from France and Russia, on the  
other hand, say the United States is simply looking for ways to 
maintain economic sanctions on Iraq indefinitely. The best way, 
they say, appears to be for the makeup of UNSCOM to remain 
unacceptable to Iraq and for no inspections to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can accept the status quo right now,'' Foley said at the  
State Department. ``We would like to see an effective UNSCOM going 
back in there, and only an effective UNSCOM.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence officials, meanwhile, have been dismayed at  
the level of detail reported this week on the methods of 
information collection used in the weapons inspection effort. The 
Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, for example, that the United 
States installed a ``black box'' listening device that intercepted 
signals from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's presidential 
communications network. 
</P>
<P>
	The encrypted messages were beamed via satellite to the U.S.  
National Security Agency center for decoding and translation. 
Material relating to Iraqi weapons was forwarded to the United 
Nations. But other information, including details on the 
whereabouts of Iraqi leaders, was kept by U.S. intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Auto Industry Has Strong Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- 1998 proved to be a surprisingly strong year for  
the auto industry, as U.S. sales surged with the economy and the 
intense competition that generated deep discounts for new cars and 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans bought 15.6 million cars and light trucks last year,  
the most in 12 years, the second-highest total ever and a 3 percent 
improvement over 1997. Figures released Wednesday show automakers 
ended the year with a bang, with December sales up 7 percent 
compared with a strong December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the last major automakers who reported their results, No.  
1 General Motors Corp., which is still dealing with the effect of 
last summer's strikes on its inventory, managed a 3 percent 
improvement last month. Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. both 
posted double-digit gains. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, foreign automakers made the biggest gains: Asian  
companies were up 4 percent while the Europeans, which have the 
smallest share of the U.S. market, improved 29 percent thanks to a 
wide array of new models. GM, Ford Motor Co. and the American 
products of DaimlerChrysler AG combined for just a 1 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But the totals were better than anyone anticipated a year ago.  
The 15.6 million vehicles sold were second only to the 16.05 
million sold in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tremendous year,'' said Mike DiGiovanni, head of  
market research at GM. ``No one I know forecast that level of 
sales. There's not much to complain about in terms of how the 
industry's performing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was cause for concern behind the numbers. Much of the  
increased demand was due to rebates, cut-rate financing and other 
incentives that reduced transaction prices. GM began the rise in 
incentives in April with its ``loyalty coupon'' program for 
previous customers after dismal first-quarter sales results. 
</P>
<P>
	The ploy worked, but incentives remained high the rest of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales in 1998 were more dependent on incentives than sales of  
any of the past three or four years,'' said analyst Susan Jacobs of 
Jacobs &AMP; Associates in Rutherford, N.J. ``The need for incentives 
is flagging some emerging softness in the market, even though the 
economy's strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs noted that the industry placed discounts even on some of  
the vehicles it redesigned for '99 shortly after they were 
introduced in the fall, something that's rarely been done in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reached a point where the ink wasn't even dry on the '99  
price increases before we had incentives,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, most automakers are optimistic about 1999. They expect  
sales to be down slightly, but still near the 15 million level 
where they have been for an unprecedented five consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for light trucks, the classification that includes sport  
utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, continued to surge at the 
expense of cars. For the year, truck sales were up 8 percent while 
car sales fell 2 percent. Trucks represented a record 48 percent of 
the market; buyers chose more trucks than cars in November -- the 
first month that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's truck sales set a company record and surpassed the 2  
million mark for the third consecutive year, despite the 
strikes-related slowdown in production and the fall plant 
changeover for GM's redesigned full-size pickup, its biggest 
seller. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes also were blamed for causing GM's market share to  
fall to 29.2 percent from 31.1 percent in 1997. DiGiovanni 
estimated that the strikes cost GM about 1.3 share points last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is producing its new pickups at full speed, but demand has  
been so strong that inventories remain half of what they were a 
year ago, DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker wants to get its market share up to 30 percent in  
the first quarter and has set what it calls a ``stretch goal'' of 
32 percent for the year. ``It will be difficult to attain 32, but 
it gives us a target to shoot for,'' DiGiovanni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's sales increased 19 percent for December and 11 percent  
for the year. Honda was up 6 percent in December and 7 percent for 
the year. Both automakers posted strong gains in sales of their 
SUVs and minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are indications of a gradual slowdown in '99,  
the sales surge in December fueled one of the industry's best-ever 
yearend closeouts,'' said Yale Gieszl, a Toyota vice president.

 *U.S. Jews asked to help defeat Israel religion bills    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leaders of the Reform and Conservative branches  
of North American Judaism have asked members to mobilize against 
proposed legislation in Israel that would restore Orthodox rabbis' 
exclusive right to perform religious conversions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would overturn a late December ruling by the Jerusalem  
District Court that validated conversions by non-Orthodox groups 
within Israel. The government's Interior Ministry plans to appeal 
the ruling to the Supreme Court. Previous court rulings had 
recognized non-Orthodox conversions performed in other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	A related bill in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, also  
targeted by the North Americans, would nullify court decisions and 
bar Conservative and Reform members from municipal councils that 
administer religious programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of the  
Conservative synagogue organization, said North American Jews 
``must use the power of our dollars'' in the forthcoming campaign 
to elect a new Knesset. Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Reform 
synagogue union, said, ``Israeli politicians need to look beyond 
short-term electoral interests to the welfare of the Jewish people 
as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a New York Times advertisement, ARZA/World Union, an  
organization of Zionists in the Reform branch, said the proposed 
legislation would ``cause irreparable harm to the unity of the 
Jewish people.''

 *Russian Orthodoxy limits role in World Council of Churches

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Orthodox Church is taking a passive  
role in the World Council of Churches while it attempts to deal 
with complaints about the ecumenical body. 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox leaders in various nations contend that liberal  
Protestants have too much influence in the WCC. Orthodox churches 
in Bulgaria and the Georgian republic have ended WCC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church, by far the largest  
member body in the WCC, discussed the situation at a meeting of the 
Holy Synod, two weeks after a WCC assembly ended in Harare, 
Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Moscow Patriarchate said the Russians will  
``suspend participation in the work of the (WCC) Central Committee 
and will attend its sessions only as observers.'' It indicated that 
a decision on continued membership depends on results from a 
special commission set up in Harare to consider changes in the WCC. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, the Moscow Patriarchate announced the  
formation of an Interreligious Council of Russia to address 
national problems with representatives from Islam, Judaism and 
Buddhism.

its 67 years of data on church memberships and finances.

	The grant was announced by the National Council of Churches,  
which produces the annual. The 1999 yearbook, edited by the Rev. 
Eileen Lindner, who works for the council in New York, will be

 *More proof that King David was real?    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An inscription found in Egypt could be the  
third rediscovered ancient text that points to the existence of the 
biblical King David, according to Biblical Archeology Review, 
published here. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Kenneth Kitchen, an Egyptologist now retired from  
England's University of Liverpool, believes the phrase ``Heights of 
David'' appears in a list of place names from southern Judah found 
at the Temple of Amun in Karnak, Upper Egypt. The list dates from 
the 10th century B.C., just after the time of King David. 
</P>
<P>
	Kitchen's reading cannot be certain, however, due to the  
ambiguity of one letter in the inscription. 
</P>
<P>
	Some modern scholars have speculated that the great biblical  
king was a mythological character. But most experts believe a text 
found in Israel in 1993 by archeologist Avraham Biran clearly 
refers to the royal ``house of David.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French paleographer Andre Lemaire contends that the most  
probable reconstruction of a damaged inscription from ancient Moab 
also names King David.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Retreat Early On / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell in early trading Friday  
on concern about the outlook for profit growth at exporters amid 
continued volatility in global currency markets. The dollar rose 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average slid 175.39 points, or 1.30 percent, to  
13,361.17 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the 
average closed up 68.10 points, or 0.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.34 yen, up 0.36 yen from late Thursday in  
Tokyo and also above its level of 111.04 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, shares lost ground on worries about  
a stronger yen after the dollar hit a 27-month low against the 
Japanese currency, buying 109.88 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen erodes the value of profits made overseas by  
Japan's many exporters. Stocks of major auto and electronics 
manufacturers were among the biggest losers, including shares of 
Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section dropped 12.18 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,057.42. 
The TOPIX closed up 10.84 points, or 1.02 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.21  
points to close Thursday's session at 9,537.76. The blue-chip index

<HEADLINE> Bankers Challenge Credit Union Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's banking industry, continuing a  
months-long fight with credit unions, is challenging a new federal 
rule allowing more people to join the lending associations. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association, the industry's biggest trade  
group, said today it was filing suit in U.S. District Court in 
Washington asking for an injunction barring the National Credit 
Union Administration from putting the new rule into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time the bankers' group has gone to court over  
the issue. The first legal action led to a 1998 Supreme Court 
ruling favoring the banks over the credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, adopted by the federal credit union agency on Dec.  
17, codifies a bill enacted last summer in a stinging defeat for 
the banking industry. The legislation overrode the Supreme Court 
ruling by allowing federally chartered credit unions to continue to 
include more than one occupational group in their memberships -- as 
long as each group doesn't exceed 3,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	NCUA spokeswoman Lesia Bullock had no immediate comment on the  
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency ``clearly thumbed its nose at Congress when  
it adopted this rule,'' Harley Bergmeyer, chairman of the ABA's 
credit union advisory group, said in a statement. ``There's no 
doubt in our minds that the rule violates both the letter and 
intent of the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA noted that in the Dec. 17 vote, Norman D'Amours, the  
federal agency's chairman, voted against the rule, saying he feared 
it would hurt smaller credit unions. The other two commissioners 
voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule took effect on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The credit union industry has said its adoption will allow  
millions of people -- including employees of small businesses -- to 
join lower-cost credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers' group has maintained that the rule went beyond the  
bill's intent by promoting big, expansive credit unions with 
multiple membership groups at the expense of small, local ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit unions compete with banks -- especially small community  
banks -- by often providing lower-cost loans and other services at 
more favorable rates for their members. They contend they are the 
best source of help for people of modest means. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has bitterly protested credit unions'  
exemption from federal taxes, which was retained by the bill.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Pianist Petrucciani Dies at 36 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michel Petrucciani, a jazz pianist who recorded  
more than a dozen albums and drew an international following, has 
died at age 36. 
</P>
<P>
	The French-born musician, who was afflicted with a bone disease,  
was being treated at Beth Israel Medical Center for a lung 
infection when he died early Wednesday, said his Paris agent, 
Bernard Ivain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All music lovers will feel his death as a great loss,'' French  
President Jacques Chirac said. ``He was a world renowned pianist 
who succeeded in giving jazz a new language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani, who stood 3 feet tall, suffered from osteogenesis  
imperfecta. Also known as ``glass bone disease,'' it causes a 
calcium deficiency that stunts growth and makes bones brittle. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore braces on his legs, had special pedal extensions on his  
pianos and often had to be carried to and from the piano bench. 
</P>
<P>
	His albums included ``Promenade With Duke,'' an homage to Duke  
Ellington, ``Pianism'' (1986), ``Michel Plays Petrucciani'' (1988), 
``Music'' (1989) ``Playground'' (1991), ``The Best of Michel 
Petrucciani -- The Blue Note Years'' (1994), and ``Marvelous'' 
(1994). 
</P>
<P>
	He won a wide following with his technical mastery, skillful  
improvisation and sense of harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a warrior,'' said jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter. ``He  
dared to go places that others never even think to go -- and not 
just musically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schooled in classical music as well as jazz, Petrucciani began  
playing at age 4 made his professional debut at 13 at an outdoor 
jazz festival in France. He put out his first album, ``Flash,'' at 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inspired by greats like Ellington and jazz pianist Bill  
Evans, and by his father, jazz guitarist Antoine Petrucciani. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe this little cat with the physical problems  
he had could play like he did,'' recalled trumpet great Clark 
Terry. ``It was mindboggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry said Petrucciani has ``a place alongside all of the jazz  
greats. He's not one of those who followed others leads. ... He was 
a giant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani moved to the United States in 1981 and lived in Big  
Sur, Calif., before moving to New York to form his own trio. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't understand that being a human being is not being  
7 feet tall; it's what you have in your head and not your body,'' 
he once said of his handicap in a 1994 interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he credited his disease with giving him plenty of time to  
practice as a child, since he couldn't go outside and play sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could stay in front of the piano for five or six hours a day  
and it all adds up over the years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrucciani is survived by three sons. Funeral arrangements were  
pending.

<HEADLINE> Statue of Liberty Gets Nod for Coin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans prefer the Statue of Liberty over  
Sacagawea for the new dollar coin planned for next year, according 
to a survey conducted for the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of respondents age 18 or older said they  
preferred the Statue of Liberty, vs. 27 percent selecting 
Sacagawea, according to a draft of a GAO report obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a Treasury Department official said the results of the  
poll conducted for the congressional watchdog agency would not 
change Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's choice of subject for the 
gold-colored coin scheduled to replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the recommendation of an advisory panel, Rubin decided  
the coin will depict Sacagawea, the teen-age Shoshone girl who 
along with her infant son accompanied explorers Meriwether Lewis 
and William Clark to the Pacific Ocean in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this month, Rubin is expected to select the final design  
from among three submitted by sculptor Glenna Goodacre of Santa Fe, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe once a design is finalized ... the public will  
embrace it and be proud of the depiction on the coin,'' said 
Assistant Treasury Secretary Howard Schloss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., who sponsored the dollar-coin  
legislation and had pushed strongly for the Statue of Liberty as 
its subject, acknowledged the design selection process is ``pretty 
far along and I doubt it's reversible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if it's not used now, I would hope it can be used on some  
other circulating coin in the future,'' he said. ``More people 
around the world associate America with the Statue of Liberty than 
anything I know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the survey, a majority or respondents favored the  
statue, regardless of age, gender, income or region of residence. 
Eighty-one percent said they felt very or somewhat strongly about 
their preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Those favoring the statue said it was a familiar symbol of the  
United States and freedom. Those favoring Sacagawea said her image 
would honor American Indians, that her trek across the Rocky 
Mountains was part of history and that her image would be a change 
from other coins, which depict former presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,014 randomly selected adults was  
conducted Nov 18-22 for the GAO by International Communications 
Research of Media, Pa. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley, Lehman Beat Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York's investment banking firms shared in  
the spoils of the stock market's recovery at the end of last year, 
with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; 
Co. reporting profits that topped expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Big mergers and acquisitions helped offset the industrywide drop  
in the business of underwriting stocks and bonds. Last year saw a 
record of deal-making, with auto, telecom and oil industries 
consolidating fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley, which ranked third in merger activity in the  
United States last year, reported fourth-quarter earnings of $879 
million, or $1.49 a share, excluding a one-time gain. The record 
profits were 15 percent above the final quarter of 1997, and 
dwarfed analysts' estimates of 96 cents a share, according to First 
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the gain, Morgan Stanley posted profits of $1.22  
billion, or $2.07 a share, for the quarter, compared with $810 
million, or $1.30 a share, in fourth quarter of 1997. The company's 
fiscal year ends Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We achieved a full year record performance despite some very  
difficult conditions,'' said Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's 
chairman said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter was $4 billion, a 6 percent jump from  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Flush with cash, Morgan Stanley said it would buy back $1  
billion of its stock to boost its flagging price, and boost its 
quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share, from 20 cents previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman Brothers reported fourth-quarter earnings of $74 million,  
or 51 cents a share, more than twice the 21 cents analysts 
expected. The results, however, fell 60 percent from Lehman's 
quarter of $185 million, or $1.30 a share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the period was $665 million, down from $1.02 billion  
in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of both companies were encouraging to investors,  
after reports of the industry's exposure to risky investment funds 
known as hedge funds like Long Term Capital Management, as well as 
rumors about Lehman's financial weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Morgan Stanley jumped $2.62 1/2 to $83.31 1/4 in morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Lehman's stock was up 
$1.50 to $55.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Morgan Stanley's net income was $3.05  
billion, or $4.95 a share, excluding non-recurring charges and 
gains. In 1997, Morgan Stanley earned $2.65 billion, or $4.27 a 
share, excluding costs related to its merger with Dean Witter 
Discover. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all costs and charges in 1998, Morgan Stanley earned  
$3.28 billion, or $5.33 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the firm was $16.4 billion, up 11 percent from 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehman's full-year profits were $736 million, or $5.19 per  
share, compared with $647 million, or $4.72 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue was $4.11 billion vs. $3.87 billion.
