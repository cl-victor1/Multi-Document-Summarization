TCU GAINS FROM GAINOUS' JUMPER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ n an evening when Lee Nailon chisled
himself even deeper into the record book, TCU required a clutch
move from ailing Marquise Gainous to preserve a win.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous, who had not practiced in four days because of a sore
ankle, dropped in a short jumper with 19 seconds remaining to
finally seal a 90-87 victory against Gonzaga's persistent Bulldogs
at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we kind of dodged a bullet,'' said TCU coach Billy
Tubbs, who watched his 24th-ranked Frogs (11-2) capture their sixth
consecutive win. ``This team has kind of developed a knack for
doing that and coming up with the right plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing their first game in 10 days, the Frogs captured their
16th consecutive home victory behind another huge game from Nailon,
who finished with 44 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy we won the game,'' said Nailon, who topped 40
points for the fifth time in his TCU career and moved ahead of Jeff
Jacobs and James Penny into 14th place on the school's all-time
scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombardment from Nailon, the Bulldogs (9-4) refused
to go quietly into the night. Trailing by as many as 14 points,
they stormed back with 21 second-half points from beyond the
3-point arc to narrow the gap quickly.
</P>
<P>
   They held only one lead _ when Axel Dench (22 points) put them
up, 83-82, on a drive with 2:35 left, after which Ryan Carroll hit
a trey to put TCU back up by two. But it was tied at 87 with 59
seconds left and Gainous standing at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   He hit one of two shots for an 88-87 lead, and then Shannon Long
got the ball back for TCU on a steal at midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with TCU maneuvering for a shot after an inbounds play,
Long got the ball to Gainous, who dropped in the winning shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a play that worked,'' said Carroll. ``Marquise's
man left him to take Shannon, who was bringing the ball down the
baseline and just dished it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainous, who was recovering from an ankle sprain, looked pretty
good to Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always does,'' Tubbs said. ``Actually, his ankle seems to
be OK now, but we weren't going to take a chance with it. Shannon
has been playing well lately, and he had another good game tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've played one game since Dec. 12, and we definitely
weren't combat-ready tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not taking anything away from Gonzaga. They're a good
team, and they played well. We stopped hitting our shots in the
second half and they got hot, and kept coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon said he felt good coming in, but had no idea he was up
for a season-high game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to play my game and take what was there,'' he
said. ``In the second half, I don't think we let up or coasted or
anything. They just packed it close inside with their zone, and the
shots weren't as open anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said he was pleased with the win, and perplexed about the
Frogs' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who thought this thing up,'' he said. ``It sure
wasn't me. We have another game Saturday and then nine days off.
Then we open conference play with three straight road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like something somebody in the WAC thought up.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU will play North Carolina-Asheville at 7:05 p.m. Saturday at
Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.

NFL COACHING CAROUSEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The domino theory thrives in the NFL coaching theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Even when five heads roll on one day, as they did Monday, you
still have to watch where they go, because they're liable to turn
up almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And half the fun is watching the employed yet potentially
available coaches squirm for bargaining position. The biggest
problem is knowing where to begin. We'll start in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Former 49er President Carmen Policy, now the president of the
expansion Browns I'll get used to that phrase as soon as I get used
to St. Louis Rams has already interviewed the two hot assistants,
Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick and Broncos offensive
aide Gary Kubiak, and plans to interview several other aides before
he's through.
</P>
<P>
   He will also sit down with Ray Rhodes, the deposed Eagles coach.
But the man he wants is the man he hired to replace George Seifert
in San Francisco, Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was supposed to be close to signing a contract
extension with the headless 49ers the team is operating with an
interim president and a couple of secretaries when the lines of
communication suddenly went dead. Here's how much Policy thinks of
Mariucci: He offered the 49ers job to Mariucci, then the Cal coach,
from his car phone as he was pulling into Mariucci's driveway.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Mariucci leaves, the 49ers would likely offer Packers
coach and ex-49er aide Mike Holmgren the whole G.M.-Coach package.
Holmgren wants to sail his own ship, which Green Bay can't offer
because Ron Wolf is G.M. for life. Holmgren will have leverage,
because Seattle and Carolina could step up with the same kind of
offer. And if Bill Walsh is indeed returning as team
president/meddler, then Holmgren might flinch. Holmgren might try
to talk Rhodes into joining him in 'Frisco as assistant head coach,
with a promise that the coaching job is his sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The intrigue hear is icy. Once Holmgren leaves, Wolf will face
incredible pressure to promote Sherm Lewis, the black assistant
coach who has been passed over several times for head coaching
jobs. It doesn't help that Holmgren has anointed Lewis as the most
qualified assistant in the league. Truth is, Wolf might prefer
Rhodes to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks want an experienced coach capable of serving as
G.M. and coach. Owner Paul Allen is willing to spend money, but
wants someone who has a clue about talent spending it. The first
move will be towards Holmgren, the second to George Seifert.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers owner Jerry Richardson doesn't feel he can hire an
assistant to replace Dom Capers. The fans' expectation got juiced
by that 1996 NFC title appearance, and the team has oodles of inner
turmoil. He's already spoken to Seifert, the man he wants. There's
no strong No. 2 candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Art Modell, asked what kind of coach he wants, said he'd take
Hitler if he was available. Really. Mr. Modell, meet Ms. Schott.
The Ravens' short list includes Rhodes, Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham and ex-Raiders coach Art Shell, who played his college
ball in Maryland. Al Davis reportedly has called several teams on
Shell's behalf. I wonder if that call comes with an admission that
Art took a bullet for Al over the Marcus Allen situation?
</P>
<P>
   All three men are black, and all three are qualified. But isn't
it curious that one team would have three black candidates in mind
at a time when several jobs are open? Is Modell paying off a debt
for Paul Tagliabue as part of his move? Is this some kind of faux
affirmative action ploy?
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh defensive coordinator Jim Haslett is the front
runner. Haslett will come cheap, which is the way owner Jeff Lurie
wants it. Lurie is odds-on to be the next NFL owner to cry that
can't make it without a new stadium and order moving vans. The L.A.
Eagles? Doesn't fly.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Beathard reportedly will hire someone who is currently an
assistant and willing to go along with a short-term rebuilding
project entitled ``Leaf or bust.'' The Chargers had one of the
highest payrolls in the league, and Beathard wants to trim it.
Terry Donahue may not be interested in those terms, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The word around the league is that the Bears have no clue who
they'll hire, that G.M. Mike McCaskey made an emotional decision to
fire Dave Wannstedt without having someone in mind to replace him.
Shocking stuff from a team that has eight wins the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There's speculation that Pete Carroll isn't totally safe in New
England, and that Norv Turner may be out in Washington once the
Redskins franchise is officially sold.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil was retained in St. Louis for reasons perfectly
understandable to Rams fans in L.A. Georgia Frontiere and John Shaw
didn't want to pay off the balance of his contract. Thus, Vermeil
will be given little help improving the roster and suffer the same
kind of season John Robinson had in his last year as coach of the
L.A. Rams.
</P>
<P>
   And while Billick and Kubiak are ``hot'' assistants, are they
truly the genii behind the Vikings and Broncos' success? Mike
Shanahan runs the Denver offense, and Terrell Davis would make any
offensive coordinator look brilliant. And Billick didn't have a lot
to do with Randall Cunningham's resurgence or the good fortune of
Randy Moss falling into Minnesota's lap.

L.A. COUNCILMAN WOOS RAIDERS, BUT FINDS LITTLE SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California and ``s'' sports news files.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Continuing his crusade to bring the Oakland
Raiders back to Los Angeles, City Councilman Nate Holden learned
firsthand Wednesday that not everyone likes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum, Holden tried to describe how Raiders owner Al Davis might
return the team, but a woman in a University of Southern California
T-shirt with five kids in tow kept interrupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the Raiders,'' the woman proclaimed, as Holden
tried to halt television cameras from capturing her remarks. ``They
haven't won in God knows how long. We want a team that wins. A team
that will stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders left Los Angeles after the 1994 season because
Oakland lured them away with a better deal to play there. Davis
also has claimed city officials never delivered on plans to upgrade
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the team played.
</P>
<P>
   Holden _ wearing a black Raiders team cap _ tried to regain
control by saying he believed that Davis was prepared to return if
he wins a federal lawsuit against the National Football League in
which he is seeking to maintain territorial rights to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Al Davis (Tuesday) night and again (Wednesday)
morning and he said he wants to come back to Los Angeles,'' Holden
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the councilman indicated any deal with Davis should
include conditions to rebuild the Coliseum, similar to the plans
now being developed to try to draw a National Football League
expansion team. Under those plans, the Coliseum would seat 66,000 _
expandable to 80,000 for Super Bowls _ and hold 140 luxury boxes
and 10,000 club suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with Al Davis when this was displayed in Kansas City,''
Holden said. ``He turned to me and said, It's four years too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had done this in 1995, we would still have the Raiders
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders spokesman Bruce Allen confirmed that Davis and Holden
had talked, but no decision has been made on returning to Los
Angeles. The Raiders are under a 16-year contract to play in
Oakland, but Davis has challenged the terms in a lawsuit separate
from the one filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Councilman Holden has expressed great enthusiasm about the
Raiders coming back to Los Angeles based on his attorney's review
of our (federal) lawsuit against the NFL,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, until that is resolved, no decisions have been made about
the team moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he believes that a decision in the court case will
be made in the near future, clearing the way for a Raiders
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said he believes Davis would make a commitment to
remain in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would agree to sell a percentage of his team to
local entrepreneurs to show his commitment,'' Holden said. ``It's
not 50 percent, but 30 to 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he would have no comment about that.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has headed the Los Angeles
effort to land a new franchise to play in a remodeled Coliseum,
dismissed Holden's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like anything new,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
``It's just some headline hunting.'' &QL;

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
With the NBA season on the verge of being canceled, the league's
players will put together one last proposal in an attempt to end
the 184-day lockout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball
Players Association, sent a memo to every player Wednesday, saying
he intends to present a final offer with the hope of sitting down
with the owners' negotiating committee for one last bargaining
session before the season is lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiating committee and I will put together our own
`final collective-bargaining proposal,''' wrote Hunter in his memo.
``I have called (NBA commissioner) David Stern and requested an
opportunity to present it to the owners' labor committee as soon as
they're available, and certainly before the Jan. 7 date that Stern
has set as the owners' deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that if a settlement isn't reached by the league's
Jan. 7 Board of Governors meeting, he will recommend canceling the
season at that time. Hunter's memo is no doubt a response to
Stern's call for the players to request a vote on the owners'
latest proposal, which was sent Wednesday to every player in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   And with some players, most notably New Jersey All-Star Jayson
Williams, heeding Stern by openly calling for a secret ballot,
Hunter's memo attempts to outline the areas where he feels the
owners' latest proposal is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   It also concedes that the owners have made concessions, somewhat
surprising considering how acrimonious this labor war has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the fact that finally, on the six-month
anniversary of the lockout, the owners have begun to address our
concerns and removed some of the onerous new restraints they have
demanded,'' Hunter wrote. ``Still, the negotiating committee and I
do not believe that the owners have met us halfway yet, and we are
not prepared to recommend that you accept this proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stern is urging players to do just that and sent a letter to
Hunter asking that the proposal, a summary of which was included
with the letter, be put before the union for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is, of course, your prerogative to reject our
proposal the consequences of that decision will be so catastrophic
to your members that simple fairness suggests they be given a
chance to be heard,'' Stern wrote. ``Accordingly, we request and
strongly urge that you put the NBA's final offer to a vote of the
entire union membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Union president Patrick Ewing said that if that's what the
players want, that's what they'll get. But until the union hears
from the rank and file, there will be no vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the majority of the players call up and say they want a
vote, then we're bound to vote,'' Ewing said Wednesday. ``But
yesterday, we had a conference call and we put the question to them
if they want a vote. And as of today, no one has called to demand
that we put it to a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's memo listed eight points of disagreement with the
owners' proposal, among which were not enough help for the
middle-class and minimum-salary players, a higher percentage of
revenues going to the players in the last three years of a six-year
deal, insufficient salary increases, and adding a fourth option
year as well as a right of first refusal on a fifth year to the
rookie scale.
</P>
<P>
   Also included was a ``list of horribles,'' a creatively named
category that listed the owners' demand to eliminate opt-out
clauses, void Bird-exception status if a player is traded in the
last year of his contract, and limit signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not be hard to get a deal that makes both sides
equally contented _ or discontented,'' Hunter wrote. ``As I have
said in recent weeks, we are not very far apart, and the owners'
latest offer bridges some of the gaps. It is now a matter of
sitting down for a last bargaining session where we each can reveal
our respective bottom lines and engage in whatever trading may be
necessary to get a deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a handful of players are beginning to voice their
discontent over the union's unwillingness to vote on the owners'
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the truth,'' Williams said. ``NBA players are a lot
softer than they appear. These guys have been big their whole
lives, so they intimidate people by their size. They're soft deep
down. They're all teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't say anything in front of the public. But if you put
it to a secret vote right now, I think it would go (in the owners'
favor) because a lot of people want to get paid, a lot of people
want to start playing basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, one of the few high-profile players to speak out, also
took issue with Hunter's contention that if the owners' current
proposal were put to a vote, 85 percent of the union's 415 members
would vote it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a crock,'' Williams said. ``If Billy Hunter is
so determined that 85 percent would turn it down, then put it to a
vote. Right now. I'll go any which way these guys say, because if
you can't split up $2 billion, then everybody's an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it to a secret vote. That will end it. Then no one can say
that Alonzo Mourning and Patrick Ewing (both members of the union's
negotiating committee) gave us a bad deal. Put it to a secret vote,
and we won't have that problem. We're all going to second-guess
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a damn how it goes. So put it to a secret vote.
Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' Herb Williams, a member of the executive committee,
took issue with Jayson Williams' stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that he would be more informed about the whole
process,'' Herb Williams said. ``I never remember him calling the
office or sitting down with anyone to talk about where the
negotiations were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia guard Allen Iverson perhaps summed up best the way
most people feel at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that I'm tired of this mess,'' Iverson said.
``I'm sick of it. All talk, and nothing is getting done. If David
Stern is going to cancel the season, then just cancel the season. I
want to play. But I don't understand what's going on.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW ORLEANS _ R.C. Slocum has always known this day was coming.
There were plenty of nights when he wished, prayed and hoped it
couldn't. Many happy afternoons on the football sidelines or in a
duck blind or out on a golf course when he almost had himself
convinced it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   While his Aggies get ready to face Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl,
the Texas A&AMP;M coach steels himself for a much bigger test. On Jan.
13, his youngest son, John Harvey Slocum, 21, will undergo a heart
catheterization at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston in
preparation for major coronary surgery to repair a congenital
defect that was discovered at birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do? What can you say?'' asked Slocum. ``Like any
parent, I want to do anything I can. But now, all I can do is be
strong for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what R.C. has been doing for John Harvey all
these years as the family has dealt with the situation in
extraordinary privacy. Virtually no one in the A&AMP;M community and
only a very few of John Harvey's closest friends have been aware of
his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that it was important for John to grow up
living as normal a life as possible,'' R.C. said. ``I didn't want
everyone to treat him like he was defective. I wanted him to be
like every other kid and take part in life.''
</P>
<P>
   However, taking part in football, his father's life, was almost
always out of the question for John Harvey. When he'd take part in
games out in the yard, the other kids wanted to know why John
Harvey always had to call time out to catch his breath. And as he
grew older and his father took over in 1988 as the Aggies' head
coach, he had to deal with well-meaning questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends would see us together and ask him, `What position are
you going to play for your dad's team at A&AMP;M?''' recalled R.C.
``And he'd usually just say something about how he wasn't that
interested in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to jerk at my heart when he was in those situations.
People didn't mean anything. How could they know that this was a
coach's son who could never play college football?''
</P>
<P>
   So Slocum got John Harvey interested in golf and took him on
hunting trips and over the past few years has grown accustomed to
his being the Aggies' biggest booster on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, watching his youngest son deal with a clock
that has been ticking faster than those of the rest of us has given
Slocum perspective on his own high-pressure career and
under-the-microscope life.
</P>
<P>
   Too laconic, they said. Can't win the big battles, they
complained. Little did they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite sayings that I like to tell our players,''
Slocum said, ``is that it's not the bad things that happen but how
you react to them that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   So he swallowed the criticism of those nine- and 10-win seasons
and plowed ahead when the Aggies sank to 6-6 in 1996. He saw his
30-year marriage end in divorce in 1995 and dealt with the constant
knowledge that his son had a bad heart. But he stayed resolute, a
characteristic of his East Texas upbringing, the son of a refinery
worker who refused chemotherapy when diagnosed with cancer and died
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up without a lot of material things but with a solid
Christian background,'' Slocum said. ``I was always taught that God
had a plan and even if there are times when the plan seems harsh,
you are never given more of a burden than you can carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I've had to sit myself down and have plenty of talks
over the years and tell myself the things I preach to my players.
You ask, `Do you really believe?' The conclusion is, yes, I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a trust somewhere. I know we'll only have
John Harvey for as long as God intends us to. I know there are
parents who lose children every day to car accidents, to leukemia,
to all sorts of things. I'll tell you, this has made me a better
father and, hopefully, a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   The years went by. The trips for checkups in Houston went from
monthly to semiannual, to annual, and eventually the mind plays
tricks and tries to tell itself the urgency has passed. But it
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, John Harvey will have a tiny device inserted
through the veins in his leg up to his heart, where it will gather
information for future surgery. In April, he will have an
eight-hour operation as doctors will try to repair a hole in his
heart and make the organ pump more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But before that, on Friday night amid the the din of a crowded
Superdome, win or lose, the father will search along the Aggies'
sideline and exchange a glance, a look, maybe a grin with the son.
An expression of faith, a matter of heart.

L.A. COUNCILMAN WOOS RAIDERS, BUT FINDS LITTLE SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Continuing his crusade to bring the Oakland
Raiders back to Los Angeles, City Councilman Nate Holden learned
firsthand Wednesday that not everyone likes the idea.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum, Holden tried to describe how Raiders owner Al Davis might
return the team, but a woman in a University of Southern California
T-shirt with five kids in tow kept interrupting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the Raiders,'' the woman proclaimed, as Holden
tried to halt television cameras from capturing her remarks. ``They
haven't won in God knows how long. We want a team that wins. A team
that will stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders left Los Angeles after the 1994 season because
Oakland lured them away with a better deal to play there. Davis
also has claimed city officials never delivered on plans to upgrade
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the team played.
</P>
<P>
   Holden _ wearing a black Raiders team cap _ tried to regain
control by saying he believed that Davis was prepared to return if
he wins a federal lawsuit against the National Football League in
which he is seeking to maintain territorial rights to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with Al Davis (Tuesday) night and again (Wednesday)
morning and he said he wants to come back to Los Angeles,'' Holden
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the councilman indicated any deal with Davis should
include conditions to rebuild the Coliseum, similar to the plans
now being developed to try to draw a National Football League
expansion team. Under those plans, the Coliseum would seat 66,000 _
expandable to 80,000 for Super Bowls _ and hold 140 luxury boxes
and 10,000 club suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with Al Davis when this was displayed in Kansas City,''
Holden said. ``He turned to me and said, It's four years too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had done this in 1995, we would still have the Raiders
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Raiders spokesman Bruce Allen confirmed that Davis and Holden
had talked, but no decision has been made on returning to Los
Angeles. The Raiders are under a 16-year contract to play in
Oakland, but Davis has challenged the terms in a lawsuit separate
from the one filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Councilman Holden has expressed great enthusiasm about the
Raiders coming back to Los Angeles based on his attorney's review
of our (federal) lawsuit against the NFL,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, until that is resolved, no decisions have been made about
the team moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he believes that a decision in the court case will
be made in the near future, clearing the way for a Raiders
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said he believes Davis would make a commitment to
remain in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would agree to sell a percentage of his team to
local entrepreneurs to show his commitment,'' Holden said. ``It's
not 50 percent, but 30 to 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he would have no comment about that.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who has headed the Los Angeles
effort to land a new franchise to play in a remodeled Coliseum,
dismissed Holden's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like anything new,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
``It's just some headline hunting.'' &QL;

CENSUS REPORT REVEALS BIGGEST ANNUAL INCREASE SINCE '92
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California's population grew by 1.5 percent
between July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998 _ the biggest increase for
the Golden State since 1992, according to a new U.S. Census Bureau
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The luster is back on California again,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The rise reflects a slowdown in the number of residents moving
to nearby states, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Central to California's growth and retention of people was job
creation in such key industries as entertainment, software and
international trade, and business services from advertising to
equipment rental, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   People are always lured to the state by the good weather, job
opportunities and societal openness, according to Kyser and Bruce
DeVine, chief economist for the Southern California Association of
Governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California lifestyle never went away _ the economy just
went into a terrible recession'' in the early '90s, DeVine said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kyser said, the 1992 riots after the first Rodney
King trial and the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, coupled with
economic hard times, drove people out and kept others away.
</P>
<P>
   That's largely in the past now. California had the highest
numerical population increase of any state at more than 484,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   For the 13th straight year, Nevada is the nation's
fastest-growing state, boosting its population by 4.1 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But California will take the top spot from Nevada, growing
faster than any other state between now and 2025, according to a
Census Bureau projection released last month. The state's
population is expected to rise to roughly 50 million by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the population growth in the rest of the West during
the early and middle part of the decade was due to a truly
phenomenal amount of domestic out-migration to other Western states
from California,'' said Marc Perry, a census demographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, with far fewer people leaving California now, this source
of population growth for other states just isn't there anymore,''
Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1997 to July 1998, even as California's population
jumped to nearly 32.7 million people, the state still suffered a
net loss of 89,711 residents to other states. But their departure
was more than made up for by the 268,685 people who moved here from
other countries, making California the state with the single
largest number of new immigrants and the highest rate of
international migration, the Census Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's number of births _ 526,785 _ was more than double
the number of deaths _ 223,066, which placed California among the
states with the largest rates of natural increase, the Census
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   This will create a host of problems, Kyser said. ``Where are we
going to put these people? How are they going to get to and from
work?''
</P>
<P>
   Local governments are going to have to work together to come up
with solutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Denser high-rise apartments may be one answer, DeVine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, How can we possibly accommodate the
population you're talking about?'' he said. ``We're pretty sure we
can do it.'' &QL;

ACCOUNTANT CHARGED IN ANTHRAX THREAT AT BANKRUPTCY COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; A Calabasas, Calif., accountant has been charged
with phoning in a fake anthrax threat to a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Los Angeles on Dec. 18 in a ruse to delay a sanctions hearing
against him, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Craig Spelkin, 53, was charged Wednesday with knowingly
threatening to transfer a biological agent under the Biological
Weapons and High Terrorism Act of 1989, federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin faces a life sentence if convicted, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Los Angeles Police Department officials said Spelkin did
not appear to be tied to any of 19 similar scares to hit Southern
California since October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should serve as an example that we have the ability to
investigate and prosecute these cases,'' said LAPD Cmdr. Bruce E.
Hagerty.
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin was released on $50,000 bail after a 10-minute hearing
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Asked to comment outside of
court, he said, ``No, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin walked out of the courthouse alone after agreeing to put
up his Calabasas home to cover the $50,000 bail. A preliminary
hearing date is set for Jan. 13. His arraignment was scheduled for
Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, you cannot make any more telephone calls of
this kind of nature,'' U.S. Magistrate Judge Rosalyn Chapman told
Spelkin, and then added he might want to ``see a counselor at some
point to see how you put yourself in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin was scheduled to appear Dec. 18 for a hearing on
possible sanctions against him in relation to a company he had been
involved with, according to an FBI affidavit. The bankruptcy
trustee had accused Spelkin of embezzlement and perjury, but he had
avoided court appearances by allegedly fabricating illnesses,
accidents and the death of relatives, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the courthouse, Spelkin called the court from a
roadside pay phone at 1:10 p.m., in an effort to avoid the hearing
in front of a judge 20 minutes later, the affidavit says.
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin admitted to investigators that during his phone call, he
said: ``You should check the air-conditioning system for possible
anthrax,'' according to the affidavit from FBI Special Agent
Stephen Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin also told investigators he dialed the same number five
minutes later and said, ``The previous call was a hoax, there is no
danger,'' Moore said in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Spelkin left a message on the judge's voice mail, saying
he had been in a car accident and could not make it to court, Moore
said in the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents began to investigate Spelkin following a tip from a
U.S. Bankruptcy Court clerk for the presiding judge in his case,
Kathleen T. Lax, Moore said in the affidavit. Spelkin came
voluntarily to FBI headquarters Wednesday, according to the
affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say that Spelkin was aware of the anthrax scare
that occurred the day before at an office building in the Westwood
area of Los Angeles that also was deemed a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Upon receiving the threat at the court in the Los Angeles suburb
of Woodland Hills, authorities evacuated the building and
temporarily quarantined about 90 employees and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The court stayed shut for two days while investigators searched
in vain for signs of the bacterium, which can kill if left
untreated after infection.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Spelkin's neighbors described him as reclusive.
They said Spelkin had been living in the 3500 block of Eddingham
Avenue _ in a weathered, slate blue, one-story house _ for at least
20 years. The Calabasas cul-de-sac is set against the hills
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said he lives with his wife, a son and daughter _ both
teen-agers, and that the family keeps to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Carole LeVine, who lives across the street, said Spelkin was her
husband's partner in an accounting firm based in Sherman Oaks some
14 years ago. Since then, their families have not been in close
contact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely shocking. The (Spelkins) were very nice people,
private, but very nice,'' she said. ``I'm totally blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. District Court on Wednesday, Spelkin, a portly
gray-haired man, wore wide-rimmed sunglasses while waiting about
two hours for his 10-minute bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Spelkin said he understood the charge filed against him, but
kept quiet when Chapman asked about his bankruptcy proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you'd rather not say anything at this time,'' Chapman
said, as Spelkin whispered to his court-appointed lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's leave it at that, your honor,'' he replied. &QL;

LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA   TARGETS   IDENTITY   THEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the last two years, Mari Frank has spent more
than 500 hours and $10,000 to clear her name because a Ventura,
Calif., woman assumed her identity, stole her credit record and
racked up debt along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got a red convertible Mustang in my name. ... I think
she's still driving it,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Frank was the victim of the fastest-growing
crime in America: identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Friday, California will become only the ninth state
to prosecute identity theft as a felony. The new law is the latest
in a series of recent local and federal guidelines set up to
protect Americans from the misappropriation of a name, Social
Security number, driver's license or any other form of
identification for monetary gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service estimates that identity theft cost U.S.
citizens $750 million last year, up from $450 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identity theft is the fastest-growing crime in America, maybe
even the world,'' Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said at a news conference Wednesday to explain the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties will include prison sentences of up to three years and
fines up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Until a year ago, there was no legal punishment in California
for identity theft. In January, it became a misdemeanor,
infrequently prosecuted by most district attorneys' offices in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a new civil law became effective, forcing credit
agencies to clear the records of identity-theft victims who can
present a police report documenting the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said the law will give his prosecutors the ammunition
they need to fight identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft also became a federal felony this year,
punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said increased use of computers, along with the ease
of getting a credit card by mail, is responsible for the rise in
identity crimes. But an identity thief doesn't need to be a master
hacker to get sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who suggests people shred discarded mail, said some
criminals find personal identity information in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said her alter ego, who was prosecuted under credit card
fraud laws and sentenced to a work furlough program, got the credit
information from a computer database that private investigators
use. Within a few months, the identity thief had obtained checks, a
driver's license and even business cards in Frank's name.
</P>
<P>
   After Frank found out about the crime, the Laguna Niguel,
Calif., lawyer spent hundreds of hours talking on the phone and
writing letters before her record was clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the true, real Mari Frank and it was not very easy to
prove that,'' she said. &QL;

WASHINGTON FIRES FOOTBALL COACH JIM LAMBRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He took over his dream job on one of the most turbulent days in
the history of Washington athletics. His unexpected termination
Wednesday was equally tempestuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a few weeks ago that I was given a validation as
the coach of at least next year's football team,'' said a stunned
Husky football coach Jim Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move, UW athletic director Barbara Hedges fired
Lambright late Tuesday, ending his 35-year association with the
school as a player, assistant coach and head coach. He had served
six seasons at the top, taking over on a Sunday in August 1993 when
Don James resigned at the announcement of severe Pacific 10
Conference sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright, 56, was a part of 39 percent of the football games in
the school's history.
</P>
<P>
   As a buyout, he will be paid $176,000 _ representing one year's
base salary _ and $100,000 toward a $200,000 annuity that was part
of the four-year ``rollover'' contract he was given last winter.
Only one year of those four, however, was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges, who announced the firing at a press conference
Wednesday, had made a public defense of Lambright in November the
week before the Apple Cup. She did not offer a specific reason for
the dismissal Wednesday, saying it was a ``judgment call'' focused
on the ``future of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright, however, said with some bitterness that he had been
``warned two weeks ago there would be a meeting.'' He said some
wealthy donors undermined his regime, telling Hedges they would
withhold support for the school's capital-improvements campaign if
changes were not made at least within Lambright's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to it,'' Lambright said, referring to the warning.
``But it meant I had to go start firing coaches and hiring somebody
else's impression of who should be on the staff and I don't do
that. That's not the way you run a program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges bristled at Lambright's version, saying, ``I did not
buckle under to anybody. There isn't one person I talked to who is
a major donor, an average donor, who has said to me, `I'm
withholding a donation because of this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-last day of 1998 brought a scene to the Don James
Center at Husky Stadium that was almost surreal. Lambright and
several family members, including his wife, Lynne, attended the
70-minute press conference.
</P>
<P>
   They heard Hedges speak for almost half of it, followed by
Lambright, who talked about, among other things, how much
recruiting of this year's high school seniors was going to be
damaged by the late timing of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be tremendously affected, I mean tremendously
affected,'' Lambright said. ``I don't care how fast you bring
somebody in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said she will hire a new coach as soon as possible, using
a small group of advisers for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it one of the best jobs in the country,'' Hedges
said. ``It's a fabulous program.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant coaches have contracts that run until June 30.
Hedges said she wasn't sure whether any would actively try to
bridge the gap in recruiting before the hiring of a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision affects many lives,'' Hedges said. ``For that, I
am truly sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was Hedges' most visible hire, albeit of necessity.
Several days after he landed the job on an interim basis when James
stepped down, he was given a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   But Lambright and Hedges were never a great fit. Hedges has been
described as an administrator who cares deeply about image, while
Lambright often seemed to shoot from the hip, sometimes making
public comments that were ill-advised or subject to being
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   In November, when he suspended senior wide receiver Andre
DeSaussure for disparaging comments about Pullman the week of the
Apple Cup game, Lambright did not stop at a simple explanation for
his action. He continued to excoriate DeSaussure, saying, among
other things, ``The way he's been up and down in the program, it's
kind of symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was also criticized for comments after his last loss,
six days ago in the Oahu Bowl. He said he was displeased at the
fact the Husky scouts didn't give the front-line players an
adequate picture of Air Force's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting in Washington also lapsed in Lambright's recent
years. The Huskies' best recruits often came from outside the
state, while highly sought local players such as Carlos
Pierre-Antoine (Notre Dame), Victor Rogers (Colorado) and Mac
Morrison (Penn State) went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The finishing loss to Air Force ended a UW streak of 21 straight
winning seasons. It left Lambright with a career head-coaching
record of 44-25-1, including 31-16-1 against Pac-10 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of that record,'' Lambright said. ``To go back
and do it much better than we did it, I'm not sure it could be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he coach again, after 30 years on the same staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see myself coaching somewhere else,'' he said. ``I'm
not sure my wife can.''

UW ATHLETIC DIRECTOR SENSED FREE-FALL IN PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Aloha Stadium press box before the Washington-Air Force
bowl game last Friday afternoon, Barbara Hedges talked cheerfully
and animatedly about the game, the team, the trip, the weather.
</P>
<P>
   She betrayed no indication that she was three days from the most
controversial, contradictory decision of her tenure as Washington's
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, responding to media requests, Hedges gave an
unqualified endorsement of coach Jim Lambright's continued tenure,
saying that he also had the full support of the university
president.
</P>
<P>
   She also denied knowledge of a plan rumored to be led by
prominent Tyee Club power brokers Rick Redman and Ron Crockett to
buy out the balance of Lambright's contract, about $276,000, which
had been extended only last year.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday, she fired Lambright and his staff, the most
publicly unanticipated axing in the modern history of Washington
football.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was hard for Hedges, or anyone, to build a case
against Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the Huskies' lame performance in the Oahu Bowl, not
after the first non-winning season in 22 years, not after losing
Northwest supremacy to Oregon, not after repeated embarrassments on
big-time TV games, not after the numerous player-management
blunders that pickled his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   But almost no school fires a coach after a bowl game, in the
middle of recruiting season. Almost no school fires a coach with a
44-25-1 record. Almost no school fires a coach a year after a
contract extension unless there are major NCAA violations or a
breach of personal conduct, none of which are said to be pending.
Almost no school fires a coach for fractured syntax and incomplete
sentences, although the English Department had Lambright on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   And almost no school fires abruptly, without a shape-up warning,
a 30-year employee and alum who bailed out the program in its most
turbulent time.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, the program is about to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Hedges concluded. Not only were some powerful alums
threatening to withdraw financial support in the middle of Hedges'
pet project, a $70 million upgrade of athletic facilities, the
increasing loss of quality recruits, locally and regionally,
threatened to keep Husky football second-rate in the Pac-10 _ which
would make Hedges the next one out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations on Wednesday with a number of former players close
to the program suggested that the loss of respect by some current
players for Lambright had reached a point where they could no
longer advocate for Washington with prospective recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Said one former player: ``Some of these guys have said that they
just don't like playing football for Washington.'' Said another:
``A lot of them still like Lambright, they just don't like what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   A part of what isn't liked is also a part that drove program
backers crazy this year: Hiding behind sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious tiredness of the excuse, it didn't play well
for two reasons: Lambright and several members of the staff had a
hand in the NCAA violations that created the Pac-10 penalties in
1992, and it was an indirect insult to the starting players.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship reductions that limited this year's senior and
junior classes were hurtful, but not to the degree implied by the
coaches. And its deployment says to the starters, ``You wouldn't be
playing much except we were screwed by the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hedges needed a final straw, Lambright supplied it after the
embarrassing whipping by Air Force when he laid off the UW's
terrible defense to an ineffectual effort by the scout team in
duplicating the little-seen option offense. The scout team was
weak, Lambright said, because players who normally fill the jobs
are playing big roles in the sanction-devastated roster.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the scout team as culprit in a bowl defeat might
have been a first in Division I-A coaching history. Turned out to
be the last refuge of a man desperate to avoid responsibility for
one of the worst losses of his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   So it could be said that the sanctions claimed another victim, a
second Washington head coach. But unlike Don James, who quit in
protest, Lambright protested too much, to the detriment of his
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions soap opera was the kind of excuse-making and odd
behavior that burned up his coaching capital, leaving him no
protection for the inevitable down cycle in every D-1 program.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright had a peculiar self-absorption in which he took high
offense at those within and around the program who would disagree
or disparage. Along with his clumsy public treatment of departing
players such as Shane Fortney and Nick Lentz, he filtered much of
the experience through himself. According to a former player,
Lambright addressed the team before the ill-fated game at Nebraska
this way: ``Don't screw with me this week _ this is the biggest
week of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly waking the echoes of Lombardi or Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said Wednesday he ``bleeds purple and gold,'' but he
never seemed to understand that he often must make do with those
who don't, or at least don't see things exactly his way.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright tossed around the word loyalty Wednesday. He said he
thought his ``30 years deserved better,'' and he might be right.
But what he never understood was that while loyalty might be a
small reason to hire a coach _ it was part of what got him the job
when James quit _ it is no reason to keep a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the imagery wrapped in raccoon coats and phrases like
``student-athlete.'' College football is as cutthroat a business as
any other big-time sports entertainment. Being loyal, being a
long-timer, being a local, it doesn't matter. This being America,
production matters.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Dennis Erickson. Ask all the fired executives at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said his only regret was that he ``might have been
more political.'' The words held as much disdain as if they had
been spoken by ex-Sonic coach George Karl, another guy contemptuous
of the game beyond the game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for otherwise wonderful characters like Lambright
and Karl, modern sports are played on two levels. Besides what
happens on the field or arena, the game is also about alumni,
owners, media, corporations, rich fans and gamblers _ all far more
heavily invested in sports outcomes than when Lambright, Erickson,
Karl and their contemporaries first learned to love their games.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was good for the way things were, not for the way
things will be. Unfortunately for her, Hedges came late to the
realization, moved abruptly, and now is operating out of
desperation to salvage the future of the UW's mammoth athletic
department machinery.
</P>
<P>
   She can only hope she plays the game better than Lambright did.

SEATTLE FOOTBALL COACHES SHORT ON SAVVY BUT LOYAL TO THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it was the Seahawks. Now it is the Huskies. The firings of
the head coaches of Seattle's two big football teams this week
leave us with little choice except to draw one parallel conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Erickson and Jim Lambright, who share Everett roots and a
life-long allegiance to football and the Pacific Northwest, have
been identified as inappropriate leaders for jobs both considered
their ultimate opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the fairy tale story had a rotten ending.
</P>
<P>
   These are local guys who made good, but their back-to-back
dismissals are an indication that both home-grown coaches lacked a
requisite level of flexibility, political savvy and public
relations smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lambright made reference Wednesday to how much
longer he has been at Washington than athletic director Barbara
Hedges, as if that negates her overall duty to act in the best
interest of the university.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lambright's job to convince Hedges, as well as the rabid
Washington alumni and fan base, that he could make the transition
from stalwart Husky assistant to Division I program leader, both
with his on-field accomplishments and administrative
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It was Erickson's job to show he had the know-how to move from
college to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man had been terribly convincing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Erickson was turned loose Monday from a fast-tracked
NFL franchise that is hellbent on winning the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Lambright was abruptly fired late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too coincidental that in their own hometowns, neither
Erickson nor Lambright was entrenched, beloved, connected or
convincing enough to sway all doubt about their abilities to lead
these high-profile teams?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. Erickson, 51, and Lambright, 56, appear to share
similar old-school tendencies _ traits to be commended, unless
those traits get in the way of making swift changes when change is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, both Lambright and Erickson prize loyalty in their
assistants over urges to replace personnel, even when it seems
clear an upgrade is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Did Erickson know when it was time to make a change of special
teams' coach in '97?
</P>
<P>
   Did Lambright stubbornly refuse to take suggestion about the
need to make changes, even when the word was coming from his
friends inside university circles?
</P>
<P>
   Both Lambright and Erickson were adament in their departure
speeches this week. If loyalty is a negative, then sorry. Loyalty
is the key element in building their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Lambright chose to open himself up to dismissal rather than
lop off some heads to satisfy outside forces, he clearly was loyal
to the point of doing himself a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   He may be the head coach, but whose program, ultimately, is it?
Wednesday he found out and he was mightily ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   . ``I was tremendously surprised and shocked by my meeting with
Barbara since it was only a few weeks ago that I was given
validation as head coach at least for next year's football team,''
Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   And when he was lobbed a softball question about whether,
looking back over his six years as head coach at Washington he
would do anything differently, he was as straight-forward and
politically unwary as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I had to do anything over again, the only thing I
would second guess is that I wasn't more political,'' Lambright
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same fellow who popped off that Washington and not
Oregon would be a better candidate for the Cotton Bowl, even after
the Ducks had whupped the Huskies that season.
</P>
<P>
   Much is going to be made of the abrupt nature of Lambright's
firing, including whatever kind of pressure anti-Lambright boosters
were able to put on Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of Hedges' reign at Washington hinges on her
authority and autonomy. That is why there will be unending intrigue
surrounding her seemingly sudden decision to fire Lambright, just
six weeks after giving him a vote of confidence and with so little
time to preserve the incoming recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright was clear on his take: This was a dirty deal.
</P>
<P>
   But was it, really? The real issue is that, short of firing
Lambright directly after the Nov. 21 Apple Cup game, no time would
be a good time to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you make a coaching change, you throw your program into
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   And until he won against Michigan State in last year's Aloha
Bowl, Lambright's job was on the line last December.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Hedges seems completely certain that the benefit
of making the coaching change now outweighs the risk.
</P>
<P>
   One year vs. the future of a program that is worth $24 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this last season was Lambright's test. Maybe he just plain
did not pass it. It is possible, considering the way kicker Nick
Lentz left the school so unhappy; the way Lambright handled Andre
DeSaussure's outspoken comments about Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Lambright did not take any opportunity to raise the level
of his game to the satisfaction of Hedges, who was already
questioning his long-term future and who may have been aware that
the team was not responding to Lambright in a manner that appealed
to her.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said her goal was to attract a new head coach who would
``manage the program in an exceptional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright may reject the politics for which a head coach at
Washington is judged. But when he decided to do this, he missed the
point of head coaching at a nationally acclaimed program like
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just all about winning. You can't insulate yourself in
the weight room and film room. You can't expect public relations
nightmares with some of your players _ including one with Rashaan
Shehee in which Lambright actually asked Shehee to lie as part of a
cover-up _ to go unnoticed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Two football teams in Seattle have decided to go in different
directions this week, meaning these are tough times for the Everett
guys who got their chance.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the premium being placed on raising the bar,
both at the Seahawks and at Washington, these are also good times
for an NFL franchise and a big-time Division I program that claim
to want nothing but the best.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you can't complain about that.

BIG ISSUES OF SPILLING UNRESOLVED INTO NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) 
(Daily News Staff Writers Howard Beck and Reed Johnson contributed
to this report.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Impeachment. Iraq. Los Angeles City Charter reform.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Around the world, across the nation and throughout Los Angeles,
many people will remember 1998 as the Year of Unfinished Business.
</P>
<P>
   On a vast to-do list, along with national and international
imperatives, is resolving two momentous local issues: how to update
the City Charter and whether a new San Fernando Valley city should
be created by splitting away from the rest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more pivotal was the founding of the city
itself in 1781,'' said California's state librarian, Kevin Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what makes 1998's conclusion seem less than climactic
and satisfying is, in the past month alone, the dizzying rush of
events that will remain hanging when the champagne wears off.
</P>
<P>
   Not an Aaron Spelling-inspired television ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a generally accepted truth that TV has made us impatient
for resolution,'' said Linda Waters, an Encino psychologist.
``Novels and television have led us to expect neat and tidy
packages. But death is about the only thing that wraps everything
up in a neat and tidy package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a natural human tendency to want closure in wrapping
things up and knowing what they mean and not having unfinished
business. The human animal has a need for anything threatening to
be resolved or escaped.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday morning, revelers shedding their party clothes
will need to wait for the other shoe to drop on plenty of issues.
</P>
<P>
   There's the impeachment _ the impending Senate trial or censure
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the conflict that began with Allied bombing to force
President Saddam Hussein's compliance with United Nations weapons
regulations continues into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Bill Gates wonders whether his business will be
deemed a monopoly and broken up.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Los Angeles has yet to find out whether it will get a
National Football League expansion team or where such a team would
play: in a revamped Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum or a new stadium
in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Will the city host the Democratic National Convention in 2000 or
lose its bid to Boston or Denver?
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association's year ended spectacularly
in June when Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to a memorable
sixth title in eight years. But Jordan and some 400 other players
haven't been on an NBA court since. The season could be canceled
Jan. 7 if the lockout of NBA players, which already has erased two
months of games, isn't resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In Valencia, police arrested mother-of-five Sandi Nieves after
finding her four young daughters asphyxiated in their home July 1.
But no evidence in the case has yet been made public. Her court
hearings have been repeatedly delayed and any trial appears far
off.
</P>
<P>
   All cultivated ears will be turned toward the long-delayed Walt
Disney Concert Hall. Fund raisers finally have come up with enough
money, nearly $200 million, to begin construction this spring. That
would be music indeed to Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry, who has
opened new buildings around the globe while his hometown spent nine
years dithering over Disney Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 366 days, when computers worldwide try to figure out whether
the year is 2000 or 1900, will the result be merely a technological
hiccup or the equivalent of choking to death on a ham sandwich for
every computer on Earth? Some who fear the latter are already
stockpiling food and weapons for the subsequent anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still a whole year to fret about that one.

KANSAS STATE IS UNABLE TO LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Bill Snyder and his Kansas State Wildcats broke
the cardinal rule of the bowl season. They came to a game they
didn't want to play in and didn't feel guilty about it until the
last 12 minutes. By then it was too late to stave off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Their punishment? A 37-34 loss to Purdue, an unranked, mid-level
Big Ten team, in the Alamo Bowl on Tuesday night. Kansas State was
the nation's third-best team, according to the Bowl Championship
Series ranking. But after 60 minutes of indifferent football, they
returned to Kansas the same way the Tin Man entered Oz: looking for
a heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were once an undefeated team on the precipice of a
national championship. They lost a heartbreaker in double overtime
to Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 championship game, pouted about being
snubbed by the New Year's Day bowl games and now can't even call
themselves the Alamo Bowl champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go to bowl games, you better show up because we are
going to have some fun,'' Purdue linebacker Tom Vaughn said of the
Boilermakers, who won their second consecutive Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' tumble should be a warning to Ohio State, UCLA and
Florida, highly rated teams that head into the New Year's games
with something other than playing their best on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes want to ignore an inexcusable home loss to a
nonbowl team, Michigan State, which knocked them out of the
championship game picture. Instead, they will hope that Florida
State wins ugly over Tennessee in the Fiesta Bowl's championship
game, while they roll over Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar Bowl and ride the
victory from No.3 to No.1 in the Associated Press news media poll.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kansas State, UCLA may experience a hangover from losing
its national title hopes on the final game of the season against
Miami. And Florida could have been in the Fiesta if it had beaten
Florida State. Instead, the Gators have two losses and a short trip
to south Florida for the Orange Bowl against a three-loss Syracuse
team.
</P>
<P>
   Each coach and player, however, may be wise to pop a tape into
the VCR and watch Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop give his
post-game interview. Was he embarrassed by losing to an unranked
team? Especially after the Wildcats had whined about being snubbed
by all the major bowls?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not embarrassed,'' Bishop said. ``We got beat by a good
team. Why would we be embarrassed? We came out to play. We put
points on the board. We just didn't come out on top. There's no
reason to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   But there really was. The Wildcats (11-2) didn't come here to
play. They barely went through the motions in falling behind by
17-7 in the first half. They made only four first downs, gained 63
total yards, turned the ball over four times, had a field goal
blocked and had seven penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers (9-4) may have had less talent, but they
honored their contract with the 60,780 people on hand with
hard-hitting effort. Their sophomore quarterback, Drew Brees,
turned in four quarters of grit; he was rewarded when he drove the
Boilermakers 80 yards in the final minute and found Isaac Jones for
the 24-yard game-winning touchdown. Brees's numbers didn't reflect
his will: 25 of 53 for 230 yards and 3 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The usually mercurial Bishop's did. He was 9 of 24 passing for
182 yards and threw more interceptions (4) than touchdowns (3). He
gained only 7 yards rushing on 20 carries. He fumbled. He muffed a
handoff exchange, which led to another Purdue touchdown. His two
fourth-quarter touchdown passes could not make up for what his
lackadaisical play had already done.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, there were no tears from Snyder and his
players, as there had been after the loss to Texas A&AMP;M. The coach,
who uses two tones, guarded and irritated, chose the latter. When
asked if his team had played as if it wanted to be in the Alamo
Bowl, he paused and stared. ``Yes,'' he said tersely, then looked
away.
</P>
<P>
   There was one Wildcat, however, who wanted to explain what
really happened. Wide receiver Darnell McDonald capped a brilliant
college career with 5 catches for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns _
including an 88-yarder in the fourth quarter that almost saved his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We totally sat down in the first half,'' he said. ``Did we
want to be here? It was mixed. But we did go out on the field to
win the game and play well. But maybe then it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes, the Bruins and the Gators should know that.  &QL;

HOLIDAY INTERLUDE ISN'T SLOW FOR SOME WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The week between Christmas and New Year's is, for many workers,
the longest unofficial holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone stays home, mind you. It's just that work
slows down and turns into extended lunches and staff parties: late
to work, early to leave _ long mysterious disappearances with such
hazy, later explanations as, ``Hi.''
</P>
<P>
   But while some have been savoring the season, there are some
jobs that only get tougher during the holidays. Firefighters are
scrambling from house fire to house fire as Christmas trees dry out
and explode under coils of hot wiring. Psychologists stack
unmarried parents like cord wood on their couches.
</P>
<P>
   Caterers, police, liquor store clerks, grocers, letter carriers,
exchange desk personnel are all a scurry.
</P>
<P>
   The pet-sitting industry, not normally one of the backbones of
Arizona's economy, rises to the rank of an economic powerhouse
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In north Scottsdale, retirees Jim and Barbara Bristol are house
guests of the Kerner family's three Pyrenees dogs and four cats.
The Bristols are among the 100 pet-sitters employed by Pampered
Pets &AMP; Plants, all of whom are busy on jobs this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some pet-sitters just stop by homes to check on a pet while
owners are visiting relatives or hitting the slopes. Others, like
the Bristols, move into the pets' home to keep them company while
the family is away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are crazy about their pets and they want the holiday to
be happy for them, too,'' said Jann Kemp, owner of the
animal-sitting business. The holidays are her high season, followed
by August, when only dogs and dog sitters remain in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Social dating services are also at full tilt during the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get 300 calls today and tomorrow _ more than any other
two days of the year,'' said Lynda Johncock, owner of Arizona's
Most Eligible Singles, a dating service she said caters mostly to
business owners, doctors and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will say, `I don't want to spend the holidays alone next
year, or with the person I was with this year.' '' The rush to
recouple continues in January, her biggest month.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's resolutions go something like this: start a diet,
save money and begin a relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Year's Eve is very romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax code is also very romantic, and nurses at some Valley
hospitals report that women close to delivering new deductions ask
for labor to be induced. And, after a stellar economic year, some
Valley hospital nurseries are overflowing with a record crop of
babies.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency rooms are also at high season, as everyone's regular
doctors are off, testing the greens in Scottsdale or skiing in
Colorado. Many doctors' offices don't keep regular hours during the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that emergency rooms are buzzing like cocktail
parties is that too much time at home means too many opportunities
to fall off ladders or jog on bad knees or see whether skating is a
skill you never forget.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful strain of flu is also sending many sneezing, dripping
people to emergency rooms. Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center's
emergency room, which normally serves 130 to 150 people a day,
handled 215 one day this week. Other Valley hospitals report
similar popularity. Snowbirds add to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Death, alas, does not take the holiday either. While some
people do try to hang on through the holidays, it's not always
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Lutz, area manager for Service Corporation International,
which manages funeral homes in the Valley, says the two holiday
weeks have been busier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   They're not the only people trying to make a body look good.
</P>
<P>
   Hair salons are abuzz as New Year's Eve parties loom directly
ahead. Debbie Angulo, one of the owners of Changes hair salon in
Scottsdale, will be on her feet all day creating up-dos and
party-dos.
</P>
<P>
   Rhinestone bugs, she says _ butterflies, ladybugs, dragonflies
and spiders _ are the rage. Women want them woven into their hair
creations this year. It's style, she says. Angulo says the bugs
``do grow on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's five-star resorts also are filling up with thawing
customers from northern climes. Debi Bridges, director of public
relations for the Arizona Biltmore, says the joint is jumping. She
says it more elegantly, but the joint is jumping.
</P>
<P>
   As if they weren't busy enough, airline counters are also
dealing with people with frequent flier miles that fly away at the
stroke of midnight tonight.
</P>
<P>
   And the crazy stock market will close early today, as it did
Christmas Eve. It has been a frenzied week for many financial
planners as people are busy converting traditional IRAs to Roth
IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing this hum of economic prosperity, Arizona's governor,
high from the 9th floor over the Copper Dome, contemplates the
needs of her people in the New Year as a new legislative season
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she's out for the day.  &QL;

COYOTES DEFEAT RANGERS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Having spent three full days without a game in sunny
Arizona, the Rangers were rested and ready for Wednesday night's
match against the Coyotes. With all three members of their first
line out of the lineup, the Coyotes were weakened against the
visitors from New York.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case under these circumstances, the team that
would seem to have the advantage was the team that played poorly
and lost while the team that seemed to be at a disadvantage played
well and won.
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking an early lead, the Rangers were sometimes
frustrated and sometimes lethargic in losing by 3-1 before a
howling capacity crowd in America West Arena. Niklas Sundstrom
scored the Rangers' only goal.
</P>
<P>
   With Phoenix leading by 2-1 midway through the third period,
Daniel Briere scored an insurance goal on a high wrist shot at the
12-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually works in reverse,'' Brian Leetch, the Rangers'
captain, said, referring to the logic of predicting a game like
this. ``We got outworked in our own zone.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his team was stale, Rangers Coach John Muckler
said that he could not use that as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual departure from his standard demeanor, Muckler
criticized several players by name. He mentioned that John MacLean
``can't put the puck in,'' on a breakaway. And that Kevin Stevens
``missed a whole open net'' on a power play. He pointed out that
Todd Harvey ``turned over the puck,'' on Briere's scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   After that goal, Harvey smashed his stick over the top of the
Rangers' net. After the game, he trashed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hand made it O.K.,'' he said of his injured right thumb,
``but it was everything else that was a problem.'' Harvey said it
was his worst game as a member of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers resume the trip on Thursday night in Denver against
the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any easier,'' said Adam Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky, who played more than 20 minutes, was held without
a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game went on, they got stronger and we seemed to
fade,'' Gretzky said. ``It was a bad loss for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes held a 2-1 lead after two periods despite playing
without all three members of their top line. Keith Tkachuk, the
left wing with 17 goals, will miss three weeks with a broken rib.
Jeremy Roenick, the center with 14 goals, will miss about a week
with a concussion. Dallas Drake, the right wing with six goals, is
serving a four-game suspension for a violent check of Doug Bodger
of the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Phoenix was the best team in the league for the first
quarter of the season, it has had less success in recent games.
Coming into Wednesdsay night's match, the Coyotes had been 3-4 in
their previous seven.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in goal for the Rangers, for the first time in more
than a month, was Dan Cloutier, the rookie who is the backup for
Mike Richter. Cloutier made several sharp saves in the first period
as the Rangers were outplayed, often hemmed in their own zone by
the aggressive skating and checking of the Phoenix players.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring for New York was Sundstrom, at 1:25. After Petr Nedved
drew two checkers toward him at the blue line, he passed the puck
to Mike Knuble, who moved it right to left to Sundstrom. Goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin had committed far to the right-wing side, so
Sundstrom had lots of empty net to fill with a long, backhanded
shot from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix tied the score at 1-1 at 6:48 of the second on a goal by
Bob Corkum, who scored off a rush after Ranger defenseman Rumun
Ndur was caught up ice, along the left boards. Corkum beat Cloutier
with a wrist shot from the inside edge of the right-wing circle.
Phoenix made it 2-1 at 18:16 on a goal by Rick Tocchet, who was
uncovered in front on a play that began with Greg Adams winning a
face-off from Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup for the Rangers was Harvey, a right wing who
missed the last two games with an injured right thumb. At the
morning practice on Wednesday, Harvey still had the hand wrapped in
a bandage and he treated it with ice after the skate. ``It's a bone
bruise, and probably something with the tendons and ligaments,''
Harvey said. ``It's not 100 percent, but it's time to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mistake on the first Phoenix goal, Ndur took a
regular shift alongside Jeff Beukeboom. In the previous game, a 6-3
victory at Carolina, Ndur assisted on Stevens's goal for his first
point in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Ndur said he did not even know he was credited with an assist
until the puck was handed to him on the bench. ``I was pretty
pumped about it,'' said Ndur, who is 23 years old. ``First point!
It really meant a lot to me.''

WILDCATS' HOLIDAY MAKES FOR BEST SEA SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It was the end of a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The first, tangible piece in an emerging Arizona football
tradition wasput into place Wednesday night by a thoroughly gritty
and often crazy 23-20 Wildcats' victory over Nebraska in the
Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it was a vintage Arizona performance in a wild,
improbable season. The Wildcats were up, down, on their heels,
reeling and yet never out.
</P>
<P>
   Ever resourceful, the Wildcats fooled the Cornhuskers, the
Qualcomm Stadium crowd of 65,354, expectations and momentum for the
last time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory over a leading member of college football's royal
family will have immediate impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a complete football team in all areas _ offense,
defense and especially special teams,'' said Nebraska coach Frank
Solich, who could havebeen casting a vote for Arizona's 1999
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are sure to finish 1998 with a ranking among the
nation'stop five. With the loss Tuesday night of fourth-ranked
Kansas State, No. 4 lookslike a lock. And then, of course, there's
next year . The season-ending victory over Nebraska promises to put
the Wildcats in the hunt for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be more about all of that later. A lot more.
</P>
<P>
   On this one night, the Wildcats proved that, yes, they were
unknown in September, underrated in October and unbelievable in
December.
</P>
<P>
   One number says plenty and says it 12 times. Once-beaten Arizona
finished with 12 victories for the first time in a history that
dates to 1899.
</P>
<P>
   But, for a while, it looked as if the Cornhuskers (9-4) would
finish a Cinderella season and leave Arizona again searching for a
way to be more than just another unknown program. For oh-so-long,
the A on the side of Wildcat helmets has stood for Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   More anonymity seemed to be on the horizon when a difficult game
started with a lot of blown opportunities, all Arizona's. The
Wildcats were within Nebraska's 10 yard line three times in the
first half. They had two touchdowns _ a Keith Smith pass to Brad
Brennan and a 78-yard punt return by Chris McAlister _ nullified by
penalities.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 5 Wildcats could have had at least 28 points on its side
of thescoreboard at halftime. Instead, it had only nine, thanks to
three field goals by Mark McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, No. 14 Nebraska seemed to be exercising its
superior power on both offense and defense. There were a couple of
Kris Brown field goalsand a 35-yard TD pass from Eric Crouch to
Shevin Wiggins.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona should have been leading. But, there was Nebraska, ahead
at halftime, 13-9. For Arizona, there was a further complication.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable receiver Jeremy McDaniel was sidelined with a hip
pointer suffered in the first quarter. The Wildcats' dynamic
passing game had lost a keycomponent.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back against Nebraska was huge,'' Arizona coach Dick
Tomey said. ``I told them at halftime that we hadn't been down at
halftime all season.I told them to keep their poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Old habits never die. Tomey was certain of the poise. His team's
inexhaustble pluck provided the rest. All season, the Wildcats
thrived on the improbable, if not the seemingly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The first confrontation came late in the third quarter. The
Wildcats drove from their own 34 to Nebraska's 21 yard line. It was
fourth down and one yard to a drive-sustaining first. Time for a
field goal? Forget it. Instead, Kelvin Eafon got the call and ran
two yards on a sprained ankle for a critical first down.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later early in the fourth quarter, Smith hit Brennan
with a15-yard TD strike that, this time, counted.
</P>
<P>
   But the game wasn't finished. With the unpredictable Wildcats,
it neveris. On the subsequent possession, Nebraska, held to 87
rushing yards, drove 68 yards with the capper a beautiful Tracey
Wistrom reception of a 4-yard Crouch pass.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, Arizona knew its offense could move on the
feared Nebraska defenders. So it did. Smith, the gam'ss offensive
Most Valuable Player,was the key in a drive that started on the
Arizona 32. Three times, he ran quarterback keepers for 20, eight
and seven yards. At the end, there was Eafon once again with a
one-yard dive for the game's final score.
</P>
<P>
   But the game itself still wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska threatened once again. This time, however, McAlister
intervened for a play that summed an Arizona defense that adjusted
and utlimately stopped Nebraska's option attack.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped high in front of Wiggins for an interception of a
Crouch pass at the Arizona six. He returned it 24 yards to the 30.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister put an exclamation point on the end.
</P>
<P>
   Only the beginning is left.

VOL'S CREDENTIALS STUFF OF LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the University of Tennessee media guide, running
back Travis Henry ran for 4,087 yards and scored 42 touchdowns in
his senior year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ``did'','' said Bud Ford, Tennessee's sports information
director.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't. He ``couldn't'' have.
</P>
<P>
   For Henry to rush for more than 4,000 yards in 14 games, he
would have had to average 292 yards a game. High schools play
12-minute quarters.
</P>
<P>
   That's 6 yards a minute!
</P>
<P>
   Al, you don't believe it, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Al Wilson, the All-America Vols linebacker and Henry's teammate,
broke into a big I-know-it-sounds-crazy grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe it,'' Wilson said. ``Travis is ``real'' strong.
His legs are like tree trunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Legs like tree trunks.
</P>
<P>
   I see.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. It didn't happen. But another Tennessee linebacker,
Raynoch Thompson, insists it did. ``Travis showed me the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Was there an intermission?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four thousand eighty-seven yards'' and 42 touchdowns in one
season. Please.
</P>
<P>
   Sports stories are like fine wine. They get better over time.
Heroics are embellished. As legends grow, so do their
accomplishments. Joe Garagiola said Stan Musial ``could hit .300
with a fountain pen.'' Josh Gibson claimed Cool Papa Bell was so
fast he could get out of bed, turn out the lights and be back under
the covers before the lights went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never exaggerate,'' golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez says. ``I just
remember big.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports stories about superhuman feats are best taken with a
grain of salt, unless you're on a low sodium diet.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Henry's 4,000-yard season sounds as if it falls somewhere
between a tall tale and a whopper. The feat simply cannot be
believed without eyewitness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   So I called Henry's hometown newspaper, the ``Frostproof News.''
The ``News'' is published weekly in Frostproof, Fla., which sounds
like an ideal place to live, especially if you're a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered.
</P>
<P>
   Four thousand yards. Get serious.
</P>
<P>
   According to the media guide, 5-foot-11, 215-pound Travis Deion
Henry, who will start for the Vols in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl,
led Frostproof to the state championship and set seven state
rushing records.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven?
</P>
<P>
   In one game he ran for _ ready for this? _ 436 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Parade'' All-American, Henry rushed for 7,224 yards during
his high school career and scored 79 touchdowns. He also played
basketball and ran track.
</P>
<P>
   I called Frostproof High School.
</P>
<P>
   A secretary put me through to the field house and the office of
football Coach Richie Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   A student answered and gave me Coach Marsh's home phone.
</P>
<P>
   No answer there, either.
</P>
<P>
   I called the field house again and spoke to the helpful student
who identified himself as Grover Benton.
</P>
<P>
   Grover, do you know Travis Henry?

   ``He's my second cousin,'' Grover said. ``We played on the same
team his senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we're getting somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, Grover. Travis didn't really run for 4,087 yards in one
year, did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure did,'' Grover said, and you could hear the smile in
his voice. He began ticking off the names of the schools that his
cousin had run roughshod over that year. He sounded like a train
conductor calling out the whistle stops along the track. Pahokee .
. . Lake Butler . . . Avon Park . . . Sebring . . .
</P>
<P>
   So it's all true?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure is,'' Grover said. ``I remember one game a guy had Travis
by the jersey and another defender was right in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``He tore loose from the first guy and flattened the second guy
with his forearm. Best run I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   How long?
</P>
<P>
   ``About 70 yards.'' Grover laughed. ``Travis had plenty of
them.'' &QL;

OPEN HALTS SALE OF BEER AT 16TH 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BEER BAN-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to take some of the hearty out of party, organizers
of the Phoenix Open have decided to ban beer sales at the wild and
crazy 16th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsoring Phoenix Thunderbirds also are attempting to set
up a ``no-fly zone'' over the tournament, which tees off Jan. 25-31
at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not that big of deal,'' tournament chairman Ray
Artigue said Wednesday. ``The Thunderbirds enjoy a party as much as
the next guy, but we also have to be sensitive to all of our
constituents. This is about moderation, not prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue added that cigar sales also will be banned throughout
the course to make the tournament more pleasurable for the majority
of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't stop people from buying beer elsewhere and
bringing it to the (16th hole), or from people buying cigars off
the course and bringing them to the tournament,'' he said. ``There
still is a good time to be had by all, but we don't want it ruined
by people who are inebriated.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue said the change was urged by the PGA Tour. According to
Tour spokesman Dave Lancer, the decision is tourwide rather than
just focused on the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encouraged Phoenix along with all of our other tournaments
to curb sales of liquor,'' Lancer said. ``It just makes sense when
you're trying to maintain optimum playing conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour has received several complaints from marquee
players in the past about the near-maniac behavior at the 16th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples, who has yet to commit to this year's event, has
not played in Phoenix since 1990 and often describes the 16th as
``totally out of control.'' Tom Watson has suggested a beer ban on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the locals, such as Phil Mickelson, Billy Mayfair,
Andrew Magee, Tom Lehman and Mark Calcavecchia, have said they
understand the party-hearty flavor of the Phoenix tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have?'' Calcavecchia asked, somewhat in disbelief, after
being informed of the Thunderbirds' decision. ``Well, I guess you
can never say it's a bad thing, cutting people off. At the same
time, I always thought it was a great time. People get partied up
and really enjoy themselves at the 16th. I guess a few of (the
players) don't like it, but it's certainly not a disturbance to me.
I want them to keep screaming (`Get in the hole!').''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia cited the ``shot heard round the world'' in 1997,
when Tiger Woods made a hole in one at the 165-yard par 3, sending
the crowd into a state of hysteria, beer cups flying everywhere
like a large flock of startled birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty cool thing,'' he said. ``You kind of hate to
see the possibility of that being taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill also made a hole in one at the 16th in 1993, but not
to quite the same histrionics. Gill's ace came in the
pre-tournament Silver Pro-Am and won a Valley woman a new house in
Salt River Project's ``Home-In-One'' promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But Artigue argued that the Phoenix Open really had no choice,
as the atmosphere has gotten more raucous each year. He cited the
decision last year by tournament chairman Tim Grant, who cut off
beer sales at the 16th in the early afternoon of the final two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly the college element,'' he said. ``That's what
we're trying to tone down. In the past, we've had a few arrests
(for disorderly conduct and intoxication), but it really hasn't
been an enforcement problem as much as just a nuisance to some of
the players and fans who are focusing more on the tournament than
having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue added that the decision to try to stop air traffic over
the course during the tournament is not yet a done deal. In the
past, various news helicopters, hot-air ballons and airplanes
toting advertising banners have crowded the sky, adding to the
circuslike atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with the (Federal Aviation Administration) to
try and create a `no-fly zone,' '' he said. ``I guess it sounds
like the Iraqi situation, but it is a distraction when someone is
trying to putt out and there's a helicopter hovering overhead or a
hot-air ballon gets a blast of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though some of those blasts from the past apparently are on
their way out, Calcavecchia said he doubts it will have a major
effect on the tour's most well-attended event, which last year
attracted nearly 500,000 fans. &QL;

ASU CRUSHES SAN JOSE ST., LEARNS COMBS HAS FRACTURES 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 ASU 83, SAN JOSE STATE 46 
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing that happened after tip-off Wednesday night at Wells
Fargo Arena came close to the importance of the hours before
Arizona State beat San Jose State in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   With arguably its best player, Theresa Jantzen, yet to play
because of a fractured left foot, ASU learned that its other prize
freshman post player, Leah Combs, is out with stress fractures in
both legs.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, who has been playing through pain in her left shin since
the beginning of the season, will undergo a magnetic resonance
imaging today and remains hopeful of being able to play in the
Pac-10 opener against Southern California (4-5) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in God's hands,'' said Combs, who was more calm than
she expected upon getting the results of a bone scan five hours
before tip-off after hearing a talk by Oklahoma Congressman J.C.
Watts at the Fiesta Bowl Fellowship of Christian Athletes
Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become sort of immune to the feeling. It's something I
could push through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But pain increased during the Christmas break, resulting first
in an X-ray that was negative then the bone scan and now the MRI.
</P>
<P>
   Even the return of senior forward Kisha White, who started 20
games last season, Saturday does little to soften the stunning news
about the 6-foot-2 Combs.
</P>
<P>
   Beating San Jose (2-10), the 11th lowest rated team in Division
I according to the Rating Percentage Index, without Combs is no
great shakes. The Devils (6-3) ran off 16 of the first 20 points
and avenged the worst loss (62-57 in 1996) of the three-year Coach
Charli Turner Thorne era, 83-46.
</P>
<P>
   Winning in the Pac-10 without Combs, who already has four
double-doubles, is the conference's fourth-leading rebounder (9.5
average) and averages 10 points, is an entirely different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to be patient,'' said Turner Thorne, who is eight
months' pregnant and who kidded about the Combs news causing a
contraction or two. ``Obviously, we wanted to be fully healthy for
the Pac-10. If we have two of three (Combs, Jantzen, White), I'll
be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Jantzen X-ray shows her foot to have healed, although
she still is experiencing pain. The 6-3 forward could dress for the
USC game although still is doubtful to play.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot White, who averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds last
season, missed the first semester plus three games due to academic
ineligibility and a suspension for exceeding earned income by a
scholarship athlete. She is in better shape and should help in
rebounding, which Turner Thorne cites as an area in need of
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ASU got better guard play than in last game, a 78-61 loss to UC
Santa Barbara on Dec. 21. The Devils also had help off the bench
from Georgie Lang, who tied her career high with 11 points, all in
the first half, Ebony Edwards and Aubrey McFadyen.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 start equals ASU's best since 1994-95. &QL;

SMITH REMAINS FURIOUS OVER DRAKE PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith is still livid over the way
Monday's game with the Los Angeles Kings ended, specifically how
Dallas Drake was mugged after his boarding major on Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   Drake was immediately confronted physically by at least three
Kings players, including Ray Ferraro, Luc Robitaille and Sean
O'Donnell. Drake, who was suspended by the league Tuesday for four
games, got it the worst from O'Donnell, who wasn't penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said referee Mick McGeough failed to control the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ref's not going to deliver justice out there, then
those kind of things are going to happen,'' Smith said. ``What
O'Donnell was allowed to do was a joke. He circled the pack waiting
to get his shots in on Drake, and then he scratched up his eye on
top of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the refs aren't going to control this sort of thing, then
we're going to have to change the complexion of our team and deal
with it ourselves. Look, we've got guys in our organization . . .
We can deliver that kind of justice on the ice ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes will play the Kings two more times at home, on Feb.
10 and March 21. &QL;  &QL; 
Wayne's words &QL;  &QL; 
New York Rangers center Wayne Gretzky, who may have played his last
game in the Valley on Wednesday, has taken notice of the Coyotes'
hot start.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, you've got to have leadership and they've
got that with (Jeremy) Roenick, (Rick) Tocchet and (Keith) Tkachuk,
who are all solid,'' Gretzky said. ``Then you've got to have a
system, and obviously, the system they've implemented, everybody
seems to be following. I don't think you can play in this league if
you don't have mobile defensemen, and they've got that. Jyrki Lumme
was a good pickup for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on top of all that, you can't win in this league without
good goaltending, and they're getting great goaltending each and
every night.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Slap shots &QL;  &QL; 
Coyotes goalie Jimmy Waite remembers his first game against
Gretzky. It was during his rookie season, when he played for the
Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 19, and I actually stopped him on a breakaway,'' Waite
said. ``It wasn't the best move of his career, though. The puck
kind of bounced on him, and I was able to poke it away. But hey,
I'll never forget that play.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll never guess which NHL team Gretzky has scored the most
points against during his career. That's right, the
Coyotes/Winnipeg Jets. After Wednesday's game, he has 79 goals, 151
assists and 230 points against the franchise in 105 career games. &QL;  &QL;

PRESERVE A KEEPER  
 HUNTING, SCENERY WORTH TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT _ It is one of the most beautiful ranches you'll ever
see _ this bit of paradise in the Williamson Valley 20 miles
northwest of Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   At 4,700 feet in elevation, this huge expanse of rolling hills
and upper desert grasslands is surrounded in the distance by
plateaus and lower elevation mountains.
</P>
<P>
   This is Long Meadow Ranch, which became a working cattle ranch
in 1872. Jim Puntenney, a retired dentist, now runs the ranch. His
grandfather purchased it in 1960. His father then ran it until Jim
Puntenney took over. He is part owner.
</P>
<P>
   By Arizona standards, these are big-time private holdings. In
most of the state, settlers laid claim to small acreages around
water sources, then leased federal land around them.
</P>
<P>
   This ranch has 4,800 acres of deeded land plus 640 sections of
grazing rights on Prescott National Forest. The private holdings
have been reduced from 7,000 acres when part of the ranch was
subdivided into 40-acre parcels for those who wanted to build homes
in this beautiful area.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch has another blessing _ water. The water table is high
on parts of the ranch, creating small ponds at water level. In
other words, no dams are needed to collect water.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some areas, you can sink a (fence) post hole, and the next
day it will be full of water,'' Puntenney said. The ground water
supply is so good that Puntenney harvests 10,000 bales of hay a
year. That's enough for him to sustain his considerable cattle
operation plus sell off high-quality hay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1918, a kit house, produced in sections, was sent to Prescott
and brought to the ranch. It still stands. It recently was painted
bright yellow and has tongue-and-groove oak floors with fantastic
grains and woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   There are other buildings on the ranch, of course, including
Puntenney's parents' place, which they no longer occupy, and a
couple of other places for guests.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another business here.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a cattle rancher, you're always always looking
for something else that will make some money,'' Puntenney said. ``I
started this hobby that grew into a business.''
</P>
<P>
   That hobby was a hunting preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Puntenney began his hobby in 1993 and it went through 1996.
There was a problem. Kent Henry's Arizona Hunt Club near Cordes
Junction was much closer to Phoenix. It, too, was classy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Puntenney thought he was whipped. Henry was getting the
big corporate accounts. Puntenney said he put out only about 1,000
birds.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Henry lost the club when the land he used was
sold for development. With the demise of the Arizona Hunt Club,
Puntenney is up and running full bore.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bob Henson's Pheasant Recreation near La Palma, Puntenney
offers pheasant and chukar hunting on his grasslands rather than
Henson's croplands. His birds are excellent. The pheasants have
full tails, and the chukars are lively. The facilities are
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, you pay for the number of birds his staff
puts out. Then you pass through the grasslands, trying to shoot as
many as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go bankrupt if hunters paid for the number of birds they
shot,'' Puntenney said. That means he has some bad shooters and
loses most of the leftovers to coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Some preserves require membership, which demands a fee that
allows so many birds to be placed in the field. Puntenney is not
selling memberships. He charges by the number of birds placed in
the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it costs $130 to put out four pheasants. Six
chukars cost another $100. If you have your own dogs, that's fine.
If you want a guide and his dogs, that's another $35 for the first
gun and $10 each for additional guns.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stay there, two cabins are available. Both have
kitchens and bathrooms. Both rent for $100 a night and sleep five
or more.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Because of the water table, the ranch offers
terrific waterfowl hunting, complete with blinds and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   That cost is $250 per gun for a guided trip. But Puntenney has a
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Long Meadow Preserve also has a sporting clays course and a tent
city for those who want to use it. Those who shoot there also can
take advantage of a waterway that offers excellent Gambel quail
shooting. These are wild birds. &QL;

WARRICK NOT TO BE IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
  ST-WARRICK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Warrick was upset, and he wore the mood like the No. 9 on
his back. The player Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden calls the
most elusive Seminoles receiver ever was finding out how elusive a
football can be when handled by a young, inexperienced quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating not to get the ball, but I can't go out there
and show I'm frustrated that I'm not getting the ball,'' Warrick
said after he caught one pass for 10 yards from Marcus Outzen in a
24-7 victory over Wake Forest on Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first start for Outzen, a sophomore replacing the
injured Chris Weinke. Outzen played OK against a pretty bad
defense. But the big test was the following week, the annual
bloodletting against Florida. The Seminoles needed a big game from
Warrick, but the question was not only whether Outzen could find
him, but whether he could deliver the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the answer: Warrick had eight catches for 119 yards and a
touchdown. A former high school quarterback, he also threw a
46-yard touchdown pass off a reverse to Ron Dugans. Florida State
won, 23-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the competition, the bigger plays I have to make,''
Warrick said. ``I feel I have to step up to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick has 61 catches for 1,232 yards _ a 20.2 average _ and 12
touchdowns. He's rushed 13 times for 85 yards and a touchdown, and
averaged nearly 14 yards on 15 punt returns. He is a first-team
All-American and was one of three finalists for the Biletnikoff
Award, the top prize for receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like he might be the most dangerous receiver in
the country,'' Bowden said. ``He might be the hardest to tackle
that there is. You just don't hardly get him one on one. A sideline
and another man is what you need to tackle him.''
</P>
<P>
   When they're not breaking in a new quarterback, coaches plot,
plan and figure how to get Warrick, a 6-foot, 190-pound junior from
Bradenton, Fla., involved in the offense as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into the game without planning to get him the ball,
he might not touch it enough,'' offensive coordinator Mark Richt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, you can just call your normal game plan and
he'll get enough touches. But you can't leave that up to chance.
That happened in the Wake Forest game. I didn't do a good job of
making sure he got the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, whose 136 receptions and 2,583 yards in three seasons
both rank fourth in school history, came to Florida State with the
requisite glittering prep credentials and was a star almost from
the start. His first two years were terrific. But he still had a
to-do list this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, I needed to improve my
consistency,'' he said. ``I feel like I came a long way. I matured
a lot. Right now, I feel like I'm at the top of my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick became acquainted with Minnesota Vikings rookie Randy
Moss during Moss' brief stay at Florida State a few years ago, and
he shares Moss' confidence that borders on cockiness. Asked whether
he's as good as Moss, Warrick responded, ``No doubt.'' Then,
however, he showed a spark of humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not 6-5 or nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick said Moss gave him his beeper number, but he lost it. So
perhaps the two can get reacquainted next year in the NFL. Warrick
has another year of college eligibility remaining, but he also has
a baby daughter, A'Lyric, and he takes parenthood seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to weigh my options,'' he said. ``I have to make
sure I make the right decision because it's an important time in my
life. . . . I still have my job to do here, but my family is
first.'' &QL;

RECEIVER HAS FEW PEERS  
 TENNESSEE'S PRICE  STANDS OUT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   At first, it wasn't easy being Peerless Price. Growing up in
Dayton, Ohio, his friends were usually relentless with him because
of his one-of-a-kind name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all said it was a stupid name,'' said Price, who often
agreed in those days. ``They constantly asked me why I thought I
had no peers. I didn't understand it back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Price, the latest in a stream of outstanding wide receivers
at Tennessee, started playing sports in high school. Suddenly, it
was very cool to be named Peerless, especially in newspaper
clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to realize it was a great name,'' he said. ``It
helped me stand out from the crowd. It's not like my name is Sean
or Mike, like so many other people. I really like it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Price's mother, Vinder Burress, wanted her son's name to be
unique. She started scouring through a dictionary, searching for
just the right name.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she came across the winner. The ``Merriam-Webster
Dictionary'' defines Peerless as ``Having no equal. Matchless.
Supreme, superlative, incomparable.''
</P>
<P>
   Price joins the exclusive company of previous Tennessee
receivers Willie Gault, Tim McGee, Carl Pickens, Alvin Harper,
Anthony Miller, Stanley Morgan and last year's sensation, Marcus
Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wanted to be a part of the tradition they have
here with wide receivers,'' said Price, whose 147 catches, 2,298
yards and 19 touchdowns all rank third in Tennessee history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself in high school that if Tennessee recruited me,
that's where I'd go. To be mentioned in the same breath with those
guys is incredible, more than I ever could have expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his name might indicate, Price has not been without
peers. He was a second-team All-Southeast Conference selection.
Florida State All-American wide receiver Peter Warrick is
considered the best receiver in the nation and may very well pass
up his final season with the Seminoles to apply for the NFL draft.
But it's not like Price, a senior, will slip out of contention for
NFL status.
</P>
<P>
   Price is expected to be selected sometime late in the first
round, which would make him the ninth Volunteers receiver to be
selected in the opening round, where Nash was taken by Denver
before this season, since Morgan became the first in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Price, like so many Tennessee receivers, also runs for the track
team, a point that seems to attract great receivers to Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't stop them from running track,'' Tennessee Coach
Phillip Fulmer said. ``A fast guy is a fast guy in the spring or in
the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Price will put his talents on display for the final time in a
Tennessee uniform Monday night. If he outperforms Warrick, it could
be the deciding factor in the game that will determine the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think I'm better than anyone else on the field,''
Price said. ``I just want to show the world I'm just as good as any
other wide receiver.'' &QL;

VOLS COACHES DON'T DWELL ON MANNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although his college football career ended a year ago, in many
ways, Tennessee remains Peyton's place.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volunteers quarterback Tee Martin is good friends with
predecessor Peyton Manning, he said Tennessee's staff made it a
point this season not to mention the former standout's name around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never comes up,'' Martin said. ``I know it's a conscious
effort on everyone's part around here not to do it, and especially
early on, I never heard it. I think it was their way of trying to
keep the pressure off me, and I'm grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns about Manning's departure was the
loss of leadership. Defensive coordinator John Chavis said some
players took the concern personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the respect in the world for Peyton Manning,''
Chavis said. ``He's a great football player and a great young man.
But certainly, I think there were some players who felt like they
had some things they needed to prove.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Money talk &QL; 
 &QL; 
Although the Volunteers will receive about $3.8 million from the
Fiesta Bowl after revenue is shared among Southeastern Conference
schools, they expect to have a net profit of $850,000 after
expenses. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freshman receiver Jermaine Kent was sent back to Knoxville for
``disciplinary reasons,'' Tennessee Coach Phil Fulmer said.
Although Fulmer didn't elaborate, he did say Kent is still on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Among those visiting practice Wednesday was Arizona State Coach
Bruce Snyder. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Autograph seeking &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida State sophomore quarterback Marcus Outzen said he went
home during the Christmas break and dug up a 1990 Fiesta Bowl hat
that he had autographed that year by Coach Bobby Bowden. Outzen was
12 then and a huge Seminoles fan who saw Bowden as a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing about him is what you see is what you get,''
Outzen said. ``He's a friendly guy, he's personable. That's how he
is with the team. That's how he is with strangers, the fans. That's
how he is with everybody. That's an unbelievable quality to have in
the position he's in, with people bugging him all the time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smash 'em &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida State offensive guard Jason Whitaker said he welcomes
Tennessee stacking up at the line to try to stop the run early.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come out and smash them in the mouth and let them
know you're here,'' Whitaker said. ``It doesn't matter how many
people they stack in the box. You have to keep pounding them. If
it's three yards and a cloud of dust all night long, we'll take
it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Streaking &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is looking not only for its second national title
in the '90s, but for a chance to keep a streak alive. A victory
over Tennessee will assure that the Seminoles finish no lower than
fourth in the final Associated Press poll for the 12th straight
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't want to be the group that ends that record,''
offensive coordinator Mark Richt said. ``That streak means a lot to
this program. There are a lot of guys over the last 12 years
watching and hoping that streak continues.'' &QL;

SMITH GIVES WILDCATS BITE IN 2ND HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Arizona may have two quarterbacks, but there was
only one Offensive Player of the Game Wednesday night in Arizona's
23-20 Holiday Bowl victory over the Nebraska Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Keith Smith was determined to share the award with Ortege
Jenkins, just as the two shared the Wildcats' most visible position
through an improbable season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a saw, and I'm going to cut this right down the
middle,'' Smith said as he held up his trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no doubt about whom it belonged to.
</P>
<P>
   Smith completed 11 of 19 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown.
He engineered two second-half touchdown drives, including the game
winner that running back Kelvin Eafon capped by diving 1 yard with
6:08 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran for 35 yards in the 68-yard drive, including a 20-yard
scramble that jump-started the march. He was clobbered on the play,
and Jenkins came in to take one snap.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Smith's team.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, following his usual plan, brought
Jenkins off the bench in the second quarter with the Wildcats
holding a 9-0 lead. Smith had played well but not spectacularly,
and Arizona had come away with only three field goals from three
chances inside the Nebraska 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenkins fumbled when he was hit in the backfield, leading to
Nebraska's first points of the game, Kris Brown's 25-yard field
goal with 4:58 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska scored 10 more points before the break. And the
Wildcats, with receiver Jeremy McDaniel out with a hip injury,
appeared to have run out of ways to move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't taking advantage of our quick passing game,'' Smith
said. ``We came out right away in the second half and took
advantage of (wide receiver) Dennis Northcutt. Their defensive ends
were coming really hard and putting pressure on, so we had to get
Northcutt involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Arizona's offensive line took charge, and running back
Trung Canidate began to find running room. Smith moved the ball
with his feet as well as his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a running quarterback, but our receivers are
so talented, we have to get them the ball,'' Smith said. ``I try to
stay patient in the pocket and make things work, but if there's an
opening there, like in the fourth quarter, I'm going to take it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Cornhuskers playing man-to-man defense, Smith waited
for Nebraska's linebackers to commit, and he was off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating because we kept getting into the red zone
in the first half, and we couldn't get the ball into the end
zone,'' Smith said. ``We kept coming away with three points. I was
just trying to find a way to get it in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Wildcats knew they had to come away with a
touchdown on the decisive drive after Nebraska took a 20-16 with
10:55 to play.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, nobody was happier than Jenkins, who was in
tears as he hugged Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great year, and this quarterback tandem did a
tremendous job,'' Jenkins said. ``There's no reason we can't make
it work again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to argue with the results _ a 12-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were saying that this couldn't work,'' Smith
said. ``If we had two quarterbacks bickering at each other, a
season like this can't happen.'' &QL;

VICTORY ON A DIFFICULT NIGHT VALIDATES CATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Nothing shines like resiliency, the polish of effort
that won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   And this was watercolor to masterpiece, mush to Michaelangelo,
Crayon to the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona never looked worse. Never looked so incompetent. Never
looked so much like a cat in a rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   And somehow, when the gun sounded, the Wildcats never looked
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to finish in the top five,'' Arizona Coach Dick
Tomey crowed. ``This is a great football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Destiny may have been Ortege Jenkins spinning in air and landing
in the end zone. But this was all about desire. A team that sailed
on the winds of skill needing to prevail on heart. A team that had
to rise above a mountain of self-induced misery. On what could've
been the biggest night in the history of the program.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Wildcats threw water coolers in the air
while Nebraska sulked off the field. They danced like fools,
soaking in the triumph. Jenkins cried like a blubbering baby. Then
Kelvin Eafon grabbed a microphone and led a wobbly chorus of the
school fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this was a much-needed jolt of respect for the
Pac-10. A victory that will leap out of the record books because of
their opponent, which, no matter the current plight, still is the
most storied team in the land. The kind that might take the program
and its recruiting to another level.
</P>
<P>
   A victory that proves Arizona is the best team in college
football not invited to the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with a minimum amount of competence, this would've
been a blowout. Twice, an Arizona touchdown was nullified by
penalty. Another time, a wonderful opportunity _ four downs, ball
on the 2 _ was disrupted by unsportsmanlike conduct. Three times in
the first half, Arizona had the ball inside the 10-yard line. And
produced nine points.
</P>
<P>
   One of the silliest aspects of college football is the canyon of
time separating the seasons. The continuity of November is gone by
Christmas. Neither of these teams had played in more than a month,
and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Penalty flags flying. Footballs that must've been coated with
petroleum jelly. Enough recovered fumbles to set a Holiday Bowl
record. Play-calling from Tomey and staff that was abominable.
</P>
<P>
   When Wilma the Wildcat, one of the team mascots, fell 20 feet
into the water Monday, cracking her head on the iron cleat of a
Navy vessel, the karma felt bad. When a pre-game sky diver toting
an Arizona flag fell on his backside attempting to land, you knew
there was trouble. But nothing so ominous as a four-point deficit
at halftime when there should've been a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then it all changed. Tomey wisely abandoned his platoon system
in the second half, and Keith Smith produced successive touchdown
drives in the fourth quarter. Eafon picked up a huge fourth-down
conversion, Brad Brennan plucked a clutch touchdown out of the air.
And the brilliant Chris McAlister, who fumbled an interception that
could've locked it up, atoned with an acrobatic pick in the waning
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Out of sure wreckage comes a win for the ages. They hit an
iceberg and found a way to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had been one of the most dynamic, entertaining teams to
grace college football in 1998. Jenkins' heroics against
Washington. Tomey's wife authoring a book called ``Balls.'' On the
same day that Ricky Williams rushed for 259 yards to set a new NCAA
record, Trung Canidate did one better, dropping 288 on the Sun
Devils. And the only thing separating Arizona from the BCS was a
fourth quarter against UCLA when the Bruins scored three touchdowns
on three successive plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats were unselfish to a fault. Jenkins, who
orchestrated a victory over ASU last year, one that might've saved
Tomey's job, had no dilemma splitting time with Smith. Canidate
shared the backfield with Eafon. A team content to be a team.
</P>
<P>
   A loss wouldn't have been right, not with the Fiesta Bowl in
town and the Cardinals going to the playoffs. Not when it would've
blown Arizona's shot at immortality.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Arizona simply wouldn't lose. Or let us forget. &QL;

BRUINS HALT THREE-GAME SKID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ The Bruins needed a much better start. Got that.
</P>
<P>
   They needed something out of their top scoring line. Got that.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to reaffirm their commitment to defense. Did that.
</P>
<P>
   And it wouldn't hurt if they got a good bounce or two. Got
those, too.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a 5-2 win over the Nashville Predators in the
Bruins' first visit to Nashville Arena _ there's just something
funny about starting a hockey game to the strains of ``Rocky Top''
_ Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That the Bruins had a 4-0 lead entering the final period and
things got away from them a bit took some of the satisfaction out
of the evening. But bottom line, a win is a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a lead and to hold it,'' said goalie Rob Tallas. ``It's
something to build off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas and the defense shut down the Predators through two
periods and held on in the third. He finished with 27 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made their three-game losing streak history and
avoided their first four-game skid in more than a year, all the
more important given Thursday night's clash with the high-flying,
sharp-shooting Stars in the finale of what had been a rough road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns took his best
it's-a-long-season-and-let's-not-get-too-wound-up-yet approach to
the team's recent misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the end of the world,'' Burns said before the game.
``Every team has its bad sequences and we're probably on a bad one
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took care of that, for the moment, and now take on
the Stars, who are 9-0-3 in their last dozen games. They did it by
ending the first period up, 1-0, on a goal by Steve Heinze, who
also had two assists. They had trailed 1-0, 2-0, and 3-0 after a
period in the consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with two goals from Anson Carter, Heinze's linemate.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with a goal from Sergei Samsonov, who had been
scoreless in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   They did it, from the start, with defense. They were outshot,
18-8, in the first period of Monday night's 5-1 loss to the
Capitals. Wednesday night, they turned the tables and outshot the
Predators, 17-8, in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much jump in the first period, they didn't have a
chance,'' Tallas said. ``They really didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins did it with bounces. The most fortuitous came on
Carter's first goal, 61 seconds after Samsonov's, and pushed the
lead to 3-0 just 5:43 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Carter stole the puck as a Predator tried to break out of the
Nashville zone. Carter went in deep and tried to center a pass.
Defenseman Jan Vopat, diving into the play, deflected the puck over
goalie Tomas Vokoun and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ferraro upped the lead to 4-0 at 8:35. He took a pass off
the boards from Joe Thornton, skated down the right side, and
blasted a shot over Vokoun's stick.
</P>
<P>
   That was all for the Nashville starter. Eric Fichaud came on in
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I let him suffer any more,'' said Predators coach
Barry Trotz. ``We weren't giving him any help.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 2-1 setback at home to Philadelphia Dec. 23, the Bruins
had lost, 4-2, to the Islanders and to the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   No time to panic. But time to try Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   And to try to get things going early.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league it's tough if you don't get the first goal,''
Burns said. ``It's tough to win a game. It's a pattern now in this
league. We came out hungry, too. We wanted that first goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinze, who had gone nine games without a goal, got it. Samsonov
piled on. And Carter. And Ferraro. Then Carter, who got his second
on the power play with 28 seconds left before Nashville's Greg
Johnson scored with two seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played with a lead for a while,'' said Don Sweeney.
``We think we've got things going in the right direction. But
you've got to play all 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   On to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a real good test,'' Sweeney said.

GAILEY REFLECTS ON FIRST SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey is still uneasy with celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   But you can bet that people who stare at him in grocery stores
do not make him more uncomfortable than watching his team play
uninspired football in New Orleans or Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   With an attention for detail and a creative mind for offense,
Gailey, 46, has steered this expectation-weary club to 10 wins, a
playoff berth, and the NFC East crown in his first season. In a
wild-card game against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday, the
Cowboys will be positioned to begin their chase of an unprecedented
sixth world championship.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the ``Star-Telegram'' last week, Gailey
talked about the success, the adversity and the celebrity of his
first season as head coach of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   On his relationship with his players, he said, ``I think it's
good people don't get to know you too well. I don't want to get so
close to somebody that I can't tell them when there's a problem and
we've got to get some things straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   On his relationship with the assistant coaches who were in place
before he was hired, he said, ``The first premise you have to work
on is, `Just because you don't know somebody doesn't mean they are
not a good coach.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And on his relationship with team owner Jerry Jones, Gailey
said, ``He's great. Jerry lets us do our jobs. He's involved. He
gets copies of the game plan. He sits in film review. He does what
every other general manager does. He loves the Cowboys. He wants to
win. He can't stand losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Gailey's thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``How have you handled the celebrity that goes with being head
coach of the Dallas Cowboys?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I don't handle that very well. The hardest part for me
is not when people walk up and talk and say, `Hi, coach Gailey, I'm
Bill from Plano. It's great to meet you,' or `Good job,' or `How
about winning.' What gets me is when they stand over in the corner
and point. And you catch them out of the corner of your eye, and
you know they are pointing at you. I'd rather somebody come over
and speak. \RWhen they stare\S I get my bread and go. I'm not used
to any kind of status or recognition factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You weren't on the job for six months when you had to deal
with the training-camp incident in the dorm room, where Everett
McIver's neck was cut. You were bombarded with questions every day
about it. Did you ever want to just break and tell what had
happened?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: First of all, I thought that was our business. There are
some things that are our business and some things that are public
business, and I have to draw the line. There have been other things
taken care of in other matters that no one knows of. That one got a
lot of attention. But no matter how hard or how much pressure was
applied, I didn't believe it was in the best interest of the team
to talk about it. Where I got a little upset is that it kept coming
up when I had already said we were going to handle it as a team. I
guess pretty soon I have to realize I can't let that bother me. You
just keep answering the questions and nodding your head. It was
frustrating answering the questions, not how we're handling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are a team whose egos are matched only by their
paychecks. Has your perception of players such as Troy Aikman,
Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders changed from the time
you took the head coaching job to now?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I assumed that every one of those guys were good guys
that were looking for the best way to help this football team and
get back to the championship. I didn't let any prior stories, or
murmurs, or anything have an influence on me. I assumed that these
guys were going to be good and look good, and I expected the best
from them. And they have proven to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Troy Aikman wanted to come back a few weeks early from a
fractured collarbone, you were the one that told him to wait until
the Nov. 2 Eagles game. How has your relationship with Troy Aikman
been?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: First, I talked to Troy and said \Rresting\S `is the
smartest thing to do. Let's \Rnot play\S.' And he agreed. If he
would have fought, we'd have discussed it further. But once he saw
where the injury was, how he was feeling, when he needed to come
back, I think we concurred.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to be a mutual decision, because what happens if it's
not a mutual decision is you get a little bit of a crack in the
relationship. And you don't want little cracks to become big cracks
because, when another issue comes up, that widens the crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be the same, even-keeled person in big wins and in
gut-wrenching losses?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I think when you are a leader, at the top, you are
supposed to create a sense of stability. I want the players to
know, that when things are going great, I'm going to be the one
that brings them back to earth, that reminds them where we are and
what we've go to get done. And when things are going tough, I want
to be the person that says, `Hey, we can still do this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team is playing badly, why don't you ever berate
someone or call out a player in public?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I don't believe in demeaning people, or in lashing out
in front of others and getting on a guy. If I've got something to
say to him, I'll bring him in here \Rhis office\S and say it to
him. I try not to publicly embarrass anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you take from the head coaches you were an assistant
under?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: \RFalcons coach\S Dan Reeves was very organized, very
matter-of-fact, very demanding about schedules and times. Everybody
was always headed in the same direction. That was a must. \RBroncos
coach\S Mike Shanahan was very innovative. He figured there were
different ways to do things, to take your people and stretch them
as far as they can be stretched, to put pressure on the defense.
\RSteelers coach\S Bill \RCowher\S lived on the edge. That's a
positive, not a negative. He was always like, `Just because it
hasn't been done doesn't mean we can't do it.' Five-wides, let's
try it. A lot of guys get conservative when they become the head
coach. Not him. He was always pushing the edge. After hanging
around him for a while, I realized, when you get a chance, don't go
conservative. That's not what got you there. Go for it. I
appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   You cried when Star-Telegram columnist Jim Reeves asked how you
felt after winning your first game, 38-10, against Arizona on Sept.
6. What moves you to emotions like that?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: Compassion moves me. Guys pulling together to do
something that people didn't think could be done, guys pushing
their egos aside to become a team player. My dad not having a
chance to be there at the first game. \RThinking\S about those
things grab you all at once. I don't show it unless it's brought
up. It gets you to a certain degree. After the \REagles\S game the
other day, I got close to that again, all the fighting, all the
tough times, all the adversity, the way the team responded to win
the division after some picked us to be third or fourth. To see how
they fought through a three-game losing streak to win was a great
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How has your relationship with Jerry Jones been?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: He's almost better in losing than in winning because
he's strong. When you are going through tough times, he comes in
here and sits in that chair and says, `Don't worry about it. We'll
get through it. We'll get it done.' Obviously, you are hurting as a
coach because you are not winning, or you've played bad. To have
somebody like Jerry, the owner, walk in and say, `Keep fighting,'
is a pretty big deal. And he's not saying, `You'll get it done.'
It's `we'll get it done.' Saying he's supportive does not give what
he does justice. It's much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you took the job as coach of the Cowboys, you
interviewed the staff that you'd inherit from the last coaching
regime. How have things gone?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I'm not vain enough to think that the only guys I know
are the only guys that can coach. After looking at how the defense,
special teams and offensive line had played \Rin 1997\S, and after
visiting with Dave Campo, Joe Avezzano and Hudson Houck, I had a
very good comfort level about where our relationship would be. I
had a great feel for where their goals were, for where my goals
were, how I'd approach things, and how they'd approach things. That
was a nonissue in taking over, and since then, it has become a very
good working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches and players say they don't know if you are joking or
if you are serious when you address them sometimes. How has that
come up in your relationship with the players?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey: I want to have as good a relationship as I can with all
the players without getting so close that they know exactly where
I'm coming from all the time and all of a sudden I become
vulnerable in this relationship. It's still a head coach-player
relationship. As much as I'd like for it to be otherwise, it still
takes on a head coach-player relationship and it's a business.
</P>
<P>
   Over a period of time that line moves and breaks down. But
initially I think everybody's got to know where I stand. Then that
line changes for each individual player. Some guys I'll have better
relationships with than others.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Win a championship, inherit a curse.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the glass-is-half-empty perspective of college
football historians, who understand the emotional baggage Texas A&AMP;M
will be carrying for frustrated fans in tomorrow's Sugar Bowl in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since a champion from the Big 12 South
Division or the former Southwest Conference won a traditional New
Year's Day game. A&AMP;M (11-2), ranked No. 8 in The Associated Press
poll, can end that streak by knocking off No. 3 Ohio State (10-1).
</P>
<P>
   The first step, said A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell, is to remember
a lesson learned during a season that saw the Aggies upend the two
highest-ranked opponents in school history after going nine years
without beating a Top 10 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God wanted you to look back, he'd have put eyes in the back
of your head,'' said Campbell, a senior from Glen Rose. ``What's
happened in the past is over. It doesn't affect today, so you've
got to look forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum drilled that message into his players'
heads before an Oct. 10 meeting with then-unbeaten Nebraska, a team
that routed A&AMP;M, 54-15, in the 1997 Big 12 title game. He warned
the Aggies about having too much respect for the Cornhuskers'
abilities, reminding them that ``lots of teams lose to the mystique
before they give themselves a chance'' to find out how they match
up physically.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies responded with a 28-21 upset of then-No. 2 Nebraska.
A&AMP;M topped that effort with a 36-33 upset of Kansas State, then the
top-ranked team in the coaches' poll, to win the 1998 Big 12 title.
Suddenly, a school that had gone 104 years without beating a team
ranked higher than fourth in either college football poll had
knocked off No. 2 and No. 1 within seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in past seasons heading into New Year's Day showdowns,
Slocum said these Aggies are confident, battle-tested in big games
and ``won't be in awe'' of the Buckeyes. That is why A&AMP;M players
adopt the glass-is-half-full approach, figuring an SWC expatriate
is long overdue to prevail on Jan. 1 and they simply find
themselves in the right place at the right time to end a decade of
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we're approaching this game. I know I'm ready to
get another win under my belt and end this thing right,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can beat good teams. We've done it,'' said A&AMP;M
tailback Dante Hall. ``There are no more self-doubts or questions.
The attitude has changed around here.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, A&AMP;M players left the field after a 29-23 loss to
UCLA in the Cotton Bowl willing to take solace in that they'd taken
the nation's fifth-ranked team to the wire. The days of
satisfaction with close calls against elite teams have ended in
Aggieland, however.
</P>
<P>
   Along with it, players and coaches hope to end the 10-year
drought on New Year's Day for former SWC schools. No team has
contributed more losses to that streak than A&AMP;M (four).
</P>
<P>
   Then again, A&AMP;M remains the last team from Texas to win on Jan.
1, when the Aggies knocked off Notre Dame, 35-10, in the 1988
Cotton Bowl. The way the Aggies see it, that makes them the most
appropriate choice to break the jinx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to win a big-time bowl,'' wide receiver Chris
Cole said. ``We've achieved some big goals this season. But that
would be the perfect finish. That would make this year really
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing can stop A&AMP;M, Campbell said. And it has nothing
to do with a fear of history or concern about extending some
unseemly trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't happen, it's just because they're a better team
than us,'' Campbell said. ``It would be sickening, because we've
had a heck of a year. And we don't want to end it with a loss.
After all we've accomplished this year, that's no way to go out.''
Decade of disappointments Texas A&AMP;M faces a unique challenge in its
Jan. 1 matchup against Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl. The Aggies
seek to end a 10-year drought in traditional New Year's Day bowls
by champions from the Big 12 South Division or the former Southwest
Conference. The list: YEAR LEAGUE BOWL RESULT 1999 Big 12 South

EVEN WITHOUT STARS, FSU DEFENSE TOUGHER THAN EVER
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida coach Steve Spurrier deals in honesty. His comments
sometimes rankle. But even when it comes to discussing Florida
State _ he likes to call them ``Semis'' instead of Seminoles _
Spurrier grits his teeth and speaks his mind. Honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clobbered us this year and last year we had about 500
yards against them,'' Florida coach Steve Spurrier said. ``If you
asked us, we'd say this year's defense is better than last
year's.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Florida State, with a defense that finished third
nationally, came within a victory over Spurrier's Gators of playing
for the national championship. And Spurrier's opinion is supported
by statistics.
</P>
<P>
   When the second-ranked Seminoles face top-ranked Tennessee in
Monday's Fiesta Bowl, they'll hit the field with a defense that
ranks No. 1 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Florida State benefitted from a strong pass
rush to shut down opposing offenses. But this season, the Seminoles
have had to rely on their secondary coverage. FSU has sacked the
quarterback ``only'' 40 times. The past two seasons, it had 64 and
67 sacks, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put the pressure on that we did a year ago, two years
ago,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``If you're going to
do that, the coverage better be better, and it has been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody said, `What's the biggest difference in your
defense this year and the year before ... I think it's that our
secondary is playing better. The biggest difference this year is
we're covering better.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Florida State's secondary was short in numbers and
experience. Cornerback Mario Edwards and safety Sean Key were
serving one-year suspensions in 1997. Their return has been a
boost.
</P>
<P>
   This Florida State defense has depth and speed, but not a lot of
brute force. Defensive coordinator Mickey Andrews keeps his players
fresh; 33 players have seen action on defense and 23 have played in
every game. Andrews' heavy player rotation has at times concerned
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I look out there and say, `Why in the world does he
have him in the game? This game's on the line and he's got the
third-string corner in there.' '' Bowden said. ``But they've got
them trained. They all can run and they're always fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers support that theory. Florida State has allowed just
45 points in the second half all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' defensive unit doesn't have stars. In recent
years, Florida State has had No. 1 draft picks like Andre
Wadsworth, Peter Boulware, Reinard Wilson, Derrick Alexander,
Derrick Brooks and Marvin Jones. But the 1998 Seminoles do it with
depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably can't say the defense right now has a
first-rounder, but if we were drafting defenses, I think you'd
draft Florida State's defense No. 1,'' Edwards said. ``Before the
season, Coach Andrews told us, `Guys, I think this is the best
secondary I've ever coached or had at Florida State.' Now we look
back 12 games into the season and we're the No. 1 secondary in the
country; the No. 1 defense in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1993 has Florida State had a defense that is this
oppressive and dominating. And it's not just a coincidence that the
Seminoles are in position to win a national championship. Which is
what that '93 team accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bunch has accomplished an awful lot,'' Andrews said. ``I
think they would be lying if they said they haven't exceeded
expectations. To accomplish what they've done and the schedule
they've played is pretty amazing, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense never rests Florida State's defense is first in passing
and total defense and second in rushing and scoring defense. A look
at how this Seminoles' defensive unit compares with other FSU
defenses this decade: Year Pts Yds/Rush Yds/Pass Yds/Gm TOs 1998 11

PLAYERS PUT TRUST IN BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can you pinpoint the moment Mack Brown turned the Texas football
program in the right direction, steered it back onto a road that
eventually led to the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl game against
Mississippi State?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the way he skillfully turned Ricky Williams' upcoming bid
for the Heisman Trophy into a unified goal, avoiding a potentially
divisive situation that could have elevated one player's importance
over that of the team?
</P>
<P>
   Was it after the potentially devastating losses to UCLA (49-31)
and Kansas State (48-7), when the Longhorns rallied behind a
redshirt freshman quarterback to run off a string of six
consecutive victories, including a plant-the-flag, 20-16 victory at
Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   Or, after that streak came to a shocking end in a wild 42-35
loss at Texas Tech that wiped out hope of playing in the Big 12
Championship game, when his team again made an abrupt about-face to
stun Texas A&AMP;M (26-24) six days later before the largest crowd ever
in Royal Memorial Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   All perhaps. Or none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of Mack's best moments as a coach came the first
time he met the squad,'' Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds said.
``I watched the kids' faces when he walked into the room and again
when he walked out. They bought into him very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior linebacker Dusty Renfro agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we lost to UCLA and Kansas State, coach Brown just kept
telling us that we were improving and that it was really tough to
play two of the best teams in the country right off the bat while
learning a new system and all,'' Renfro said. ``He told us just to
have a little perseverance and it would all work out _ and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed him then because we trusted him from the first
day. When he showed up in his cowboy boots and propped his foot up
on a chair and started talking _ we knew he was going to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dodds, ``When we hired him, I thought he was as good as
I'd ever seen. He's proven to be even better than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The personable Brown has not only turned a program, but united a
sometimes fractious group of alumni and fans grown rancorous during
six roller-coaster seasons under John Mackovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have one man come in and change this whole town around and
get everyone back into Texas football has been exciting to be a
part of,'' senior wide receiver Wane McGarity said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's first season at Texas has _ and hasn't _ exceeded his
own expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not have exceeded what I hoped coming in last
December,'' Brown said. ``But after I'd gone through spring
practice with the guys, I knew we weren't very good, were really
poor on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after the first three games, we still had not made the
progress on defense we felt like we needed to make. And, we were
inexperienced at quarterback. Richard Walton hadn't played much _
and then he gets hurt \Rfirst quarter, UCLA\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think considering all the circumstances of the year and
playing three of four top-10 teams on the road, it's been a super
year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as players have pointed to Brown's communication and
motivation skills and the way he immediately won their confidence,
he said one of his greatest concerns was how his new team would
respond to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we were concerned about back in the spring was that
all these kids had been recruited by another staff. So we didn't
know them and they didn't know us very well,'' Brown said. ``It's
very hard to build up a good level of communication under those
circumstances. And if you don't have communication, you don't have
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you go 1-2, the trust is broken down even worse and
people start questioning themselves. We were really afraid that
after the lack of confidence we'd shown at the end of the previous
year, we might go back to the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really good at explaining how things are,'' Renfro said.
``He really sees what's going on. He can tell what's going on just
by watching, talking to a few players here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really likes to get inside and find out what's going on.
And when he's done that, he'll confront us with it and say, `This
is what has happened. And this is what we need to do to fix it.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity said that Brown has also been good about heading off a
problem before it becomes one.

   ``He realized that there could be a problem with us playing
top-10 teams back-to-back early,'' McGarity recalled. ``So he let
us know beforehand that win or lose, we had to realize we had the
whole season to play. So that's how we played it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he also realized that if we're not having any fun, we're
not going to win any ballgames. He's a great motivator. He feeds
off us. And we feed off him. I don't know if this season would have
been any different if coach Brown wasn't here. It's hard to say.
But I do know he made a big difference.''

VOLS WORKED THEMSELVES INTO A TITLE FRENZY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tracing the origin of Tennessee's football success this season
leads in two directions.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Volunteers got a taste of championship champagne in
1997 when they won the Southeastern Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   Second, after playing a slapped-around supporting role to
Nebraska's national championship in the Orange Bowl, the Volunteers
realized that neither their effort nor their work ethic was title
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play very well against Nebraska, and they just beat
the dog out of us and we just took our beating,'' junior center
Spencer Riley said. ``We used that as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, a year after losing all-everything quarterback Peyton
Manning, is 12-0, top-ranked and playing for the national
championship. The Volunteers need a victory over Florida State in
Monday's Fiesta Bowl for the school's first national title since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``They forgot to tell the players they weren't supposed to be
this good,'' Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``This team has
exceeded everybody's expectations. There were a lot of ifs about
this team. We had to replace Peyton, get our defensive line
healthy, replace three people in our secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their determination has been special. We said we didn't have
to be the best team in the country. We just have to be the best
team on the Saturdays that we play. Hopefully, we'll continue on
the Monday we play.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manning's four seasons, Tennessee won 40 of 49 games. But the
Volunteers' only championship came last year when they won the SEC.
That earned them a spot in the Orange Bowl against Nebraska.
Tennessee didn't put up much of a fight, losing 42-17.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Manning plus NFL draft picks Leonard Little,
Jonathan Brown, Terry Fair and Marcus Nash (all chosen in the first
three rounds), few people expected Tennessee to improve on last
season. The Volunteers, though, had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were kinda shocked about playing in a game like
the SEC championship game, the Orange Bowl,'' said junior
quarterback Tee Martin, who has been more than adequate replacing
Manning. ``We came out and didn't play very well in the SEC game.
Even though we won, it was kind of a negative, and we took that
feeling into the Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found out is what we had to do to get to the level of
the Nebraskas and the Michigans. We took that into spring practice
and the summer workouts. We had a different feeling coming into
this season. We knew what we wanted and we knew how to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of winning a national championship became a mantra as
the Volunteers spent the summer working in Knoxville. Nearly all of
the top players attended summer school and worked out. A three-hour
morning session included running, weight lifting and agility
drills. In the evening, it was seven-on-seven passing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody said we would have won another SEC championship
and be playing for a national championship, you'd say he was
crazy,'' senior linebacker Steve Johnson said. ``During the summer,
we made a commitment to each other to practice and work every day
to get better. We came together and jelled during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times got tough during the season, we'd look at each
other and challenged each other. We had spent all this time and
effort to get better. That's why we came to Tennessee, was to play
for championships.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during these summer sweat sessions that Tennessee's 1998
personality became genetic code. This would be a team with a
blue-collar work ethic, a team that would prove that it didn't need
stars to succeed. The Volunteers also developed a resiliency that
has bolstered them through adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were probably the only people who thought we had a chance
of running the table,'' senior wide receiver Peerless Price said.
``We hadn't been this close in the past years. It all came together
because the guys worked hard together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the season opener, Martin drove the team from its
18-yard-line in the final 2:27 to set up a game-winning field goal.
In the next game, Tennessee finally got a meaningful victory over
hated rival Florida, a 20-17 overtime triumph in Knoxville. And,
after leading rusher Jamal Lewis was lost for the season with a
knee injury after Game 4, the Volunteers shrugged their shoulders
and got on with playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of good teams have more than one way to win,'' Fulmer
said. ``But when you lose an impact player, there aren't a lot of
teams with the resiliency and the ability to overcome that kind of
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' success also can be explained using a standard
from another sport. Often in college basketball, a team makes a
championship run after losing a star player. Examples: Virginia in
1984 and Utah in 1998 each reached the Final Four after losing
All-Americans (Ralph Sampson and Keith Van Horn, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some guys who have developed into stars, guys who
could play in the NFL,'' Fulmer said. ``But we don't have a lot of
players who are nationally known. That's the approach we took and
the kids bought into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, the players were fighting for self-respect
and respect for the football team. It's caught on. I'm grateful to
the seniors and the captains for the way they went about their
business and how they hammered that point home.''
The replacement Volunteers Tennessee did not let the loss of
several significant players prevent it from going 12-0 and playing
in Monday's Fiesta Bowl national championship game. A look at the

KINGS BEAT SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When the Kings defeated the Coyotes in
Phoenix on Monday night, it seemed valid to wonder just how
significant the victory had been.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Kings respond in their next game with another solid
effort and another victory?
</P>
<P>
   Or would the Phoenix victory merely be a positive blip in a
season of negatives?
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks before an announced
crowd of 10,918 at the Forum on Wednesday night, the Kings provided
an affirmative answer to the first question, and avoided having one
night's blip become another night's bleep.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got goals from Matt Johnson (yes, Matt Johnson), Ray
Ferraro, Yanic Perreault (on a power play), Glen Murray
(shorthanded) and Olli Jokinen. Murray's goal capped an evening of
outstanding penalty killing, and Jamie Storr made 31 saves as the
Kings (12-21-3) won for the fourth time in their last five games,
and for only the fifth time this season at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Stern scored the only goal for the Sharks (10-16-8), as the
Kings held an opponent to two goals or fewer for the fifth
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite how dismal the season has been for the Kings, their
brief hot streak suddenly has them back in the playoff hunt, which
says a thing or two about the mediocre state of the nether reaches
of the NHL's 13-team Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's victory moved the Kings into an 11th-place tie with
Calgary, and within one point of 10th-place San Jose, two points of
ninth-place Nashville and three points of eighth-place Vancouver,
the current occupant of the Western Conference's final playoff
position.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 2:28 for the Kings to get on the scoreboard, with
Johnson scoring his second goal this season, matching his career
high. The 6-foot-5 Johnson parked himself in front of San Jose
goalie Mike Vernon, warded off the efforts of 6-2 Sharks defenseman
Bob Rouse, and redirected a cross-ice pass from Ian Laperriere to
give the Kings the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before another three minutes elapsed, however, Sean O'Donnell
and Laperriere took penalties 28 seconds apart, leaving the Kings
two men short for 1:32. But aside from a Joe Murphy shot that hit
the post, the Sharks did not threaten, and late in the period,
Ferraro padded the Kings' lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake carried the puck into San Jose's zone and passed it to
Donald Audette in front. Audette fed the puck back to Ferraro in
the slot, and Ferraro's shot off the pass sailed past Vernon for
his fourth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks drew to within a goal 7:43 into the second period,
when the Kings paid for allowing a rare outnumbered rush. Storr
stopped two shots by Mike Ricci, but could do nothing about the
third shot, by Stern.
</P>
<P>
   But at 13:05, the Sharks' Patrick Marleau took a tripping
penalty, and the Kings _ unlike so many other times this season _
capitalized on the power-play opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   They got lucky, too. Audette, at the left point, attempted to
pass the puck down low to Perreault, who was standing to Vernon's
right. But Audette's pass deflected off the skate of a San Jose
defenseman and onto the stick of Blake, who quickly passed the puck
to Audette's intended recipient. Vernon had no chance to get across
the crease to make the save, and Perreault fired the puck into a
virtually empty net.
</P>
<P>
   Murray sealed the victory midway through the third period with
his 15th goal, slipping the puck between Vernon's pads on a
breakaway, with Sharks defenseman Jeff Norton in vain pursuit.
Jokinen added his fifth goal three minutes later, his first point
in more than a month.

USC'S CLAIBORNE SET TO MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE FOR NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ USC junior linebacker Chris Claiborne said Wednesday
that he will select an agent ``soon,'' his first public
acknowledgment that he intends to make himself available for the
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said he will hold a press conference Monday at USC to
make his official announcement, which means today's game against
Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl will be his last as a Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to pick an agent soon,'' Claiborne said, ``so
I can get to work and not be distracted. That's my main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said he should have an agent selected within two
weeks, and would like to avoid being represented by any large
agency or big-time representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have one that's hands-on. I think it's a conflict
of interest when you go with somebody really big. Whose contract
are you going to do the best?'' Claiborne said. ``There's other
things I have to decide, like a money manager. The agent's job is
to get the contract. I'm not going to let one person do everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm prepared for it. I have to find the best team of
people around me. Not only people who I respect but will reflect me
in the public. That people will say, `He's got a nice family. He's
a nice young man.' I don't want people to think, `Oh, I've got to
deal with this jerk.'''
</P>
<P>
   The intricate nature of Claiborne's comments demonstrates how
much thought he has put into turning pro. Claiborne said he will
also begin doing his homework on NFL teams to have some background
of each franchise that is interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will study them,'' Claiborne said. ``All the way back to
1945. They will be blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne had been steadfast in keeping his intentions secret,
prior to Wednesday's frank comments following USC's final practice
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   During a post-practice performance by the USC band in the Sun
Bowl, Claiborne directed it through its rendition of the school
fight song. As he ascended the ladder to lead the band, members
chanted ``one more year, one more year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments apparently fell on deaf ears. Claiborne is
projected to be a top-five draft pick and would probably not
increase his stock with another season of college football.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Butkus Award, which goes to the nation's top
linebacker, and recorded 107 tackles, six interceptions, including
two for touchdowns, along with 16 pass deflections.
</P>
<P>
   He was also USC's first unanimous All-American at linebacker and
the first Trojan to be a unanimous All-American at any position
since Keyshawn Johnson in 1995. He also earned Football News' 1998
Defensive Player of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
   But Claiborne has frequently felt shackled by the constraints of
the college game and opponents' desire to run plays away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Even while discussing TCU's option offense, Claiborne lamented
the thought of being double- and triple-teamed, something he
believes will happen on a weekly basis next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not have many tackles (today). They might send three
or four people at me,'' Claiborne said. ``Hopefully, they're cocky
and they won't feel they'll have to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said earlier in the week that Claiborne's
chances of returning were ``50-50'' and that the linebacker was his
No.1 recruit for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out a year from now, with him winning a national
championship, which is our goal, is something that he'll never have
again,'' Hackett said. ``Pro football is going to welcome him with
open arms whether it be this year or next year. He's one of those
rare players.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hackett will likely have to focus on keeping wide receiver
R. Jay Soward in the fold, as he ponders joining Claiborne by
declaring early for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne said he had not spoken to Soward about the NFL, or
tried to influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal thing that you shouldn't try to put on the
team,'' Claiborne said. ``R. Jay will do things his way. To try and
seek him out will not do any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward is expected to make his decision early next week,
although his father favors that R. Jay return for his senior
season. College players have until Jan. 8 to declare their
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: There's been one surprising lineup change for today's Sun
Bowl. Senior David Pratchard of Canyon Country will start at left
guard ahead of Jason Grain. USC offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood said the move was made because of Pratchard's performance
in practice, not because he is a senior.... USC will be the road
team and wear its white jerseys.

ROSE WIN WOULD PUT BRUINS `GHOSTS' IN CLOSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA cornerback Marques Anderson emerged from the
training room a few weeks ago with a white bandage around his head
and a thick patch above his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   No, he wasn't preparing for the UCLA film school's latest
production, ``Saving Coach Aliotti.'' Pressed for an explanation,
Anderson chuckled and said it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' defense hasn't laughed much since it collapsed at
Miami, since it yielded 690 yards and 49 points and, many believe,
cost UCLA the national championship. Bitter and beleaguered,
players and coaches want to move on. But everywhere they turn, it's
thrown back in their face.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rose Bowl press conference Monday, defensive coordinator
Nick Aliotti was introduced as the offensive coordinator. When
linebacker Ryan Nece introduces himself on campus, people ask if he
plays offense or defense.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Bruins finally have a chance to end their
ignominious existence, a chance to answer their critics, get a jump
on next season and hold their heads high on Bruin Walk. They have a
chance, as linebacker Tony White said, to put ``the ghosts in the
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA may be playing Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, but for the
maligned defense, this is the Redemption Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we've been maligned might be an understatement,''
Aliotti said. ``Raked over the coals might be a better term. But
I'm not going to B.S. anybody. We didn't play against Miami, but we
need to put that behind us. It's been tough on me. This is an
opportunity to get some respect back.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti's job appeared to be in jeopardy immediately following
the Hurricane game. But coach Bob Toledo gave Aliotti a vote of
confidence after determining the problems weren't tactical but
fundamental: The Bruins were in the right place to make tackles;
they just didn't make them.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, UCLA devoted much of its Rose Bowl preparation time _
teams are allowed 15 postseason practices _ on rudimentary tacking
drills. But aside from tweaking the gameplan to counteract
Wisconsin's option attack, Aliotti has not made dramatic changes in
scheme or personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we are who we are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are talented but young, instinctive but uncertain and, most
of all, united in punctured pride. If nothing else, the criticism _
both internal and external _ galvanized the defense. In recent
weeks, they've vocalized their frustration with the disparate
reviews heaped on UCLA: The offense gets accolades; the defense
gets ripped. No one wants to be ``Ishtar'' forever.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Bruins can close the chasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a real character builder,'' said linebacker Tony
White. ``Besides maybe one or two guys, we've never played in a big
game like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a bad game, there will be a snowball effect. We'll
go into the offseason thinking about what we can do to turn the
defensive program around. If we have a good game, it closes the
door with the ghost in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Redemption is thickest for Aliotti and linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo, who missed most of the Miami game with sprained knee
ligaments. Afterward, several Bruins questioned the severity of
Ayanbadejo's injury _ a stunning, piercing blow to a passionate
senior who plays at dervish pace. He missed two weeks of practice
and, even now, is not completely healthy. But as the emotional
leader of the young defense, his presence is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed how bad we can be against Miami, and now we have to
show how good we can be against Wisconsin,'' Ayanbadejo said. ``We
have a lot to prove. We have to show what kind of character we
have, what kind of heart we have.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the problem isn't their hearts and heads, but their
knees, ankles and elbows. Starting nose guard Micah Webb ripped
knee ligaments against Miami and is out until training camp '99, at
the earliest. Ayanbadejo is not at full strength. Nor is defensive
end Pete Holland, who sprained elbow ligaments in practice and may
not play. Reserve nose guard Kory Lombard is doubtful with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Implausible as it seems, the Bruins are even younger than they
were before. True freshmen Anthony Fletcher and Ken Kocher will
start for Holland and Webb, respectively _ meaning eight defensive
starters are freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   The line, so critical in slowing Wisconsin's mammoth tailback,
Ron Dayne, will feature a true sophomore and two true freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the road, we have a chance to be really good,'' Aliotti
said. ``(But the injuries) mean more time for the freshmen. It's
the Puppy Chow defense.''

PEPPERDINE FALLS TO SIENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Kelvin Gibbs never heard of Siena until he saw
Pepperdine's schedule. Many of his teammates echoed it.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the Waves knew nothing of the Franciscan school,
had no idea of its upstate New York location in the Albany suburb
called Loudonville.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were they aware of the measles scare in 1989 at Siena, which
forced North Atlantic Conference to play its league tournament in
an empty building to alleviate fear of spreading the disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, they are all things the Waves should bone up on because
Siena, which now plays in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference,
holds a special piece of Pepperdine history.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints beat the Waves 85-76 at Firestone Fieldhouse on
Wednesday to win the inaugural Sparkletts Invitational, ending
Pepperdine's 10-game home winning streak and severely dampening the
festive mood of a win against Rhode Island 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat a big-time team like (Rhode Island) and then to come
out like this... Siena is a good team, but I think we should have
beaten them,'' Gibbs said. ``We didn't play up to or ability, both
offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the tournament setting up the Waves' last tune-up for
the West Coast Conference, a trip to San Jose State on Saturday, it
pushed Pepperdine's progress backward.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the focus on gaining momentum. Rather the Waves now
must figure out a way to score consistently in a half-court offense
that isn't producing. That deficiency shined greatly late.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, which led by double-digits in second-half, went
ahead 67-63 on a basket by Gibbs with 8:01 to play, but managed
just one field goal the rest of the way thanks to Siena's zone
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints took the lead for good, 78-75, on a 3-pointer by
Isaiah Stewart with 2:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they got up we didn't stay poised,'' said Pepperdine
forward Marc McDowell, who scored a game-high 18 points. ``We
started rushing our shots and didn't' take care of the ball. When
we're pressured we have to keep doing our thing instead of breaking
down and going one-on-one. You've got to stick to the game plan
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Siena (9-1) has won five straight, but coach Paul Hewitt, in his
second season of what is turning into a masterful rebuilding job
with the Saints, said he wasn't about to cut down the nets and
declare this the grandest of wins for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, it wasn't even the best win this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some qualities, like George Washington,'' Hewitt said.
``What it does is give our guys confidence they can go on the road
and win in a tough building. They have a long history here at
Pepperdine of having a strong home court advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The field is tentatively set for next season's Sparkletts
Invitational, and again it could feature the return of a former
UCLA coach. Larry Farmer is expected to bring his Loyola-Chicago
team here next season. Colorado State is also slated to
participate, and Pepperdine officials hope to secure Princeton as
the fourth team in the next few weeks. But the tournament is being
moved to Thanksgiving weekend.... Siena's Marcus Faison was named
the tournament MVP. The all-tournament team was composed of Siena's
Brandon Fields, Pepperdine's Gibbs and McDowell and Rhode Island's
Lamar Odom and Antonio Reynolds-Dean.

HACKETT HAS NO DESIGNS ON LEAVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ USC coach Paul Hackett's name has surfaced in Chicago
as a possible candidate for the Bears' coaching vacancy, but
Hackett claimed Wednesday that he had no desire to return to the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that no one would be shocked if my name was
thrown around in the NFL,'' Hackett said. ``It's an honor that
people felt that I did enough work as an assistant in the NFL to
merit being a head coach. It's flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett repeatedly stressed that he was not considering
leaving USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here. I just got here. I love being here. I've been there
and I want to be here,'' Hackett said. ``I would hope my name being
mentioned would be directly as a result of how well we do on the
field at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's name has been tied to the Bears' job because of his
close friendship with Mark Hatley, Chicago's vice president of
player personnel. The pair worked together for three years in
Kansas City, and Hatley flew to Los Angeles to visit Hackett once
during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why my name is being thrown around,'' Hackett said.
``He and I are good enough friends that he knows about my
commitment at USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he has not been contacted by the Bears or talked to
Hatley.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he is frustrated that his name could arise for NFL
openings because of his pro background and become an issue during
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to hammer us with it,'' he said. ``(UCLA
coach) Bob Toledo has never coached a down in pro football. Every
year it's going to come up. I'm going to get hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commitment: USC received an oral commitment from
Courtney Morgan, a 6-foot-4, 315-pound lineman from Westchester
High. Morgan selected the Trojans over Michigan. He is USC's 11th
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces: Westlake High coach Jim Benkert watched
Wednesday's practice with former assistant coach Bill Culpepper,
who is the head coach at Clint High in El Paso. Culpepper was also
the head coach at Viewpoint in Malibu for one season. Two of
Benkert's former players _ wide receiver Billy Miller and defensive
lineman Bobby DeMars _ play for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Coach in cast: Defensive coordinator Bill Young will wear a
large cast on his arm for the game, but he doesn't have a broken
arm. Young tore a ligament in his right hand after cutting it on a
piece of glass during a team barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a lot worse than it is,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket tally: By Wednesday night, the Sun Bowl had sold 40,428
tickets. A walk-up of 4,000 to 5,000 is expected, meaning the game
could be close to the stadium capacity of 51,171.

LOOKING INTO PAC-10'S NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nine weeks and 180 games of what promises to be
the wildest, wackiest Pacific-10 season ever _ all in just four
questions and 900 words:
</P>
<P>
   How many dance?
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10 will send between four and six teams to the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is the only bet-the-house lock. Despite injuries and
two early losses, the Cardinal remains the class of the conference
_ the only team capable of winning consistently on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Cal, Washington and Arizona probably have the combination of
talent and experience to earn at-large bids on Selection Sunday
(March 7), although losses to Boise State and Gonzaga could hurt
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   USC and UCLA are teetering _ neither destined for the NIT nor
guaranteed spots in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are 8-1 with 18 conference games left, meaning
they'll need 10 wins to have a chance at an at-large berth. Aside
from Kansas, a 29-point loss, USC played a poor non-conference
schedule (best win: at Nevada-Las Vegas) and that figures to
deflate its power rating come March.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are a prime example of the importance of preseason
tournaments, which provide three games over and above the 27
allowed by the NCAA. With one or two extra wins in Alaska, Maui,
the NIT or Puerto Rico, USC would have had greater margin for error
in the Pac-10 and still hit the 18-win barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have a quality non-conference schedule (Maryland,
Kentucky, Oklahoma State, Syracuse, Louisville) that will bolster
their case with the Selection Committee. Historically, 18 wins and
a top-30 power rating are enough for an at-large bid. But 18 wins
won't be as easy as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are 8-2 with the Pac-10, Louisville and Syracuse
remaining. Considering the inexperience _ their top 10 players are
freshmen and sophomores _ they could finish anywhere from 12-6 to
8-10 in conference play.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to recent years, when protecting the homecourt and
splitting on the road was the accepted formula for success, the
Bruins this season should aim for seven wins at home and three on
the road. That gets them to 10-8 in the Pac-10 and 18 wins
(minimum) overall. Do that, and they're in.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the league's emerging stars?
</P>
<P>
   They weren't prep phenoms, they didn't dominate the recruiting
rankings, and they received little preseason attention. But these
five will emerge as impact players this year:
</P>
<P>
   Cal forward Sean Lampley. A 6-foot-7 sophomore, Lampley is
athletic, physical, relentless and a future star. He's second in
the conference in rebounding (11.3 per game) and should prosper
under Bears coach Ben Braun, who specializes in developing big men.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford wing guard David Moseley. A 6-4 junior, Moseley is one
of Stanford's best athletes and will play major minutes to
compensate for injuries to Mike McDonald and Ryan Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State guard Deaundra Tanner. A 6-2 sophomore from
Inglewood, Tanner is the best player on the league's worst team,
equally adept at scoring, rebounding or directing what little
attack the Beavers have.
</P>
<P>
   USC guard Jeff Trepagnier. A 6-4 sophomore, Trepagnier is a
sensational athlete who has improved his fundamentals and gives the
Trojans' backcourt some much-needed size.
</P>
<P>
   Washington forward Chris Walcott. A 6-7 junior, Walcott is quiet
but effective around the basket and capable of hitting mid-range
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Where have all the (reserve) point guards gone?
</P>
<P>
   It may have no impact on the league race or their NCAA
Tournament fate, but Arizona and Stanford are tinfoil-thin in the
backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Terry and Art Lee will be asked to play 35 to 40 minutes
because of a dearth of depth; injuries, fatigue or foul trouble
could mean instant doom. Lee's backup, Mike McDonald, is out at
least another month with a foot injury, and Terry simply has no
established help. Arizona's reserve point guard is walk-on John
Ash.
</P>
<P>
   On which games will the season turn?
</P>
<P>
   Whether they're on Fox, Fox Sports West, Fox Sports West 2 or FX
or F-whatever, here are four games that shouldn't be missed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Cal at Stanford (Jan. 9). Bears hand Stanford its only loss
in Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   2. UCLA at USC (Jan. 20). Watch the Trojans beat the Bruins for
the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stanford at Washington (Feb. 18). Ready for a repeat of
Stanford's thrilling win last year?
</P>
<P>
   4. UCLA at Arizona (March 6). A tournament bid could be on the
line in this season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 order of finish: 1. Stanford, 2. California, 3.
Washington. 4. Arizona, 5. (tie) UCLA and USC, 7. Oregon, 8.
Arizona State, 9. Washington State, 10. Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Cal was the second-place pick in this space long before
its victory over North Carolina in the Newell Challenge. The Bears
are experienced, they have superb guard play and one of the
league's best coaches. Oregon and Arizona State are comparable to
the seventh- and eighth-place teams in the ACC or Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   All-league team: Arizona guard Jason Terry and center A.J.
Bramlett, Arizona State forward Bobby Lazor, USC forward Brian
Scalabrine, UCLA guard Baron Davis, Stanford guard Art Lee and
forward Mark Madsen, Cal guard Geno Carlisle and forward Sean
Lampley, and Washington center Todd MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: Terry and Bramlett are the best one-two senior punch in
the conference and will guide an otherwise young team to a solid
season. But don't expect 25 wins from the Wildcats. Like UCLA,
they're reloading this year.
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine should win the Fred Hessler Newcomer Award, while
Arizona's Michael Wright and UCLA's Jerome Moiso will contend for
Freshman of the Year honors.

UCLA WOMEN ROUT PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANEL LAJ  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even without All-American candidate Maylana
Martin, the UCLA women's basketball team bounced back with an 85-51
nonconference win over Pepperdine Wednesday night at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the night was could the ninth-ranked Bruins
(8-4) win without Martin, who was sidelined with a sinus infection.
In Monday's 85-80 loss to No. 17 Duke, Martin was 1 of 10 from the
field, and the rest of the Bruins couldn't produce enough offense
to beat the Blue Devils. Wednesday, UCLA got the offense it needed
from LaCresha Flannigan and Melanie Pearson. Flannigan, 9 of 16
from the field, scored 18 points, and Pearson, who was 6 of 6 from
the line, had a game high 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the turning point was when we picked it up
defensively,'' said UCLA coach Kathy Olivier. ``We got some easy
baskets just from our defense. Our defense was creating points for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (8-4) came out strong in the first half and led by as
many as seven before the Bruins took over. With five minutes
remaining in the first half, UCLA used a 13-3 run to take a 43-31
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheeda Clark scored 12 points, and Kate Crane added 11 and
nine rebounds to lead the Waves. Pepperdine held its ground in the
first half, outrebounding the Bruins 25-18. But UCLA became more
aggressive on the boards and outrebounded the Waves 51-45 for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Another offensive bright spot for UCLA was junior center Janae
Hubbard, who had a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a two-game losing streak for UCLA, which opens
Pac-10 play Saturday at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Pac-10 is good from one to 10,'' said Olivier. ``I
think that if we try to again take the easy route or think that
it's going to be an easy game it's going to be another wake up
call, and we don't want to go through that again. ``I think
consistency will not be a problem because (we'll) all be ready to
play ... If our post gets into foul trouble that will be trouble
for us. That will be an ugly situation. We got to stay out of foul
trouble. If we have Maylana and Janae in the game, and they're
effective, we can do some damage against anyone.''

NEW CAREER FOR NICHOLLS

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Once upon a time, Bernie Nicholls had 70
goals and 150 points in a season playing for the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a decade ago, and less than a year after that epic
season the Kings traded Nicholls, who thus began a nomadic
existence that would take him from team to team for the rest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   That career ended for Nicholls, 37, earlier this season, when
the San Jose Sharks basically pushed him into retirement. Nicholls
was disappointed at first, mostly at how the Sharks dealt with the
matter, but Wednesday night, he was back in the Forum as a San Jose
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more a disappointment than anything,'' Nicholls said of
the circumstances that led to his retirement. ``It should have been
handled a little differently. I felt more disappointed that my mom
and dad didn't get to watch my last game. I didn't get any notice
(that it would be his final game).''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholls, who finished his career with 475 goals, had 327 of
those during his 7{ years with the Kings, along with 431 assists.
He is the fifth-leading scorer in Kings history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved playing here,'' Nicholls said. ``Even after I was
traded from here (in 1990, for Tony Granato and Tomas Sandstrom),
it was always fun coming back here to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset close: Kings goalie Stephane Fiset is close to returning
to the lineup from the latest of the three groin injuries he's
suffered this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine right now,'' said Fiset, who has appeared in only 10
of the Kings' first 36 games. ``Every day, I'm doing a little more.
I just have to stretch it after practice and ice it. But I'm
feeling pretty good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset said his training regimen before this season was the same
as every other year, and he's puzzled by the repeated injuries he's
suffered since the fourth game of the season, against Colorado on
Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really frustrating,'' Fiset said. ``One day, you
feel good. The next day, you wake up and you're sore and you don't
know why. Nobody knows what's going on. I guess I'll just have to
deal with it all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Defenseman Doug Bodger missed the game because of
the cervical strain and bruised shoulder he suffered Monday night
when checked from behind by Phoenix's Dallas Drake. Garry Galley
replaced Bodger in the lineup. Bodger's injuries are not believed
to be serious, though he may miss Saturday night's game at the
Forum against Colorado.... The Sharks were without leading scorer
Jeff Friesen, who is sidelined with a shoulder injury, and veteran
winger Murray Craven, who has a bruised nerve in his shin.... Rose
Bowl opponents Cade McNown of UCLA and Bob Adamov of Wisconsin
participated in a ceremonial faceoff before the game.

   SEATTLE _ Barbara Hedges is justifiably proud of her record
hiring coaches at Washington. She appointed Ken Knutson to head up
baseball, Teresa Wilson as the person to shepherd the Husky
softball team to the College World Series, and she was sage enough
to recognize that Bob Bender was the cream of men's basketball
candidates in the UW pool.
</P>
<P>
   Now the UW athletic director must make the most monumental hire
in her seven-year tenure here, that of a replacement for Jim
Lambright. Her choice as football coach will hold the key to one of
the nation's wealthiest athletic programs, one with a four-year
waiting list for season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major decision with huge implications,'' Hedges
said. ``I'm already starting to get phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping Hedges in an advisory capacity will be Don James, the
College Football Hall of Fame coach who guided the Huskies from
1975-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked if I would help her with a list,'' James said
Wednesday night. ``I'll know the coaches, or I'll know someone who
will. I'm not going to be on the selection committee, but I'll be
willing to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges isn't ruling out any NCAA Division I coach, but it is
more likely she hires a head coach from a school at a conference
level comparable to Washington's. She will, however, be reminded
that James was little known when the UW hired him from Kent State
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   That may lead her to:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Gary Barnett, Northwestern. A facile figure among
boosters and media, he did the impossible and took the Wildcats to
the Rose Bowl in 1995, but has since fallen on harder times, and
the school's point-shaving scandal may dull his luster.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett has irked many Northwestern faithful for his frequent
dalliance with some top jobs _ he wanted the Notre Dame and Texas
positions in recent years _ so this might have to be done in
secretive fashion. He is popularly believed to covet the Colorado
job (he was an assistant there) whenever Rick Neuheisel leaves, but
Washington might appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Barry Alvarez, Wisconsin. The former Notre Dame and
Iowa assistant has done his own miracle work, getting the Badgers
to the Rose Bowl twice in five years. Which could lead him to
conclude that everything he could do here, he can do there. Alvarez
is already being mentioned for NFL vacancies and his interest here
might be a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Gary Pinkel, Toledo. Hedges is almost certain to talk
to Pinkel, who has long considered Washington his dream job. He is
57-31-3 in eight years in the Mid-American Conference after leaving
his Husky job as offensive coordinator before the national
championship season of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkel, 46, played for James at Kent State and James'
recommendation would likely carry weight around Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Gary,'' James said. ``I watched him grow, all
the way from when he was a player to being a coach. He's just a
solid guy, a hard worker with a lot of character.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Chris Tormey, Idaho. It's unlikely the Huskies would
dip as low as the Big West Conference, but the Vandals were
mentioned among the worst teams in Division I-A in August, and
Wednesday they shocked 16-point favorite Southern Mississippi in
the Humanitarian Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Tormey, 43, a Spokane native and Idaho grad, spent 11 years on
UW staffs spanning the James and Lambright regimes and was highly
respected.
</P>
<P>
   Another name making rounds is Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer. But
Beamer, a Tech alum, has a resume grounded in the South and
wouldn't appear to be the sort of fit Hedges wants.
</P>
<P>
   Others available include deposed Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson
and former Auburn coach Terry Bowden. But the pall over the '98
Seahawks likely would be among factors discouraging Hedges on
Erickson, while Bowden, like Beamer, would have to overcome
strictly Southern connections.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges, who expects to have a short list quickly, said she
wouldn't be opposed to pursuing a good candidate from the Pac-10
although she called that ``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said she would rely on an unnamed group of advisors to
assist in interviewing candidates, but that the decision will be
hers. She wouldn't specify when it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright earned a package of $566,000 including outside income,
and Hedges said, ``I would say the parameters would be similar.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lynda Amari let out a shriek of delight.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't because her Cal State Northridge women's basketball
team opened the Big Sky Conference with a 66-63 home victory over
defending co-champion Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it because the Matadors (7-4) beat the Lumberjacks (6-5)
for the first time in the last 10 meetings. And while her game-high
24 points were nice, that wasn't the reason, either.
</P>
<P>
   No, her scream was because she opened up a tiny box and saw her
1997 State Junior College championship ring from her Ventura
College days. Several players and her coach made the presentation
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does fit!'' she exclaimed. ``A $400 ring! That's gold and
diamonds in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Northridge coach, Frozena Jerro, responded, ``Dang, girl!
You'd better lock it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge would be wise to lock up this victory because it
overcame its mistakes and made free throws in the final minutes.
With the next three conference games on the road in a six-day span,
the Matadors will need poise to come out in the title hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Amari had much to do with that. Edniesha Curry didn't start,
having been disciplined by Jerro. (Jerro called it ``minor''; Curry
didn't attend the postgame conference.) So Amari filled in and
scored nine points in about nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had to take responsibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the second half, after NAU had cut a 16-point deficit to
tie the score at 61 with 1:20 to play, Amari hit two free throws 10
seconds later to put the Matadors ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   She also took seven rebounds and brought many in the announced
crowd of 374 to their feet with a loud block midway through the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``She displayed her versatility,'' Jerro said. ``We sent a
message to the Big Sky. We matured a lot today.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, the only other Matador in double figures, finished with
12 points.
</P>
<P>
   NAU got 20 points off the bench from guard RaeAnn West, and
forward Jess LeBlanc became her school's career-leading scorer with
a field goal late in the first half. She finished with 10 points.

KINGS BEAT SHARKS

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When the Los Angeles Kings defeated the
Coyotes in Phoenix on Monday night, it was valid to wonder just how
significant the victory had been.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Kings respond in their next game with another solid
effort and another triumph?
</P>
<P>
   Or would the Phoenix victory merely be a positive blip in a
season of negatives?
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks before an announced
crowd of 10,918 at the Forum on Wednesday night, the Kings provided
an affirmative answer to the first question, and avoided having one
night's blip become another night's bleep.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the Kings (12-21-3) amazingly are just three
points behind Vancouver, which holds the final Western Conference
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel lucky,'' said center Ian Laperriere, who had two
assists, as did Rob Blake and Donald Audette. ``We're not the only
team that's been struggling. The only thing we can do about it is
keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings got goals from Matt Johnson (yes, Matt Johnson), Ray
Ferraro, Yanic Perreault (on a power play), Glen Murray
(shorthanded) and Olli Jokinen. Murray's goal capped an evening of
outstanding penalty killing, and Jamie Storr made 31 saves as the
Kings won for the fourth time in their last five games, and for
only the fifth time this season at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   After going more than two months without beating a Pacific
Division opponent, the Kings won a game within the division for the
second time in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Stern scored the only goal for the Sharks (10-16-8), as the
Kings held an opponent to two goals or fewer for the fifth
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't generate too much offense,'' San Jose's Joe Murphy
said. ``We outshot them, but most of our shots were from the
perimeter. No one was going to the net. It was just a bad hockey
game by our club.''
</P>
<P>
   It took only 2:28 for the Kings to get on the scoreboard, with
Johnson scoring his second goal this season, matching his career
high. The 6-foot-5 Johnson parked himself in front of San Jose
goalie Mike Vernon, warded off the efforts of 6-2 Sharks defenseman
Bob Rouse, and redirected a cross-ice pass from Laperriere to give
the Kings the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't miss him,'' Laperriere said. ``If you miss him,
you're blind. If our line can bring goals, it's just going to help
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson, who has six goals in 151 NHL games, ``I might have
had a bit of a step on Rouse. Lappy made a nice play and it went
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before another three minutes elapsed, however, Sean O'Donnell
and Laperriere took penalties 28 seconds apart, leaving the Kings
two men short for 1:32. But aside from a Murphy shot that hit the
post, the Sharks did not threaten, and late in the period, Ferraro
padded the Kings' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big turning point in the game,'' Kings coach Larry
Robinson said of the penalty killing. ``It took the wind out of
their sails and gave us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern drew the Sharks to within a goal 7:43 into the second
period, but six minutes later, Perreault's power-play goal
re-established the two-goal margin.
</P>
<P>
   Murray sealed the victory midway through the third period with
his 15th goal, slipping the puck between Vernon's pads on a
breakaway for the 10th shorthanded goal by the Kings this season,
tying them for the NHL lead with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen added his fifth goal three minutes later, his first
point in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' Robinson said of the victory. ``If you look
at our record at home, we've got to get a better record. It's
pretty sad when you've got a better record on the road than at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just happy to get goals. We were playing pretty well
defensively. We just weren't generating anything offensively.''

 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM NATIONS HIT BY MITCH GET BREAK  &HT;     By LOUIS FREEDBERG and APRIL LYNCH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As part of a plan to provide relief to countries
ravaged by Hurricane Mitch, the Clinton administration said
Wednesday that it will allow as many as 150,000 illegal immigrants
from Honduras and Nicaragua to stay in the United States for the
next 18 months without fear of deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is creating some breathing room for people
who are already in the United States the opportunity to remain so
that the rebuilding can take place in their countries,'' said
Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after weeks of intensive debate within the
administration about how best to respond to the disaster. The White
House had been under pressure to also provide relief to illegal
immigrants from Guatemala and El Salvador. But it decided only to
cover immigrants from the countries most directly affected by the
hurricane that displaced 3 million people and caused billions of
dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Honduran and Nicaraguan immigrants who entered
the United States before Wednesday will be granted ``temporary
protective status'' until June 30, 2000. After that, they
technically would be subject to deportation, but Meissner said she
``would not want to speculate on what will happen at the end of 18
months.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was welcomed by Nicaraguans and Hondurans, who must pay
a $175 fee for the new visas. An estimated 32,500 live in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real relief,'' said Antonio Herrera, 36, a Nicaraguan
living in South San Francisco. ``From here, I can keep working and
sending money home. Right now, they really need outside help more
than ever, and the people like me who are here can really do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan drew criticism from immigration experts and
advocates on all sides of the immigration debate. Some advocates
said the plan does not go far enough, because it does not grant
relief to the nearly 400,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador
and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is all the administration does, it will not be
sufficient,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National
Immigration Forum in Washington, D.C. He said that 70percent of El
Salvador's rural economy had been destroyed, and that the
administration failed to come up with a plan that responded to a
crisis that will affect the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said that almost all of those displaced by the
hurricane came from Honduras and Nicaragua. She also noted that
Guatemalans and Salvadorans who are currently in INS custody facing
deportation would not be deported for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there's been damage in El Salvador and Guatemala, the
vast majority of people have been able to return to their homes,''
she said. ``So there is a different situation on the ground, and
this immigration action is tailored to that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Demetrios Papademetriou, director of international migration
programs at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said
the plan was the ``absolute minimum the administration could have
done.'' He predicted that the hurricane's devastation will trigger
large migrations of people throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some who favor more restrictive immigration
policies criticized the decision as essentially opening the door to
more illegal immigrants. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the
Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., said that after
the 18-month moratorium expires, there will be pressure to extend
the visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advocates are going to ask for an extension for another six
months, for another 12 months,'' said Krikorian. `'By the time
things get back to normal, these people will have put down roots,
and it is politically improbable that they will ever be deported.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Rubin, deputy director of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights in San Francisco, said that the INS was using the
immigration law precisely as intended _ ``to provide important
protection at a time of danger, whether from political upheavals
and natural disasters.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has granted temporary protective status to a
range of people, such as Bosnians and Sudanese who have been
victims of political upheavals. But this is only the second time
that it has offered these protections following a natural disaster.
The first was in 1996, after a series of volcanic eruptions almost
destroyed the Caribbean island of Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate effect of the plan will be to allow
immigrants to work legally in the United States. That presumably
will allow them to get better jobs and to continue to send money to
family members in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration relief announced Wednesday is part of a plan to
prevent economic turmoil in the region, &LR;  and to avert a possible
surge of immigration to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided $75 million in emergency military
assistance. About 5,000 U.S. soldiers are in the region helping to
rebuild the most hard hit areas. In addition, several U.S. agencies
sent over $40 million in food aid. The U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development is helping to rebuild homes and the Treasury
Department has extended $50 million in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ensure that the relief efforts are aggressive and
comprehensive until the rebuilding is completed,'' Meissner said.  &LR;

O.J. SIMPSON PAL WINS IN U.S. COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Brian ``Kato'' Kaelin, the O.J. Simpson
associate who won brief celebrity during the former football star's
murder trial, can sue a supermarket tabloid newspaper for
suggesting that he was a suspect in the case, a federal appellate
court in San Francisco ruled Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after Simpson was acquitted of charges that he murdered
his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman,
Kaelin was the subject of a story in the National Examiner
newspaper that was headlined: ``Kato Kaelin . . . Cops Think He Did
It!''
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin sued Globe Communications, the paper's publisher, but his
suit was dismissed by a U.S. district judge in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's opinion, a three-judge appellate panel consisting
of Judges Barry Silverman, Dorothy Nelson and Betty Fletcher
overturned the district court ruling, saying it was simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold today that a reasonable juror could find, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the headlines are defamatory, and that
(the Examiner's) editors acted with actual malice in their decision
to run a headline from which a reasonable juror could conclude that
Kaelin was a murder suspect,'' Silverman wrote on behalf of his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be sent back to the U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin is a would-be actor who won brief notoriety as the
``houseguest'' who was staying with Simpson on the night that
Simpson's wife and Goldman were slain.
</P>
<P>
   The story published in the National Examiner one week after
Simpson was acquitted of murdering his wife and Goldman did not
support the headline. In fact, the story, which ran 17 pages inside
the tabloid, said that Kaelin was suspected of perjuring himself _
not committing the two murders.
</P>
<P>
   Kaelin demanded a retraction, but Globe refused. But when Kaelin
sued for libel in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, his suit was
dismissed by Judge Dickran Tevrizian.
</P>
<P>
   Tevrizian said he threw out the action because Kaelin had not
proved the National Examiner's defamatory headline had been
published with actual malice. Malice is a crucial element in libel
cases, because slurs against public figures are legally actionable
only if they are published without regard for their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   However, in its decision Wednesday, the appellate court panel
said that even the tabloid's editors said they did not believe the
headline was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undisputed that Globe (Communications) never believed
Kaelin to be a suspect in the murders. The fact that Globe ran the
headlines anyway ... is circumstantial evidence of actual malice,''
said Wednesday's Court of Appeals ruling.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Supreme Court should decide Senate's impeachment
jurisdiction
 &HT;    By Jack Bass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate must insure the integrity of the process as it
confronts the articles of impeachment against President Clinton.
The first question the Senate should address is whether it has
jurisdiction to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   If the lame-duck House of Representatives had passed any other
legislation after the election, it would be dead. Is its authority
for impeaching the president different?
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933,
shortened the time between congressional elections and members
taking office and was aimed at preventing a lame-duck Congress from
overturning the will of the people in the previous election. The
1998 election surprised pundits with its gain by congressional
Democrats. This outcome reflected national polls showing most
Americans don't want President Clinton removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The same Republicans arguing against a Senate ``rush to
judgment'' by substituting censure for an impeachment trial made
their own rush by voting for articles of impeachment before their
numbers decreased when the 106th Congress takes office on Jan. 4.
Because impeachment is a political process, the House Republican
leadership had a right to make this political decision.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a question of unresolved law, not politics, whether
under the 20th Amendment the Senate in the 106th Congress has
jurisdiction to act on articles of impeachment passed by the House
in the 105th Congress. Although the Senate received the articles of
impeachment through its clerk, the senators took no action.
</P>
<P>
   This is a situation without precedent.
</P>
<P>
   This unique constitutional question is so grave _ a matter of
removing the president _ that the Senate and the American people
deserve an answer from the most authoritative source. That clearly
is the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In an impeachment trial, the Senate acts not in a legislative
capacity, but a judicial one. It serves as judge and jury. As a
court of limited jurisdiction, the Senate lacks authority to try
the impeachment case if its action violates the 20th amendment,
even if both sides agree to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Based on established principle, the Supreme Court does not issue
advisory opinions. But the genius of the law is its adaptability.
</P>
<P>
   A rarely-used procedure of the federal courts offers a means of
resolving the legal question of jurisdiction definitively. In its
judicial capacity, the Senate could certify the matter to the
Supreme Court as a question of law.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1963
certified as a question of law to the Supreme Court whether
Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett was entitled to a jury trial for
criminal contempt because of attempting to thwart James Meredith
from breaking the racial barrier at the University of Mississippi
by enrolling under a Fifth Circuit court order. The judges on the
court of appeals had divided 4-4 on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge John R. Brown of the Fifth Circuit said this case
``must be looked upon as one of the great constitutional crises of
the United States.'' The current situation arguably amounts to a
greater crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to prevent the Senate, acting in its judicial
role, from certifying this question of law to the Supreme Court.
The Senate could ask both sides_the House managers and the
president's lawyers_to argue the case in written briefs. The
Supreme Court has the authority to accept or reject the case.
Although President Clinton as defendant has the authority to raise
the issue and get it to the Supreme Court, it would be easy for the
justices to say no_that it's the Senate's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As a legal and constitutional issue of overriding importance,
the Senate and the American people deserve to know from the highest
authority that the procedure to be followed meets the requirements
of the Constitution. That means a decision by the full Supreme
Court. The Senate and the nation might be served well by the
resultant delay providing a cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court approves Senate jurisdiction for a trial,
it can then proceed with unquestioned legitimacy. If not, the new
House of Representatives can decide whether to seek new articles of
impeachment, in the same manner as with any legislation that dies
at the end of a previous Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue against a rush to judgment are correct. Before
commencing a trial, the Senate owes it to itself and the American
people to move with dispatch to get an authoritative answer to this
unprecedented constitutional question of jurisdiction. As the final
arbiter of the constitution, the Supreme Court should accept its
responsibility to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bass is author of two books about federal judges and civil
rights, ``Unlikely Heroes'' and ``Taming the Storm.'' His most
recent book is ``Ol' Strom: An Unauthorized Biography of Strom
Thurmond,'' co-authored with Marilyn Thompson.

 &HT;    The newspaper loses one of its true strengths
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One of the smartest, toughest women I've
ever met died last week. Lucille Fain passed away 12 days after
having a stroke while writing obituaries for The Daily Sentinel,
where she had worked for 62 years. As Ab Abernethy put it at her
memorial service, her friends know that's the way she would have
chosen to leave this earth _ quickly and without a lot of fuss and
bother.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I can do justice to writing about Ms. Fain, not the
way Ab and Joyce Swearingen _ both of whom knew her much longer
than I _ did with their eulogies last week at the memorial service.
But I feel bound to try.
</P>
<P>
   All told, I worked with Ms. Fain (I never had the nerve to call
her Lucille to her face, even after I became her boss) for 11
years. For the last five years, her desk was the closest to my
office. About once a year, she'd come in and ask me if I still
wanted her to work at the paper. My answer was always the same: You
can work here until you don't want to anymore or until you die. I
always figured it would be the latter.
</P>
<P>
   You could set a clock by her routine. She was here by 7:45 a.m.,
would pick up the metro papers lying outside on the sidewalk and
knock on the door if it hadn't been unlocked yet. I tried to give
her a key to the front door or the combination to the side door,
but she didn't want either. She would come inside and make a fresh
pot of coffee, fill a cup with shredded wheat, grab the front
section of The Dallas Morning News and sit at her desk and read
every story. Often, I'd pick up the same section later in the day
and find holes where she'd cut out an editorial or story that
piqued her interest.
</P>
<P>
   Then she would work on her weekly history column, juggling her
work between a steady flow of visitors. After more than six decades
at the paper, she had built up a large contingent of fellow history
buffs who would arrive to discuss all manner of things. Often,
folks she'd never met would wander in, perhaps chasing a
genealogical connection and hoping she'd be able to help out. She
was always gracious and patient, though if under deadline she would
politely shoo them off and do the important stuff _ helping get out
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fain was an inveterate letter writer, firing off missives to
politicians with whom she had found fault. She had to use my
printer, and often I would find her letters while looking for
something I had printed. I would read with amusement as she took
senators, presidents and congressmen to task with short,
to-the-point letters.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, at age 76, she seamlessly adapted from using an
IBM Selectric to writing on a Macintosh computer. She viewed the
computer as a necessary evil, and I could hear her muttering
deprecations at it when it wouldn't act right. She hammered the
computer mouse like she was launching a nuclear attack. But she
learned the essentials _ the spell checker and the word count _ so
that she could warn the layout folks that we had 1,200 words of
obituaries, which would take up most of Page 2 the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Some days she would come in my office and announce that nobody
had died, and thus there were no obits. It was a standing joke
between us. I would look at her sternly and say, ``Well, Ms. Fain,
we're just going to have to do better than that. People will start
calling to accuse us of having discontinued running obits.'' She'd
laugh knowingly, since it's true that someone invariably calls when
we don't have any obits.
</P>
<P>
   She would leave by late morning and return in late afternoon,
usually after picking up her granddaughter at school. Then she
would write the obituaries for the next day's paper, calling the
funeral homes when she caught a name or town spelled wrong. Ms.
Fain very rarely got anything wrong in an obituary.
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday afternoon, she made the rounds of the building,
watering the plants, some of which have been in this building 20
years. I don't have a clue how they'll survive without her.
</P>
<P>
   The only argument I had with her was two years ago when I wanted
to do a story marking her 60th year at the newspaper. She would
have none of it. Nope, no way, she said. Find something else to
write about. I'm not interested in talking about myself, she told
me in no uncertain terms. She won the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fain is gone, but I can still smell her old-lady perfume, as
I called it, a thick floral scent wafting around her desk. Though
we all knew not long after she slumped forward in her chair that
she wouldn't be coming back, it still doesn't seem quite real. I'm
betting she's watching us now, worrying if we're getting the names
spelled right.
</P>
<P>
   All I can promise is we'll do the best we can without her.

 &HT;    Air Force frees cash to build F-22 jets
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The U.S. Air Force has released money to
begin building production versions of the F-22 Raptor stealth
fighter, including $94 million to Pratt &AMP; Whitney to build the
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Pentagon was giving the go-ahead to begin production
of the advanced aircraft, it was authorizing a study of
alternatives to the costliest Air Force fighter in history at $171
million a plane the fighter, which at $171 million is the costliest
in history. Air Force spokeswoman Gloria Cales said the study is
normal in weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The money approved this week by Secretary of Defense Defense
Secretary William Cohen will pay for Pratt's production of six F119
engines, four of them for two fighters to be built by Lockheed
Martin and two spares, according to the Air Force. The work is to
be completed by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   The engines will be made at Pratt's operations in Connecticut
but the F119 engine is under development and the program is managed
at Pratt's plant in northwestern Palm Beach County. More than 1,000
people work on the F119 engine here.
</P>
<P>
   With less fewer defense dollars being spent on new weapons
systems in the 1990s, the F-22 is one of only a handful of
multimillion-dollar projects being bought by the Pentagon. It also
is the bridge between the F-15 and F-16 programs, which have all
but ended except for overseas sales, and the Joint Strike Fighter,
an all-purpose jet for the military meant to supplement the F-22 in
the latter half of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 contracts had been delayed since October because
Congress required two prototype aircraft to complete 183 hours of
test flights before the money could be released. The hours were
completed in November, although test flights continue, Cales said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of the aircraft in the test program are at Edwards (Air
Base in California). One is down for maintenance but the other is
still flying. The last time I heard, test flying is at 199 hours,''
Cales said.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department is expected to release another $189
million within days, Cales said. It will be used for partial
production of six more F-22 Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's was the smaller of two F-22 contracts approved by Cohen.
Lockheed Martin received $503 million to build the Raptors, which
are being designed to be undetectable by enemy radar. Boeing is
also a major subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to buy 339 F-22s at $62 billion. They are
expected to begin service in 2005. Pratt will make 678 engines plus
spares.

 &HT;    Worst of weather yet to come, experts say
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This was the year that turned skeptics
into believers. It even made some of the bah-humbug crowd admit
that something really weird, and probably bad, is happening to the
weather on planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   We had it, or saw it, all: Floods, tornadoes, fire and ice
storms. Trains toppling off railroad tracks warped by weeks of
100-degree-plus heat in Texas. Four hurricanes spinning at once, 10
tropical storms born in little more than a month. The warmest and
wettest January and February on record in the United States, the
hottest July ever for the entire world, the warmest year on the
whole surface of the earth since the beginning of temperature
records in the 1400s.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 people killed, 300 million displaced, $89
billion in losses around the globe. All from disasters caused by
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Is this how global warming announces itself and claims
retribution for burning fossil fuels and leveling forests? Or did
we just get caught in a nasty family tug-of-war between a robust El
Nino and La Nina?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have natural variability, but that doesn't
account for what went on,'' says Kevin Trenberth, head of climate
analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo. ``We don't have definitive answers, but there is
reason to believe this is part of the signals of global warming we
may be seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baloney, says Jerry Mahlman, director of NOAA's Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Lab at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no bad guy out there,'' Mahlman insists. ``Basically,
we're getting jerked around by the same stuff that's been jerking
us around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``stuff,'' Mahlman means El Nino and La Nina, those fickle
phenomena that alternately heat and cool the Pacific Ocean waters
near the equator, and thus determine where winds will blow and rain
will fall. Scientists agree that they are the direct causes of this
year's bizarre heat in Texas, fires in Florida and hurricanes in
the Caribbean, and that they probably have more unpleasantness in
store for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But not all scientists are ready to blame global warming and
greenhouse gases for the antics of El Nino and La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the topsy-turviness is an impression born of the fact
that weather in the news has gotten a lot sexier than it used to
be,'' Mahlman says. ``Everybody's interested in it. You hear more
about weather far from where you live than you used to . . .
Everybody has a heightened sense of weather as something that can
get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate began in the 1980s, when scientists began to wonder
whether the droughts, freezes and heat waves of that decade were
early signs of global warming. In 1990, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science devoted a major part of its annual
convention to such issues for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites, computers and communications had gotten
sophisticated enough to let scientists see and connect weather
events in different parts of the world into a global pattern. What
they saw in the isobars, graphs, wind and water measurements was
troubling _ temperature inching upward through the preceding
hundred years, holes in the Earth's protective ozone layer, floods
and droughts and storms that seemed to be strangely out of place
and out of season.
</P>
<P>
   Some said flat out it was the start of the greenhouse effect _
gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons
trapping heat in the atmosphere and not letting it radiate out into
space. And that's how how it would happen, they concluded. Not
gradually and imperceptibly, but in harsh, topsy-turvy doses.
Colder cold, hotter heat, heavier rains, longer dry spells,
stronger storms, droughts where rains ought to be, floods where it
ought to be dry, and no way to pinpoint any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the industrial revolution, the earth's
surface temperature has gone up by 1 degree as carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent to 30 percent. Because
we'll keep on burning oil, coal and natural gas to keep our
factories and power plants and cars running, we probably will pump
that much more CO2 into the air during the next century.
</P>
<P>
   That would trap twice as much heat and raise the Earth's
temperature by about 4 degrees, according to climatology experts.
And that would mean trouble on a scale to make the weirdness of
1998 pale _ melting glaciers and sea ice fields, ocean levels
rising 20 inches, weather going viciously haywire.
</P>
<P>
   That's the vision/nightmare of most scientists, including
Trenberth, who are bold enough to state an opinion publicly. Others
think it's hysterical nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough data to prove it, they say. Even if it were true,
higher temperatures would mean places such as Canada, Siberia and
Minnesota would turn into breadbaskets and forestry growing regions
and what's wrong with that, even if agriculture gets wiped out
somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this gigantic heat engine made up of land, water, air,
ice that makes it so wonderful for us to live here,'' says Jim
O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction
Studies at Florida State University. ``(Global warming) means
you've just thrown another log on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather researchers made a big breakthrough when they realized
that conditions in the Pacific Ocean control the path of the jet
stream, the bands of high-altitude winds that flow from west to
east and move weather systems around the globe. When the eastern
Pacific waters are warm _ El Nino _ the jet stream flows steadily
across the continent, suppressing hurricanes and tornadoes. When
the eastern Pacific turns cold _ La Nina _ the warm water gets
pushed out to the western Pacific, where it bumps the subtropical
jet stream north.
</P>
<P>
   That sets off a loopy pattern that streams in over the
Northwest, curves down into the country's mid-section and back up
toward the east coast. And that means wicked winter storms, spring
tornadoes, fiery summers and fall hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell breaks loose,'' in O'Brien's words.
</P>
<P>
   We began the year in an El Nino that lasted from April 1997
until last May, but whose storm-suppressing effects lasted until
late summer. As it faded into the cold of La Nina, floods swept
over China and Bangladesh and tropical storms seemed to leap out of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 hurricanes and tropical storms of 1998 killed more than
11,000 people, most of them victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central
America. Wildfires charred more than 500,000 acres in Florida. Ice
storms put out the lights for hundreds of thousands of people in
the mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   And we've been warned that most of Florida _ even the sunny
southern tip _ probably will freeze sometime in January or
February, creating more dry vegetation to fuel new forest fires
expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a plague of tornadoes is predicted for the Ohio and
Tennessee river valleys before La Nina expires in March or April.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we'll have to wait for the next El Nino to bring the
forecast into focus again.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, known to peers as ``Mr. El Nino'' for his research on
that phenomenon, has found another ocean anomaly that may be
connected to global warming, but definitely promises trouble for
large areas of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements show that waves in both the northern Atlantic and
Pacific oceans are getting bigger and stronger, meaning the winds
that drive them are stronger. O'Brien suspects that northern ocean
storms _ like the one that hit Washington and Oregon with
hurricane-force winds last week _ have gotten stronger because
they're carrying extra heat from the tropics to the polar regions
so it can radiate into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the engine works,'' he says, ``and the engine is
running harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine, some say, is showing signs of overheating because of
global warming. Water is the planet's air conditioning coolant, and
raising the Earth's surface temperature causes it to evaporate.
That dries out soils, wilts plants, leads to fires and more heat.
Then the droughts that normally come during the cycles of El Nino
and La Nina get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the other half of the equation: All that evaporating
moisture has to go somewhere, so it gets carried 1,000-2,000 miles
away and caught up in a weather system _ such as a hurricane _ that
dumps it someplace _ such as Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part of the global warming scenario we'd better
watch, Mahlman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we expect with global warming is things that are kind of
scary for Florida. We expect hurricanes to be more intense . . . we
don't know if there will be more of them, but if they do form, and
the water is 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, it might crank up more
(Hurricane) Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost certainly will rain a heck of a lot more, and almost
certainly, the summertime heat index will be considerably higher
than it is now. That's kind of creepy, I know _ we even tried to
figure if we had screwed up the calculations, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   South Florida. Hotter and wetter. Creepy, indeed.

 &HT;    How to out-snob the snobby at any soiree
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If you really want to outsnob the snobs
at your next soiree, check your pretense at the door (along with
your borrowed mink stole), and don't act like a snob at all.
</P>
<P>
   Old money, you see, doesn't need attitude. So to get folks
murmuring about whether your great-grandpa was an oil magnate,
steel baron or railroad tycoon, flaunt nonchalance _ graciously, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest, most unaffected people are almost always the ones
with the most money,'' says a maitre d' who's worked in Palm Beach
nearly 20 years. ``They don't make a scene for a certain table
because they expect it. And if it's unavailable, they don't throw a
tantrum. People who've grown up wealthy _ not the types who just
made a million on Microsoft _ have a certain quiet assurance
regardless of what goes on around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have some money but want to appear like they have
more, they're the ones who'll storm out in a huff because of a
smudged glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Another observer of the rich and famous says you can spot
wannabes because they try too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear every piece of jewelry they own and will chose a
restaurant because it's listed in la-ti-da magazine,'' said Elaine
Oksner, retired head concierge at The Breakers. ``Then, they'll
come back from dinner and tell you what they had wasn't as good as
such-and-such a place in New York or L.A. They want you to know
they know what's `in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these snobs may actually have bucks galore. But what they
lack is breeding, and that blows their cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see them coming, loud and overbearing,'' she says.
``They're the ones with the same designer knit suit everybody's
wearing or the navy blue blazer and ascot they've seen on Robin
Leach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people with the most money are confident enough to
wear a creative, one-of-a-kind outfit they've picked up at a
high-end craft show. And they'd rather go to a restaurant with
interesting, offbeat cuisine or decor _ not one from a play-it-rich
guide.''
</P>
<P>
   So to appear cosmopolitan at a party, you needn't gush about how
fabulous the fois gras is at some horrifically pricey French cafe
you can't pronounce. Consider commenting on the fanciful Indian
``best kept secret'' you recently discovered (without saying it's
the only place you can swing because of the chicken curry
two-for-one).
</P>
<P>
   Editing yourself, in fact, is a clever strategy for outsnobbing
snobs. This makes you appear a tad more mysterious and limits your
chances for chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with money, especially money that's been around a
while, don't feel a need to impress, so you won't hear them go on
and on about clothes or homes or cars,'' says a Wellington
socialite. ``Sure, these things might come up in conversation, but
never in a forced, here's-what-I-have sort of way. That would be
obvious _ and rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything, rude (and arrogant) behavior is a
dead giveaway that you're of clock-punch mentality.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, say some confused soul mistakenly uses his salad
fork for the entree. Rather than raise an eyebrow or chuckle behind
his back with your table companions, consider using your salad fork
to make him feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say this reinforces the blunder, while others contend it
saves face _ even if it's not yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``New money is concerned about appearing at ease,'' explains the
veteran maitre d', ``while old money is concerned about making
others feel at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks on the Forbes list, insiders say, also aren't afraid of
frugality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that the people with the most money are
the ones least likely to part with it,'' Oksner says. ``They're the
ones who're comfortable requesting a moderately priced wine.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ones who don't tip a king's ransom when their cars are
brought around, says a Palm Beach valet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't misunderstand, we're more than glad to take the money,''
he says. ``But we always laugh at the guy who hands over a 50 like
it's some big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can hold your own among deep-pocket types by being
understated and gracious, a time may come when you can't pronounce
a menu item or are baffled by which bread plate is yours.
</P>
<P>
   Panic not. ``It's perfectly acceptable to point to something on
the menu and say to the waiter, `This sounds delicious, I think
I'll try it,' '' Oksner says.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the Wellington socialite, if you make a faux
pas, 'fess up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're unsure, the rule of thumb is to sit back and watch
what others do,'' she says. ``But if you do screw up, smile and
make light of it. A definite sign that you're out of your league is
acting like it's the end of the world. Take a deep breath, and have
another drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask for Tom Perignon.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T WHINE ABOUT WINE: HOW TO ORDER CONFIDENTLY
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Does the thought of being in the wine
spotlight give you the cold sweats? Follow along. You won't be an
oenophile (wine connoisseur), but you won't be an ``oh, no!-phile''
either.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare situation No 1: You're asked to choose the wine. And
you're a Pabst Blue Ribbon kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel compelled to pick the most expensive bottle of any
category. Go with middle-priced wines, and stick to these solid
choices if you're in doubt:
</P>
<P>
   _ Merlot (mare-LOW): a red wine, it is a favorite among
sophisticates. Heavy enough for red meat, light enough for poultry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sauvignon Blanc (saw-veen-YAWN blonk): Dry, light white wine
with herbaceous, ``grassy'' taste, good with fish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cabernet Sauvignon: (CAB-ber-nay saw-veen-Yawn) A full-bodied
California red wine that goes well with red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare situation No. 2: You're toast! Everyone wants you to
lift your glass and say something about some jolly good fellow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it short, sweet and sincere. Don't try to be funny. Raise
your glass and speak confidently.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the name of the person you're toasting and say it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't bang your glass against your tablemate's. Tap gently.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't drink wine, toast with the beverage you're
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Nightmare situation No. 3: The sommelier (pronounced
soh-MAHL-yea, meaning wine steward) is coming at you. Do you sniff
the cork, squeeze the cork or bite it?
</P>
<P>
   He'll show you the label _ it should be the same wine you
ordered. Nod. He'll then uncork it and place the cork for you to
see. That's all you do: look at it. If it's wet, as it should be,
nod again. Do not sniff it; that will mark you as dolt. He'll pour
a small sampling and stand there, waiting for you to taste. Don't
ask him to ``fill 'er up!'' Hold the glass by the stem up to the
light _ you're looking at its color _ swirl slightly, sniff deeply,
then taste it, trying to suck in some air at the same time (but do
not slurp). Swallow. Tell him it's fine _ 99 percent of the time,
it is. Nod again, and he'll now pour for the table.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not a wine drinker, make eye contact with the
sommelier and shake your head, or quietly say ``no thanks.'' Don't
turn your glass upside down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jan Norris
</P>
<P>
   TABLE TALK: AWKWARD MOMENTS BE GONE!
</P>
<P>
   The man next to you starts talking about how disappointed he is
with the effect of U.S. tritium production on Russian ratification
of START II. You: ``Don't get me started! I'll go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turns to an intellectual analysis of the
never-more-relevant political insights in James Joyce's Ulysses.
</P>
<P>
   You: ``Oh, if only I had time to read!''
</P>
<P>
   You're not sure whether you have already met the person you are
being introduced to.
</P>
<P>
   You: ``Nice to see you!'' (``Nice to meet you'' implies you
never met, and, busy soul that you are, you just might know them,
yes?)
</P>
<P>
   Someone points to your dress and asks, ``Is that a Versace or a
Valentino?'' (But you can't possibly tell them it's a Target _
tar-JEH.) You: (winking as if you're sharing a secret) ``You know
who it is ...''
</P>
<P>
   _ Shannon Colavecchio
</P>
<P>
   SAY IT WITH APLOMB (A-PLUM)
</P>
<P>
   Bouillabaisse: BOO-ya-bess (not boo-EEL-a-base-ee) _ French
seafood stew
</P>
<P>
   Chianti: key-AHN-tee _ a fruity Italian red wine
</P>
<P>
   Creme brulee: krem broo-LAY _ baked custard with burnt-sugar top
</P>
<P>
   Bruschetta: bru-SKET-ta _ tomato pieces on grilled bread
</P>
<P>
   Prix fixe: pree-fix or pre-feeks _ fixed-price menu
</P>
<P>
   Picadillo: pick-a-DEE-yoh _ ground meat and spices
</P>
<P>
   Arugula: ah-ROO-guh-lah _ a lettuce
</P>
<P>
   Paella: pie-EY-ya _ a Spanish seafood-rice combo
</P>
<P>
   Celeriac: (seh-LER-ay-ak) _ root vegetable
</P>
<P>
   Jicama: (HEEK-eh-ma) _ another root vegetable
</P>
<P>
   And you can always point to the menu item and say to the waiter
with an arched brow: ``Oooh, this looks intriguing!'' Then let him
do the explaining (and pronouncing). Or say, ``Could you please
describe this item to me?''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLACE SETTING (OR NEVER EAT SOMEONE ELSE'S ROLL AGAIN)
</P>
<P>
   _ Solids on the left, liquids on the right
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't put your purse or cellphone or anything inedible on the
table. A small purse goes on your lap, under your napkin. A larger
one can go on the floor under your chair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Between bites, place the knife in the upper right-hand corner
of the plate, never on the tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put butter pat on your bread plate; don't butter your roll
directly from the butter dish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Break bread or rolls with your hands before putting on your
plate, and butter only the piece you plan to eat next.
</P>
<P>
   _ No cutting up food all at once; cut only what you'll eat in
the next bite.
</P>
<P>
   _ When done, lay the fork and knife as if they were clock hands
reading 10:20. Do not push the plate away from you. And don't toss
your napkin on your plate when finished _ it goes to the right of
the plate, folded.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON TIPPING
</P>
<P>
   A generous tip is now considered from 18 percent to 20 percent
of the total bill before tax. Do not tip the captain or busboys
because the waiter will split the tip with them. Tip the maitre d'
$5 to $10 once in awhile if you are a regular patron, but do it
subtly. Tip the wine steward 10 percent of the bottle price,
especially if he has helped you choose it. Also do this subtly.
</P>
<P>
   Tip the hotel doorman who gets you a taxi about $1 to $3,
depending on whether he stood out in the rain for you. When he
brings your car to the door for you, tip him $1 to $2. Avoid
overtipping just to show off.
</P>
<P>
   DO'S AND DON'TS
</P>
<P>
   Wear a Hard Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood T-shirt only if you
own a piece of the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, wear black. Cheap fabrics look pricier, fat folks
look skinnier.
</P>
<P>
   Never, never pull a mirror out at the table or tug at your
clothes or fluff your hair. It shouts, ``I'm insecure.'' Excuse
yourself to the restroom and take care of any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Carry a hanky. This way, you can avoid sneezing into a dinner
napkin or, worse, your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Want to make a good impression? Ask good questions and then
really listen. Everyone loves to talk about themselves.

 THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Vision in Animation.
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   192 pp. New York: Harry N. Abrams. $45.

 &UR; GO HOLLYWOOD, MOSES
</P>
<P>
   BY MARTHA BAYLES
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Prince of Egypt'' will doubtless be remembered as
the film that lifted feature-length animation to the high ground of
biblical epic, this in-house history of the same name is less
memorable -- except in one curious way. By showing how Dreamworks
lavished $75 million on the movie, the book reveals not only the
state of the animator's craft but also the drastically unequal
status of the arts in Hollywood. On every page, ``The Prince of
Egypt'' (the book) reminds us that the focus of feature-length
animation remains so visual that music gets treated as an
afterthought and language as a mere device to carry plot.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Solomon, a respected authority on animation and the
author of five other books on the subject, does a good job of
explaining how ``The Prince of Egypt'' integrates the handmade
images of traditional animation with the highly flexible and mobile
images generated by computer. Especially helpful is his history of
how animators have struggled to achieve the illusion of depth,
going back to the multiplane camera used by Walt Disney in ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs'' (1937) (it stood two stories high and
shot downward through six suspended panels of painted glass).
</P>
<P>
   The book's fine illustrations represent every stage in the
process, from initial scribbles to finished frames, while only
hinting at the beauty of the film itself, in, for instance, the
dream sequence, in which the figures in an Egyptian wall painting
come to life and re-enact the slaughter of the Hebrew innocents;
the burning bush scene; the Angel of Death smiting Egypt; and the
parting of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although these episodes achieve an almost visionary intensity,
``The Prince of Egypt'' rarely soars as high as it should. This may
be because, as some of the animators suggest, their drawings cannot
convey as much emotion as live actors. A more obvious answer,
though, can be found on the soundtrack. While ``The Prince of
Egypt'' is glorious to the eye, it gluts the ear with kitschy music
and cliche-laden dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   A single example will suffice. When interviewed by Solomon, the
composer Hans Zimmer predicted that his score would have ``a
special sound, one that will incorporate the musical styles of the
Near East and North Africa.'' Zimmer is good at this sort of thing,
as evidenced by his score for ``The Lion King.'' As for the script,
let us remember that the protagonists here are the people of the
Book. But in the film, the climactic Exodus scene is accompanied
not by mystical desert strains or the majesty of biblical poetry
but by a power ballad straight off the pop charts. ``When You
Believe'' is not just melodically and lyrically trite, it is also
painfully anachronistic. It's nice to know that the ancient Hebrews
had self-esteem: ``We were moving mountains long /
</P>
<P>
   Before we knew we could.'' But I seem to recall the Bible giving
credit to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   How can such artistry and banality coexist? As Solomon reports,
``Many artists object to the idea of one or two people being
credited as screenwriters on an animated feature, arguing that the
entire story crew actually 'writes' the film.'' Those quotation
marks around the word ``writes'' say it all.
</P>
<P>
   The most successful animated features, like ``The Lion King,''
have sophisticated scripts as well as scores. But it would seem
that sophistication got scrubbed from ``The Prince of Egypt'' on
the same day that the producers scrubbed Disney-style talking
animals. The trouble is, Disney minus comic relief equals kitsch.
And as this book illustrates, despite the prodigious talent that
went into it, ``The Prince of Egypt'' does not alter the equation.

 &UR; THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   BY PETER BISKIND
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton sent Tomahawk cruise missiles against a
Sudanese pharmaceutical plant and Osama bin Laden's redoubt in
Afghanistan last August, after the bombings of the United States
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, many of those who had seen
the movie ``Wag the Dog'' exchanged knowing looks. They couldn't
help recognizing that the attack followed by only three days the
President's now legendary grand jury appearance. Reality, in other
words, seemed to be imitating fiction. (By December, when the
President attempted to ``degrade'' Saddam Hussein's ability to
produce weapons of mass destruction, there seemed to be no doubt
about this, at least in the minds of many of his Republican
opponents, for whom ``Wag the Dog'' had now become a ``syndrome.'')
</P>
<P>
   While most political commentators were flummoxed by the rise in
Clinton's ratings after the airing of the grand jury video, Frank
Rich, a columnist for The New York Times and a former movie and
theater critic, wrote, ``The best explanation I've heard comes not
from a journalist but a filmmaker in Los Angeles.'' The explanation
need not concern us, but suffice to say it turned on a comparison
between Clinton's televised ordeal and tragic drama, albeit of the
trashy variety. More recently, The New Yorker let novelists
pontificate about Monicagate in its Talk of the Town pages,
presumably on the theory that they were as sure-footed on this
soapy terrain as its pundit-turned-novelist-(re)turned-pundit, Joe
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Such phenomena have attracted the attention of Neal Gabler,
whose two previous books -- one a study of Hollywood's Jewish
moguls, the other a biography of Walter Winchell -- more than
qualify him as a credible commentator on the vagaries of American
popular culture. Gabler thinks he knows why cultural critics have
become the Walter Lippmanns of the millennium, and he lays out his
provocative reflections in a new work whose title and subtitle do a
pretty good job of summing up his thesis, ``Life the Movie: How
Entertainment Conquered Reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing upon the shoulders of scholars who have examined the
impact of movies and television on traditional values --
particularly Neil Postman but also the likes of Marshall McLuhan,
Daniel Boorstin, Leo Braudy and Richard Sennett -- Gabler argues
that everyday life at the end of the 20th century has become our
very own ``Truman Show,'' perhaps aptly retitled ``The Human
Show.'' We are all Trumans, with the difference that we are witting
accomplices to the fictionalization of our lives because we prefer
our life movies, or ``lifies,'' as he calls them, to reality, which
barely exists anyway. ``Life itself,'' Gabler says, is ``gradually
becoming a medium all its own.'' We are all ``becoming at once
performance artists in and audiences for a grand, ongoing show. . .
. Life has become art, so that the two are now indistinguishable
from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabler maintains that ``there is obviously no such thing as a
unified field theory of American culture,'' but this is precisely
what he offers when he goes on to say that ``if there were, one
could do worse than to lay much of what has happened in
late-20th-century America to the corrosive effects of entertainment
rather than to the effects of politics or economics.'' This is a
large claim. Does Gabler back it up?
</P>
<P>
   Partly. Following Postman, he has a fine old time showing how
entertainment values have come to permeate every nook and cranny of
American life. Gabler traces the rise of entertainment, which he
characterizes as ``fun, effortless, sensational, mindless,
formulaic, predictable and subversive,'' from its humble beginnings
in 19th-century low or popular cultural forms like band music,
penny dreadfuls, melodramas, variety acts, the yellow press and, of
course, the early nickelodeons to its eventual triumph over high
culture, transforming America into what he calls ``the Republic of
Entertainment.'' How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   First, Gabler says, came the ``graphic revolution'' at the turn
of the century, when photographs made inroads into print media and
``image-thinking'' replaced reasoning, nurtured by the old culture
of typography. Eventually, moving images replaced static ones, and
entertainment swept everything before it -- not only logic but also
character, which became personality, and the work ethic, which gave
way to celebrity. The boundaries between real and unreal became
increasingly permeable until they broke down altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Citing everyone from Baudrillard to Warhol, Gabler aims to show
that nothing has remained safe from the virus of entertainment.
Indeed, it is impossible to put down this book unconvinced of the
cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of American life.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler makes particularly short work of American politics, for
example, effortlessly showing how, beginning with John F. Kennedy
and reaching an apotheosis with Ronald Reagan, entertainment has
replaced substance. It is his great insight to see that Reagan's
habit of confusing the plots of old movies with reality was not a
manifestation of senility but rather the ineluctable working out of
a seismic cultural change. He concludes that political candidates
have become stars, primaries casting calls, campaigns auditions,
the electorate no more than an audience. Gabler even refers to
issues as ``MacGuffins,'' Alfred Hitchcock's term for irrelevant
plot devices, and borrowing from the New Yorker writer Kurt
Andersen, he calls President Clinton the ``Entertainer-in-Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   But an idea can be a dangerous thing, as someone once said, and
as Gabler gallops through the pages of American history in search
of evidence to fit his thesis, he rides his horse into the ground.
``The real political revolution of the 1980's,'' he argues, was not
``the much-bruited-about demise of postwar liberalism and the rise
of conservatism but the triumph of entertainment over political
ideology of any sort.'' This is absurd, and points to one of the
problems with Gabler's argument. He seems to feel that
entertainment trumps ideology.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MOVIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: trumps ideology.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment does have powerful imperatives, but they have not
(yet) overwhelmed traditional ideologies. To be simplistic, it
helps to think of entertainment as a delivery system that can carry
ideologies of all political stripes, left, right and center. The
left, for example, has its own music, say, Bruce Springsteen, and
its movies (Oliver Stone), while the right has its Christian rock
and Rambo. The biggest blockbuster (read: most entertaining) of all
time, ``Titanic,'' was so loaded with working-class sentimentality,
Beverly Hills style, that if the ship hadn't hit an iceberg, its
ideological baggage would have sunk it anyway. Often the medium's
message, to use McLuhan's famous formulation of Gabler's thesis,
reinforces the ideology it conveys. Sometimes it contradicts it,
creating art or entertainment divided against itself, fun of a
different kind -- for campus deconstructionists.
</P>
<P>
   As for reality being swallowed up by entertainment, surely
Clinton's favorable ratings in the face of Monicagate suggest not
that Americans have confused his tribulations with a soap opera
but, on the contrary, that they are well able to distinguish
between entertainment and reality and that they do not want the
President cashiered. When Mike Nichols's film adaptation of
``Primary Colors,'' Klein's best-selling novelization of his
experiences reporting on the 1992 primaries, flopped in the wake of
the Lewinsky revelations, it was because reality had eclipsed
fiction, not because it had become fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In the traditional formulation, life precedes and inspires art,
but in moments of high historical drama the spectacle of reality
has often surpassed art. This is why, in the 60's, documentaries
flourished and theatrical films like those of John Cassavetes and
Martin Scorsese tried to incorporate news footage or otherwise
approximate the look of documentary. This is one of the reasons
that features did not succeed in dealing fictively with the Vietnam
War until well after it was over. This is also why dog-wagging
incidents like John Hinckley's attempt on Reagan's life, inspired
by ``Taxi Driver,'' still seem so transgressive.
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, ``Life the Movie'' doesn't tell the
whole story. Still, it tells a big part of it. It's a thoughtful,
in places chilling, account of the way entertainment values have
hollowed out American life and if not supplanted reality, at least
threatened it.

 &UR; UNSTRUNG HEROES
</P>
<P>
   BY EDWARD HOWER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ghost of a young woman named Lydia Dent appears in the
opening pages of ``The Travelling Hornplayer.'' And one of the
pleasures of this witty, often moving novel is watching her
reappear again and again -- not as a ghost but as a memory, pulling
the other characters toward their destinies.
</P>
<P>
   The book's South African-born author, Barbara Trapido (a
longtime resident of England), makes Lydia and her sister, Ellen,
an appealing pair of teen-age siblings. In flashbacks, they cheer
each other up when their mother deserts the family. They also enjoy
listening to the sounds of lovemaking when visiting their grown-up
gay half brother and his companion -- ``POW! BASH! BAM! noises''
like those made by comic-book heroes ``in uppercase balloons.'' The
two girls raise the morale of their lonely father, the headmaster
of a public school, by cooking him fudge and teasing him with tales
of their racy (and imaginary) adventures, about which he obligingly
pretends to be shocked. Later, Ellen's fondness for her father will
deepen as they struggle to recover from the loss of her sister.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Lydia is killed in a traffic accident, she is on her
way to visit a high-profile novelist, Jonathan Goldman, hoping to
show him a school paper about the poet Wilhelm Muller entitled
``Love and Death at the Mill: Twenty Poems From the Posthumous
Papers of a Travelling Hornplayer.'' Jonathan -- who, like Lydia,
enjoys German Romantic poetry -- doesn't care for the quaint
Cotswold village he and his family have moved to following his
literary success. He finds the Neighborhood Watch committee ``a
bourgeois vigilante organization: a smuggies' club for people with
too much stuff.'' What's worse, he can't seem to work in his very
own home: ``The house is so pleasing to the eye that I spend the
whole time staring at the walls while eating too many biscuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan is bright, perceptive, funny. He's also flagrantly
unfaithful to his long-suffering wife. But he's redeemed by his
patient love for his extremely difficult daughter, Stella. As a
child, Stella is sickly and inept, tormented at school for her
inability to read. She can also be ungrateful to her mother,
Katherine, who has given up her personal life to help Stella become
``her one, onerous, unlikely work of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella, reaching adolescence, finally blossoms. When her
grandmother gives her a cello, the girl's life changes radically.
She now has a purpose: music. She makes friends and is a lot nicer
to her adoring parents. Despite her dyslexia, she's accepted as a
student at Edinburgh University, where she meets Ellen and also a
gentle, damaged aristocrat named Pen, who wants to marry her. The
author charts Stella's dramatic development with great sensitivity.
In fact, all three of Trapido's major characters -- Ellen, Jonathan
and Stella, each of whom takes a turn at the narration -- are
skillfully drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Trapido creates some wickedly amusing minor characters as well.
Stella's sweet, dotty mother-in-law does charity work at a prison,
where she finds the drug dealers ``charming. . . . Terribly nice,
you know. Especially the Caribbeans. Lovely smiles.'' Jonathan's
girlfriend, Sonia, a tireless self-promoter, wears a kinky
hard-rubber outfit to an assignation, which for him makes the
experience ``like trying to commit sex with an armadillo.''
Jonathan's older brother, Roger, is an eccentric professor who
wanders about the house naked, urinates into jars in the bedroom
and scorches frying pans while scrambling eggs with bloody liver.
Stella's artist boyfriend, Izzy, is a study in solipsistic
hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
   A problem develops when some of the over-the-top minor players
meet up with the more realistically drawn major ones. Our credulity
is strained when libidinous Sonia somehow becomes a trusted friend
of the reconciled Jonathan and Katherine. It's also difficult to
believe that Roger, the demented don, can suddenly seem like a
``dreamboat'' to Ellen. And it's hard to watch Stella, who has come
so far, risk her life with the reckless Izzy.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these unlikely meetings occur because the plot becomes
increasingly contrived toward the end of the book. For most of the
novel, however, Barbara Trapido keeps us happily engaged in the
lives of her clever, warmhearted characters.

   A Candid Biography of Robert F. Kennedy.

 &UR; POLITICAL AFFAIRS
</P>
<P>
   BY JOHN JUDIS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When I was an editor of a Marxist theoretical journal in the
early 1970's, we often joked that we should add the words ``and
sex'' to the titles of our weighty essays to make them more
attractive to the general reader. It would be ``The Fiscal Crisis
of the State and Sex'' and ``The Triumph of Bourgeois Hegemony and
Sex.'' On that principle, though without a hint of humor, C. David
Heymann's biography of Robert F. Kennedy could have been called
``RFK and Sex.'' ``RFK'' amply covers Robert Kennedy's rumored
affairs, but there is also an orgy of details about the alleged
dalliances of John F. Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, Edward M. Kennedy,
Peter Lawford, Steven Smith, Ethel Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann, the author of an ``intimate biography'' of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis and another of Elizabeth Taylor, writes
competently. But here his political account is entirely
conventional: Robert Kennedy, after his brother's death, emerges as
the tribune of a new ``humane 'liberalism.' '' This probably didn't
need reiteration. What is novel about this ``candid biography'' may
increase book sales but not the understanding of its subject. A
politician's sex life and love affairs can certainly be important
to understanding his character and his conduct in office. Garry
Wills in ``The Kennedy Imprisonment'' and Seymour M. Hersh in ``The
Dark Side of Camelot'' attempt to demonstrate that John Kennedy's
manner of dealing with women was symptomatic of a flaw in his
character and affected his Presidency. Heymann, too, occasionally
makes such connections, but they are overshadowed by a pageant of
unanalyzed naughty anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of two pages of a chapter called ``Sex,'' for instance, are
devoted to extended quotations from Doris Lilly, whom Heymann
describes as a ``society columnist'' (``One of Steve Smith's most
passionate affairs'' was with a woman ``who happened to be the best
girlfriend'' of one of the Kennedy brothers' lovers). We also hear
Truman Capote's musings about the size of the Kennedy brothers'
penises. ``I've seen an awful lot of them,'' he says, ``and if you
put all the Kennedys together, you wouldn't have a good one.''
Later we are treated to a former ballerina's claim that she saw
Robert Kennedy and Rudolf Nureyev ``kissing passionately'' in a
telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sheer wealth of Heymann's anecdotal material
demonstrates that Robert Kennedy did indeed fool around, but
Heymann often relies on single sources who turn out not to have
personally witnessed what they describe, or to have had an animus.
He recounts that Kennedy in the mid-1950's, when he worked for the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, would accompany
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics on raids in New York. Citing a New
York lawyer, Howard Diller, Heymann suggests that Kennedy took
drugs and raped women during these raids. But Diller's actual
statement involves third-hand information -- what he had heard that
agents ``purportedly'' said. Nor does Diller seem particularly
dispassionate. Kennedy, he says, ``struck me as basically
schizophrenic. . . . Caligula seemed mild by comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Heymann casually endorses the theory that President John
Kennedy's assassination involved a ``second gunman and a
mob-controlled hit.'' And he speculates that Robert Kennedy's
killer might not have acted alone. If that weren't enough, he
introduces a new conspiracy involving Marilyn Monroe, with whom he
says Robert as well as John Kennedy had a love affair. Robert
Kennedy, he writes, ``very likely had conspired in the murder of
his former lover, the nation's premier cinema star.'' Heymann
relies on Peter Lawford's account of a conversation between Robert
Kennedy and Monroe's psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson: '' 'Marilyn
has got to be silenced,' Bobby told Greenson -- or words to that
effect.'' Heymann doesn't say how Lawford was apprised of this
private exchange, or remark on the telling qualification, ``or
words to that effect.'' He further claims that Greenson, at
Kennedy's prompting, gave Monroe an injection that, mixed with the
sleeping pills that she was taking, killed her. The police never
discovered evidence of the injection; Heymann explains this away,
of course, but I'll leave the details to readers interested in
tabloid speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann often makes the worst out of Robert Kennedy's pre-60's
political career, calling it ``characterized by one savage vendetta
after another.'' But Kennedy's work for Senator Joseph R. McCarthy
was fairly tame -- he was mainly concerned with foreign vessels
trading with China during the Korean War -- and his crusade against
labor racketeering benefited the nation and the labor movement.
(Heymann sheds no light on the obvious question about Robert
Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General -- why he so energetically
prosecuted organized crime figures on whom he and his brother
relied in trying to get rid of Castro.)
</P>
<P>
   Heymann equally exaggerates the political virtue of the later
Robert Kennedy. He contends that John Kennedy's death transformed
Robert Kennedy into a kinder, gentler being. He contrasts Robert
Kennedy's humane liberalism with the ``reactive'' and ``supremely
pragmatic'' politics of his brother. But Heymann does not
appreciate the limits under which President Kennedy -- and by
extension his Attorney General -- had to operate. Kennedy barely
defeated Richard Nixon in 1960 and had to contend with a Congress
in which conservative Southern Democrats held the balance of power.
With John Kennedy's murder, Bobby Kennedy was not freed from his
brother's political shadow, but from executive responsibility. He
could say what he wanted, and could do so in a country and a
Congress that was, briefly, moving to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Heymann embraces the myth that if Robert Kennedy had lived we
would not have seen the Nixon and Reagan Presidencies. I don't
think that's likely. If anything, the Republicans were able to
exploit white reaction to the liberal passions for black
advancement that Bobby Kennedy so exactly embodied. While Senator
Edward Kennedy was, of course, crippled by Chappaquiddick, it is
worth recalling the similar false hopes that initially surrounded
his Presidential candidacy in 1980. But such historical judgments
are certainly debatable, and Heymann's interpretation of Robert
Kennedy's political career and legacy is defensible. What is not
defensible is the way he deals with the rest of Kennedy's life.

   A True Story of Race in America.

 &UR; THE PRACTICE
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD D. KAHLENBERG
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mungin had done everything right to succeed in
corporate America. Raised by a single African-American mother in a
housing project in Queens, he'd worked hard in high school and,
against the odds, attended Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
Though he faced instances of racism, he didn't dwell on them. He
shunned the all-black groups in college and law school and
befriended large numbers of whites. His mother had taught him,
``You are a human being first, an American second, a black third.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a practicing lawyer, he found things starting to go awry,
as the Wall Street Journal reporter Paul M. Barrett explains in
this riveting and heart-rending book. Barrett, who roomed with his
subject in law school, skillfully and dispassionately tells
Mungin's story in ``The Good Black,'' with chapters alternating
among present, recent past and distant past.
</P>
<P>
   After he had served as an associate at two prestigious law
firms, Mungin's life took a turn for the worse when he joined the
Washington office of a second-tier Chicago firm, Katten Muchin &AMP;
Zavis. He was left out of important meetings. He was given
insulting assignments, more appropriate for a paralegal than a
senior associate. He was denied regular contact with clients. He
was not formally evaluated as promised and was told by one partner,
``You fell between the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Mungin singled out because of his race? This was the key
issue when he decided to sue Katten Muchin. Our civil rights laws
do not protect against mere mistreatment. During debate over the
1964 Civil Rights Act, one leading sponsor in the Senate, Hubert
Humphrey, noted that the act ``does not limit the employer's
freedom to hire, fire, promote or demote for any reasons -- or for
no reasons -- so long as his action is not based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Katten Muchin's primary defense was not that it treated Mungin
well but that it mistreated everyone. The defense, Barrett notes,
``decided to make a virtue of Katten Muchin's tendency to handle
its associates shabbily,'' arguing: ``White attorneys, white
support staff, all had the same complaints. . . . They, too, had to
suffer the nonsense of those partners.''
</P>
<P>
   MUNGIN could point to no racial epithets, no memos indicating
discrimination. On the contrary, he and his lawyers cited a number
of memos and conversations in which his race was mentioned as a
positive attribute. Typical was a hiring partner discussing Mungin
with another lawyer: ``Harvard-Harvard. . . . He's perfect! And
he's black.''
</P>
<P>
   A predominantly black jury awarded $2.5 million in damages. Was
this a jury that couldn't tell the difference between affirmative
action and racism? Or did it feel that a poorly conceived
affirmative action program could coexist with -- indeed, perpetuate
-- discrimination by justifying unchallenging assignments and a
reluctance to evaluate? Mungin believed that he was seen as ``a
racial token'' rather than as ``a real lawyer,'' but white appeals
court judges nullified the jury verdict, finding it not
``reasonable.'' One of Mungin's own lawyers told Barrett it was
``questionable'' whether Mungin's mistreatment was related to race.
Barrett concludes that the case ``presented a close question.''
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniable, however, that the firm's mishandling of Larry
Mungin left him broken and disillusioned, off the corporate
partnership track and instead practicing law as a temp-lawyer for
$14 an hour. His case, and this book, raise a larger, serious
question seldom asked in this country: Even apart from racial bias,
shouldn't employees who are wronged have some sort of legal
recourse? Should employers really be able to fire people or abuse
them for ``no reason''?
</P>
<P>
   The pure free-market response says that employers who mistreat
employees will lose good talent and eventually be driven out of
business. But in the racial context, that logic was rejected when
we passed antidiscrimination legislation. In a nation where a
dwindling number of employees are protected by unions, perhaps
Larry Mungin and his white counterparts should be protected from
gross mistreatment by employers as well. Isn't it time we expand
our cramped notion of civil rights to include a fuller array of
human rights?

 &UR; LOST MAN OF THE LOST GENERATION
</P>
<P>
   BY ROBERT KIELY
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part we were not interested in social problems,
in economics or in any particular political complex. . . . We were
the Romantics of the 20th century.'' So wrote Eugene Jolas of the
cosmopolitan literary and aptistic world he inhabited, observed and
contributed to in the Paris of the 1920's.
</P>
<P>
   Given the legacy of World War I and the tensions building in
Europe at the time, the comment sounds arrogant and insular. Jolas
seems nostalgic, not apologetic, about a period of willful
blindness. Yet while it is true that nostalgia informs many moments
in this memoir of an extraordinary life in an extraordinary time,
Jolas was anything but a blind participant in events of the first
half of the 20th century. The statement is a typically honest
recollection by a person who did not forget the past or
sentimentalize the future, but who by disposition, personal history
and profession was an acute recorder of moods and events in rapidly
shifting times.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Jolas was born in Union City, N.J., in 1894 of a German
mother and a French father from Alsace-Lorraine. His parents
returned to their native town of Forbach when Jolas was still an
infant. He was raised in a bilingual family, educated in German at
Roman Catholic schools and surrounded by French-speaking neighbors.
Nothing in his eventful life seems to have marked him more than
this early experience of a cultural and political border tense with
instability and burdened by a history of conflicting allegiances
and ideals. Even after he immigrated to America (he was a citizen
by birth), he continued to associate the word ``frontier'' with a
complex and fateful inheritance from the past rather than with
opportunity and hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jolas returned to the Unitdd States at 15, lived with relatives
and took odd jobs as a messenger in New York City. Despite low pay
and hard living, he loved the variety and bustle of the city.
Instead of two languages, he heard dozens. He relished the accents
and atmosphere of Hell'{ Kitchen, Chinatown, Flatbush and Prospect
Park. When he heard the story of another immigrant boy, Joseph
Pulitzer, he decided to be a newspaperman. He wandered from city to
city taking any tasks a paper would offer, and between jobs he
slept on park benches, sharing hunger and stories with others out
of work. There is something Dreiseresque in the cold chaotic whirl
of Jolas's American city at the turn of the century, but there is
nothing of Dreiser in Jolas's outlook. He sounds more like the
Artful Dodger. Where others might fall into despair, he inevitably
finds reason for hope and even a kind of irrepressible
cheerfulness.
</P>
<P>
   His first serious job was with a German-language newspaper in
Pittsburgh. The teen-ager arrived hungry and alone in what at the
time must have been one of America's least appealing cities: ``I
arrived in Pittsburgh on a cold, snowy February evening. The tall
chimneys of the steel mills and glass factories pierced the sky.
Blast furnaces belched soot and smoke. I felt exhilarated by the
lurid cosmos, the cloudy world of industry, grandiose and
Dantesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Jolas began writing his memoirs in the 30's and continued
through World War II, it is possible that the older maj casts a
golden haze over the hardships of his youth. Still, his capacity
not only for survivah but also for taking genuine pleasure in the
unexpected shifts of fate that might have defeated a more fragile
psyche seems to have remained with him throughout his life. It is a
trait that helped make him one of the outstanding journalists of
his day and may have prevented his brooding American-French-German
philosophical poetry from possessing the originality and
authenticity of his English prose.
</P>
<P>
   The writing, even in this unfinished memoir, will strike any
reader. Jolas began dictating chapters to his wife, Maria, in the
late 30's or early 40's and continued intermittently until his
death in 1952. It was in the 1980's that Maria brought these papers
to uhe attention of the editors of ``Man From Babel,'' Andreas
Krames and Rainer Rumold.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else he was doing, Jolas also found time to write
verse. His memoir is punctuated by samples of it. Strongly
influenced by the German Romantics and the French avant-garde, as
well as by Whitman and Hart Crane, he longed to universalize his
incurable homesickness -- for Europe when he was in America, for
America when he was in Europe -- and consequently his restless need
to keep moving, which he considered ``an immigrant neurosis.'' He
was obsessed by language, and, like many of his generation, he
borrowed Freudian terminology to label if not explain his inner
conflicts, including the linguistic ones between the literary and
the idiomatic, French and German, American slang and standard
English. ``Language became a neurosis,'' he writes at the outset as
if to alert us to the pathology that will provide consistency to a
life divided between continents and interrupted by two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   If language was his neurosis, he turns it -- much as he did the
sidewalks of New York, the smokestacks of Pittsburgh, the bordellos
of Savannah -- to his advantage as a reporter. In the 20's he found
himself writing for the Paris edition of The Chicago Tribune. He
seemed to be everywhere in Paris at once -- in the right hotel
lobby for the entrance of Gloria Swanson, in the right bar to
overhear drunken conversations of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in
the right park to see Ernest Hemingway take his son for a walk:
``He usually wore workman's clothes and was always most careful to
avoid being taken for a literary man. . . . He seemed to have a
preference for intermingling his vocabulary with strong four-letter
words. Frequently, however, these gave the impression of being
carefully calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BABEL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: carefully calculated.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Jolas was more than a literary gossip columnist. He was
deeply interested in the esthetic avant-garde of the 20's; he was a
defender of Dadaism and Surrealism and of any effort to break
language and the arts away from the cliches of conventional light
entertainment. Not long after his arrival in Paris, he was asked to
take over from Ford Madox Ford the writing of The Tribune's
literary column, ``Rambles Through Literary Paris.'' During
interviews and by attending readings, he met everyone -- James
Joyce, Francois Mauriac, Andre Breton, Gertrude Stein, Sinclair
Lewis, Andre Gide -- and quickly became not only an observer but an
actor in the Paris scene.
</P>
<P>
   His most important and influential contribution to the literary
life of the times was his founding and editing of Transition, a
journal dedicated to the publication of avant-garde works and, of
equal importance to the trilingual Jolas, the exposure between the
same covers of Continental, American and British experiments in
language. In a manifesto published in the third issue in 1927,
Jolas expressed himself with characteristic expansiveness: ``We
need new words, new abstractions, new hieroglyphics, new symbols,
new myths.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the closest and most important of his many literary
friends was Joyce, with whom Jolas shared a nostalgia for an
impossible homeland and a fascination with the meeting and mingling
of alien languages. Jolas became a defender of Joyce's radical
linguistic experiments and published excerpts of ``Work in
Progress'' (early fragments of ``Finnegans Wake'') in Transition.
But he also came to know a side of Joyce few outside his closest
circle of friends would ever see. He saw the lover of Italian
opera; the introverted celebrity who refused to be interviewed but
who could talk and sing into the night with those he trusted; the
aloof literary giant who wished readers would be more appreciative
of his humor (and said, ``in riso veritas''); the grieving father
tormented by his daughter's mental illness. Like all good
reporters, Jolas could capture a personality in a moment and a
phrase. Recalling an evening with Joyce in a Parisian restaurant,
he noticed at a nearby table Picasso, Breton and Jacques Prevert.
``Informed of their presence, Joyce did not look up.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jolas's English was supple and fluent, some of his most
pointed vignettes depend on what he considered untranslatable
expressions. Whenever the French printer of ``Work in Progress''
heard that Joyce was about to send in yet another addition or
correction, he threw up his hands and shouted, ``Joyce, alors!'' --
so often that it became for him all one name. When the Paris police
booked several writers for an unruly clash between the Romantics
and the Surrealists, Jolas loved the fact that the official charge
was bagarre entre intellectuels. At the end of World War II, when
Jolas was in Germany working for the Office of War Information, he
encountered two Jewish brothers who had lost their father in
Dachau; he quotes but deliberately does not translate their words
to him: ``Wir mochten nach Israel auswandern.''
</P>
<P>
   A gain and again, Jolas reveals not only his sharp eye and ready
ear for a good story but also his sensitivity to human suffering
and injustice. Having cheerfully rejected politics in the
avant-garde carnival of literary Paris in the 20's, he, unlike many
others of the time, did not lurch toward Fascism or Communism in
the 30's. His experience of America had imprinted on him democratic
longings and a tolerance for difference that he eventually saw to
be in conflict with the idealized nationalism and racism of the
German Romantic poets he had once so admired. When he returned to
the frontier land of his parents to help establish a free press in
postwar Germany, he faced not only the devastation of people,
landscape and language but also a past poetic self that had been
deaf to what the mature journalist took to be chillingly clear. ``I
found a definite predilection among the Romantics for the
totalitarian state, for anti-Semitism and for . . . Pan-Germanic
dementia.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be too simple to say that in Jolas's conflicted life
the American journalist triumphed over the German poet, the
modernist over the Romantic, the practical good-humored survivor
over the melancholy dreamer. Outwardly this all seems to be true.
Yet the poetry of abstract angst continued to be written. And there
was a private, inner life -- marriage, children, his complex
relationship to Roman Catholicism -- that is barely touched on in
this action-packed memoir. Like so many modern expatriates, Jolas
took on many attributes of a new world without ever letting go of
the old. Finding Forbach, his ancestral home, in ruins in 1945, he
wrote: ``I realized that throughout my wandering life I had been in
constant flight from this land of restless frontier-shifting. . . .
And yet in the American world something had continued to live in me
that was part of this medieval night.''

 A WEREWOLF PROBLEM IN CENTRAL RUSSIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Other Stories.
</P>
<P>
   By Victor Pelevin. Translated by Andrew Bromfield.

 &UR; HOWL
</P>
<P>
   BY RICHARD LOURIE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although I have been tracking Russia and its literature for
something like 40 years, it was my son, a year younger than
37-year-old Victor Pelevin, who gave me the key to this collection
of antic and enigmatic stories. When I questioned him about his
generation, which seems bafflingly at ease with both seat belts and
heroin, he replied that in a world of bits and pieces everyone was
assembling those fragments into individual mosaics in a search for
meaning. That remark also lit up the post-Soviet, post-modern world
of Victor Pelevin.
</P>
<P>
   The author of four other books available in English (``The Blue
Lantern,'' ``Omon Ra,'' ``The Yellow Arrow'' and ``The Life of
Insects''), Pelevin is the freshest voice to emerge from the rubble
of Soviet Russia. The verbal mosaics he makes from its bits and
pieces sometimes constellate into patterns of pain, hilarity and
beauty; at other times they seem as pointless as the piles of
detritus exhibited in hip galleries. One could easily imagine
Pelevin being read avidly in a cyber-cafe in Alexanderplatz or Los
Feliz, but the German would probably understand him better than the
Angeleno. However, the danger with Pelevin is to overglobalize him
-- his roots are deeply Russian, and though much of his manner and
message will resonate with rootless international youth, nuances,
like politics, ultimately prove local.
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin, in fact, belongs to one strand of the great Russian
tradition that goes back as far as Gogol and Dostoyevsky, in which
metaphysical intuitions about the mystery of existence clash with
the grotesque banalities of life as it is actually lived. He has
borrowed a bit from Tolstoy's doctrine of ostranenie, ``making it
strange,'' in an effort to illuminate and redeem the mess of daily
life -- which is nowhere messier than in today's Russia. And he has
certainly imbibed the ``fantastic realism'' of Andrei Sinyavsky,
who wrote under the pseudonym Abram Tertz and who in stories like
``Pkhentz'' described the adventures of an extraterrestrial whose
spaceship has crashed in the Soviet Union and who must live in
disguise as an ordinary citizen, his multiple eye-covered limbs
arranged as a hunch on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin is also affiliated with the feverish metaphysics of the
writers of Russia's silver age, the last desperate flare of
creative culture in the years preceding the Revolution. He is well
aware of the occultists who were the rage at the time, like Madame
Blavatsky and G. I. Gurdjieff, and even makes reference to them in
the story ``Vera Pavlovna's Ninth Dream,'' in which an aging female
lavatory attendant struggles to understand both perestroika and the
nature of solipsism. In yet another story, Gurdjieff's idea that
all humanity is essentially asleep serves as the conceit for a
satire on the mass hypnosis of Communist society and on life in
general, sleep being a ``kind of universal joint on which people's
entire lives turned.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pelevin can be classified as an esoteric satirist,
someone searching for the meaning of existence while lashing out
with a merry ferocity at the more absurd forms that life has
adopted in his native land. ``Bulldozer Driver's Day,'' for
example, takes place in a closed Soviet city where nuclear weapons
are assembled so sloppily that children are born with three legs
from the leakage of radiation. The hero of the story, Ivan, has
been knocked silly by a bomb that fell on him at work on the
assembly line, ``referred to as the 'medium-soft plush toy shop.'
'' (The actual Soviet nuclear weapons program was part of the
Ministry of Medium Machine Building.) Some of these ``in'' jokes
travel better than others. In the same story, we are introduced to
'' 'Partai-chi' . . . an entire complex of movements allowing even
an individual of the very sharpest mental acuity to tune his mind
for the faultless exposition of the party line.'' This story is
probably best suited for domestic consumption, or for those
initiated into the arcana of what used to be called ``Soviet
reality'' and must now logically be ``the former Soviet reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The title story of this collection is the most perfectly
realized of the eight narratives. Here a youth named Sasha stumbles
upon a group of people with the ability to turn themselves into
wolves -- a plot device that is used not to make the obvious point
about man's beastliness but rather to reconnect with the elemental
vitality of life. Having himself become a wolf, Sasha realizes that
people ``couldn't feel the meaning of life in the same way as they
felt the wind or the cold. But now Sasha was able to feel it, he
felt the meaning of life continuously and clearly as an eternal
quality of the world itself, and that was the greatest charm of his
present condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasha's sensual awareness also becomes exquisitely heightened.
And this transformation is so beautifully and authoritatively
rendered that the reader feels similarly transported into the world
of wolf consciousness: ``Two hares swept by like a jet plane,
leaving a thick trail of scent which made it clear that they were
frightened to death and that one of them was also a total idiot.''
When Sasha asks the leader of the pack, ``What are werewolves,
really?'' the leader looks him in the eye and, baring his teeth,
replies, ``What are people, really?'' After all the questioning and
ideas, for man and for wolves nothing remains but to howl ``about
the incomprehensible beauty of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelevin writes very well, and his prose has been sparklingly
rendered into English by Andrew Bromfield. Even when Pelevin's
youthful qualities lapse into the merely juvenile, as in ``Tai Shou
Chuan USSR (A Chinese Folk Tale),'' which begins with a sort of
stoned-in-the-dorm premise (``As everyone knows, our universe is
located in the teapot of a certain Lui Dunbin who sells trinkets at
the bazaar in Chanyan''), there are instances of marvelous
invention -- black swans that are actually enchanted K.G.B. agents,
a crack paratroop division called the Brothers Karamazov.
</P>
<P>
   But Pelevin at his best can open a story with a sentence that is
both startling and convincing, immediately creating a world. ``The
Tarzan Swing'' begins: ``The wide boulevard and the houses standing
along both its sides were like the lower jaw of an old Bolshevik
who, late in life, has arrived at democratic views.'' The hero of
the story, Pyotr Petrovich, opines on the nature of belief: ``It's
like having something to hold on to in the bus. It doesn't matter
what it is as long as you don't fall.'' Still, he says, there are
limits: ``It's too late for believing in God. If I suddenly start
believing now it'll be dishonest somehow. . . . So instead of that
I believe in Herbalife or the separation of powers.'' In the end,
he comes to a typically Pelevinian realization: ``Sometimes it
seems to me there is a part of the soul which sleeps all the time
and only wakes for a few seconds on summer nights, in order to peep
out and remember something as it used to be long ago, in a
different place -- dark blue skies . . . stars . . . mystery. . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Churchill, post-Soviet Russia is a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside a Pelevin.

   The Unmaking of Elvis Presley.
</P>

   By Peter Guralnick.
</P>

   Illustrated. 766 pp. Boston: Little, Brown. $27.95.

 &UR; HEARTBREAK HOTEL
</P>
<P>
   BY GERALD MARZORATI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LET'S get a little loud. Peter Guralnick's two-volume life of
Elvis Aron Presley, of which ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis
Presley'' is the second installment, is not simply the finest
rock-and-roll biography ever written. It must be ranked among the
most ambitious and crucial biographical undertakings yet devoted to
a major American figure of the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear the chorus. Ambitious? Ambitious like Robert Caro's
exhaustively researched biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson, the
first two volumes of which have yet to bring the 36th President of
the United States to the door of the White House? Crucial? Crucial
like Taylor Branch's two-thirds completed and already majestic
chronicle of Martin Luther King Jr., probably the man of his time
most essential to the nation's unfolding history?
</P>
<P>
   Let's drive it home. This is what a serious literary biographer
of Elvis Presley has to confront: a subject who did his greatest
work before his 23d birthday, who never wrote a deep-reaching word
about himself and remained largely aloof from his times, even as he
informed them. He is also a figure who, 21 years after his
drug-steeped death in a bathroom at Graceland, remains a staple of
both the supermarket tabloids and of recondite academic papers that
smother him with more radical socio-cultural significance -- Elvis
the Transgressive -- than he can possibly carry. There was so
little for Guralnick to work with, it would seem, and so much to
rescue Elvis from.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick has long been one of the country's more thoughtful
writers about its various musics, and what he set out to do, I
think, was to find a place for Presley in the mainstream story of
America -- to portray not a wiggling, unwitting deconstructionist
or someone who wound up a freak with a massive following, but a
figure of deep American colorations, effervescent and then so
quickly and utterly sad, who got the life he desired and willed,
both on the way up and for much of the long slide down. And what
dramatizes Presley's life for Guralnick, what lends it emotional
complexity and resonance, is the essential American drama -- the
tug between home and flight, acquiescence and rebellion,
conventions and their transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   An artist is engaged not so much with resolving emotional
conflicts as with expressing them, and in the 1950's that is
exactly what Presley did. As Guralnick introduced him in his
exhilarating first volume, ``Last Train to Memphis'' (1994), Elvis
was a mama's boy and something of a tough, was God-inspired but
hated commandments, couldn't wait to break out of Memphis and
couldn't go anywhere else without a phalanx of boyhood friends. He
also swung wildly between agonizing self-doubt and Emersonian
ecstasies -- and it's all there, in the work. In his early
recordings, in movies like ``Jailhouse Rock'' and especially in his
live performances of the 50's, Presley stirred up as audacious and
incendiary a mixture of the pious and profane, the communal and the
libertine, the constricted (a few chords and a backbeat) and the
boundless (think of ``Mystery Train'') as the culture had ever
encountered. But he hadn't thought he was making art. He had
thought he was becoming Elvis. Herein lay the seed of the
``unmaking'' in Guralnick's subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   The book picks up his story in the fall of 1958, with Private
Presley completing his Army hitch in Germany. This period has
commonly been understood as the King's quiet interregnum, but, as
Guralnick carefully details, it was during Presley's 17 months
overseas that all the pieces were put in place for his awful end.
The plan Presley and his hucksterish business manager, Thomas
Parker (a k a the Colonel), had agreed to -- and then sold to the
Army -- went like this: In the interests of military esprit de
corps and public morale back home, Presley would go about things
like any draftee. No performances, no recording sessions, no
rock-and-roll. Meanwhile, Elvis's record label, RCA, would package,
release and (went the reasoning) use up recordings already in the
can (thereby putting Presley in a prime negotiating position when
he mustered out), while the Colonel worked his Barnumesque magic in
Hollywood, playing the studios against one another for his client's
services. The plan worked. The singles continued to top the charts,
album sales held steady, earnings for good-soldier Elvis approached
$2 million a year, and there were deals for three pictures awaiting
him when he returned to Memphis to the wails of crazed fans in the
spring of 1960. He was golden, and doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Being Elvis no longer meant singing, stomping and venting at the
delirious edge of a stage or in intensely inspired recording
sessions with first-rate sidemen. It meant showing up -- a couple
of weeks on the set to make a lousy movie (``Girls! Girls!
Girls!,'' ``Kissin' Cousins''), then a couple of days in the studio
to complete a lackluster soundtrack, which is what an Elvis album
became in the 60's. ``Nothing could be simpler or more logical: the
soundtrack album promoted the movie release, the movie release
guaranteed a certain level of sales and publicity for the album,''
Guralnick writes. Touring? Live audiences? He was still making the
charts and the big bucks -- who needed them? Only Elvis, his
roiling inner self, but he had no way of knowing. All the acuity
had been spent getting him to precisely where he was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-PRESLEY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: where he was.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Presley had more time on his hands through the 60's than anyone
should have, and an undiminished store of soul-tangled
restlessness. He played a lot with the buddies and hangers-on, the
so-called Memphis Mafia, whom he paid to keep around him, whether
at Graceland or out in Los Angeles at this or that mansion he
called home while he was shooting his movies. There was karate,
touch football, party after party and, when things got stale,
making out with the other guys' girlfriends (this is a man in his
30's, understand).
</P>
<P>
   There were always young women around, and they tended to fall
into two categories: the ones Presley went to bed with and the ones
Presley went to bed with and just talked to, at least in the
beginning. The latter tended to be on the young side, barely
teen-agers in a couple of cases, and Presley would nuzzle them and
explain to them what he had been reading -- cosmology texts,
``Autobiography of a Yogi,'' the Physicians' Desk Reference. He
would also sometimes talk about how lonely he was -- he missed his
mother, whose death just before he was shipped off to Germany he
had never really got over -- and how strangely unsatisfied he felt
with his life. But he would not talk like this for long or too
deeply. He was Elvis, after all. What was there to complain about?
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Beaulieu had been one of the young ones -- just a
14-year-old Air Force brat when Elvis met her during his tour of
duty in Germany. Not long after, she joined him at Graceland (the
Colonel worked hard to keep that quiet), and after enduring several
years of his ``saving'' her until she got older, to say nothing of
his mood swings and endless affairs, she married him in the spring
of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Presley was also seriously attached to amphetamines,
which he had also discovered in Germany. He tended to ingest them
late in the afternoon, which is when he liked to rise, and then on
through the night, when, with dawn approaching, he would switch to
sleeping pills and crash, frequently in the mothering arms of
someone not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, his habit, or habits, did not prevent him from
railing against drugs and seeking a sanctioned role in the
government's war against them. Some of Guralnick's most meticulous
research is devoted to reconstructing Presley's surreal December
1970 trip to Washington -- one of his few forays outside the
Memphis-Hollywood-Las Vegas axis -- during which he managed to
arrange an Oval Office visit with President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief exchange, they agreed that the Beatles were largely
to blame for the scourge of dissent and drug use in the United
States. Presley -- not so far removed from events to miss that the
group had usurped and then surpassed him in the rock-and-roll
culture he had more or less created -- declared he would lead an
anti-Beatles campaign, and, with Nixon's O.K., left the capital
with an honorary Drug Enforcement Administration agent's badge. The
Beatles had broken up seven months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Presley did have a second act. In the summer of 1968, urged on
by a young television director named Steve Binder, he turned what
was expected to be a lachrymose network special into a reawakening
of sorts -- his first performance before a live audience of any
kind in seven years, and a triumphant one.
</P>
<P>
   He followed the Christmastime broadcast of the show with a
monthlong engagement in Las Vegas -- another triumph -- but it
proved, in retrospect, a final reprise, not a fresh start. He was
still Elvis. It was just that he no longer knew what for.
</P>
<P>
   Too many pills, and too many purposeless days, were killing his
heart. As he performed regularly through the mid-'70s -- it was his
main source of income now, the movies having dried up -- the shows
grew stale, then worse. He might have funneled his unresolvable
emotions into songwriting, but that never appeared to have occurred
to him. Instead, between the tired oldies he sang before aging,
adoring fans who approached him more as a sort of tent revivalist
than a rock star, he ranted about his divorce from Priscilla and
his falling-out with the entertainment press, his paranoias and his
bitternesses, believing himself more sinned against than sinning --
Lear in a wing-collared jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick writes too much of these last five or six years.
``Careless Love'' bloats along with its subject, and the author's
lyrically spare sentences begin to sag as they struggle to find any
glimmer of the old Elvis amid the wreckage. Guralnick wisely
chooses not to end with a reckoning of the wages of fame but to
return to a consideration of the beginning, to those first electric
years when Presley was able to convey to so many Americans ``the
proclamation of emotions long suppressed, the embrace of a
vulnerability culturally denied, the unabashed striving for
freedom.'' Guralnick wants us to understand that that song will
never be over, and after reading him, we do.

 &UR; HELLO, HAL
</P>
<P>
   BY COLIN McGinn
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Has the invasion already begun? Are the aliens already right
under our noses? Are machines, the products of human engineering
intelligence, poised to take over the world -- or is this an
irrational fear, the latest spasm of the Luddite spirit? Finally,
is the whole idea just a clever marketing ploy for the
investment-hungry artificial intelligence industry? Here we have
three books, all written by experts in computer intelligence, aimed
to persuade us that the Age of Machines is nigh. We are to be
eclipsed by our own technology, ceding our outdated flesh, blood
and neural tissue to integrated circuits and their mechanistic
progeny. The future belongs to the robots.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of this dystopian vision (or utopian, depending on
your view) go back to a prediction made in the mid-1960's by a
former chairman of Intel, Gordon Moore, that the size of each
transistor on an integrated circuit will be reduced by 50 percent
every 24 months. This prediction, now grandly known as Moore's law,
implies the exponentially expanding power of circuit-based
computation over time. A rough corollary is that you will get
double the computational power for the same price at two-year
intervals. Thus computers today can perform millions more
computations per second than equivalently priced computers of only
a few decades ago. It is further predicted that new computer
technologies will take over where integrated circuits leave off and
continue the inexorable march toward exponentially increasing
computational power. The computational capacity of the human brain
is only a few decades away from being duplicated on an affordable
computing machine. Brains are about to be outpaced by one of their
products. They are already being outdone in certain areas: speed of
calculation, data storage, theorem-proving, chess.
</P>
<P>
   All three of these books provide a vivid window on the state of
the art in artificial intelligence research, and offer provocative
speculations on where we might be heading as the information age
advances. Of the three, ``The Age of Spiritual Machines,'' by Ray
Kurzweil, is the best: it is more detailed, thoughtful, clearly
explained and attractively written than ``Robot: Mere Machine to
Transcendent Mind,'' by Hans Moravec, and ``When Things Start to
Think,'' by Neil Gershenfeld -- though all three are creditable
efforts at popularization.
</P>
<P>
   Since the books cover much the same ground, with some difference
of emphasis, Kurzweil's gives you the most bits for your buck.
Gershenfeld's breezily chatty book sometimes reads too much like an
advertisement for the Media Lab at M.I.T., of which he is director.
There is much discussion (and not a little hype) of his many
achievements in harnessing computer technology to more physical
concerns: electronic books, smart shoes, wearable computers,
technologically enhanced cellos.
</P>
<P>
   Moravec's book is more intellectually adventurous and free with
confident futuristic speculation. He envisages autonomous robot-run
industries that we tax to siphon off their wealth, and the gradual
replacement of organic humans with mechanical descendants -- our
``mind children.'' His vision is of a world in which machines are
the next evolutionary step, with organic tissue but a blink in the
eye of cosmic history. Once intelligence is created by natural
selection it will be only a matter of time (a very short one by
cosmic standards) before the products of intelligence outshine
their creators, finally displacing them altogether. This is good
knockabout stuff, a heady and unnerving glimpse into a possible
future. Where Moravec is weak is in attempts at philosophical
discussion of machine consciousness and the nature of mind. He
writes bizarre, confused, incomprehensible things about
consciousness as an abstraction, like number, and as a mere
``interpretation'' of brain activity. He also loses his grip on the
distinction between virtual and real reality as his speculations
spiral majestically into incoherence.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil is more philosophically sensitive, and hence cautious,
in his claims for computer consciousness; he develops the same
kinds of speculations as Moravec, but with more of an emphasis on
the meaning of such innovations for human life. He has an engaging
discussion of the future of virtual sex once the technology
includes realistic haptic simulations (what other bodies feel like
to touch); here he envisages the eventual triumph of the virtual
over the real. His book ranges widely over such juicy topics as
entropy, chaos, the big bang, quantum theory, DNA computers,
quantum computers, Godel's theorem, neural nets, genetic
algorithms, nanoengineering, the Turing test, brain scanning, the
slowness of neurons, chess playing programs, the Internet -- the
whole world of information technology past, present and future.
This is a book for computer enthusiasts, science fiction writers in
search of cutting-edge themes and anyone who wonders where human
technology is going next.
</P>
<P>
   But the question must be asked: How seriously are we to take all
this breathless compuhype? Will the 21st century really see
machines acquire mentality?
</P>
<P>
   There is naturally a lot of talk in these books about the
possibility of machines duplicating the operations of the human
mind. But it is vital to distinguish two questions, which are often
run together by our authors: Can machines duplicate the external
intelligent behavior of humans? And can machines duplicate the
inner subjective experience of people? Call these the questions of
outside and inside duplication. What is known as the Turing test
says in effect that if a machine can mimic the outside of a human
then it has thereby replicated the inside: if it behaves like a
human with a mind, it has a mind. All three authors are partial to
the Turing test, thus equating the simulation of external
manifestations of mind with the reality of mind itself. However,
the Turing test is seriously flawed as a criterion of mentality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-INTELLIGENCE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: criterion of mentality.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, it is just an application of the doctrine of behaviorism,
the view that minds reduce to bodily motions; and behaviorism has
long since been abandoned, even by psychologists. Behavior is just
the evidence for mind in others, not its very nature. This is why
you can act as if you are in pain and not really be in pain -- you
are just pretending.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is the kind of problem highlighted by the
philosopher John Searle in his ``Chinese Room'' argument: computer
programs work merely by the manipulation of symbols without any
reference to what these symbols might mean, so that it would be
possible for a human to follow such a program for a language he has
no understanding of. The computer is like my manipulating sentences
of Chinese according to formal rules and yet having no
understanding of the Chinese language. It follows that mimicking
the externals of human understanding by means of a symbol-crunching
computer program is not devising a machine that itself understands.
None of our authors even so much as consider this well-known and
actually quite devastating argument.
</P>
<P>
   Third, to know whether we can construct a machine that is
conscious we need to know what makes us conscious, for only then
can we determine whether the actual basis of consciousness can
occur in an inorganic system. But we simply don't know what makes
organic brains conscious; we don't know what properties of neurons
are responsible for the emergence of subjectivity. We would need to
solve the age-old mind-body problem before we could sensibly raise
the question of minds in machines. My hunch is that it is something
about specifically organic tissue that is responsible for
consciousness, since this seems to be the way nature has chosen to
engineer consciousness; but that can only be a guess in view of our
deep ignorance of the roots of consciousness in the brain. In any
case, lacking insight into the basis of consciousness, it is futile
to ask whether a machine could have what it takes to generate
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the Turing test is therefore no proof of machine
consciousness: outside duplication does not guarantee inside
duplication. This bears strongly on a practical suggestion of
Kurzweil -- that during the course of the 21st century we might
decide to ``upload'' ourselves into a suitable computing machine as
a way of extending our lives and acquiring a more robust physical
constitution. Let us suppose that the machine you choose to upload
into passes the Turing test; it had better or else you would not
wish to inhabit it. The problem is that it might do so without
containing the potential for any form of consciousness, so that
uploading your mind into it amounts to letting your mind evaporate
into thin air.You will pass from sentient being to insentient
robot.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot to risk on the veracity of the Turing test! And it
is no good hoping that the robots themselves will tell you whether
they are conscious, since they will say they are -- whether or not
they are. If people become convinced of the validity of the Turing
test on mistaken philosophical grounds, then we might find
ourselves in the position of unknowingly extinguishing our
consciousness by uploading into machines that are inherently
incapable of feeling anything. If Kurzweil is right when he says
that machines that mimic the externals of human performance will
become available sometime during the next century, then I suggest
that the human race ponder the merits of the Turing test very
carefully before taking any drastic steps. I for one would prefer
sentient mortality to insentient immortality, or, more accurately,
to the end of my self and the creation of an unconscious machine
that merely behaves like me.
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil, Moravec and Gershenfeld take it as a given that the
mind is essentially a computer. The question then is just how
powerful a computer the mind is and whether a machine could
duplicate this power. But the authors do not think hard enough
about their basic assumption. It is true that human minds
manipulate symbols and engage in mental computations, as when doing
arithmetic. But it does not follow from this that computing is the
essence of mind; maybe computing is just one aspect of the nature
of mind. And isn't this already obvious from the fact that many
nonmental systems engage in computations? Silicon chips are not
conscious, nor are the components of any future molecular or
quantum computer. The fact is that minds are just one kind of
computational system among many, not all of which have any trace of
mentality in them. So computation cannot be definitive of mind.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of mind wholly omitted by the computational
conception is the phenomenological features of experience -- the
specific way a rose smells, for instance. This is something over
and above any rose-related computations a machine might perform. A
DNA computer has biochemical as well as computational properties; a
conscious mind has phenomenological as well as computational
properties. These phenomenological properties have a stronger claim
to being distinctive of the mind than mere computational ones.
There is thus no reductive explanation of the mental in terms of
the computational; we cannot regard consciousness as nothing but a
volley of physically implemented symbol manipulations. And this
means that there is no reason at all to believe that building ever
larger and faster computers will take us one jot closer to building
a genuinely mental machine. The fallacy here is analogous to
reasoning that if a human body is a device for taking you from A to
B, and a car also does this, then a human body is the same thing as
a car. Minds compute and so do silicon chips, but that is no reason
to suppose that minds are nothing more than what they have in
common with silicon chips (any more than silicon chips are nothing
more than what they have in common with minds).
</P>
<P>
   If our three authors are wobbly on the philosophy of mind and
artificial intelligence, they are strong on computer technology
itself; and here is where their books are particularly interesting.
The reader can simply detach all the dubious speculations about
machine consciousness and focus on the authors' predictions about
the future of computer and robot technology, its potential benefits
and hazards. Consider two examples of the kind of technology that
might well be just over the horizon: the foglets and the nanobots.
Foglets are tiny, cell-sized robots, each more computationally
powerful than the human brain, that are equipped with minute
gripping arms that enable them to join together into diverse
physical structures. At ease the foglets are just a loose swarm of
suspended particles in the air, but when you press a button they
execute a program for forming themselves into an object of your
choosing. We may come to live in foglet houses whose rooms are
formed from the same foggy swarm. We may come to have foglet
friends and take foglet vacations. Our entire physical environment
may come to consist of a
</P>
<P>
   3-D mosaic of cooperating microscopic computers. This would be
virtual reality made concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Nanobots are devices for nanoengineering, the manipulation of
matter on the atomic scale. They are also high-power
microcomputers, equipped with manipulative skills and an urge to
perpetuate their kind. They can make copies of themselves by
following a program for nano-scale operations on chunks of
surrounding matter. Imagine you start with 10 of them and that they
can each make a copy of themselves in five seconds (they can do
many millions of computations a second and their little mechanical
limbs move, insectlike, with great rapidity). That means they
double their numbers every five seconds, and an exponential nanobot
population explosion is set to break out. These little blighters
could consume the entire planet in a matter of weeks, including all
the organic material on it! Nor would they be picked off by natural
predators, being quite indigestible. In a very short time the
nanobots will have razed everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Self-replication is perhaps the biggest hazard presented by
advanced computer technology. Even today computers are routinely
used to design other computers; in the next century they may be
making computers that challenge humans in all sorts of ways. Victor
Frankenstein refused to give his monstrous creation a bride for
fear of their reproductive potential. Maybe we should be thinking
hard now about the replicative powers of intelligent machines. If
the 20th century was the century of nuclear weapons, then the 21st
might be the century of self-breeding aliens of our own devising.

 THE HAUNTED WOOD

   Soviet Espionage in America -- the Stalin Era.

 &UR; THE KREMLIN CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
   BY JOSEPH E. PERSICO
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In December 1948, the legendary broadcast journalist Edward R.
Murrow went on the air to deplore the death of Laurence Duggan, a
former State Department official seemingly hounded to suicide by
the Communist-hunting House Un-American Activities Committee, whose
members included Representative Richard M. Nixon. Murrow's outrage
might have been tempered if he had possessed the information about
Duggan that is revealed in ``The Haunted Wood,'' by Allen
Weinstein, the founder of the Center for Democracy in Washington
and Moscow, and Aleksandr Vassiliev, a journalist and a K.G.B.
alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   While once-unimaginable collaborations among writers from
opposing trenches in the cold war are not all that uncommon today,
this work has a special power. During a two-year window of
opportunity (or of lowered guard), Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service, the successor to the Soviet Union's K.G.B., allowed the
authors access to thousands of secret documents from the Stalin
era. Much of what they found is not new -- and yet it is.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of reading ``The Haunted Wood'' is rather like
looking into the new edition of a book from which half the pages
had previously been torn out. What emerges most sharply is proof of
the guilt of certain Americans whose spying for the Soviet Union
has been the subject of debate for over half a century. Laurence
Duggan, for example, may have been driven to suicide by the HUAC
Red hunters; but one document the authors unearthed in Moscow
reveals how a Soviet defector was murdered to protect the identity
of Duggan, whose espionage ``take'' in the 1930's occasionally went
directly to Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly with Alger Hiss. For decades, the truth about the
Hiss-Whittaker Chambers case had been obscured by its symbolism. To
both liberals and conservatives, as Weinstein and Vassiliev put it,
``the protagonists assumed the status of icons in the demonologies
and hagiographies of their opposing camps.'' In an earlier work,
``Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case'' (1978), Weinstein, possessing
far less evidence than is now available, traced his odyssey from
believing in Hiss's innocence to accepting his guilt as a Soviet
agent. Now the most die-hard Hiss apologist will find it daunting
to explain away a document the authors discovered in the K.G.B.
files revealing that Hiss and his ring were awarded Soviet
decorations for providing military information going back to 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the book consists in great part of swatches of actual
quotation from the files of the K.G.B. and its predecessors during
what the authors call the ``golden age'' of Soviet espionage
(1933-45). The files document Soviet spying by Representative
Samuel Dickstein of New York, so greedy that his handlers gave him
the code name ``Crook.'' The material from the file on Martha Dodd,
the daughter of the American Ambassador to Germany in the 1930's,
reads better than most spy thrillers: the beautiful and reckless
Dodd, known socially to President and Mrs. Roosevelt, gave her all,
sleeping with Nazis or whoever could provide useful intelligence to
her Soviet spymasters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Straight, a wealthy American blue blood recruited for
Soviet espionage at Cambridge University along with Donald Maclean,
Guy Burgess, Harold (Kim) Philby and Anthony Blunt, went directly
to an unwitting Roosevelt for help in wrangling a job that would
position him conveniently for Soviet spying. Serving in America's
own World War II intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic
Services, and close to its chief, William J. (Wild Bill) Donovan,
was Duncan Lee, a descendant of Gen. Robert E. Lee, and another
Soviet recruit. Lee always denied the charge, yet a K.G.B. file
reveals a Soviet agent boasting of Lee's value as a source, noting
that all O.S.S. intelligence ``from Europe and the rest of the
world . . . comes through his hands.'' Still another file documents
the Soviets' strategy to tap Lauchlin Currie, a top Roosevelt White
House aide who became a source of intelligence to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   None of the foregoing names are new to accusations of espionage.
But in the past many escaped opprobrium, shielded by the notion
that they were victims of anti-Communist hysteria. The
Weinstein-Vassiliev discoveries in the archives of the opposition
camp tear away that shield.
</P>
<P>
   All the above penetrations, however, pale before the all-time
Soviet espionage triumph, the piercing of America's most zealously
guarded secret of the war, the development of the atomic bomb --
fittingly code-named ``Enormoz'' by the Soviets. The activities of
Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, the Rosenbergs and many
others have long been chronicled. What is new here is the view of
their manipulation from the Soviet side and evidence of even deeper
penetration of the Manhattan Project than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The authors found in the archives of the K.G.B. a virtual
hemorrhage of Allied atomic secrets. An anonymous donor left a
bundle of top secrets practically on the doorstep of the Soviet
Consulate in New York. A still-unidentified ``Tina,'' a Communist
working for a British firm, revealed to the Soviets the metals used
to make the bomb. ``Fogel,'' the code name for an American who was
never caught or identified, delivered to his controller plans for
plants and equipment employed to construct the bomb. Another
document reveals Soviet paranoia, with Moscow prodding its agents
in the United States to work harder because the Americans intended
``to maintain a complete monopoly on 'Enormoz' and to use the
(atomic bomb) for aggressive purposes against us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HAUNTED-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: against us.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The K.G.B. archives further detail Moscow's nearly total control
and orchestration of the failed worldwide public relations campaign
to save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg from the electric chair for
passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. And the authors'
probing in Moscow finally lays to rest long-bruited suspicions
about the loyalty of the scientific chief of the Manhattan Project,
J. Robert Oppenheimer. Files they found suggest that he was a
``secret member'' of the American Communist Party, and make clear
that he was indeed a target of Soviet operatives -- Oppenheimer
``represents a very large interest for us.'' Yet Weinstein and
Vassiliev uncovered no shred of evidence that he ever spied for the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of these revelations to accept, at least for
those of us who deplored the overzealous Red-hunting of the late
40's and early 50's, is that the hunt rested on more substance than
we cared to admit, the phony posturing of Senator Joseph R.
McCarthy aside. Still, one question lingers. What prompted so many
privileged American intellectuals -- a Hiss, a Duggan, a Straight
-- to become seemingly mesmerized servants of an authoritarian spy
service? ``Soviet intelligence files,'' the authors conclude,
``document the mixture of accidental encounters, underlying
ideological beliefs, romantic antifascist views and Soviet
persistence.'' One finishes ``The Haunted Wood'' with a sense that
the romantic antifascism, coupled with a romanticized Communism,
produced a potent political narcotic. To be an economist for the
Farm Security Administration might lack glamour, but to toil for
the F.S.A. and also to be a spy! Now there was excitement,
heightened by membership in ``an elite . . . secretive club
fighting for a noble ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, critics may charge that it is all a fraud. Could not
the Russians have fabricated incriminating documents and then fed
them to eager researchers? But to what end? Why would Russian
intelligence operatives have concocted and buried these files until
only the impossible-to-predict collapse of the Soviet Union brought
them to light? Further supporting the validity of the documents is
the fact that many of the messages in the K.G.B. archive were
matched by the authors against outgoing messages that the Soviets
radioed from the United States to Moscow during the war,
transmissions intercepted and broken through an American
code-cracking triumph called Venona.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that all World War II histories written before
the revelation of Ultra, the British success in breaking German
codes, are incomplete. The work of Weinstein, Vassiliev and their
colleagues mining the Soviet lode begins to approach the
significance of an Ultra. Histories of Soviet-American relations
written without benefit of Soviet secret files now available are,
to some degree, books with missing pages.

   Religion has always been a problem for science fiction writers.
While they are occupationally biased toward rationality, their
stock in trade is imagining plausible futures -- and no speculation
about future societies can be complete without considering the
evolution of current belief systems or the advent of entirely new
religions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few writers have taken this challenge seriously. When
religion has not served merely as a symbol of irrational reaction,
it has usually figured as window dressing -- a few hints of altered
rituals or creeds to remind the reader that this is indeed ``the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the memorable exceptions: Walter M. Miller Jr.'s
``Canticle for Leibowitz,'' James Blish's ``Case of Conscience,''
Frank Herbert's ``Dune'' series, Gene Wolfe's multivolume ``Book of
the New Sun.'' Add to these Octavia E. Butler's PARABLE OF THE
TALENTS (Seven Stories, $24.95), which continues and deepens the
story she began five years ago in ``Parable of the Sower.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the protagonist is Lauren Oya Olamina, a
21st-century prophet, born, she believes, to bring a new kind of
truth to troubled times. Reeling from environmental, political,
financial and military blows, American society is just barely
surviving in the opening years of the next millennium. The
revelation that Olamina feels called upon to share can be summed up
in two sentences: ``God is Change'' and ``The Destiny of Earthseed
is to take root among the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthseed'' refers both to her new faith and to the small
circle of believers she assembles through the force of her
personality and her writings, which consist of aphoristic verses
that couch revolutionary thoughts in deceptively simple words.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's narrative skills are impressive. We follow the rise and
fall of Earthseed's first communal home through a chorus of voices
that jump around in time, giving us contrasting perspectives on the
heartbreaking events that test the faith and will of the founding
mother, her family and her adherents. Most remarkably, the ideas
they espouse -- at the risk of their freedom and even their lives
-- are presented with the respect they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The tenets of Earthseed arise from a thought-provoking
collaboration between the scientific and religious imaginations. As
the founder's husband notes, ``Olamina believes in a god that does
not in the least love her.'' Conceding that Earthseed ``isn't a
very comforting belief system,'' Olamina achieves prophetic stature
by insisting that in the long run the true test of a religion is
whether the solace it offers conforms with the nature of the
universe we live in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its provocative title, PLAYING GOD (Aspect/Warner, $22),
by Sarah Zettel, disappoints, because the author fails to take her
stated theme seriously enough. In two previous novels,
``Reclamation'' and ``Fool's War,'' Zettel ranged across time and
space with the bracing confidence of a latter-day Asimov or
Heinlein. In ``Playing God,'' she focuses on the fate of a single
planet and, paradoxically, loses her way.
</P>
<P>
   In a not-so-distant future, human beings have averted the
destruction of the earth by splintering into competitive but
mutually respectful political and economic entities called
enclaves. A species of warlike aliens on a distant world has not
been so lucky: after nearly destroying their ecosystem with
biological and nuclear weapons, they find that their only hope for
survival is a worldwide makeover proposed by Bioverse Incorporated
Enclave. The project involves temporarily evacuating 1.3 billion
aliens to giant orbiting spaceships, followed by ``full-scale
bioremediation efforts to clean the planet up after two centuries
of extremely dirty warfare.'' As if that were not difficult enough,
the aliens suffer ``massive anaphylactic reactions'' from close
contact with humans, so attempts to keep the mutually murderous
clans from killing each other on the spaceships must be supervised
from afar.
</P>
<P>
   The humans who devote themselves to this project must respect
the alien culture while containing the aggressive tendencies
inherent in it. I wish I could report that Zettel successfully
dramatizes this problem. Unfortunately, she allows the situation to
deteriorate into open conflict, which she then describes in prose
that lacks the snap and conviction of her earlier books. Despite
page after page of dutifully detailed description, I never got a
clear picture of the aliens or their society. Even worse, I did not
much care what happened to the humans whose efforts to ``play god''
give way, in the end, to all-too-predictable melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unfamiliar with the work of Paul J. McAuley, his new
collection of stories, THE INVISIBLE COUNTRY (Eos/Avon, paper,
$13.50), provides a useful introduction to this engaging writer.
The title story, set in a grim near-future London, is told in a
noirish style that might be characterized as ``bio-punk.''
</P>
<P>
   A former professional biologist, McAuley conjures a world
ravaged by global warming and a breakdown in social order
exacerbated by the easy availability of intrusive biotechnology. In
a convincing demonstration of his stylistic sleight of hand, he
transmutes this nightmarish vision into a dream of utopia right
under the reader's nose, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the nine stories in this collection evoke a future (also
encountered in McAuley's novel ``Fairyland'') in which ``dolls,''
gene-engineered humanoid creatures, serve as all-purpose slaves. By
coming at this painful subject from the point of view of society's
human outcasts, McAuley avoids the twin traps of facile moralizing
and maudlin sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Another story, ``Recording Angel,'' shares setting and theme
with McAuley's recent novel ``Child of the River'' and casts some
light on the confusing background of that work, the first in a
promised trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 10 years old, I read a book entitled ``Tom Swift and
His Electric Elephant Gun.'' I can still remember the thrill
generated by the technological wonder of a superweapon that allowed
Tom to subdue a ponderous pachyderm without actually killing it. A
similar sense of wonder animates the recent crop of computer-driven
techno-thrillers, of which THE TERMINATION NODE (Del
Rey/Ballantine, $24), by Lois H. Gresh and Robert Weinberg, is a
suitably breathless example.
</P>
<P>
   An evil mastermind is killing off computer hackers faster than
you can say ``delete.'' Only the skills of a superhacker, Judy
Carmody, known to her online friends as ``TerMight,'' can save the
day -- not to mention the billions of dollars of electronic bank
deposits about to vanish forever at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   I would not venture a guess about whether this Internet-savvy
collaboration will stir feelings of wonder in today's young
readers. I can only report that the book's series of brutal murders
raised not so much as a hair on the back of my neck, since the
authors failed to breathe life into these victims before they were
dispatched.

 THE LAST AVANT-GARDE

   The Making of the New York School of Poets.

 &UR; LAST ONE OFF THE BARRICADE TURN OUT THE LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   BY DAVID YEZZI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH time has passed since the poets of the New York School
resembled anything like an avant-garde that to refer to them as
such now invites nostalgia. As with so many artists who begin as
defiant Prince Hals and end as conquering King Henrys, the term
suggests a time prior to widespread acclaim. For John Ashbery,
Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch and James Schuyler -- the subjects of
``The Last Avant-Garde,'' David Lehman's jaunty and readable
account of artistic friendship and collaboration in Manhattan in
the 1950's and early 60's -- the battle to establish their
distinctive brand of poetry has long been waged and won.
</P>
<P>
   Of Ashbery, Lehman writes that ``he is America's best-known
poet, with a strong readership in Britain and a larger
international following than any of his American contemporaries.''
That his willfully opaque poems remain a ``litmus test'' for some
only suggests to Lehman that there are those who have not yet
caught up with the judgments of our most prominent literary
critics. All four poets may be read in swank collected editions
befitting their prizewinning oeuvres. Lehman's label of
``avant-garde,'' however, reminds us that these darlings of the
academy were once its adversaries, and that their work was not
always the colossus it has become but a dynamic fringe experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the author of ``Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and
the Fall of Paul de Man,'' has a spirited story to tell, and he
tells it with spirit. A strong proponent of the New York School
esthetic, he is fortunate in his material, which lends itself so
neatly to bohemian mythologizing. With more than a hint of Romantic
ecstasy, Lehman describes the fervor of the San Remo bar and Cedar
Tavern in Greenwich Village. Such midcentury hangouts teemed not
only with painters and writers, we read, but also with ``the bliss
of being alive and young at a moment of maximum creative ferment.''
As Koch has it, the scene was ``fizzy with collaboration.'' (And
one suspects, with so much hard drinking going on, fizzy with
Alka-Seltzer as well.)
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara provided the group with its center and, after his death
in 1966 in a freak accident on a Fire Island beach, with its
martyr. Through his myriad friendships and his curatorial position
at the Museum of Modern Art, O'Hara worked painters like Jane
Freilicher, Fairfield Porter and Larry Rivers into the mix. Joint
works abounded. Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch wrote the poem
``A Postcard to Popeye'' with Ashbery, Ashbery wrote the novel ``A
Nest of Ninnies'' with Schuyler, Schuyler collaborated on an ode
with O'Hara, O'Hara sat for a portrait painted by Rivers (his
lover) and so on in a daisy chain of ``literary lovemaking''
straight out of ``La Ronde.''
</P>
<P>
   While mutual admiration cemented them as a school, the four
remained very different as poets, with the ``quietly Whitmanic''
Schuyler most markedly apart. Personally, they had much in common.
All (save Schuyler) overlapped at Harvard, all (save Koch) were
homosexual, all (save Ashbery) did military service, all (save
Koch) reviewed art and all (save Ashbery, who soon moved to Paris)
lived in New York during their formative years as poets. The sound
of Ashbery's voice so resembled O'Hara's that people mistook them
for each other, yet readers of their work would hardly make that
mistake. Lehman, nevertheless, finds some common denominators. The
quartet aligned themselves with French Surrealists like Raymond
Roussel, Pierre Reverdy and Guillaume Apollinaire: ``They favored
wit, humor and the advanced irony of the blague (that is, the
insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and
Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School painters after whom
they were named.''
</P>
<P>
   An assiduous researcher and critic as well as a companionable
gossip, Lehman occasionally falls prey to his poets' playful
spirit. Do we need to know Ashbery's astrological sign (``Leo . . .
with Virgo rising'') to appreciate a poem referring to
constellations? Lehman sometimes overstates his case, particularly
where he assumes the reader's complete sympathy. Ashbery's
associative ramble ``The Skaters'' becomes in Lehman's estimation
``a latter-day equivalent of T. S. Eliot's 'Waste Land.' '' The
comparison misfires. Ashbery's lines pale next to the best of
modernism, America's only truly great literary avant-garde of the
century and the movement that the New York School poets labored so
wildly to extend.

 &UR; THE BOY IN THE BRIGHT GREEN HAT
</P>
<P>
   BY MARGARET TALBOT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Childhood these days is often a land of diagnoses. Detours from
the developmental path can easily get a kid tagged with one new
syndrome or another. And as far as many parents are concerned, this
is an unmitigated good. These parents -- and we tend to hear a lot
from them because they speak up at school board meetings and
testify before Congress -- are grateful to have an explanation
like, say, attention deficit disorder for behavior that puzzles or
frightens them and are relieved to know that they are not alone. We
don't hear quite as much from parents who react to such labels with
tortured ambivalence, who wonder whether their child's
individuality has been reduced to pathology, and what might be lost
if it has.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kephart is such a parent, and fortunately for us she is
also a gifted, even poetic writer. In 1991, when Kephart's son,
Jeremy, was 2, doctors concluded he had something called pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified, a catchall
condition that might best be described as a milder and more
malleable form of autism. That Jeremy was different from other
children his age came as no surprise to Kephart or her husband, an
artist and architect. Jeremy spoke early, but his speech seemed to
stall at the naming stage -- ``Dino!'' ``Juice cup!'' ``Bathtub!''
-- and later deteriorated into echolalia, the tendency to repeat
what he had just heard. He was, more even than most toddlers, a
creature of habit, a fiend for order and patterns. He liked to
arrange his matchbox cars in color-coded pinwheels as intricate as
church-floor mosaics and could not abide having any of them moved a
fraction of an inch. For months he would not leave the house or
take a bath or go to sleep without donning a chartreuse fedora
several sizes too big that he had picked out for himself at the
local department store. Playgrounds were not easy places for him,
and new children -- new people in general -- often put him deeply
out of sorts. He preferred textbooks on medieval chivalry to
``Goodnight Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Kephart, a freelance writer, have any real doubt that
Jeremy would need extra help, redoubled devotion, if he were to
keep one foot in the world as most of the rest of us know it. She
writes eloquently in ``A Slant of Sun,'' her first book and a
finalist for a National Book Award last year, of her panic before
his diagnosis and his first rounds of speech therapy, of the
moments when her sweet black-eyed boy seems to be sliding away from
her into some shadow land: ``There is an absence of things. Small
lights burning out. The creep of an indecipherable dimness. Jeremy
does not wave hello. Jeremy does not eat his food. Jeremy does not
look for us beneath the hood of his eyes; language is
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kephart also knows that naming a child's syndrome is not the
same as helping him, and not the same as understanding him.
Pervasive developmental disorder, as she quickly comes to realize,
is another way for doctors to say that something is wrong but they
don't know what or why. It's not a diagnosis that entails an
obvious course of treatment, nor does it take into account the
aspects of Jeremy that those who love him wouldn't want treated.
``What, in the end, are you fighting for: Normal? Is normal
possible? Can it be defined? Is it best achieved by holing up in
the offices of therapists, in special classrooms, in isolated
exercises, in simulating living, while everyday 'normal' happens
casually on the other side of the wall? And is normal superior to
what the child inherently is, to what he aspires to, fights to
become, every second of his day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Slant of Sun'' is a memoir -- a personal and not a
prescriptive book -- but one of its strengths is that it makes us
think about these questions not just for Jeremy but for other
idiosyncratic children too. In her introduction Kephart writes that
Jeremy is now ``a successful second grader at a country Quaker
school,'' a boy with friends and hobbies and a philosophical bent
that prompts him to ponder aloud, ``Mommy, how are we supposed to
see God?'' And it is striking that while Kephart gives ample credit
to the various professionals -- speech therapists, play therapists
-- who helped Jeremy adopt a less solipsistic way of being in the
world, she is most moved by the ordinary people who saw and
appreciated him for what he was already.
</P>
<P>
   Kephart and her husband decided against special schools for
Jeremy, which they thought would only isolate him further. They
were willing to create a miniature mainstream for their son that
would be like the real mainstream, but kinder -- a milieu in which
he would always be listened to as he groped for more conversational
language, in which he would be given time to decompress when he had
been deep in one of his interior visions. In this enterprise,
though, they needed at least some confederates outside their own
tenderly solicitous household -- friends who would not regard
Jeremy's passions for trucks or knights or green hats merely as
symptoms, who would see something joyful in the whorls and ridges
of his distinctive sensibility. They did find some of these people,
not many, but enough -- a teacher or two, a baby sitter, the
handyman at school who just plain liked him. What these friends
offered might seem like the simplest of gifts. Kephart makes it
clear that it was anything but.

   ``The appearance of struggle,'' Nicholas Fox Weber writes in
CLEVE GRAY (Abrams, $39.95), has often been identified with being
``'the real thing.''' This is a key argument in his attempt to
dispel the aura of privilege that the painter Cleve Gray believes
has interfered with the art world's perception of him. Written as a
continuing encounter among artist, author and several barnloads of
paintings, this monograph is unusual both in its frankly informal
tone and its subordination of the work to the worries of the maker.
``I've often been mistaken for a rich boy who could buy his way
in,'' Gray laments, in a manner that reveals his private fear more
than it elucidates his artistic ambitions. What does emerge from
Gray's hand wringing, however, is an oddly affecting and
sympathetic portrait of the struggle to create in the face of
indifference. The book also traces the delicate path required to
achieve success and shows how sincere efforts can turn into
self-sabotage -- like Gray's diatribe against the Abstract
Expressionists written in 1959 for The American Scholar, in which
he excoriated the art world's poor taste. Curiously, as his ideas
evolved Gray's own paintings came to resemble that very work he
dismissed as lacking content. But his conversion came too late, and
despite prestigious commissions, including the ``Threnody'' series
-- 14 enormous murals commissioned for the Neuberger Museum of Art
at Purchase College of the State University of New York -- poor
critical reviews have dogged his career, rendering elusive the
recognition that every artist hopes for. Though Gray emerges from
this fragile paean to his perseverance as a worthy martyr to art,
Weber fails to make a convincing argument for a reconsideration of
Gray's work as commensurate with the struggle that made it. _

</P>
<P>
   Coming from someone who is so adept at cutting through
corniness, it is a shame that Cher's memoir, ``The First Time,'' is
so banal. Instead of her smart-mouth humor, most of the book is
filled with exclamations, italics, parentheses and exaggerations.
Instead of making it light and breezy, the book's structure --
short chapters on subjects like ``My First Bra,'' ``My First
Out-of-Body Experience,'' ``The First Time I Learned My Daughter
Was Gay'' -- kills continuity and buries the biography. Background
details are almost nonexistent; for example, we learn few facts
about Cher's parents except that they ``were young, jealous and
immature; kind of like Sean and Madonna.'' Nicknames are given
before full names appear; divorces are announced when the reader is
not sure if there has been a marriage. There is probably just
enough material here for an illustrated calendar on Cher's career.

   Adapted from Ruby Dee's one-woman show, ``My One Good Nerve,''
is a compilation of musings, short essays, stories and poems
written and performed over several years. The whole, however, is a
good deal more than its parts. With its wry humor, longing,
occasional anger and impatience with the world's idiocies, the book
provides a sharing of Dee's deepest concerns, those of an
intelligent, informed and sophisticated sensibility. ``Ode to
O.D.,'' for example, is an encomium to Dee's husband, Ossie Davis,
that every wife will appreciate and identify with: ``Wait! Ossie
wait! After half a century, I have something to tell you!'' That
``something'' is expressed in a poem that barely mentions love, yet
is profoundly loving (the last lines are ``Don't forget to -- to --
/
</P>
<P>
   Put out the trash''). Funny, touching and sensitive, Dee's voice
is always unpretentious and it is one to be returned to again and
yet again. _ LYNN KARPEN

</P>
<P>
   Morrow, $25 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Waris Dirie, a model who has appeared in Elle, Glamour and
French Vogue, has written a memoir that describes her amazing
journey from childhood in the deserts of Somalia to the runways of
New York, Paris and Milan. ``Desert Flower,'' written with Cathleen
Miller, gives a powerful inside view into the hardships of the
nomadic Somali culture, where life is centered around the daily
search for food and water, and young girls undergo genital cutting
for arranged marriages. Dirie herself escaped such a marriage -- by
running away to an aunt in Mogadishu -- but not the cutting, which
she describes in horrific detail. Moving to London after finding
work as a domestic servant, Dirie was discovered by a photographer,
thus beginning a career filled with difficulties. There were
cultural differences (she left her first casting when asked to
remove her dress), language barriers (Dirie was only just learning
to read and write English) and, most important, her lack of a valid
passport, which necessitated two disastrous marriages of
convenience and years of deceiving British immigration officials.
After long and painful health problems, Dirie reached a turning
point following the birth of her son. Realizing that millions of
women were still suffering from the practice of genital mutilation,
Dirie decided to ``speak out for the little girl with no voice'' in
a magazine interview. This resulted in an appearance on ``20/20,''
and ultimately Dirie was given a post as a special ambassador for
the United Nations. Written with innocence and warmth, this book
shows how one woman's tragedy can help others. _ RAYE SNOVER

   Beacon, $24 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Carson, best known for her book ``Silent Spring,'' died
of breast cancer in 1964. It is no great surprise that her writing
still sparkles after all this time; she was as much a perfectionist
in her writing as in her science. Linda Lear's collection of her
essays does a superb job of pulling from Carson's works a
collection that is lyric, descriptive, informative and moving. The
surprise is that Carson's scientific brilliance still shines. The
engaging pieces in ``Lost Woods'' include a discussion of how
evolution continues today, a warning on the hazards to island
ecosystems and an analysis of cloud formations that accompanied a
1957 television program. The most scientific and politically
powerful piece in this collection is Carson's speech attacking the
detractors of ``Silent Spring,'' delivered shortly before her
death, giving example after example of the damage being done
through bioconcentration of contaminants moving through food chains
and transportation of contaminants across distances in animals; it
ends with her declaration that humans should be viewed as animals
whose well-being is tightly tied to the condition of their
environment. This book should be required reading both for
corporate managers in environmentally sensitive industries and for
environmentalists and environmental scientists, who deserve the
inspiration of Carson's finely wrought, passionate prose. _ BILL

   Lew Wasserman, MCA and the Hidden History of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Crown, $27.50 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The rags-to-riches story of how Jules Stein and Lew Wasserman,
two sons of Jewish immigrants, became the ultimate
behind-the-scenes Hollywood power brokers is told in Dennis
McDougal's thoroughly reported and engrossing book, ``The Last
Mogul.'' Begun by Stein, the Music Corporation of America started
as an agency representing bands. It quickly gained leverage over
the live music business through its talent lineup. Under Stein's
successor, Wasserman, the company later applied its hardball
tactics to movies and television, with even more success. MCA began
to dominate the entertainment industry, and its nickname said it
all: ``The Octopus.'' In 1962, after a 20-year antitrust
investigation, the Justice Department forced MCA out of the talent
agent business. In return it was allowed to continue with its
biggest acquisition, Universal Studios. Wasserman went on reigning
in Hollywood until the 1990s, when the company was bought first by
Matsushita, then by Seagram. McDougal, who covered Hollywood for
The Los Angeles Times for some 10 years, has marshaled reams of
documents and hundreds of interviews to show exactly how MCA used
its muscle -- from making friends with presidents to strong-arming
network executives and devising intricate tax shelters for star
clients. He writes that the most noteworthy trait of MCA was how it
hid its power. ``One of Lew's great strengths,'' McDougal says,
``was that he never felt compelled to take the credit -- all he
demanded was the money.'' _ TED LOOS

 &HT;    For release Friday, Jan. 1
 &HT;    We'll all be sick of millennium talk soon _ very soon.
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So do we start from scratch, or what? This isn't the first time
you've heard this, but hey: The end of the century is coming. It's
right around the corner, in fact, and by the time it arrives, it'll
seem like it's been here forever.
</P>
<P>
   How many times are we going to have to wade through the musings
and philosophications and roundups of the last thousand years? How
many times are we going to peruse a list of the accomplishments we
humans have achieved, the changes we've effected, the progress
we've made?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Way too many.
</P>
<P>
   How many millennium calendars did you get for Christmas? And how
many times are we going to be reminded that the 21st Century
doesn't start until the year 2001? Face it, we're going to get sick
and tired of all things 2000, and it's starting right here, right
now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, try to forget the Y2K problem. Try to forget the
predictions of doom and disaster from techno-phobes and
techno-experts who say that our computer-dependent society will
come crashing to a halt. Forget what they say about ATM machines
not working after midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, or the nationwide
blackout that will result when power company machines read ``00''
at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, and clink a collective ``huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that? No way. We're going to be reminded again and
again that stockpiling canned goods and bottled water is not such a
bad idea; that getting our prescriptions filled for a couple of
years in advance might be the prudent thing to do. Sure, President
Clinton has assured us that Social Security is ready, that the
checks will keep on coming despite the naysayers who tell us the
government computers aren't going to be ready. (President Clinton
wouldn't lie, would he?)
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all ``World Is Ending'' signs, we're about to be
treated to page after page, newscast after newscast, Internet site
after Internet site, of ``The World That Was.'' There are plenty of
things to discuss. Just think of all the stuff we've invented since
1900.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   _ World wars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rice Krispies for different colored holidays.
</P>
<P>
   _Postage stamps that peel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Madonna. Oh wait: She invented herself.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be unbearable, especially for those born in the
'70s or '80s, who by nature resent any sense of historical
perspective. What about those kids walking around with ``00'' on
their letter jackets? They're ready. They don't need to be
reminded.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates that 64,000 lucky folks have a shot
at spanning three centuries. How are they possibly going to cope?
It's hard enough to explain the vinyl recordings stored (for
nostalgia) in the basement, or to tell our children that life
wasn't always lived on-line. Are they going to believe that Grandma
didn't ever have a chance to design her own Web site? This year
they're going to hear that, and a millennium's worth of more.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be unbearable. And it's going to be enlightening.
So pay attention _ not that you have a choice. The media need a
hook, and there's never been a bigger one than the one that starts
today. The countdown. The big 365-episode show about everything.
The segments titled ``In Retrospect'' or ``The Last Thousand
Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepare yourself. It has begun.

 THE ORCHID THIEF
<TEXT>

   By Susan Orlean.

</P>
<P>
   Random House. $25.

 &UR; FLOWER POWER
</P>
<P>
   BY TED CONOVER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Given a stack of 30 long features from the nation's magazines, a
reader could quickly find the one written by Susan Orlean. It would
have a narrow focus: the routine of a 10-year-old boy in New
Jersey; Saturday night with a lounge band in Portland, Ore.; a
grocery store in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stylishly written, whimsical yet sophisticated,
quirkily detailed and full of empathy for a person you might not
have thought about empathetically before -- might not have thought
about at all. It would be lightly first person, with the few things
Orlean revealed about herself things you were probably glad to
know, and yet the whole would feel somehow suffused with her
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orchid Thief'' grew out of an article like those, for The
New Yorker. It is Orlean's first book-length narrative (after two
collections, the first one short pieces about New England, the
second portraits of Americans celebrating Saturday night). It shows
her gifts in full bloom, as well as the challenges, even for such a
talented journalist, of writing at this length.
</P>
<P>
   The thief of the title is John Laroche, ``skinny as a stick,
pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and sharply handsome, in spite of the
fact that he is missing all his front teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlean had noticed a short article about him in a local paper.
Laroche, along with three Seminole assistants, had been caught as
they emerged from southern Florida's Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve, a vast swamp, carrying four pillowcases containing more
than 200 rare orchids and bromeliads. He planned to clone them by
the millions, he explained to the arresting officers, and then sell
them to collectors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   As he awaited trial, Orlean decided to hang out with Laroche and
learn about him and his world. With her picaresque hero as guide,
she is led into the strange society-in-miniature of orchid
collectors and propagators. This sort of place is exactly where
Orlean likes to be, and soon her terrarium is filled with orchid
maniacs like Laroche's pal Dewey Fisk, whose business, the
Philodendron Phreaque, is run out of his house on ``one of those
old Florida roads with rain ruts and grassy edges, and rows of
one-floor bungalows with screened porches and dead cars and dead
bicycles and dead appliances lying out in the open to molder, the
way the Seminoles lay out their dead.'' And then there is the
orchid breeder Martin Motes, a former English professor who
misquotes Shakespeare to his customers. And the swells at Miami's
American Orchid Society gala, where Orlean leans against the wall
with the black-tied, orchid-loving Earl of Mansfield (``His wife
had impressed me in the receiving line because she was so pretty
and her hands felt like baby powder'').
</P>
<P>
   Laroche is not a gala benefit type of guy, and he vanishes
during this and other long stretches of the book. This is not all
bad, because though Orlean is marvelous at describing her wing nut
and his esthetic and moral world, there is not nearly enough of him
to fill a book. Orlean appears to know this and digresses in long
passages into several areas suggested by Laroche and his passion.
We learn about the birth of orchid collecting in Victorian England
and the exploits of agents sent by aristocrats to acquire specimens
in faraway lands; about the Seminole Indians (Laroche was starting
a nursery business for them at the time he was caught); about the
sometimes fierce rivalries among Miami-area orchid dealers; and
about orchid crimes, the largest of which was perhaps a classic
Florida land scam that drained large pieces of the Fakahatchee for
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   No narrative really unites these passages, and several, like the
Fakahatchee itself, through which Orlean slogs on three occasions
(once with two convicts on work release), are slow going. What
emerges finally as the book's true subject is the monomania of
collectors. As Orlean meets and sizes up a cast of characters that
is downright English in its eccentricity, she comments: ``It seemed
as if there were hundreds and hundreds of people who were wrapped
up in their special passion for the natural world. I still
considered Laroche and his schemes exceptional -- actually,
something beyond exceptional -- but he had started to seem more
like the end point in a continuum. He was the oddball ultimate of
those people who are enthralled by nonhuman living things and who
pursue them like lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlean envies them this passion, this organizing principle for
life, without sharing it -- early on she professes to own not a
single plant. Still, she comes to appreciate orchids as you feel a
fancier must (and describes one as only she could): ``He reached
for a pot that held the cutest plant in the world. . . . I thought
I might die if I couldn't have this one. The background of the
petal was the beigey yellow of a legal pad, and over the yellow
background was a spray of hot pink pinpoint dots, and the flower
was attached to the plant by a stem that was twisted like a stick
of licorice. The petals were plump and supple and pleasant to
touch. The center of the flower looked like the face of a piglet. I
felt as if the plant was looking at me as much as I was looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She even appreciates her roguish hero as only a mother might,
appearing to forgive him when he returns to her story at the end
only to let the air out of it: slapped on the hand by the judge and
dropped by the Seminoles, Laroche renounces not only orchids but
indeed plants of any kind. His new love: Web-page design and
pornography publishing. Orlean puzzles over ``how someone could end
such intense desire without leaving a trace.'' But she concludes
that it's all in character -- Laroche's earlier infatuations with
ice age fossils, turtles and antique mirrors also ended abruptly.
He does not even know the phone number of his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate for the book that Laroche ends up looking like
a flake, because the collecting mania that Orlean has so
painstakingly described is, like the orchid, a small thing of
grandeur, a passion with a pedigree. Serious collectors wait seven
years just to see a new plant bloom, and Laroche, lacking
constancy, is not in their league. It is despite her thief, and not
because of him, that Orlean succeeds in revealing the grandeur of a
miniature.

NEW &AMP; NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS 
 BY SCOTT VEALE
</HEADLINE>
  (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 CIRCUMNAVIGATION
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Steve Lattimore.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $12 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The author's first collection of short stories is populated by
disaffected Californians stuck with menial jobs, empty lives and
dead-end relationships. In 1997 our reviewer, Scott Bradfield,
called this a ``funny, moving book'' that in its best moments is
``about the various jangled ways in which broken families manage to
operate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLAVES IN THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   By Edward Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ballantine, $15.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Searching for the descendants of slaves owned by his ancestors
in South Carolina, the author confronts his heritage and the moral
consequences of slavery. His account, which won a National Book
Award last year, took him across America and to Africa, and
involved extensive interviews and research. ``There is much to
admire in Ball's very willingness to challenge the generations of
silence in his white family and to search out black kin whose
reactions he had every reason to fear,'' Drew Gilpin Faust wrote
here in 1998. In To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives
and Labors After the Civil War, by Tera W. Hunter (Harvard
University, $15.95), a history professor explores the valuable
political and social role played by black women after Emancipation.
In 1997 the same reviewer called this a ``celebration of struggle
and resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COCKROACH BASKETBALL LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   By Charley Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Stories, $13.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This hymn to minor-league basketball follows a team of misfits
and whining wannabes as they ply their trade in the shadow of the
big time. The result is ``a racily entertaining novel'' that
``skillfully induces the reader to join 'the Brotherhood of the
Sacred Hoop,' '' Michael Anderson wrote here in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE ELIOT: A LIFE
</P>
<P>
   By Rosemary Ashton.
</P>
<P>
   Penguin, $15.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This revisionist biography combines the social context of
Eliot's fiction and a detailed analysis of her novels. ``Ashton is
a serious, persistent scholar, and the picture she gives of Eliot's
intellectual and emotional life is convincing,'' William S.
Peterson wrote in these pages in 1997. Jane Austen: A Life, by
David Nokes (University of California, $19.95), reveals how the
novelist wielded irony and razor-sharp observation as weapons to
skewer the constraining society in which she lived. In 1997 in the
Book Review, Claude Rawson praised the author for leaning heavily
on Austen's letters, which ``are wonderfully revealing, especially
strong on the texture of relationships and the tang of social
encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRINCE OF PEACE
</P>
<P>
   By James Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This densely plotted novel tells the parallel tales of an
American priest who gets caught up in the anti-Vietnam War movement
and what is portrayed as the metamorphosis of the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States into a cynically run corporation. ``The
stories are nearly irresistible,'' Webster Schott wrote here in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASPHALT NATION
</P>
<P>
   How the Automobile Took Over America, and How We Can Take It
Back
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Holtz Kay.
</P>
<P>
   University of California, $16.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In this cranky polemic, an architecture critic describes how
unchecked motorized sprawl is threatening the nation's cities and
towns, its economy and its health. She ``largely succeeds in
proving that it is possible to get where we are going without
destroying where we live,'' Kenneth T. Jackson said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EATING CHINESE FOOD NAKED
</P>
<P>
   By Mei Ng
</P>
<P>
   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Lee is a restless college graduate whose protective love
for her mother draws her back to her father's laundry in Queens.
Last year our reviewer, Lynn Karpen, called this an ``affecting
first novel'' that ``conveys the complexities of family life with
vibrant color and luminosity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOBBY REX'S GREATEST HIT
</P>
<P>
   By Marianne Gingher.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State University, $14.95 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It's 1961 in Greensboro, N.C., and Pally Thompson is about to
marry a man who wants to know how far she went with a local
country-music crooner whose hit song is all about his romance with
her. This ``richly detailed, often charming first novel . . .
lovingly evokes Pally's journey from innocence to maturity in a
town where gossip flourishes and ambitions fade,'' Ellen Pall wrote
here in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIZEN SOLDIERS
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army From the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the
Surrender of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   June 7, 1944-May 7, 1945
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen E. Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In this sequel to ``D-Day,'' the author's 1994 best seller about
the Normandy landing, he once again uses the experiences of
ordinary soldiers to re-create the bloody, often nameless battles
that led to the Nazi defeat. '' 'Citizen Soldiers' is an
unforgettable testament to the World War II generation,'' Carlo
D'Este wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S SNAKE
</P>
<P>
   By Irini Spanidou
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $13 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   A young girl chronicles her anguished coming-of-age in Greece in
the 1950s as the daughter of an inflexible military officer who
treats her as if she were one of his recruits. This first novel
``freshly evokes the beauties and terrors of childhood,'' Nicholas
Bromell wrote here in 1986.

A SLOW, RELUCTANT THUMBS DOWN  
 BY HERBERT STEIN
</HEADLINE>
  (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The preliminaries are over. It is time to decide. Should the
Senate convict President Clinton and expel him from office? My
answer, after months of indecision, is a strong ``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   I had formerly been impressed by the argument that ousting
Clinton would set a precedent for any party having a sufficient
majority in Congress to get rid of any president, which would
convert us into a parliamentary democracy. At one time I had
thought our problem might be solved by the 15th Amendment, which
provides for the removal of a president found unable to perform the
duties of his office. But that required the concurrence of the vice
president, which would surely not be forthcoming. I had also
thought that Clinton might save us a lot of soul-searching by
resigning, but apparently he will not. At some times I thought that
censure or rebuke might do as punishment and expression of
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   I can say exactly when I came to the conclusion that Clinton had
to be removed. It was the morning of Dec. 15, 1998. That was two
days before the House of Representatives was to start action on
impeaching him. It was also one day before he gave orders to bomb
Iraq. I got out of bed that morning, took in the papers, and
scanned the first page. Within 10 minutes I was decided, and not
only decided, but decided with a heat that I rarely feel about
public affairs. What sparked this heat was the picture of Clinton
in Gaza, and the reminder of the picture of Clinton the previous
day, wearing a yarmulke at the grave of Yitzhak Rabin. And I
suddenly thought, ``Is this the man I want representing the
righteousness of America in a land sacred to billions of Jews,
Christians, and Moslems?'' Then I asked whether I wanted him to
represent us anywhere. Do we want him laying the wreath at the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier, comforting our mourners, saluting our
heroes? Do I want to see his ``sincere'' face on television every
day? No, decidedly no!
</P>
<P>
   No, even more decidedly no, after the bombing of Iraq. I don't
know whether he decided to bomb Iraq in order to divert us from the
forthcoming impeachment debate. That is the point: I don't know,
and most of the world doesn't know. He has generated the belief
that he is capable of taking such grave action to save his own
skin. Terminating the action in Iraq without any conclusive results
only a few hours after the House voted for impeachment strengthened
that belief. He had started the bombing just in time to give his
supporters the refuge of arguing that to impeach the commander in
chief while our troops were in harm's way would be unpatriotic. He
had stopped the bombing as soon as that argument became useless.
That is an abuse of power! The whole episode shows how unfit he is
to be president. He has polluted the atmosphere within which policy
decisions are made.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost everyone else, I want to get ``this thing'' over
with. But to me ``this thing'' is not only the process; it is also
the Clinton presidency. I don't want to punish him or have a
national catharsis. I want something more practical. I want him off
our screen.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I never wanted Clinton to be president and never
voted for him. But I was always ``cool'' about it. I have not been
a deep-dyed Clinton hater. Except for the 1993 health care plan,
and his vacillation toward Iraq, his policy has not been terrible,
in my opinion. The performance of the economy during his
administration has been good, and although I don't attribute very
much of that to him, at least he has not been an obstacle. I don't
expect any improvement, or any change, in public policy as a result
of his departure.
</P>
<P>
   An an article I wrote during the 1996 campaign (pre-Lewinsky) I
said of Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has one serious deficiency as a president. He is prone
to foolish mistakes. Every president, like everyone else, makes
mistakes. Foolish mistakes are ones that could reliably have been
known in advance to be mistakes. There is something in Bill
Clinton--some odd combination of naivete and conceit--that makes
him liable to such mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone too far in his foolish mistakes, and beyond foolish
mistakes, and I am no longer ``cool'' about him as president.
</P>
<P>
   People who are legally fastidious say it's not the sex, it's the
perjury. For me it is partly the sex. If he had lied under oath
about parking illegally I wouldn't be so disgusted. But for a
married man to have oral sex with a woman employee less than half
his age in the Oval Office--I can't claim not to be offended by
that. I have been told that is an old-fashioned, puritanical
attitude. But even old-fashioned puritans have the right as
citizens to protest the behavior of their president. And it is not
only the perjury. It is the sophomoric deviousness of the perjury
that is an insult to our intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional question remains. Does his behavior add up to
grounds for removal from office? The words in the Constitution,
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' give us much latitude. If the
framers had wanted to limit us more they could have been more
specific. Essentially, they left the judgment to us--not to an
opinion poll or even to our political representatives who are
closest to the people but to our most senior political
representatives, the Senate. My opinion is that not every perjury
is a ``high'' crime, as grounds for removing a president from
office. But I believe that Clinton's performance, before and after
his perjuries, has universally generated such a response of
disapproval, ranging from cynicism to disgust, as to degrade the
ability of the presidency to serve its function. Clinton has said
that it is his goal to degrade the ability of Saddam Hussein to
threaten Iraq's neighbors. But Clinton has degraded the ability of
the president of the United States to lead the nation and the
world. That is a high crime.
</P>
<P>
   I am still concerned about the risk of setting a precedent for
opposition majorities in Congress to remove presidents for purely
political reasons. Future generations will have to deal with that.
For now we have to set the precedent that presidents of the United
States should so behave themselves as to merit the confidence of
the world. This is a big country, and surely we can find men and
women in it who are as capable of being president as Mr. Clinton is
and who are also able to commit themselves to good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a vote of at least two-thirds of the
Senate to convict and expel a president. The Republicans will not
have a two-thirds majority, and Clinton cannot be convicted on the
votes of Republicans alone. That is a good thing. The
precedent-setting risk would be greater if the president were
convicted by a strictly party-line vote. The case against the
president should be strong enough to justify some members of his
own party voting against him. In the case of this president, it is.

LET'S GO BACK AND IMPEACH REAGAN  
 BY MICHAEL KINSLEY
</HEADLINE>
  (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so it's not about sex. It's about lying under oath,
obstruction of justice, and abuse of power. If the standards used
to impeach President Clinton for those offenses were applied to his
two Republican predecessors, Reagan and Bush, they would have been
impeached too. The fact that they weren't owes less to any lack of
evidence than to a sense of proportion and respect for the popular
will--or call it cowardice, perhaps--in the opposition party (the
Democrats), which then controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The only time Ronald Reagan ever talked about Iran-Contra under
oath was in a deposition for the criminal trial of his former
National Security Adviser John Poindexter. The deposition was in
1990, after Reagan had left office. He claimed that there was not
``one iota'' of evidence that profits from the sale of arms to Iran
had been diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras, that his aides hadn't
lied to Congress about the affair, and so on. All this was
demonstrably false. The only reason he might not be guilty of
perjury is that his mind pretty clearly was going.
</P>
<P>
   But the very fact that Reagan was never forced to testify under
oath as president illustrates the double standard that has trapped
Bill Clinton. If Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh had operated
like Kenneth Starr, he would have forced Reagan, while president,
to repeat or renounce under oath his public lies about Iran-Contra,
such as those in his first TV address on the subject, when he
declared it ``utterly false'' that arms had been shipped to Iran in
exchange for the release of American hostages. This was as vivid as
Clinton's televised finger-wagging ``that woman'' sound bite, and
just as flatly untrue. Reagan had been at several meetings where
the arms-for-hostages deal was discussed--and, indeed, where
Cabinet members had warned him it was illegal and he'd said he
didn't care. If Walsh had been Starr, Reagan would have faced the
same excruciating dilemma as Clinton: admit to a spectacular public
lie or lie again under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly Reagan was already gaga in 1986, while still president,
though this is not an argument the Republicans now pursuing Clinton
are likely to want to make (or were heard to make back in 1986).
But even before he was officially declared to be losing it, Reagan
benefited from a more general double standard about truth telling.
Reagan and Clinton both are among the great bullslingers of
American history, but somehow Reagan was always regarded as
floating above the truth while Clinton is regarded as wallowing
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's final report concluded that Reagan ``knowingly
participated or at least acquiesced in'' the Iran-Contra cover-up,
which involved, among other things, Oliver North shredding
thousands of documents that may well have implicated Reagan more
deeply. Any Flytrap cover-up pales in comparison. (The nearest
equivalent involves the mysterious appearance--not
disappearance--of documents, none of which has turned out to be
vital, in a White House closet.) Yet Walsh didn't bring charges
against Reagan, or even depose him to squeeze out information or
set him up for a perjury rap.
</P>
<P>
   The case against George Bush--by the standards being applied to
Bill Clinton--is even stronger. Bush claimed in the 1992 campaign
that he'd given sworn testimony hundreds of times conceding that he
knew all about the arms-for-hostages deal. In fact, when the story
broke in 1986, Bush repeatedly claimed to have been ``out of the
loop.'' He knew we were selling arms to Iran--itself flatly illegal
and spectacularly in conflict with the administration's public
pronouncements--but, he claimed, he had no idea the deal involved
paying ransom for hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Bush claimed not to have attended a January 1986
meeting at which Secretary of State George Schultz and Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger vehemently opposed trading for hostages.
When White House logs indicated that Bush was at the
</P>
<P>
   meeting, he emended his story to say he hadn't caught the drift
of Schultz's and Weinberger's objections. If only he'd known George
and Cap were as bothered as he was, Bush said, he would have tried
to stop the policy. This was his story until 1992, when Walsh
released notes taken by Weinberger at the meeting, recording that
``VP approves'' of the policy Bush claimed to be both ignorant of
and disturbed by.
</P>
<P>
   As president in 1989-93, Bush did his best to thwart Walsh's
investigation. He tightened up on the release of classified
information. A diary he started keeping in 1986 somehow never
materialized until after the 1992 election. And his last-minute
pardon of Weinberger, Poindexter, and others, after he'd lost
re-election, effectively thwarted Walsh's pursuit of Bush himself,
among others. No ``obstruction of justice'' or ``abuse of
presidential power'' in Flytrap comes close.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bill Clinton's presidency stamped forever with the
shame of impeachment, and why does he face premature removal from
office, when impeachment was never seriously considered for Bush
and Reagan? Perhaps at this point Clinton's critics would like to
revisit their insistence that it's not about sex. The only sensible
distinction is that lies about some things matter more than others.
Henry Hyde, for example, was quite eloquent back in the Iran-Contra
era about how statesmanship and higher principles sometimes require
presidents to lie and break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and others would be tempted to say that lying to free
American hostages and breaking the law to protect Latin America
from communism are more justified than lies to hide a tawdry
affair. I would be tempted to reply that lies and cover-ups
intended to thwart the workings of democracy on an important public
policy issue seem to me to be a lot worse than lies about an
embarrassing personal mess. But perhaps we could agree that David
Schippers, the House Judiciary Committee Counsel, was wrong in his
self-righteous pronouncement ``Lies are lies are lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers himself told a quick series of obvious whoppers during
that same impeachment hearing opening statement. ``When I appeared
in this committee room a little over two months ago,'' he said
(mournful as the Walrus in Through the Looking Glass), ``it was
merely to analyze the (Starr report) referral and to report to you.
Today, after our investigation, I come to a point that frankly I
prayed I would never reach. It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse
President William Jefferson Clinton,'' etc., etc. Raise your hand
if you believe Schippers a) was feeling sorrowful; b) had prayed
that his months of effort to nail the president would be in vain;
c) was being frank; d) had no settled view on the whole matter even
after analyzing the Starr report, until ``our investigation''
(whatever that consisted of). And while your hand is up, would you
care to swear an oath that you believe these unbelievable things?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a witness lies, that witness chips a stone from the
foundation of our entire legal system,'' Schippers intoned. Or does
he make an exception when the witness is himself? Trent Lott, as
Senate majority leader, is overseer of the forthcoming Clinton
trial. He was pictured in the New York Times of Dec. 25 actually
wagging his finger, Clinton-''that woman''-style, as he publicly
lied to get himself out of a fix. On Wednesday he had said about
the Baghdad bombing: ``While I have been assured by administration
officials that there is no connection with the impeachment process
... I cannot support this military action in the Persian Gulf at
this time. Both the timing and the policy are subject to
question.''
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately clear that Lott should not have said this. So
on Thursday, Lott declared that he did support the action, did not
suspect any connection with the impeachment process, and had not
meant to imply otherwise merely by uttering words whose plain
meaning and universal interpretation was the exact opposite. Lott's
sushi-master carve-up of the phrase ``at this time'' was positively
Clintonian in its boldness and artistry. Of course he wasn't under
oath, so that's OK. What made the Lott incident especially
enjoyable is that Republicans all rallied round the obvious meaning
of his original statement even as Lott himself was denying it. Paul
Gigot, for example, got trapped midspin-cycle. In his Friday column
on the Wall Street Journal editorial page, he praised Lott's remark
as ``an honest, considered judgment.'' But how could a conservative
Republican senator and major flag waver for the original Gulf War
honestly oppose punishing Saddam for violating his surrender terms?
Easy: ``This is the surreal politics Bill Clinton has created.
Hawks are now doves and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely, Paul, you don't really believe Clinton bombed
Baghdad to affect the impeachment vote? Well, no, but, ``The
tragedy for American interests is that Mr. Clinton is doubted even
when he might be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Neato. Clinton is thus responsible not only for his own lies and
hypocrisies but also for those of his enemies. No doubt he is
somehow to blame for Iran-Contra too.

AMAZON.COM'S AMAZING TAX BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of days ago, annoyed with Amazon.com because 10 days
had passed since I placed an order and it still hadn't been shipped
yet, I canceled that order and went (in the virtual sense) to
barnesandnoble.com to buy the set of books I wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I placed the books in my virtual shopping cart and got to the
end of the checkout line, but when I arrived there I discovered
that my New York address meant that I was going to have to pay the
8.25 percent state sales tax on any orders from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Since Amazon.com charges sales tax only to residents of the
state of Washington, I canceled my barnesandnoble.com order and
returned to Jeff Bezos' site, chastened. Amazon ended up getting my
order, despite its inferior service, because I was able to practice
tax evasion while buying there.
</P>
<P>
   A story with an obvious moral, to be sure, but just because the
moral is obvious doesn't mean that it's unimportant. In fact, in
the glorious hubbub about the inevitable triumph of e-commerce, too
little attention has been paid to the impact of tax-free purchasing
on the demand for buying goods over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard a lot of talk about how online retailing allows
sellers to deliver goods more cheaply and efficiently than in the
offline world. But one of the key reasons why sellers can deliver
goods more cheaply is that almost without exception they're getting
a price break of anywhere from 5 percent to 8 percent depending on
where the buyer is.
</P>
<P>
   And given how dubious these e-commerce business models look even
with the absence of sales tax--companies losing more money, not
less, every quarter--what will happen when the preposterous
three-year moratorium on Internet taxation ends?
</P>
<P>
   That's an especially interesting question because all the
evidence suggests that many online shoppers are there not because
of the convenience, but because of the cheap prices. One recent
much-cited study by Chicago economics professor Austan Goolsbee
suggested that Internet sales would drop by 30 percent if sales tax
were charged.
</P>
<P>
   If you add together sales tax with shipping costs, after all,
most books at the online web sites would be as expensive, or nearly
so, as they are in a real book store. And when you shop at a real
bookstore you don't have to wait three days to read the book when
you buy it. (People who talk about how quick it is to shop online
always seem to omit the part about waiting for the product to
arrive.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans don't have to pay any Internet tax because of the
three-year moratorium pushed through Congress in October. The
moratorium was supposedly intended to protect a nascent industry,
and perhaps to lay the groundwork for a national sales tax to
replace what's inevitably called the current ``hodgepodge'' of
state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But singling out the Internet for what's effectively a subsidy
is exactly the kind of government planning for which everyone now
excoriates Japan's MITI. Giving companies a competitive price
advantage for no reason other than that the Internet is new is an
excellent recipe for ensuring that they'll never really figure out
how to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all these companies are counting on that moratorium
being extended indefinitely. But if e-commerce becomes as big as
everyone says it will, there's no way states will be able to
survive without taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed impossibility of collecting individual state taxes
is, on the face of it, ridiculous. barnesandnoble.com, for
instance, collects state taxes from citizens of New York, New
Jersey, and Virginia (New York and New Jersey are where B&AMP;N's
corporate headquarters are, Virginia I still haven't figured out).
Would it really be that hard to collect from citizens of the other
states?
</P>
<P>
   What's especially screwed-up about the current system is that it
actually helps pick winners and losers among the e-commerce
players, besides giving a big boost to all the e-commerce people.
In retailing, 5 percent to 8 percent is a huge difference, which
means that Barnes and Noble is at a serious competitive
disadvantage compared to Amazon when it comes to someone like me.
And I'd be surprised if New York didn't account for a
disproportionate number of Internet bookbuyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tax loopholes are always bad ideas. They function as subsidies,
distorting the ability of price to convey information about demand
and making everything much less efficient than it should be. The
Internet Tax Freedom Act may be law, but it's bad law. E-commerce
is for real, but it needs to flourish without subsidies if it's to
be really for real.

GAME RATING SYSTEM STILL GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO GORE
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS  
 c.1998 CyberTimes 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While supporters and critics of the electronic game industry
agree that the voluntary rating system used for video and computer
games generally works well, a new report suggests that some
publishers may be undermining the ratings, by marketing games
featuring gore and violence to children barely out of their Sesame
Street years.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict became apparent this month (December), after the
release of the fourth annual ``Video and Computer Game Report
Card'' issued by a media watchdog group, the Minneapolis-based
National Institute on Media and the Family. The report was unveiled
at a news conference with Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat, who helped push for the industry to adopt its voluntary
rating system in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report was timed for the onset of the busy
holiday game-buying season; overall, the industry is expected to
record about $6 billion in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a combination of telephone interviews with parents,
visits to game retail and rental outlets and inspections of about
90 games, the report card offered word of some positive
developments for parents concerned about games that emphasize
violence and offensive themes, finding that the rating system is
generally working well.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings appeared on virtually all the video and computer game
boxes examined for the report, and the researchers generally agreed
with the ratings assigned to the games -- seven categories ranging
from ``early childhood'' to content suitable for ``adults only.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the report found that the ratings have not proved
altogether successful in keeping children away from graphic
content.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the report indicated that too few parents know
about or use the ratings. A national telephone survey of 529
parents conducted this summer by the National Institute on Media
and the Family found that only about 40 percent routinely checked a
game's rating when making a purchase. Another problem, the group
found, is that few retailers have policies in place to discourage
children from buying games rated for the older crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the report charged that a small group of game makers
and distributors is marketing games to a younger-than-appropriate
age group. ``We are not claiming it's widespread, but there are
examples and we are asking the industry to take a look at it,''
said David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited several examples of inappropriate marketing,
among them an advertisement for a game called Resident Evil 2 in
the magazine Sports Illustrated for Kids. The game, made by Capcom
Entertainment, carries an ``M'' rating, indicating it is
appropriate for those age 17 and above.
</P>
<P>
   But the advertisement in Sports Illustrated for Kids was for a
toned-down version of the game made by a different company, Tiger
Electronics Ltd., and adapted for hand-held units. This version
carries a ``T,'' rating, meaning it is suitable for those 13 and
older, said Sandra M. Schneider, vice president of Tiger
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated for Kids, meanwhile, is aimed at 8- to
14-year-olds, and about half of its readership is older than 12,
said Tracey Vogt, a spokeswoman for the company. Magazine officials
saw little that was inappropriate in the advertisement itself and
felt the product was targeted at a good portion of the
publication's readership.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh found those arguments unconvincing, suggesting that many
parents would not distinguish between the various versions of the
game. He also said he is concerned that the advertisement could
whet the appetite of the magazine's younger readers for the more
violent version of the game. ``They use products that would gain
the attention of kids to sell products that are not supposed to be
sold to kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry representatives insist that matters are not as
simple as presented in the study, and that game marketing is
generally appropriately targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, which represents 41 major game publishers,
said that it is impossible for publishers ``to create an airtight
system'' to prevent children from ever being exposed to advertising
for games aimed at an older market.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein stressed that he is not defending some of the
advertisements in the industry, which prominently highlight the
goriest aspects of violent games. Nonetheless, he says there are
other brakes on children's access to arguably inappropriate
material that the report card fails to consider.
</P>
<P>
   One is that increasingly, the players themselves are older, and
that computer games are now often played by adults, not just young
boys. Another, he said, is that buyers of the items are usually
adults, because few children have the $50 or so available to buy
the games.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh remains skeptical and says it is children, in many cases,
who buy the games. His assessment of this year's report is that it
contains both good news and bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been progress in a lot of areas, and there are some
concerns in others,'' he said.

WELCOME TO OUR FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
  By TODD PITOCK 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, as the infamous British nanny case made front-page
news, my wife and I began looking for childcare. Despite the
negative press, choosing an au pair seemed like the best option for
our family. If nothing else, a year of living with a stranger would
be an adventure for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   What we found, adventure aside, was that much could be learned
from our relationship with our au pair. I came to this conclusion
one Saturday when, a little past noon, my 2-year-old son threw a
major fit. He lay on the floor, outraged and bereft, his face
hidden in his arms. I knelt beside him and offered lunch, milk and
the $23 I had in my pocket. ``You know, Jeremy,'' I sighed, ``this
isn't what I had in mind for our afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a voice from above called out to me: ``Offer him a
cheese stick!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I thought, heavenly advice. Soon, there was peace in our
house.
</P>
<P>
   The voice belonged to our German caregiver, Kathrin (Ka-treen).
It was simultaneously disconcerting and reassuring to think that in
eight months, she'd acquired a better sense of how to handle
Jeremy's tantrums than I had.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Toni, was in graduate school when Jeremy was born, and
we found ourselves in a common predicament over childcare. Our
4-year-old daughter, Elyse, was in preschool Monday through Friday,
but we needed a full day's supervision for Jeremy and occasional
evenings for both kids. Cost was an issue, as was flexibility. Our
schedules shifted according to my unpredictable project deadlines
and the demands of Toni's academic workload.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, we wanted nurturing, consistent, one-on-one care
for Jeremy, in our house, from a caregiver whom we could train and
supervise. In our experience with daycare, which we'd used
part-time for a few months, the staff turnover rate was high, and
we wanted Jeremy to have more stability.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, we opted for an au pair, a young foreign woman from
one of six U.S. government-regulated agencies, who would live with
us for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Toni and I were scrupulous about finding the right person. We
chose an agency that asked detailed questions on its application
about the au pair's background and interests. We made up our own
questions, too, already knowing the answers we wanted, to make sure
the candidate was a solid match.
</P>
<P>
   Then we placed our overseas call to interview 19-year-old
Kathrin, the prospective au pair with whom we'd been matched by the
agency. In the conversation, we posed ``what if'' scenarios to test
Kathrin's responses on various childcare issues. Toni asked how
Kathrin's parents felt about her going abroad for a year. Hearing
they were worried (they were) would indicate that she came from a
nurturing family.
</P>
<P>
   As a final question, Toni inquired, ``How should children be
disciplined?'' ``According to the parents' beliefs.'' Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Kathrin's arrival, six weeks before Toni's fall
semester began, allowed us time to observe her with the kids and
gave her a chance to model our parenting style. During the first
days, we discussed expectations on both sides. Elyse was excited by
the prospect of having a ``big sister,'' and Jeremy instantly took
to our new helper.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges were immediately apparent. The only room
available for her was the one right next to ours. Suddenly, our
personal space constricted. The house became somewhat more formal.
No more flopping in front of the TV set in my favorite ragged
pajamas. But that was implicit in the choice of having live-in
help. We all adjusted. I learned to wear a robe.
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier was greater than we'd anticipated. Toni,
who is a South African immigrant, and I had both lived in
non-English speaking countries and understood how overwhelming it
is to have words coming at you like freeway traffic, so we did our
best to speak slowly. Kathrin, determined to learn, studied her
palm-size German-English dictionary every night. Her discipline
paid off, and within weeks, she improved markedly.
</P>
<P>
   The children were the main issue. After the initial excitement
wore off, Elyse resisted the alien authority figure in ``her''
house. The result was erratic emotions, from love to hate,
sometimes within a bewildering stretch of 10 minutes. Kathrin, an
experienced daytime baby sitter but here clearly out of her depth,
was confused, irritated and unequipped. She compared Elyse with
Jeremy, generally an easygoing 16-month-old, and decided that Elyse
was ``difficult.'' When we explained that Jeremy was simply
younger, that Elyse had also been pliant at his age and was still a
happy 4-year-old, Kathrin did not look completely convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Toni and I began to hold weekly family meetings to discuss what
was working and what wasn't. Here, Elyse and Kathrin expressed
themselves gently but directly. Elyse needed to know that she could
articulate her feelings. Otherwise, they'd turn into tears of rage,
which in turn would provoke Kathrin. Given a chance to speak up,
Elyse felt her power restored.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Kathrin grew into her role. She continued to favor
Jeremy, though not at the expense of Elyse. Because Elyse was in
school, Kathrin spent more time with our son. She also came to know
him at an earlier stage of his life, learned the rhythms of his
moods as he developed, and moved in sync with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrin's relationship with the kids, Toni, and me was hard to
pin down. Kathrin was not quite family, but she wasn't just an
employee, either. One of the most challenging aspects of living
with Kathrin was when she was off duty. Sometimes she seemed like a
mature young woman who was nearly our contemporary; other times she
was like a teenager thrusting us into a stage of parenthood for
which we weren't ready.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of instances, such as a series of successive late
nights that had her falling down on the job, required that Kathrin
and I have a ``chat.'' Thereafter, we agreed to a midnight curfew
on workdays. We could also see that she needed more time off, and
we agreed to give her alternate weekends. It was a case of
enlightened self-interest. This way, we could ask her to put in
longer hours on days when our schedules got particularly hectic.
</P>
<P>
   Kathrin was clever and innovative when it came to playing with
the kids. I arrived home one afternoon to discover she'd turned the
entire basement into an indoor playground. An old blanket and two
cardboard boxes were transformed into a bedouin-style tent, and
Jeremy's cars and trains formed a little transport system
underneath, much to his delight. Not only did Kathrin seem to enjoy
playing with the kids, she knew how to do it at their level.
</P>
<P>
   As Kathrin's yearlong stay drew to a close, she said she had no
regrets. ``I learned a lot,'' she told me, ``But if I had total
choice, I would rather be an exchange student than an an pair.''
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. Critics of the au pair program point this
out as its quintessential flaw. When the host family is looking for
childcare and the au pair is looking for an American adventure,
such mismatched expectations can lead to unhappy pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Kathrin's departure, Toni and I decided not to apply
immediately for another au pair. We didn't want to bring someone
into the children's lives, only to replace the relationship on a
yearly basis. We also had the luxury of time. Toni had finished her
graduate studies and was pregnant again, so she would be at home.
</P>
<P>
   We talked with our children about Kathrin's leaving. We drew
maps and pictures, explaining where she would be going. Jeremy, not
quite 2 1/2, needed the preparation. When he heard the word
leaving, he reflexively offered to go along for the ride, for fear
of being left behind. This was one ride, we explained, he couldn't
go on. Although sad, he brightened somewhat when Toni reassured him
that neither she nor I would be leaving.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Kathrin's absence was harder for Elyse, who
had overcome her early resistance and grown attached to her
caregiver. A few outbursts prompted us to discuss Kathrin's
departure, talking with Elyse about how it made her feel. Slowly,
we all adjusted to life as it was before having an au pair.
</P>
<P>
   After Kathrin left, the house assumed its former dimensions. The
robe returned to the closet, and I once again flopped, pajama-clad,
in front of Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time Toni and I missed the extra help, and we
were so far out of the baby-sitting loop that we didn't know where
to begin. Kathrin herself had been part of our life for a year,
sharing everything from dinnertime discussions to family outings.
It was only natural, then, that for a while, we all had a sense
that someone was missing.

WHY MONEY WON'T BUY FAT 
 BY ATUL GAWANDE, M.D.
</HEADLINE>
  c.1998 Slate (www.slate.com 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a job like mine, in which a reasonably broad swath
of American society presents itself to you without any clothes on,
this question no doubt has popped into your head: Why are the poor
so fat? That obesity is a characteristic problem of affluent
countries surprises no one. But why is it also characteristic that
obesity increases so dramatically as you go down the social scale?
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not the case in developing nations. In
countries such as India, where my parents emigrated from, being
overweight is directly related to wealth and status and is regarded
as attractive. Thus, my father's rural family of farmers is thin
and wiry, while the elders in my mother's urban clan of higher
caste and wealthier stock are as plump as can be. When my sister
and I, two scrawny specimens of the American ``upper-middle
class,'' visit, we always evoke a good deal of concern from
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The first report I found to document the effect class has on
obesity was a 1965 study of midtown Manhattan residents. The
researchers found obesity was six times more common among women in
the bottom third of the social scale than among those in the top
third. Subsequent studies, orginating from California to New
Zealand, confirm these findings. In a 1996 study in Minnesota's
Twin Cities, women earning under $10,000 a year weighed, on
average, 20 pounds more than women earning over $40,000 a year. In
advanced nations, low income is a more powerful predictor of
obesity than any single factor except age, though this relationship
is weaker in men than in women. In men, height is associated more
strongly with status. On average, in developed and undeveloped
countries alike, richer men are taller.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think weight would be like height. More money means more
food. So more food should mean more fat, just as it means more
height, right? And, in fact, in children this is exactly the
case--at young ages, certainly under age 6 in the United States,
lower-income kids are less likely to be obese than higher-income
kids. By the time they are adults, however, the relationship has
inverted.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? As my epidemiologist friends point out to me,
when two things correlate, there are always three possible
explanations. One leads to the other. The other leads to the one.
Or some third thing is driving both.
</P>
<P>
   The downward mobility hypothesis. One possibility is that
obesity leads to lower income. Certainly the obese, particularly
obese women, face severe disadvantages in both the job and marriage
markets. And the evidence that this produces downward mobility is
distressingly strong. Almost half the women in the 1965 Manhattan
study belonged to a different social class than their parents, and
those who had moved down were significantly fatter than those who
had moved up. More recently, a landmark national study led by
Steven Gortmaker, a Harvard researcher, tracked over 8,000 people
from age 18 to 25. It found the heaviest 5 percent of women were
half as likely to get married and twice as likely to become
impoverished as others. Obesity affected a woman's economic
prospects more than even chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   In men, however, shortness led to downward mobility. One foot
less of height doubled a man's likelihood of poverty. But as
Gortmaker points out, downward mobility explains only a small part
of the observed relationship of income to obesity. That makes
sense. After all, the gap also exists in countries such as Britain,
where social class is more rigid than it is here.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic explanation. Could genetics be an outside factor
driving both obesity and poverty? The so-called ``Danish doption
study'' lent some credence to the idea, finding that the obesity
and social status of adoptees depended on the social status not
only of their adoptive parents but also of their biological
parents. The study inferred that parents can give their offspring
genetic traits that tip the scales toward both heavier weight and
lower status. Even so, inheritance accounted for at most a small
part of the stark effect of income on obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The gluttony and sloth hypothesis. So downward mobility and
genes matter somewhat but, ultimately, we're left with the obvious
explanation that in affluent societies the lower the income, the
more people eat unhealthily, sit around, or both. Unfortunately,
measuring this directly is notoriously difficult. Most
people--especially the obese--fib about diet and exercise and, when
observed, tend to change their behavior. The differences you're
looking for are also quite small--a single calorie of extra daily
intake starting in childhood can translate into 10 extra pounds by
the time you're 25. Nonetheless, there's a good deal of indirect
evidence--for example, TV watching is linked to eating more and
exercising less, and rises substantially as income lowers. Given
the weakness of other explanations, few experts doubt that
lifestyle is the most important one.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why. It's as if avoiding obesity were enormously
expensive. But it's not--exercise is free, and eating less junk
food and meat and more produce saves money. Rather, for the 30
percent to 70 percent with a genetic predisposition to obesity,
it's just horrendously difficult. Being motivated is vital, and
motivation is what seems to differ by class.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Twin Cities study, for example, found marked
differences in weight concern. Although women earning under $10,000
were no less successful when they dieted than women earning over
$40,000, they were one-third less likely to diet in the first
place. They had a greater tolerance for weight gain, saying it
would take a 20 pound gain before they took action, as opposed to
the 10 pound gain that would trigger action in higher-income women.
They even weighed themselves less often (three times a month vs.
seven times a month).
</P>
<P>
   This cultural-differences explanation certainly accounts for why
anorexia nervosa is mainly a disease of higher-income girls and
young women. Since obese men are less stigmatized, it may also
explain why wealthier men are not that much less obese than poorer
men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if thinness really becomes the ideal in every affluent
culture--the way plumpness is in poor societies--it's curious. Is
this simply the nature of status--the rich will always find a way
to distinguish themselves from the poor? Or does richness breed an
instinct for longevity? Whatever the case, I'll know India has
finally risen from Third World status when I go back to visit my
relatives and the first few words they say are not ``Eat, eat,
skinny boy.''

TEA FOR LIFE

<P>
   A cup of tea keeps the doctor away? Don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A symposium this fall (1998) in Washington heard evidence that
this 5,000-year-old beverage has health benefits beyond a warm,
contented feeling and a gentle caffeine buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that
tea is an important source of antioxidants, those chemicals that
keep oxygen and nitrogen compounds from damaging cells, thus
slowing the aging process and preventing some diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A typical cup of black tea _ the kind most Americans drink _
contains more antioxidants than some fruits and vegetables. Teams
from the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the Chinese Academy of
Preventative Medicine discussed findings that tea-drinking may
reduce the risk of some kinds of cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some evidence from the Netherlands that chemicals
in tea can lower levels of ``bad'' cholesterol in the bloodstream,
which might prevent heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   All this good news needs to be taken with a grain of, er, sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium was sponsored and publicized by the Tea Council of
the USA, an association of tea businesses and importers. Below the
headlines, scientists indicated that most of their theories needed
much more research for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Still the possibility of health benefits justifies a second look
at a drink whose popularity crosses the boundaries between dozens
of cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical year, Americans drink enough tea to fill 160,000
backyard swimming pools, with plenty of pitchers to spare,
according to the Tea Council. Roughly half of Americans are
tea-drinkers, with the South and New Englanders downing far more
than their share.
</P>
<P>
   According to sociologist John Shelton Reed, 87 percent of
Southerners say they drink tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink tea every day,'' said Moyra Stevens, a Scotswoman now
living and gardening in Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Down South, of course, ``tea'' usually means sugared iced tea;
two-thirds of Southerners say they prefer their brew sweet, and
they drink it year-round, even in the depth of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Such a widespread habit _ novelist Reynolds Price says iced tea
is as essential to the Southern lunch as fried chicken, cured ham
or green beans _ was formed surprisingly recently.
</P>
<P>
   Official histories credit British promoter Richard Blechynden
with inventing iced tea in 1904, meeting the demand for a cool
nonalcoholic beverage at the St. Louis World's Fair that year.
</P>
<P>
   Food chronicler John Egerton, however, thinks cool tea might
have caught on in parts of the South in the late 1800s, as
commercial ice-making became more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everybody downs his or her tea cold, and Orange
Pekoe, the type preferred in most Southern kitchens, is just one of
thousands of varieties of tea worldwide. It's possible to grow as
snobbish about tea as many aficionados do about wines or cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung invented tea in
the year 2737 B.C., after some leaves floated into a pot of boiling
water. Other sources claim that tea was brought to China by
Buddhist missionaries from India. In any case, China and India
still lead the world both in tea production and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Tea leaves come from a bush or shrub, a botanical cousin of the
camellia. The best teas grow in tropical regions on mountainsides
at elevations between 3,000 and 7,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Teas come in three major varieties: black, green or oolong.
Black teas, accounting for 95 percent of the tea drunk in America,
are produced by crushing the leaves, letting them ferment under
special conditions and then drying or oxidizing them in ovens.
Dried, the teas are black and powdery; steeped in boiling water,
they take a red or amber hue.
</P>
<P>
   Green teas, a specialty of China and Japan, are steamed and
crushed, without the oxidizing process. The resulting teas are
green or golden in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Oolong teas represent a sort of halfway point between black and
</P>
<P>
   green. The leaves are partially fermented, giving these teas a
greenish-brown color.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal teas, especially the decaffeinated brands, are not true
teas. They are ground from the flowers, leaves, peels, seeds and
other parts of plants and herbs such as chamomile, chrysanthemum,
thyme, peppermint, cinnamon or rosebud.
</P>
<P>
   TEA CEREMONIES
</P>
<P>
   Almost as important as the tea itself is the ritual behind it.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan _ which acquired tea from a Buddhist monk named Yeisi
sometime in the 1100s _ the tea ceremony evolved into an elaborate
social grace, in which tea-drinking (precisely three sips, no more,
no less, from a tiny, exquisite cup) becomes almost an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, who picked up the habit in the 1700s, turned tea into
an excuse for animated conversation, generally centered around
their distinctive samovars (from a Russian word meaning, literally,
``self-boiler''). In Russia, tea is strongly sweetened with sugar,
honey or jam.
</P>
<P>
   The Western nation that took tea closest to its heart, however,
was Merry Old England. The brew began to appear in London in the
late 1600s, patronized by King Charles II, who picked up the tea
habit while in exile in Holland and who married a princess from
Portugal, the foremost tea importer of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, again, that particular English custom called ``tea'' is of
surprisingly recent vintage. History books attribute it to the
Duchess of Bedford (1788-1861), who needed an afternoon pick-me-up.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources credit the Industrial Revolution. Britons, then as
now, generally serve supper at 8 p.m. or even 9 p.m., Stevens
noted. The workers from the new factories of the 1800s and the
mines, however, needed some refreshment once their shifts ended
around 4 or 5 p.m. Thus, Stevens and millions of other Anglophiles
take a break around the world at 4 p.m. for a little tea with
perhaps a cookie or some cake. ``High tea'' takes on the character
of a small meal, often with roast beef, mashed potatoes and peas.
</P>
<P>
   The tea is always hot, even in the tropics: ``The heat actually
cools you down, strangely enough,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake novice tea-drinkers make, is not to heat the
water enough. For good tea, the water must boil, at a temperature
of at least 212 degrees; coffee-grade water, at 180 degrees or so,
will not do.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens always begins by warming her teapot, pouring in some
water from her electric kettle, swirling it around inside, then
pouring it out through the spout.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers loose tea, which involves such apparatus as a
tea-strainer or tea ball. However, Americans have generally
embraced the 1904 invention of tea dealer Thomas Sullivan, also
introduced at the St. Louis World's Fair _ the tea bag.

   Here are budget lines for the first installment of the Cox
Millennium package on the 2000th anniversary of Christianity. It is
running in two parts, the first on Sunday, Dec. 27, the second on
Saturday, Jan. 2. CoxNet will produce a full-page layout for each
of these two parts:
</P>
<P>
   This package is for Sunday, Dec. 27: MOVED LAST WEEK
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-OVERVIEW _ Almost 2,000 years ago, a man named Jesus
was born and the world changed forever. The impact of Jesus echoes
through the millennia. It has profoundly changed the way people
view God, the world and each other. Over the next two weeks, and
the coming year, Cox Newspapers will take a look at Jesus, focusing
on the spread of Christianity, first in and around its homeland in
the Mideast, later through Europe and the Americas, and ultimatley
around the world. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-CHRISTIANS _ JERUSALEM _ Despite their urban settings
and the politics that engulfs them 2000 years later, the sites
where Christ was born, lived and died are still powerful ``faith
strengtheners'' for millions of Christians world wide. Visits to
the region by Christians _ and they constitute about 75 percent of
Israel's 2.3 million annual tourists _ remind them that Jesus was
human and the ideals he practiced can be practiced by others. The
physical sites still make Jesus' story real. Christian
denominations have picked their favorite spots. Catholics come to
Jerusalem's Old City, where they often rent wooden crosses and walk
the supposed path Jesus took with his cross. Traditional
Protestants gravitate toward the Church of the Nativity and
Evangelicals head for prayer nearby in the Shepherd's Fields.
(Kaplow, Cox News Service) 35.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-SCENES _ JERUSALEM _ Short vignettes from the places
where Jesus was born, lived and died, focusing on what they look
like today, what visitors think of them and how they fit into
today's political, social landscape. (Kaplow, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   For Saturday, Jan. 2: MOVED TODAY
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-FUTURE _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ There is a new trend
in this old city. For about a year, Christians have been putting
crosses, usually lit electrically, on their homes and shops. It is
largely seen as a sign of a population that is free, but is a
minority and feels insecure. Christians are a divided minority. In
Israel, Arab Christians benefit from a healthier economy and some
even serve in the Israeli army. In Palestinian areas, they face a
military occupation and a stagnant economy _ driving many to
emigrate to the United States. But, 2000 years after it was founded
here, it would be a mistake to predict Christianity's demise in the
Holy Land. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) 25.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-SYRIAC _ JERUSALEM _ Two thousand years later, you
can still
</P>
<P>
   hear the language. About 3,000 Syriac Christians cling to their
lifestyle in the walled city of Jerusalem and still practice
religion in Aramaic, the language of Christ. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service) 20.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-AMERICA _ Two thousand years after Jesus's birth, the
relationship between his native people, the Jews, and his
followers, the Christians, is complex. Some evangelical Christians
are Zionists, believing that the Temple in Jerusalem must be
rebuilt so that Jesus can come again. But some of these same people
think they must proselytize the Jews. A look at American Christian
attitudes toward Israel and its people. (White, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 30.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MILLENNIUM COVERAGE:
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, Jan. 3: MOVING WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MILLENNIUM _ C'mon, you're not going to usher in the new
millenium by popping the top on a Pink Champale and staring at Dick
Clark on the TV, are you? This once-in-a-lifetime event demands a
once-in-a-lifetime celebration, whether it's frolicking with a
million pagans in the California desert or sipping Dom Perignon in
your own private Times Square hotel, yours for the low rental price
of $3 million. We've spanned the globe, or at least plowed through
a mountain of brochures, to bring you the wackiest, weirdest, most
daring and most extravagant millennium parties. Call it Y2K _ 2 the
extreme. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    For release Friday, Jan. 1
 &HT;    We'll all be sick of millennium talk soon _ very soon.
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So do we start from scratch, or what? This isn't the first time
you've heard this, but hey: The end of the century is coming. It's
right around the corner, in fact, and by the time it arrives, it'll
seem like it's been here forever.
</P>
<P>
   How many times are we going to have to wade through the musings
and philosophications and roundups of the last thousand years? How
many times are we going to peruse a list of the accomplishments we
humans have achieved, the changes we've effected, the progress
we've made?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Way too many.
</P>
<P>
   How many millennium calendars did you get for Christmas? And how
many times are we going to be reminded that the 21st Century
doesn't start until the year 2001? Face it, we're going to get sick
and tired of all things 2000, and it's starting right here, right
now.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, try to forget the Y2K problem. Try to forget the
predictions of doom and disaster from techno-phobes and
techno-experts who say that our computer-dependent society will
come crashing to a halt. Forget what they say about ATM machines
not working after midnight on Dec. 31, 1999, or the nationwide
blackout that will result when power company machines read ``00''
at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, and clink a collective ``huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that? No way. We're going to be reminded again and
again that stockpiling canned goods and bottled water is not such a
bad idea; that getting our prescriptions filled for a couple of
years in advance might be the prudent thing to do. Sure, President
Clinton has assured us that Social Security is ready, that the
checks will keep on coming despite the naysayers who tell us the
government computers aren't going to be ready. (President Clinton
wouldn't lie, would he?)
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all ``World Is Ending'' signs, we're about to be
treated to page after page, newscast after newscast, Internet site
after Internet site, of ``The World That Was.'' There are plenty of
things to discuss. Just think of all the stuff we've invented since
1900.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   _ World wars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Computers.
</P>
<P>
   _Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rice Krispies for different colored holidays.
</P>
<P>
   _Postage stamps that peel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Madonna. Oh wait: She invented herself.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be unbearable, especially for those born in the
'70s or '80s, who by nature resent any sense of historical
perspective. What about those kids walking around with ``00'' on
their letter jackets? They're ready. They don't need to be
reminded.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates that 64,000 lucky folks have a shot
at spanning three centuries. How are they possibly going to cope?
It's hard enough to explain the vinyl recordings stored (for
nostalgia) in the basement, or to tell our children that life
wasn't always lived on-line. Are they going to believe that Grandma
didn't ever have a chance to design her own Web site? This year
they're going to hear that, and a millennium's worth of more.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be unbearable. And it's going to be enlightening.
So pay attention _ not that you have a choice. The media need a
hook, and there's never been a bigger one than the one that starts
today. The countdown. The big 365-episode show about everything.
The segments titled ``In Retrospect'' or ``The Last Thousand
Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepare yourself. It has begun.

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Israel's fate captures imagination of evangelical Christians
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The names on a map of modern Israel ring with biblical
significance in the ears of American Christians. The ancient cities
and towns, mountains and rivers are the settings of the great
events of the life of Jesus Christ and his Old Testament
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   For many conservative Christians, this identification has
translated into a strong support for Israel, even while they feel
obligated to try to convert Jews to Christianity. Sometimes
enthusiasm for Israel comes at the expense of their fellow
Christians of Palestinian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pro-Jewish, pro-Israel,'' said the Rev. Jerry
Falwell, pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va.,
and founder of Liberty University. ``I would say evangelicals are
the very best friends Israelis have in the whole world outside
their own family. Evangelicals are more committed to Israel than
some of the American Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   This commitment is rooted in years of Bible lessons, according
to the Rev. Timothy Weber, dean of Northern Baptist Seminary in
Lombard, Ill. ``I think at rock bottom, evangelicals care deeply
about Israel because they're steeped in the Bible,'' Weber said.
``So many evangelicals sat for years and years and years in Sunday
school rooms with Bible land maps on the wall and heard Bible story
after Bible story that, as a result, they have a proprietary
interest in Israel. In a way it belongs to them as much as to the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, among Israel's best-known supporters, cites the Old
Testament and world history as the basis for his support.
``Basically God promised to bless those who blessed the children of
Abraham and curse those who cursed Israel,'' he said. ``I think
history supports the fact that he has been true to his word. When
you go back to the pharaohs, the caesars, Adolf Hitler and the
Soviet Union, all those who dared to touch the apple of God's eye _
Israel _ have been punished by God. America has been blessed
because she has blessed Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Falwell and some evangelical and Pentecostal Christians feel
a special tie with Israel not only because of the past but because
of the future. They see the land as ``ground zero'' for Jesus'
triumphant return to earth, as Weber describes it. They believe
Bible prophecy dictates that certain political and religious events
must occur in Israel to prepare the way for Jesus to come again,
and see recent history as steps toward the fulfillment of this
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelical Christians in America have thought for centuries
that the nation of Israel was especially chosen by God and the
return of the Jews to Palestine and the establishment of the nation
of Israel in 1948 is viewed as a significant event,'' religious
broadcaster and former presidential candidate Pat Robertson said.
``Perhaps more significant is the Six-Day War, beginning June 5,
1967, which resulted in the Jewish people for the first time in
almost 2,500 years having control of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson says the reclamation of Jerusalem by the Jews signals
the culmination of prophecy by Jesus quoted in the gospel of Luke,
which says ``Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles, until
the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (Luke 21:24, New Revised
Standard Version of the bible).''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The year) 1967 began what I could call the generation of the
end of the Gentiles,'' Robertson said. ``That terminates in 2007.
That is an important 40 years in the history of the world as far as
I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson _ like most Christian leaders _ refuses to get into
specific predictions of when Jesus might reappear.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine of a second coming of Christ is not peculiar to
evangelicals. It is standard in both Catholic and Protestant
traditions. End-times events are so important to Christians that
the field of study has its own name _ eschatology. But within
Christianity, many different scenarios have developed for just how
the present world will end. Denominations have evolved from
people's acceptance of one view over another, and a whole
vocabulary has evolved to describe beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   What all the scenarios have in common is the pervasive belief
that Jesus' return will happen in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbolism is that his feet will stand on the Mount of
Olives,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tied to this belief is the political support for Israel to hang
on to its present boundaries and add more property. Historically,
say both Falwell and Robertson, the lands now called Gaza and the
West Bank were a part of the Promised Land God gave Abraham and his
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In insisting that Israel give land to Palestine to spur on the
peace process, ``the United States is on the wrong side,'' said
Robertson, who went on to warn that President Clinton could
``unwittingly begin a series of events that could lead to
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The final battle will be a fight over Jerusalem, Robertson said.
``It'll take place when the nations of the world come up against
Israel and try to take Jerusalem away ... The whole thought is that
when Jerusalem is under attack, Jesus will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The view that Israel is entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza
and complete control of Jerusalem puts evangelicals at odds with
some of their Christian brethren of Palestinian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the evangelicals believe they know what's going to
happen and they know the players in the end-time events, anything
that doesn't contribute to that scenario is outside the will of
God,'' Weber said. ``Palestinian Christians just don't factor in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent of Palestinians who are Christian frequently feel
neglected by their fellow believers, according to the Rev. Fahed
Abu-Akel, a Palestinian Christian and founder of Atlanta Ministry
with International students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians of Palestine and Israel feel forgotten by the
Christians of America,'' Abu-Akel said. ``Americans go there as
tourists and visit the place where Jesus was born in Bethlehem,
where he lived in Nazareth and was crucified in Jerusalem, and
focus on the past. They seldom get in touch with the living
Palestinian church today to see how they are doing, how they are
struggling and what are their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Abu-Akel said, ``American TV evangelists focus, most
of them, on Israel as a sign for the fulfillment of prophecy and
are completely insensitive to the issues of peace and justice and
the struggle of people for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians have found some support among mainline
Protestants. Because of the former British rule of Palestine, the
Anglican church is strong there. And Abu-Akel's denomination, the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is on record supporting a two-state
solution to conflict in the Middle East. ``That means an
independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christians who hold that view just don't take the Bible
seriously enough, Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably get more negative mail from Protestant and Catholic
Christians than I do from Arabs,'' he said. ``Most of them don't
believe in the inerrancy of the Bible. When you reject the
infallibility of scripture, then you can develop your own concepts
... Evangelicals, believing in the inerrancy of scripture, rather
choose literally to follow God's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainline Protestants, Robertson said, ``regard Israel as just
one more country,'' while he and other evangelicals ``think of the
Jews as the chosen people of God and the return of the Jews to
their land as a matter of great significance from a Biblical
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Christians and their supporters lack the
communication infrastructure of either the government of Israel
with its consulates and ministry of tourism, or the American
evangelical and Pentecostal Christians with their television
ministries, Abu-Akel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the conservative Christians who offer Israel
unflinching support are also the most likely to feel the need to
convert the Jews to Christianity. At the very least, they believe
that Israel will go through continued tribulation and eventually
recognize Jesus as the messiah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is very, very complicated,'' Weber said.
``Most evangelicals who are politically involved in the support of
Israel have learned they've got to tone down the evangelism. And
conversely, Jews who accept evangelical support have got to kind of
forget that they know the reason for all this evangelical interest
_ that Israel plays a role in end-time events which will lead to
the complete victory of Jesus Christ in the world.''

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    A pilgrimage of faith
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Jesus Christ walked on the stone streets of this
ancient city nearly 2000 years ago, and his followers still come
here to praise his name.
</P>
<P>
   They come, undaunted by today's reality.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the place where Protestants believe Christ was
crucified is now a grimy outdoor bus terminal. Or, that the
fortress-like Church of the Nativity sits in the heart of a crowded
Bethlehem, where the rattle of jackhammers and bus engines echoes
around ``Manger Square.''
</P>
<P>
   To the pilgrims, it is still the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The holy sites today are surrounded by the wonders and problems
of the 20th century _ office buildings and shopping malls, traffic
jams and smog.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still a few shepherds on the rocky hills of
Bethlehem. The rolling green landscape of the Galilee is still
relatively serene, a logical place for Christ to take refuge and
preach. And Jerusalem remains a spiritual center, the place legend
suggests all prayers return to before soaring to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   As this Christmas season edges us closer to the second
millennium since Jesus' birth, his believers today still find that
the ``Holy Land'' attests to his humanity. A visit to these stone
streets and rocky hillsides adds a gritty realism to The Bible
story, strengthening the faith the pilgrims bring with them.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked out of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem
recently, through the dust of construction in preparation for the
anticipated tourist influx in the year 2000, aluminum siding
salesman David Gage reflected on his trip to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the presence of the Lord with me two or three times,
it's almost like being lifted up,'' said Gage, 39, from Venice,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, pediatric nurse Rebecca Wiley of Houston wept as
she emerged from the austere rock crypt at Garden Tomb. The bare
rock floor is believed by Protestants to be the burial place of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the place where they laid Jesus and he's no longer
there,'' Wiley, 39, said. ``That's the whole reason for our
Christian belief. Everything you read and studied and learned _ you
look at it in a whole new light.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fourth century, Christians have flocked to this land.
They came from Europe on foot or jammed in the holds of ships,
diseased and unwashed. Royalty and members of the aristocracy made
the journey in caravans and during state visits.
</P>
<P>
   Denominations the world over, from the Greek Orthodox in the
fourth century to Mormons in the 20th, built their churches and
schools here, laying claim to at least a portion of this holy land.
</P>
<P>
   Their pilgrims followed and, through most of history visited a
land that was ruled not by Christians but by Muslims and, now,
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they come in airliners and tour buses, from Oregon and
Great Britain and Guatemala. This is the Jewish state, but about 60
percent of the 2million tourists to Israel each year are
Christians. The total might double in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents and tour guides agree that when terrorism and the
political turmoil of the modern Middle East scare off visitors to
Israel, Christian tourists are the last to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians are guided through their heritage by
Jewish-Israeli tour guides, licensed by the Israeli government.
They point out remnants of the pre-Christian past _ either in the
architecture or the landscape _ that bring Jesus' story alive and
let believers identify with his experiences.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Catholic priest and historian Jerome
Murphy-O'Connor notes that Bible readers might not understand why
at Gethsemane Christ anguished about his impending death. After
all, he had anticipated his demise long before. Visitors here,
though, will see that Christ had likely just walked through the
Kidron Valley, where he might have been frightened by stern tombs
that still stand today.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if one wonders about the story of the foot washing, which
Jesus did for his disciples in the manner of a servant, a few walks
around the dusty area will demonstrate why that was a custom.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Gallbreath, a civil engineer from San Antonio, Texas, said
he got a new insight looking at the woods of Galilee _ a modest
patch of trees on a rolling landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never thought of Jesus before as what he was, a
carpenter,'' Gallbreath, 54, said. ``(In the Galilee) I imagined
him having to cut down one of those trees and making it into
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, drawing inspiration from the holy sites may require
imagination or selective tourism. The exact location of many
biblical events is disputed and many shrines are labeled
``traditional sites,'' meaning people have decided through the
years to accept their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The various Christian denominations have chosen their separate
destinations. Protestants favor the airy, landscaped Garden Tomb
near the bus terminal in east Jerusalem. Catholics and Orthodox
Christians say Christ was crucified and buried at the hulking
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants often sing Christmas carols in the Shepherds Fields
outside of Bethlehem. Catholics kiss the stones of the big
churches, more ready to accept that the floors and walls touched by
Christ still radiate his holy essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the Catholics will be moved standing in the chapel,
the Protestants in the hillsides,'' Israeli tour guide Josef Gilboa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many evangelical Protestants carry a literal belief in the
Bible's Book of Revelation. They see the apocalypse as close and
believe steps are under way to clear the way for Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical tourism surged after Israel captured the West Bank
in the war of 1967. Many Christians see the uniting of the Holy
Land under the Jews as a necessary condition for Christ's return.
</P>
<P>
   Such belief has led to a stream of evangelical tourists who are
also hard-line believers that Israel should keep controversial
occupied Arab territory. Frequent visitors include the Revs. Jerry
Falwell and Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the birthplace of Christianity can include a sail on
the Sea of Galilee, where Christ is said to have walked on water.
Some pilgrims rent smocks and towels and stand knee-deep for a
rebaptism in a branch of the Jordan River, the same river _ though
in a different spot _ where Jesus was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the religious sites are getting a make-over for the
millions expected at the turn of the millennium. That can be
sensitive work in a land where tradition often trumps pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of pressure, the Israeli government recently
talked the three main orders in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre _
Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox _ into adding a
second door to the church for a much-needed emergency exit. After
that, Israeli officials want them to upgrade the dilapidated public
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   The three groups have feuded for centuries and jealously guard
their portions of the church. They fear that even the slightest
change will disrupt ownership rights.
</P>
<P>
   The church, first dedicated in 335 A.D., is often held up as a
metaphor for the region, where followers of many religions live
under the same roof but cannot agree on simple solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But even the religious rivalry and harsh politics can be
incorporated into the story of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rossing, a Jewish Israeli who used to be the government's
liaison with the Christian churches, said Christian visitors should
not be distracted by the discord.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was the story of Jesus all about?'' Rossing asked. ``It
was about him coming to the nitty-gritty. You want a paradise?
That's not what this is about.

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Christians a minority in land where Jesus dwelt
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   BETHLEHEM, WEST BANK_Nisreen Zieneh isn't distracted by the
German tourists roaming about the cavernous Church of the Nativity
as she kisses her fingers and touches the low door frame of the
1,400-year-old basilica.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the church, believed by many Christians to be the
site of Jesus Christ's birth, the stylish young Arab woman kneels
and repeats the ritual, gently kissing her fingers and touching the
stone floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where Jesus was born. I came because I want to pray to
him. He stands beside me,'' Zieneh said.
</P>
<P>
   This day, Zieneh has two requests: That Jesus support her in her
law school examinations and that he forgive her for not visiting
the church since her wedding there six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the native Christians. Amid the more powerful
majorities of Jews and Muslims, it is Arab Christians who apply in
the modern world the religion that began here nearly 2000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But their numbers are dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, political clout has determined the
subsistence of religion in the Middle East. Today, Christians are
without it, and in places like Israel, Egypt and Lebanon, they
suffer economic hardships and harassment because of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 6 million to 10 million Arab Christians
in the Middle East, about 5 percent of the population, according to
statistics at the Jerusalem-based Christian Information Center.
While exact figures are difficult to come by, experts agree the
population has slipped steadily over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem alone, the ratio of Christians to Muslims has
undergone a complete reversal in the past 50 years _ from a 70
percent majority of Christians at the end of World War II to a 30
percent minority today.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, some Arab Christian villages continue to thrive,
while others simply disappeared after the war that gave Israel its
independence in 1948. A tide of refugees, Christians and Muslims,
left Israel and later the West Bank and Gaza Strip when Israel
captured those territories in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel and the Palestinian-ruled territories _ home to
Jerusalem and Bethlehem _ Christians number fewer than 200,000
among a population of 5 million Jews and 2.5 million Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Christian schools are now mostly populated by Muslims, churches
are surrounded by mosques and synagogues. Christians emigrate
frequently to the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons for the emigration are still there, in that
Christians are always going to be second-class citizens either in a
Jewish state or in a Muslim-majority state. They are never going to
be a force,'' said the Rev. Jerome Murphy O'Connor, a scholar at
the French Dominican School of Bible and Archaeological Studies in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A new trend in Bethlehem highlights the Christian predicament.
Over the last year, neon crucifixes have cropped up on a few
rooftops in this crowded city of 140,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rossing, former Israeli government liaison to the
Christian community, called the crosses an attempt at ``Christian
power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are between the hammer and the anvil,'' he said, in the
middle of the colossal struggle between the Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing historically after the Jews and before the Muslims,
Christians are like the overlooked middle child amid the region's
three faiths. But some Christians feel their religion's message may
be especially apt today, a period of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord's Prayer says to 'forgive their trespasses as you
would want yours to be forgiven,''' said Bernard Sabella, an expert
on the Christian population and a Christian Palestinian whose
family lost its house to Israel in 1948. ``I find it difficult to
apply this .. . it's difficult, but it's the way out.''
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist. Relations between Jews, Muslims and
Christians remain strained.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial report, the Israeli government asserted
earlier this year that the new Palestinian National Authority
encourages Muslim persecution of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Mor, author of the report, says persecution is not overt.
But Muslims who desecrate churches or cemeteries are protected, he
said. Some who have converted from Islam to Christianity have been
harassed. He says Christians tell him privately that the
Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat, encourages their
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the politics of the region, Christians in Israel and
other Middle East countries have a support system that continues to
make them a major, if small, force in the region. They receive
millions of dollars in aid from Christians around the world, who
maintain about 700 churches, hospitals, schools and universities in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The local Christian community is a ragtag mix of ethnicity and
experience. There are Christian Palestinians who participated in
the anti-Israel Intifada uprising. Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs largely
stay out of the political fray. A Christian entrepreneur owns the
only Palestinian beer brewery, and another recently got the
franchise to produce Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   In Beit Jala, near Bethlehem, social worker Heyam Aldaqamqa at
the Evangelical Lutheran Church is hopeful that this land where
Jesus once walked will remain a spiritual center for Christians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Her church, founded more than 100 years ago, is heavily
supported by churches in Germany and has a congregation of about
500.
</P>
<P>
   Its modern wing has a boarding school for children from broken
homes _ Christian and Muslim. Aldaqamqa said the children share
their holidays and hardships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one people,'' she said. ``We are Palestinians and we
have the same destiny.

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    One man, 2 millennia, 2 billion followers worldwide
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christians believe that through the birth of Jesus of
Nazareth, God became human.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he was God incarnate, Jesus changed the world.
History is full of the best and the worst of human actions in his
name: horrible wars and wonderful acts of kindness; persecution and
sacrifice; bigotry and unselfish love. Some of the world's greatest
art, music and literature have been produced and some of its most
prominent institutions of medicine and learning have been
established to honor him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the calendar changed to mark his birth. The celebrations
that will mark the beginning of the year 2000 will actually
acknowledge an anniversary of that event. Groups ranging from small
survivalist sects to the Roman Catholic Church are gearing up for
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in a small Middle Eastern town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early Christians did not believe that the time and place
of the birth of Jesus had been left to chance,'' writes church
historian Justo L. Gonzalez of Decatur, author of ``The Story of
Christianity.'' ``On the contrary, they saw the hand of God
preparing the advent of Jesus in all events prior to the birth, and
in all the historical circumstances around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus was born at a crossroads, historically and geographically.
Palestine back then was at the intersection of trade routes joining
Egypt with Mesopotamia and Asia Minor with Arabia. As a result, it
was often invaded.
</P>
<P>
   In the late first century B.C., Palestine was a ``rustic,
despised corner'' of the Roman Empire, Gonzalez said. A few hundred
years before, people had lived in city-states that determined their
identity, including their religion. But with the Roman Empire came
interaction of cultures and a new mobility.
</P>
<P>
   The time of Jesus' birth ``was a time of confused identities,
similar to now,'' Gonzalez said. ``Christianity came into that
fray.''
</P>
<P>
   It arose as a renewal movement within Palestinian Judaism.
Jesus' earliest followers saw their role as fulfilling the promises
of God, Yahweh, to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The gospels of the Christian Bible say God performed miracles
through Jesus, beginning with his birth to a virgin and ending with
his resurrection after death. Perhaps one of the most amazing is
the growth of the faith that worships him. From 12 disciples,
according to Biblical accounts, it has increased to nearly 2
billion followers. One out of three people identifies with some
branch of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exact date of Jesus's birth is unknown and
generally estimated to have occurred between 3 and 6 B.C., the
coming of the year 2000 still has great symbolism for Christians,
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good time for reflection, for recollection, for
thanksgiving and for repentance,`` he said. ``Every once in a while
you need to go back to your origins.

 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    Few remain to speak `the Lord's language'
 &HT;    By Larry Kaplow
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They still speak the language of Jesus Christ, but
few are left in the land where Jesus once walked.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian Orthodox Christian community is so small that
observers question whether its traditions will continue to exist
here.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Damascus, Syria, communities of followers can be found
from Iraq to New Jersey. But what's left now in the land where
Jesus lived is a tight-knit, highly skilled community of between
1,500 to 3,000 in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Should this group disperse, the Holy Land would be a little less
Christian _ and a lot less colorful.
</P>
<P>
   They are known for their ancient language, which they chant in
church and that older Syrian Orthodox still speak in their homes.
They are famous for their bagpipe parades, which they began a few
decades ago just to get some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition is essential in a region where religion is the most
important factor in peoples' identity. It usually determines with
whom they socialize and to whom they can turn for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a deacon (in the church) but I am not religious. I have
to be involved in the church. It's a presence,'' said Syrian
Orthodox Elia Ahou, 39. ``You have to show that there are some
people in the community. We have to fight for our presence as
Syrians, and as Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahou, an assistant hotel manager, sees his community facing a
squeeze similar to other Christians, a small minority in a land
dominated by Muslims and Jews. But, unlike other churches, the
Syrian Orthodox own little church land and have few institutions to
call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they are fighting for Jerusalem, the Muslims and the
Jews, and we are left with nothing,'' he said. ``At least we have
the holy sites, which show that we are part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of Jerusalem's Syrian Orthodox community is its
St. Mark's Monastery, with a small, elegant church that is located
over what they believe was the house of the Virgin Mary and the
site of the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the daily Mass at the Church of St. Mark, surrounded since
the 1967 war by Jewish housing in Jerusalem's walled Old City, and
the clergy might outnumber the congregants. Their ceremony can seem
stern and intimidating. They chant in Aramaic and the bearded
clergy wear tight black hoods embroidered with small white crosses
for each of the 12 apostles.
</P>
<P>
   But afterward even a stranger might be able to sip tea in the
courtyard with the archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, several dozen show up at their cave-like chapel
behind the tomb of Christ in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. It
is one of several chapels within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Some Syrian Orthodox speak in Aramaic. Sounding a little like
Hebrew, this is a modern form of the classic language spoken
throughout the Middle East in Jesus' time. Like a few other
denominations, the Syrian Orthodox speak the classic Aramaic in
their church ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Orthodox consider their ethnicity as Aramaean and Syrian
and say their lineage goes back to Abraham. Many note that, as they
were born here, they are also Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian heyday in Jerusalem may have been during the Crusader
reign starting in 1099. What is now known as the Jewish Quarter of
the Old City was then called the Syrian Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1915, there may have been 1,000 families in Jerusalem
alone. Now, there are maybe 150 families here and possibly 500 in
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Sabella, a researcher who made the last comprehensive
count of Christians here, doubts even those figures. He put the
total number of Syrian Orthodox at about 1,500 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Emigration has taken its toll as the Syrian Orthodox escape the
troubled region. Like other Christians, they lost land and houses
to Israel in the 1948 and 1967 wars. The economy has been
perennially depressed. The last Syrian Orthodox school in Jerusalem
closed in 1967 and the last one in Bethlehem closed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially tempting for Syrian Orthodox to leave. Most have
dozens of family members in other countries. Each speaks several
languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough potential in this country,'' said Johnny
Goric, a 25-year-old Syrian Orthodox who speaks six languages and
is the executive chef at a foreign consulate.
</P>
<P>
   He has decided to stay and heads the Syrian Orthodox Club, which
provides activities for young members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian Orthodox hopes are pinned on the celebrations for the
millennium, when followers from around the world will be encouraged
to visit. They will try to raise money for a 40-unit housing
project and a program to spread Aramaic, or ``the Lord's language''
among their young people _ most of whom have given up the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot guarantee that what you feel in your heart you can
transfer to the next generation,'' said Jack Khazmo, an organizer
of the effort.

   Church of the Nativity
</P>
<P>
   Site of Jesus' birth
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem _ One must bend when entering the Church of the
Nativity. The large door was made into a small passage centuries
ago, in order to stop raiders from taking horses and carts inside.
Over the past 1,600 years, this church has been built, pillaged,
repaired, fortified, commercialized and, now, enveloped in urban
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army pulled out of the city in late 1995, leaving it
to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   A mosque sits across the plaza, as this city for decades has
beenmostly a Muslim city. At prayer times, the amplified call from
the minaret reverberates inside the cavernous church.
</P>
<P>
   Now, forklifts and bulldozers lay stones in Manger Square, the
plaza in front of the church that has long been used as a bus
parking lot. The renovations, planned for the tourist boom expected
in 2000, will keep the buses out.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sirk, a 56-year-old Methodist from Washington, D.C., says
he can imagine the presence of angels, who fanned out across the
surrounding hillsides to announce Christ's birth. ``I feel that my
faith has been strengthened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stone church sits over the cave in which Christ is said to
have been born. In that spot now, at the bottom of a small stone
staircase, is a dim cave-like room that houses a shrine. A hole in
the floor lets pilgrims touch the rock.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims file through. Some stop to pray, light candles or sing
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Some are bothered by the construction and the souvenir sellers
outside. But they still find meaning in the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Room
</P>
<P>
   Site of the Last Supper
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem _ For Oregon Pastor Howard Loyd and his congregants,
this plain room in Jerusalem's Old City is not at all plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are common, ordinary, everyday people, but once we are
filled with the Holy Spirit we can change the world,'' he tells the
group from the St. Helen's Assembly of God Church.
</P>
<P>
   They stand in a close circle in the center of what is called by
many, simply, ``The Upper Room.'' They begin praying loudly and
separately, with some raising their hands above their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a complex of 14th-century buildings constructed on
foundations more than 1,600 years old, the rectangular room has
vaulted ceilings, bare white walls and a plain stone floor. It
looks like it could be a large dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe it to mark the location of Christ's Last Supper.
It's considered a ``traditional site,'' meaning that it is accepted
more by custom than by evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is also believed by many to be the site where Christ sent the
Holy Spirit to descend upon his disciples during the Pentecost. The
event prompted the disciples to begin speaking in tongues, in the
language-- of all nations.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of Pentecostal Christians still, in their fervor, speak
in tongues in this room. The loud, bubbly, utterances echo off the
bare walls.
</P>
<P>
   Below this room is the traditional site of the Tomb of David,
the Jewish king. While Pentecostals exult above, Hasidic Jews, with
their side curls and hats, rock their heads in silent prayer facing
David's supposed resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Yardinit _ The Jordan River
</P>
<P>
   Site of Jesus' baptism
</P>
<P>
   Near the Jordan River _ There are lines most afternoons, people
wading their way through the railings and chains on the submerged
stone platform of this river.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 yards wide, this is near where the slow river
forms from the Sea of Galilee. Tall eucalyptus trees form a canopy
over the banks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a quiet spot. Groups from Canada, Great Britain,
and West Palm Beach, Fla., are being baptized today. The Canadians
shout ``Hallelujah,'' and the families of the British people
getting baptized sing gospel music with enthusiastic precision.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque says Christ was baptized near here. The original site,
near Jericho on the Jordanian border, was often too dangerous for
foreign pilgrims. So an Israeli kibbutz, a collective farm,
established this spot further north.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for $6 in the gift shop you can rent a white robe and a
towel, stand in line with your local pastor, and duck back in the
water of the Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baptism is an expression of your personal relationship
with God,'' Pastor Keith Thomas told his congregants from the First
Baptist Church of West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Wingate, of Wellington, Fla., came with her mother, husband
and two children. ``It's going to make my spiritual walk even
closer to the Lord,'' she said, dripping from the head-to-toe
immersion.
</P>
<P>
   Garden Tomb
</P>
<P>
   Site that many Protestants believe was the scene of the
crucifixion and burial of Christ
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ Behind the wall on this busy street, the rumble of
buses is somehow replaced by the chirping of birds that flutter
among the olive, cypress and mustard trees. It's a large garden,
hilly enough to divide into small areas of valleys and peaks.
</P>
<P>
   In one plateau, with large umbrellas and benches, members of an
American church group testify to their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a long-haired, drug-abusing hippie boy,'' one husky man
announced, ``I never thought I'd live to see a day like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The site of the crucifixion can be seen from a raised deck that
overlooks a gritty outdoor bus terminal. Somewhere amid what is now
blacktop, legend has it, the cross was planted.
</P>
<P>
   A guide explains that the Romans crucified people at busy
crossroads, so this spot was probably ugly in Christ's time, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the garden, a room is carved out of a rock
cliff and inside, an indentation carved in the floor is thought to
be the place Christ's body was buried. A sign on the door states,
``He is not here, for He is risen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Padilla, 63-year-old pastor at the First Hispanic Baptist
Church of Jonesboro, enters and kneels facing the stone slab. After
a couple minutes, he emerges, with a white handkerchief, wiping
tears from his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful experience to see the place where he was
laid, and that he didn't stay there, and that he is very much
alive,'' the Georgia man said. ``I thanked the Lord for the victory
he had over death and for the victory that is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Church of the Holy Sepulcher
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Catholic, Orthodox site of Jesus' crucifixion and
tomb
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem _ Packed amid the markets and mosques of Jerusalem's
walled Old City, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher creates a vast,
complex, universe of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The high, metal and wooden door is the only passage in or out.
After four years, the Israeli government has persuaded the
denominations that share the church to agree to an emergency door.
They guard their space jealously and to the letter of a
centuries-old treaty. For centuries, the key to the church has been
entrusted to an impartial, Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
   The church was first built by the Greek Orthodox in 335 A.D. It
was destroyed and rebuilt twice. The current structure has been
there about 800 years.
</P>

   ``There is not a stone or an arch or a corner that does not have
a legend or tradition,'' Israeli tour guide Josef Gilboa said.
</P>
<P>
   The dim, ornate church is a conglomeration of large sanctuaries
ringed by small chapels. Upon entering, there is a smooth stone
slab marking where, according to believers, Jesus' body was
prepared for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Up a steep staircase to the right is the elaborate, some say
gaudy, shrine covering the rock where the cross was planted. Jesus'
tomb is back downstairs, inside a small structure of deteriorating
rock now held in place by a cage of girders.
</P>
<P>
   There are many passages, chapels and levels. Many pilgrims do
not like the gaudy look of the chandeliers. Some resent the
infighting between the denominations inside. But the church
impresses, despite itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an area of significance, you can feel it in the
air,'' Alan Howard, a 20-year-old psychology student at Morehouse
College in Atlanta, said on a recent visit. He does not care about
the garish decoration. The atmosphere is more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about God and religion,'' he said. ``There's a religious
feeling in the air.

<P>
   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ A form of New Year's festivity which has ever
puzzled me is the ``watch party.'' What, I used to wonder, when we
assembled at the country church on New Year's Eve, were we watching
for? Some of us would rush outside and stand, shivering in the
unexpected South Alabama cold, peering at the sky. We never saw
anything to mark the end of the 12 months and usher in a new
beginning. But we felt duty-bound to watch. (Sibley, Atlanta

plants, it's not too late. And just what will be the hottest plants
on the market this spring? Thet new All-American All Stars, the
cream of the crop for new introductions, are out and just in time
for winter planting. We take a look at other new plants on sale
now. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) FOR SATURDAY

   MARTIN-STYLE _ ATLANTA _ On Sundays he's a Dirty Bird. During
the remainder of the week, however, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver
Tony Martin acts more like a peacock. Ask Martin, the 14-2 Falcons'
second-leading receiver this season, who the best-dressed player on
the team is and he'll respond, nonchalantly, ``Myself.'' (Walton,

   TRAVEL-MILLENNIUM _ How did you usher in 1999? Was Thursday
night another New Year's Eve of lukewarm pink Champale, slightly
scorched Jiffy Pop and Dick Clark on the tube? Hey, that's OK.
We're not passing judgment here. But no way is that going to cut it
come next New Year's Eve, when people worldwide will be partying
like it's, well, 2000. You need to start making your millennium
travel plans now. Already, the resorts at Walt Disney World in

   AMERICANBEACH _ AMERICAN BEACH, Fla. _ On a blustery December
day, the village of American Beach, Fla. is so deserted it seems
almost haunted. If there are ghosts about, they are friendly ones
for MaVynee Betsch, the colorful, exuberant, unofficial mayor of
what was once one of America's few all-black beach resorts. A new
book by Atlanta native Russ Rymer, ``American Beach: A Saga of
Race, Wealth and Memory,'' celebrates Betsch's family, their role
in founding American Beach and the unique part the town has played
in African-American history and culture. (Williams, Atlanta

<P>
   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ Years ago I used to think only country and
smalltown people gathered when one of their number was in a
hospital. I understood because we in Creola regarded a trip to the
hospital as major, on a par with a trip to Roche Mortuary, the
final stop in many lives. City people are usually different, I
think . There are so many hospitals and so many doctors and it's
not always a grave, death-dealing malady that sends you to either.
But I tell you the country custom of relatives gathering can't be
beat. The other day I had an appointment at Piedmont hospital for
some tests, nothing fearsome, no drastic surgery, nothing
threatening. But my family decided I needed backup. (Sibley,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) FOR SUNDAY

   DULL-TASTE _ With a name like Dull, she had to be good. And she
was. Henrietta Stanley Dull _ plain old Mrs. Dull to the
generations of Southerners who took her classes and clipped her
newspaper recipes _ wrote just one cookbook during a long life that
began before Sherman marched through Georgia and ended after King
marched on Washington. It was a homely-looking volume, with a
matronly silhouette of the author, drawn by her daughter, on the
cover. Yet ``Southern Cooking'' was for much of this century the
definitive treatise on the subject. Seventy years after its 1928
publication, you can still find it at bookstores in a new printing
by Cherokee Publishing Co., the South's own Fannie Farmer
continuing to admonish cooks not to pour gravy over their fried
chicken. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

   MILLENNIUM-FUTURE _ BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ There is a new trend
in this old city. For about a year, Christians have been putting
crosses, usually lit electrically, on their homes and shops. It is
largely seen as a sign of a population that is free, but is a
minority and feels insecure. Christians are a divided minority. In
Israel, Arab Christians benefit from a healthier economy and some
even serve in the Israeli army. In Palestinian areas, they face a
military occupation and a stagnant economy _ driving many to
emigrate to the United States. But, 2000 years after it was founded
here, it would be a mistake to predict Christianity's demise in the
Holy Land. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) 25.

religion in Aramaic, the language of Christ. (Kaplow, Cox News

<P>
   MILLENNIUM-AMERICA _ Two thousand years after Jesus's birth, the
relationship between his native people, the Jews, and his
followers, the Christians, is complex. Some evangelical Christians
are Zionists, believing that the Temple in Jerusalem must be
rebuilt so that Jesus can come again. But some of these same people
think they must proselytize the Jews. A look at American Christian
attitudes toward Israel and its people. (White, Atlanta

   RIVER-RESTORE _ HABERSHAM COUNTY, Ga. _ Severe erosion along the
Soque River was causing the loss of100 tons of soil a year on
Justin Savage's farm in Habersham County in North Georgia. The soil
was washing into the Soque, a tributary of the Chattahoochee River,
making the stream unfit for fish and destroying its natural beauty.
Now, an intensive project by EPA and environmental groups is
restoring the natural flow of the river and the native vegetation
to bring the stream back to life. Already, native brown trout have
returned to the stream. Seabrook. The project is being watched
closely by water experts around the Southeast as an example how a
degraded river can be restored. (Seabrook, Atlanta

something more distasteful in mind: monitoring the disposal of

first practical and profitable use of an electronic tongue invented
at the University of Texas are four UT graduate business students
who won't get their degrees until May. (Stanley, Austin

 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

ETHICISTS QUESTION TESTING OF HALLUCINOGEN ON HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychiatric researchers over the past several years have given
about 100 healthy individuals across the nation a powerful
hallucinogen, known to drug abusers as ``Special K,'' to study
psychosis, often without fully disclosing the nature of the drug or
the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The studies using ketamine have involved both mentally ill and
healthy subjects, placing them both at potential risk of psychotic
episodes, according to documents reviewed by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Using ketamine on healthy volunteers especially troubles some
medical ethicists, because there is no possibility that healthy
people as a class will achieve any benefit to offset the risk of
harm. The mentally ill, at least in theory, would be aided by any
knowledge gained about the biology of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ketamine experiments have been conducted at the
National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., or at
NIMH-funded facilities such as the medical schools of Yale and New
York University.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe review of their research and some of the consent forms
that participants are asked to sign indicates that subjects are
often not being told that the drug is being given to specifically
induce symptoms such as hallucinations or memory loss, or that it
is abused as a psychedelic drug.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets and on drug-subculture Internet sites, ketamine
is known for being able to create near-death experiences, feelings
of floating, and other hallucinations. It has recently been used as
a date-rape drug and at all-night parties known as ``raves,''
prompting several states to make illegal possession a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics see these experiments as an echo of 1950s and 1960s
research in which psychiatrists gave people LSD without fully
informing them of the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like shades of LSD research as far as I'm
concerned,'' said Carl Tishler, an Ohio State University
psychologist who has written on the ethics of ketamine experiments.
</P>
<P>
   LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, was made illegal across the
nation in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine is primarily used as an animal tranquilizer,
particularly for cats and nonhuman primates. It had once been
commonly used as a human anesthetic, until its hallucinogenic
properties were discovered. Ketamine, also known on the streets as
``KitKat'' or, simply, ``K,'' is a chemical cousin of PCP, or
``angel dust.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series on psychiatric research last month, the Globe
documented the harm done by the use of ketamine and other
``challenge'' agents to induce psychotic symptoms in people with
schizophrenia, as well as from other research approaches. An
additional review has revealed studies involving ketamine in more
than 100 healthy people since 1994 _ and the growing illicit use of
the drug. Such studies do not appear to have been done in
Massachusetts, although a bill has been filed by a private citizen
to strengthen research protections here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what they are doing to normal (people), God help us
with the cognitively impaired,'' said Adil Shamoo, a University of
Maryland bioethicist and editor of the journal Accountability in
Research.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the Globe's review, Shamoo said the New
York-based advocacy group he co-founded with Vera Hassner Sharav,
Citizens for Responsible Care in Psychiatry and Research, will
expand its call for a moratorium on challenge studies, to include
those involving healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the results of ketamine in healthy subjects
reported in the literature: Feelings of floating and of having a
transistor radio implanted in the ear; acute psychotic states;
``psychedelic effects''; ``tearfulness, a sad mood''; and feelings
of ``life and death at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   While the possibility of experiencing long-term harm from a
drug-induced psychosis is less likely among healthy people, there
is still the risk that some normal subjects will have flashbacks
months afterward, even if they apparently have no history of
substance abuse or mental illness that would make them vulnerable,
according to the Globe's review of LSD and ketamine research, and
ethicists familiar with the research.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a possibility that healthy subjects would refuse
to disclose elements of their medical history to researchers for
fear it would mean they would be unable to participate. (Some of
the ketamine studies paid $100 per subject.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something to worry about,'' said Jonathan Moreno,
director of the University of Virginia's Center for Biomedical
Ethics and a specialist on the history of LSD research.
</P>
<P>
   A top NIMH official and a Yale psychiatrist who has conducted
some of the studies said they do not believe that ketamine's illict
use needs to be spelled out in informed consent forms, since the
drug is still approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an
anesthetic. Above all, the careful use of ketamine in research may
help yield answers for some of the most devastating mental
illnesses, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a medicine which is given under close scrutiny for a
short-term basis. There is no repeat long-term exposure,'' said Dr.
Trey Sunderland, chairman of NIMH's institutional review board,
which has approved ketamine studies involving both healthy subjects
and those with schizophrenia. As a result, ketamine's street use is
``not an issue in these studies'' and not brought up with subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a direct comparison between the ketamine
research and the LSD research,'' Sunderland said, since ketamine is
FDA-approved and shorter acting. In addition, ``I know of no such
long-term effects with this kind of study,'' like flashbacks,
although he said it is not a matter of routine for researchers to
check up with subjects months later.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John H. Krystal, a Yale professor of psychiatry who has
conducted studies in both healthy people and people with mental
illness, said that his group began using ketamine ``based on a
reading of the old PCP literature. There might be symptoms or
cognitive deficits or emotional problems associated with
schizophrenia that might be modeled by ketamine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope . . . is that we might gain new insights into
treatment of these symptoms,'' Krystal said. Ketamine is thought to
provide a better model of schizophrenia than LSD or other
psychostimulants, because it appears to induce both hallucinations
and bizarre thoughts, or so-called positive symptoms, as well as
the social withdrawal and other negative symptoms of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Krystal said he is certain that during his early studies, first
published in 1994, subjects were not told of ketamine's use as a
street drug, but he did not have available the most recent consent
forms to verify what subjects are now told.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, ``People who participate are made aware that
it has effects on mood that may make some people want to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Childress, a member of the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission, which is calling for special research protections for
the mentally ill, said the illicit use of ketamine is ``exactly the
sort of thing that should be disclosed'' to study participants.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania,
said such disclosure is particularly important because ``There's
always the danger of hooking someone, getting someone down a road
they don't even want to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   One legislator in Florida, a state that has considered making
possession of ketamine a felony, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government is going to do studies on people, I think they
need to tell people what they're ingesting. It seems government
should have learned that lesson a long time ago,'' said Florida
state Representative Tracy Stafford, a Democrat who has filed a
bill to make ketamine a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethicists who reviewed an NIMH consent form obtained by the
Globe said they were most worried about its failure to fully
explain the effects of ketamine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact the purpose of the NIMH study was to produce a
psychotic state, or if they knew it would produce a psychotic
state, then they should tell their subjects that,'' said Leonard
Glantz, a medical ethicist and professor of health law at Boston
University School of Public Health. ``It's not a side effect or a
hazard. It's a desired outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   NIMH's Sunderland defended the form. ``It does mention you might
get an altered mood, hallucinations. . . The main side effects of
the medication are listed in black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that challenge studies are under ``intense
review'' at NIMH and elsewhere, because of the questions that have
been raised.
</P>
<P>
   In February, an advisory council to NIMH is set to take up
challenge studies. NIMH director Steven Hyman has publicly stated
that the research community has ``to get its house in order'' to
fend off restrictive regulation and legislation.

BETTER THINKING THROUGH PLAYING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To help my fifth-grade son study for a test, we head to the
playroom. While he executes soccer drills with an indoor ball, I
drill him on Colonial American history.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical about this as a way to help a child prepare for a
test? I was at first, too. But I've stuck with it for two reasons.
First, it's fun. For Eli, anything that involves a ball is fun by
definition, even if he has to study at the same time. For me, it's
fun because the struggle is gone; I don't have to cajole,
negotiate, or threaten to get him to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also testing out a theory.
</P>
<P>
   We've known for years that exercise is linked to fitness. With
children's obesity on the rise in the United States _ 14 percent of
6- to 11-year-olds were overweight in 1994, almost double the
number from the previous reporting period, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics _ parents have more reason
than ever to be concerned about diet and exercise. Indeed, a recent
study shows obesity can strike even our youngest children: 32
percent of preschoolers in a Florida Head Start program are obese,
according to Betsy Hernandez, a researcher at the University of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   We've also known for generations that young children are more
cooperative and attentive after they run around.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's reason to think exercise does more than burn off
calories or burn up energy. The latest brain research indicates
that the more children move the body, the more they stimulate the
brain. In other words, exercise has the potential to increase
learning.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area of research that parents and teachers aren't
sufficiently aware of,'' says educational psychologist, researcher,
and author Jane Healy of Vail, Colo. She says the brain and body
are not independent systems, but have connections that strengthen
each other. ``When you stimulate the cerebellum (through exercise),
you make your child smarter,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Healy sees physical movement as the gateway to cognitive
learning almost from birth. ``The infant who uses her hands to grab
something is learning not only how to get a toy into her mouth, but
also that persistence pays off. She's learning about space, time,
and cause and effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In the toddler and preschool years, a physical response to music
has been linked to reading and math skills. ``Music actually helps
organize the brain,'' says Healy, who is author of ``Endangered
Minds: Why Our Children Don't Think and What We Can Do About It''
and ``Failure to Connect'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of movement don't just accrue to young children.
Researcher Olga Jarrett of Georgia State University says
schoolchildren are better able to pay attention after they
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study of fourth graders in an urban school, she
observed children who had recess some days but not others.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days when they don't have recess, the teacher's giving a
lesson and you look around the room and you see children half out
of the seat, swinging their legs, playing with their hair,'' she
says. Some children are more antsy than others, but all children
fidgeted at some point, she says. This inability to focus is
dramatically reduced on days when children had the chance to get
outside and play.
</P>
<P>
   Does this actually translate to more learning?
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett can only prove that lack of exercise correlates to
increased fidgeting but she's persuaded enough about the impact on
learning to be preparing a report urging this school to have daily
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Healy says recess is critical. ``Hanging from the monkey bars
actually helps reading skills,'' she says, because it stimulates
the cerebellum, which is responsible for balance as well as
language and higher-level thinking skills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exercise also changes the chemical balance in the brain to make
it more efficient, according to research at the National Institutes
of Health by neurochemist Candice Pert. This may account for why
children are happier after exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any exercise will do, however. While gym and team
sports may give children cardiovascular activity that keeps them
fit and trim, it appears that only spontaneous exercise/play like
street hockey or double-dutch jump rope provides brain connections
that stimulate learning. ``In PE (physical education) and on teams,
it's adult-directed. Plus in PE, half the time can be spent waiting
your turn,'' says Jarrett. Her report will argue for both PE and
recess.
</P>
<P>
   Even solitary exercise has a lot going for it. Look at all Healy
says happens when a child is simply throwing a ball against a
pitch-back:
</P>
<P>
   --Since he's probably playing an imaginary game in his head,
there's self-monitoring going on, which builds the frontal lobes, a
big part of the attention system.
</P>
<P>
   --As he tries to calibrate his movements to change the way the
ball goes, he's helping to coordinate sensory systems in the back
of the brain, which are important for reading, writing, and math
skills.
</P>
<P>
   --If he messes up, there's an immediate consequence, so he's
learning about cause and effect, which involves the brain's
association areas.
</P>
<P>
   --If he's enjoying it, he's feeling successful and powerful,
which means chemicals in the brain are flowing in a positive way;
that will influence mood and make him feel better when he comes
inside to do homework.
</P>

   Hernandez, who observed preschoolers' exercise patterns in
central Florida, urges parents to look at how children play in day
care. ``When they go out on the playground, are they getting pushed
on the merry-go-round and the swing or are they encouraged to run
around?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   She says even at this young age, children can develop sedentary
habits that set a pattern for the rest of their lives, affecting
weight patterns and mental acuity.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez worries not only about the kind of exercise children
get but the amount of exercise they aren't getting because they
spend so much time in front of TV and computer screens.
Pediatrician Joseph Hagan Jr. of Burlington, Vt., shares that
concern and makes it a point to talk to children of all ages about
the importance of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them it should be fun, that they should run around with
their buddies and laugh,'' he says. ``But I also tell them that for
it to qualify as good exercise, they need to run enough so they
have to stop and catch their breath.''
</P>
<P>
   While the predominant reason Hagan recommends exercise is for
health and fitness, he doesn't doubt the benefits vigorous movement
has on mood _ he calls it ``emotional cleansing'' _ or that it
carries over to other activities like academics.
</P>
<P>
   William Dietz, director of the division of Nutrition and
Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, agrees exercise and learning are related, even though
data are relatively new. His conviction is at least partly
influenced by his son. ``He needed to be physically active before
he could sit down and learn,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty convinced, too. My son is having a terrific academic
year. I can't prove that exercising while studying is part of the
reason why, but who's to say it's not?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Researchers say latchkey children are among those who get the
least exercise. Even if they play a team sport, be sure to provide
time and opportunity for physical play that is child-directed.
Children who are home-schooled also may be at risk if parents don't
value exercise or allow for free play.
</P>
<P>
   --Unless it's unusually severe, cold weather is not a reason to
keep children from playing outside as long as they are dressed
properly. Children under 5 need one more layer of clothing than an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   --Movement therapy is critical for children who are physically
disabled, not only for medical reasons but also because it can
provide stimulation for the brain.
</P>
<P>
   -- Parents' exercise is a powerful model for children. How much
and what kind of exercise do you get?
</P>
<P>
   --Can you answer yes to these questions about your child's
exercise: Does she get at least an hour of exercise a day? Does she
have fun? In the course of a week, is at least some play
child-directed, not teacher- or coach-directed? Is at least some of
it what we would consider old-fashioned play: climbing a tree,
jumping rope, riding a bike, chasing, running, throwing?
</P>
<P>
   --Encourage your teen to continue to exercise beyond
participation in a team sport. Even at this age, there are still
mental and physical benefits to be had from exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Children with two or more siblings benefit from
having a place in the house where they can be alone, even if it's
just to experience peace and quiet. Some families build quiet time
into the family routine. (From ``365 ways to raise Great Kids'' by

would produce ``a comedy version of `Gilligan's Island.''' Flip
Wilson was comedy in its purest, most hilarious form, telling the

Youngman, 91, said, ``Take my wife _ please.'' Jack Lord, 77,

ADDRESSING ON THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy
has announced it will hold hearings next month to discuss the
creation of four new area codes for eastern Massachusetts. Once
again, it seems, Massachusetts regulators are facing a difficult
question: Should they geographically split the existing area codes,
the same way that the 617 and 508 area codes were split when the
781 and 978 codes were created, or should they adopt an overlay
plan, in which the new area codes will be laid over the existing
ones?
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of a geographical split is dialing. With a
split, Grandma can call across the street by dialing seven digits.
The big advantage of an overlay plan is that nobody has to change
area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Department of Public Utilities, under
considerable pressure from the Legislature, mandated that Eastern
Massachusetts take the geographical split. Officials said nobody
would have to change phone numbers. What they didn't realize at the
time was that in today's regional and national economy, a person's
area code is just as much a part of a phone number as the last
seven digits.
</P>
<P>
   The split was supposed to create enough new telephone numbers to
last for nearly a decade. The fact that we are running out now is
the result of a number of factors. First, a few towns, such as
Watertown and Belmont, were switched from 718 into 617 as the
result of political pressure. A second problem has to do with
allocation; the telephone companies aren't using the numbers as
efficiently as they could.
</P>
<P>
   But the fundamental reason behind the need for new area codes is
that people are using more telephone numbers than they have in the
past, a direct result of the expansion in cellular telephones,
pagers, Internet access, and large corporations with direct-inward
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the Internet has had to wrestle with
these same issue of expansion and renumbering. But unlike users of
the telephone system, Internet users have been largely isolated
from the dislocations that come with growth.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and technologists planning the future of the
telephone system could learn much from the Internet's example.
Every computer on the Internet has its own unique number, called an
Internet Protocol address. These numbers are roughly the same size
as 10-digit phone numbers; where there are 10 billion possible
10-digit phone numbers, there are 4 billion possible 32-bit IP
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Local dialing has always been a distinctive feature of the
telephone system. If you want to call the Massachusetts State House
from Boston, you dial 727-2121; to call from California, you need
to dial 1-617-727-2121. The IP protocol, on the other hand, has
never had local dialing. No matter whether your computer is opening
up a connection to a computer on the other side of the office or
the other side of the world, it uses a 32-bit IP address.
</P>
<P>
   Like the telephone system, the Internet's 4 billion IP addresses
are split up according to geography and by provider.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name system works like a big White Pages, but with an
important difference. Whereas you might look up the number of the
Massachusetts State House just once and then write down
617-727-2121 and use that number forever, your computer looks up
the IP address of ``www.state.ma.us'' practically every time you
turn on your computer and jumps to the state's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big reasons the Internet has been so successful is
backwards compatibility. With very rare exceptions, a computer that
was on the Internet in 1983 could still function perfectly well
today, nearly 16 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said of the telephone system. With the
splitting of area codes and changes in dialing rules, telephone
switches and paging systems require constant reprogramming.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the need to frequently reprogram systems would be
for Bell Atlantic to adopt 11-digit dialing on an optional basis.
Bell Atlantic could do this today, without the need for regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   What ``11-digit'' dialing means is that any person inside
Massachusetts could dial the number 1, the area code they are
calling, and a phone number and have the call connected.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, 11-digit dialing means that the telephone system
would adopt the Internet's attitude towards addresses. Every phone
number would work equally well anywhere in the system, without the
need for special dialing rules. This dialing plan would simplify
the programming of automatic dialers, and it would make life
considerably easier for people who travel between area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to handle the problem is to put a moratorium on
area-code splitting and phone-number changing. Now that we have
seen firsthand the disruption of changing several million phone
numbers, we should do everything possible to avoid having to do
that again. This means adopting an overlay plan is the way to do
that, something we should have done the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic agrees. ``We continue to favor an overlay. We
think that it is the least disruptive to customers,'' says John
Johnson, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic. ``As you continue splitting
and make the area codes smaller and smaller, they lose any
geographical identity. But the worst part is the requirement that
half the people give up their telephone numbers each time there is
a split. That is the thing that causes the most confusion and the
most cost for people.''

<P>
   Ten years ago, 352 students at Boston University signed up to
learn Russian; by last year, the number had nose-dived to 140. At
Williams College, the comparable enrollments have plummeted from
149 to 50 over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, at schools large and small, the picture's the same.
And, as the study of Spanish outdistances all contenders, Slavic
languages are not the only ones to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   French remains second in popularity, but every year
significantly fewer students are opting for it. German is taking an
even bigger hit, leading some colleges and universities to drop
staff and courses in a subject for which enrollment historically
has wavered very little.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons ranging from the end of the Cold War to the
globalization of the American economy, from an extraordinary wave
of Hispanic immigration to the advent of the Internet, the study of
foreign languages in this country is being transformed.
</P>
<P>
   The metamorphosis, which experts describe as historic, provides
far more than a window into the shifting linguistic interests of
high school graduates. Rather, it offers insights into ways in
which disparate events can conspire to alter a nation's behavior _
even as they reflect some of the fundamental changes that the
nation is undergoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not intentional, this was not purposeful, this is
just how things are falling,'' said Carol Saivetz, a specialist in
Russian foreign policy at Harvard University and executive director
of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
``But I think, nevertheless, that the changes are happening in
important, revealing ways . . . some good, some not good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The up side, many scholars agreed, is that a wider range of
languages is now being studied.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of Asia as a global economic and political player,
steadily growing numbers of American students are learning Chinese
and Korean. At the same time, media attention to some international
hot-spots _ combined with heightened interest by students of
specific ethnicities _ has led to higher enrollment for courses in
Arabic, some African dialects, Hindi and, especially, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The most-recent study of foreign-language enrollments, by the
New York-based Modern Language Association, showed a 13.5 percent
jump in students taking Spanish at US institutions of higher
education from 1990 to 1995. During the same period, the study of
Russian fell 44.6 percent, German dropped by 27.8 percent, and
French by 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   College officials around the country, in interviews with the
Globe, said those trends have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, and they're going to continue in the same
direction,'' said Harlan Sturm, acting chair of the French and
Italian departments at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
The school closed its Slavic department three years ago, like many
colleges in the 1990s, because of falling enrollments in Russian
and other Eastern European languages that scholars tie directly to
the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a natural consequence of what's happening in the
United States,'' said Jerry Sheehan, the associate dean at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``Spanish
is becoming the second language . . . and interest in the others is
declining as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars said it was the declines, rather than the ascents, that
troubled them.
</P>
<P>
   As academics, they worried that diminished attention to the
French and German languages is just the most obvious indicator of
waning interest in _ and in the understanding of _ European nations
that helped shape American history.
</P>
<P>
   And they voiced regret that fewer students will experience the
richness of reading books and otherwise drawing from historically
important Western cultures. ``They're growing in the new languages
they are taking, but the students are really missing something in
the areas left behind . . . and I think we all lose something
intangible, as a society, as a result,'' said Dorothy Kelly, chair
of the modern languages department at BU.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, those interviewed expressed concern that the new
pattern of language study underscores and reinforces two other
trends: a move in American academia away from liberal arts
education toward more-practical schooling where, for instance,
students prefer Chinese to French because they believe it will
improve their job prospects; and an acceleration of many Americans'
belief that it does not matter what languages they learn because
English is the only one they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest fear is that this is all part of an
Americanization that leads to isolationism of a kind,'' said
Michael Holquist, a professor of Slavic languages and literature at
Yale University. ``The underlying assumption is that we know the
world because we can read about it in the English language . . .
and that locks out an awful lot of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of the Internet, by all accounts, has fueled
this sentiment, since English is the computer world's basic
language. But Holquist and others said Americans in business,
government, and other fields _ while finding it easier to
communicate _ will be hurt by their lack of fluency in foreign
languages, because they will not be able to grasp the subtleties of
other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Though the idea may be counterintuitive, the rapid rise in
Spanish instruction actually reflects this notion of growing
American linguistic nationalism. Analysts say that is because many
students taking Spanish are doing so as a result of looking inward,
essentially training themselves to live in a country with a
burgeoning Hispanic population, rather than reaching out to learn
the languages of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   And this seems to be a fast-moving train, with no stops in sight
as Hispanics move toward becoming the largest minority group in the
country by 2008. Elementary and secondary schools are responding by
adding more Spanish classes each year, presumably creating a feeder
system weighted toward that language for colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Applied Linguistics, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization that tracks language studies from kindergarten through
12th grade, recently completed a report showing that the number of
public and private schools teaching Spanish has risen from 68
percent to 79 percent in the last decade. At the same time, schools
offering Japanese rose from none to 3 percent; French dropped from
41 percent to 27 percent; German from 10 percent to 5 percent; and
Latin from 12 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the reconfiguration of language studies reflects the
American perception of, and response to, a changing world in which
both Western and Eastern Europe play diminishing roles. But some of
the scholars interviewed _ pointing to Asia's economic crisis,
Europe's new confederation into a monetary union, and the
persistent instability in Russia _ warned that such views could
turn out to be shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy beyond just the self interest of people who
teach these languages to fewer and fewer students,'' said Saivetz,
the Russia expert at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is a major cataclysm and people will say the field
didn't warn us. But that next generation of scholars just isn't
going to be there,'' she added.

CAN ONE LOVE TWO MEN AT ONCE? 
 FOR USE FRI., JAN. 8, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: Is it possible to love two men at the same time? I
just heard from my ex-boyfriend (we broke-up over three years ago)
and I learned we still have feelings for each other. But it's awful
because I'm in another relationship (for one year) with a guy I
don't want to lose. How can I make a decision when I have feelings
for both? _ Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course it is possible to love two people at the same
time. We love our friends, our children, our parents. But you want
to know if you can be in a relationship with two men at the same
time. And given the fact you are single, the answer is a qualified
yes.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some problems with your question: Number one,
it sounds to me that your old boyfriend is a long-distance
relationship, which is poison, since it is primarily fantasy, and
number two, the current guy is compelling but not preemptive--not
enough to wipe the ex from your memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   How about taking a deep breath and evaluating Mr. Right
Now--your current relationship. If it seems to be working for you,
tell the ex-boyfriend that you would like to talk to him in a year
or so and see where you are then. Meanwhile, pour all energy into
your present relationship. If, after six months, it still lacks
luster, tell the current guy you need time off to see other people.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to love two people at the same time; it is
possible to date two people; but it is impossible to be mated to
more than one.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm 50 years old, married, with two children. For as
long as I can remember I've had a huge problem with my mother. She
is hard of hearing (and deals with it as one long pity party) and
is obsessed with her religion to the point that any conversation
leads quickly to a fire-and -brimstone sermon.
</P>
<P>
   She has been to a therapist. It didn't help because she refuses
to believe anything is wrong with her. I have been to a therapist
to help me deal with her. One of the strategies I've tried is to
set limits on the topics we may discuss, but in a short time she
disregards any limits and goes ahead regardless of who's feeling
she may hurt.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to talk, write, send smoke signals, any method to
communicate with her so she'll stop this preaching and try and be
more of a mother. Because she's deaf, talking to her only ends up
in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   What more can I do? _ Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Listen, kiddo, you are a 50-year-old 15-year-old. Part
of you still wants mom's attention and approval. You mom is smart
enough to get attention from you by being obnoxious. She has
probably been hard of hearing for a number of years but like most
of us, she hears what she wants to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to get her to change. Change your behavior. When she
talks about religion say ``If you don't stop, I will leave the room
for five minutes or hang up.'' Then don't back down. The issue is
to set limits and stick to them without being nasty, weepy, sullen
or sarcastic. Try being a bit more of a grown-up and see if she
doesn't follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 5-year-old granddaughter has been living with me
for most of her life. My son is her father; he never married the
girl's mother, who left her here with me in Seattle to go off to
school and then to Reno, Nevada. We have maintained a decent
relationship over the years, and I have made sure that my
granddaughter has contact with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's married and settled, and has another daughter, 8
months old, and tells me she wants to raise the two girls together.
I'm devastated, naturally, but I also want to do the best thing for
my granddaughter. What should I do? _ Seattle, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a tough situation _ and not uncommon. It sounds like
your custody was an informal rather than a legal arrangement. And
in all fairness it seems your pseudo-daughter-in-law has gotten her
act together. In the long run it's best that she and her child live
together.
</P>
<P>
   Start your granddaughter with extended visits with her mom. Have
a therapist involved (split the cost equally) and see what happens
between the 5-year-old and her mom. It will help your granddaughter
to feel that her mom wants her, even though it will bruise your
heart.
</P>
<P>
   You will have time of your own with the child. In the next 10
years or so, I would not be surprised if she lands on your doorstep
again. In any event, you will never really lose her.

 (Eds.: Newspapers that used the Boston Globe story DELIAS-CATALOGUE
(f) by Fred Kaplan, which moved Wednesday, Dec. 30, will wish to
use the following clarification.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe article about Delia's teen clothes catalogue
noted that the company's stock dropped last summer after it
acquired a retail store. The story neglected to report, however,
that the stock recovered nearly half of its earlier declines on
Christmas Eve, when Delia's announced it was setting up an online
shopping operation.

 No. 500 for Dec. 31  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Dec. 31, 1998. With only one more year until the big party,
the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures Guild advises getting those
vacation requests filed early or you'll be kissing the slot man to
celebrate the year 2000, and this is BONG Bull No. 500!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT THEY WON'T DO TO GET INTO BONG'S 500TH. &LR;  Gerard Farrell,
who defected from the trade to take up arms in Texas A&AMP;M's
publicity office, recalled these possibly factual tales from the
newsroom:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our night city editor was formatting the police blotter one
evening and called me over to his desk. He'd gotten a grand jury
wrap-up from a bureau reporter in a county with a large Asian
population and wondered about the ethnicity of an
as-yet-unapprehended suspected crack dealer, based on the name.
Seems the list included a certain `Fnu Mnu Lnu,' which I pointed
out was actually cop shorthand for `First Name Unknown, Middle Name
Unknown, Last Name Unknown.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also from the cutting room floor, this story never made it into
Farrell's clip file:
</P>
<P>
   ``A police patrol sergeant offering the final, official, word on
the circumstances of a motor-vehicle accident: 'Vehicle No. 1 was
traveling westbound and vehicle No. 2, traveling northbound, ran
the red light and T-boned her ass.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANOTHER TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE. &LR;  Emery Jeffreys, web developer
for Modis Government Systems Division and ex of the Daytona Beach
News- Journal, ex Unipresser and other exes, advises all to forget
the dramas of the freight elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do any of the young newsies remember chases? How about
rattling the chases that were not stored on turtles to see where
the floor man had his pint?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPECIAL THANKS TO MIKE LINKSVAYER. &LR;  Getting to the 500th BONG
Bull would have been an even mightier chore but for the devotion of
our list wallah Mike Linksvayer of San Francisco, keeper of the
keys to the bewildering listserv software. Mike gets the message
out, sorts the ins and outs and catches all the bounces, and we're
grateful for his expertise and faithful service.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IT'S ALL HOW YOU SAY IT. &LR;  Carissa Vanitzian discovers an
anagram, one of those curiosities that come of rearranging the
letters in a word, name or phrase to form new ones. Computer
software makes the game easy, and the Internet brings the world's
anagramists together. Consider this passage, its discoverer
uncredited:
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of the Bard's best-thought-of tragedies, our insistent
hero, Hamlet, queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the dowdiest 11th-grade English teacher would give extra
credit for bringing the news that the anagram is almost as good as
Shakespeare's original:
</P>
<P>
   ``To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
...''
</P>
<P>
   Or startle a simpler teacher, say algebra, with this anagram:
``Eleven plus two'' equals ``twelve plus one.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE BAD WRITING COMES FROM. &LR;  The collection in BONG Bull No.
498 wasn't by high school students, but by Washington Post readers
for a Style section contest a year or so ago. Once again, Internet
traffic peels off attributions of all things in record time. Thanks
for the tip to Thom Newlin, who adds, ``Keep up the good work,
season's greetings, and Happy New Year Y2K-1!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THREATS DON'T FAZE US, MOSTLY. &LR;  Bill Tammeus, the Kansas City
(Mo.) Star's other genius, dropped a bag of Scrabble tiles and this
fell out:
</P>
<P>
   ``Be alerted: If my alma mater, the Missouri School of
Journalism, isn't mentioned in the historic 500th edition of BONG
Bull, I will not read it _ even to see if Missouri is mentioned.
And, though I cannot speak for all Mizzou folk, I bet I will not be
alone in my one-week boycott. Wishing you an excellent new year
full of wise choices, I remain, Your obedient servant, Bill
Tammeus, MU BJ '67.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE WORLD OF THE MOVIES. &LR;  From the United Kingdom, a
computerist named Emma notes a number of truths we learn from
watching movies. Others are invited to add to her list:
</P>
<P>
   All police investigations require at least one trip to a strip
club. All U.S. phone numbers begin with 555. All beds have special
L-shaped cover sheets that reach up to the armpit on a woman but
only to waist of the man beside her.
</P>
<P>
   And, once applied, lipstick will never rub off even while scuba
diving. The ventilation system of any building is the perfect
hiding place. You won't survive a battle if you show someone a
picture of your sweetheart back home. The Eiffel Tower can be seen
from any window in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And, a man will show no pain while taking a ferocious beating
but will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds. When staying
in a haunted house, women investigate every strange noise in their
most revealing underwear. Cars that crash almost always burst into
flames.
</P>
<P>
   And, a detective can solve a case only after being suspended
from duty. When alone, all foreigners speak English to each other,
but with an accent. You can always find a chainsaw when you need
one. Travel between any two points in New York City requires
passing the Statue of Liberty, Lincoln Center, Washington Square
Park and the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHERS. &LR;  All reporters wear dirty trenchcoats, run impossible
bar tabs, have strings of shoeshine boys as snitches, dodge
multiple ex-spouses and at least two current lovers, jump the staff
car waiting list by sweet-talking the keys clerk, keep bourbon in
the lower drawer, live on cold coffee and malted milk balls, and
have drop-kicked at least four computer terminals into the alley.
How Hollywood gets away with promoting this fiction is outrageous.
In real life it's two computers, max.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COMIX SECTION. &LR;  The Further Adventures of Herman ``Speed''
Graphic, Ace Photographer for the Chagrin Falls Commercial
Scimitar, and his Faithful Companion, Typo the Wonder Pig.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL ONE: &LR;  As the evening approaches, the nattily dressed Deft
Duo gather their party toys and prepare for the New Year's
celebration as Typo vows, ``I'm telling you, Boss! At $300 a plate,
nobody from the paper is getting into this party but us!''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing pizza sauce off his trenchcoat, a deathbed gift from an
ancient mystic wire service executive editor on a fog-shrouded
eastern island, Speed frets, ``Hyperba Lee is an evilly resourceful
person, Typo! She didn't get to be Features Editor by following all
the rules!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL TWO: &LR;  In the luxurious Backwater Room of the Chagrin
Hilton, Typo marvels, ``I was right, Boss! There's nobody here but
bankers, lawyers and large advertisers, and it's easier to get to
the food from the window side of the buffet table if you don't mind
wading in the fountain! Hey, this is our fourth trip through, and
it ain't even midnight yet!''
</P>
<P>
   Munching a skewerful of meatballs, Speed wonders, ``... Large
advertisers, Typo!?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL THREE: &LR;  Typo spots danger and blurts, ``Features Editor
at 11 o'clock high, Boss! Roll right and get behind the busboy's
cart...!''
</P>
<P>
   Speed despairs, ``She's got the angle on me, and she's using
in-lines! I'm a goner, Typo...!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FOUR: &LR;  The panel is obscured by pain stars, huge wet
drops, romantic hearts and huge ugly popout letters reading
``sa-MOOCH!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PANEL FIVE: &LR;  In the ruins of the butter sculpture of Woody
Hayes and 24 pounds of Buffalo wings, Speed admits, ``We could have
predicted she would talk the rent-to-own furniture guys into
letting her sit at their table, Typo!''
</P>
<P>
   Typo counters, ``Sorry, Boss! But while she's bragging to
everyone at the diversity seminar that she got your first kiss of
'99, we'll be watching to see whose couches and chairs she plays up
in her interior decorating stories!''

IT'S TENORS VS. TOUGHS IN MONTREAL METRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Music, it is said, has charms to soothe the savage
breast. But does it pack sufficent wallop to clear a subway station
of loutish loiterers?
</P>
<P>
   Opera has become the latest weapon employed by Montreal's Metro
system to chase off youthful toughs who loaf about downtown
stations, demanding spare change from passersby, chain-puffing
cigarettes under ``No Smoking'' signs, cussing, spitting and
generally making life unpleasant for real subway riders.
</P>
<P>
   Cops can't seem to frighten them away. But Metro officials
reckon diva Maria Callas or tenor Luciano Pavarotti might just do
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is already claiming success, saying there are fewer
young idlers strutting about the city's busiest subway station and
regular riders are being hassled less since the opera started
booming. Other Canadian cities have used classical music to repel
bad characters from public spots, but Montreal is the first to
resort to hard-core opera.
</P>
<P>
   In a debut underground performance, strains of ``Tristan und
Isolde,'' ``Don Carlos'' and other epic operas are blaring from
loudspeakers in the busy entranceway of Berri-UQAM station, a
favorite hang-out for young vagrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids don't like opera, and that's why we're using it,''
Serge Savard, spokesman for the Montreal Urban Transit Commission,
told reporters. ``If they didn't like country music, we would play
country music.''
</P>
<P>
   Opera lovers, however, are incensed by what they see as yet
another insult to an under-appreciated art form. ``We think it is a
blow to opera, using it as a negative thing and something
offensive,'' John Trivisonno, spokesman for L'Opera de Montreal,
told Canada's National Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The test project is a new twist on an old tactic of
psychological warfare. During the Korean conflict, for example,
American psy-ops soldiers bombarded Communist troops with ``God
Bless America'' and such homey musical tortures as ``Don't Sit
Under the Apple Tree.'' North Koreans fired back with high-decibel
odes extolling the virtues of collective farming.
</P>
<P>
   The music is still blasting both ways along the Korean DMZ. But
Montreal claims it is driving the pimply foe into retreat, if not
total surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer young people loitering,'' said Savard. ``We
have fewer complaints from our customers about being harassed by
people blocking their way or begging for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is famous for its safe, clean subway system. But recent
years have seen an invasion of some stations by loud gangs dressed
in scruffy denim and leather festooned with chains. The
self-described punks are perhaps less dangerous than they look.
Still, they can be aggressive and highly obnoxious, flipping
smoldering butts at ordinary citizens, cursing or even spitting on
those who refuse their entreaties for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the ambience we want,'' Savard said.
</P>
<P>
   So the Metro is turning to the big guns: Wagner's ``Ride of the
Valkyries,'' Rossini's ``Barber of Seville,'' even Puccini's
``Madama Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ringing arias and piercing high notes may be driving off the
riffraff. But the assault has also wounded the sensibilities of
opera fans. Many are outraged that their beloved music has become a
sort of auditory cudgel, in a league with the ear-splitting siren
blasts that the Japanese use to rid airport runways of noisome
seabirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows true contempt for the art form.'' said L'Opera's
Trivisonno, complaining that the project ``is a blow to punks as
well, because it says they aren't able to appreciate anything that
is foreign to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In resorting to opera, Montreal is following in the classical
footsteps of other Canadian cities, which have discovered that
symphonic sound is the most powerful of persuaders when it comes to
clearing off youthful miscreants.
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest city, Toronto, as well as Alberta's
Edmonton and New Brunswick's Moncton are among the centers piping
classical music into public places for the purpose of scattering
gangs, although the same strains have a side benefit of soothing
everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto uses Bach, Beethoven and Brahms to shoo punkers from
crime-plagued subway stations. In Edmonton, oboe concertos have
chased drug dealers from downtown parks. Moncton, meanwhile, plays
piano sonatas along a stretch of the main street as a way of
scaring off packs of teenaged troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has had a real, measurable effect -- there's been a
reduction in crime, a reduction in problems, and kids don't hang
around anymore,'' said Mike Walker, chief security officer for the
Toronto Transit Commission.
</P>
<P>
   However, he jokingly told a Toronto newspaper, by cranking up
the opera, Montreal may be playing a bit too rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use classical here. We don't use opera,'' he said. ``We
wouldn't do that to anyone.''

Kennstedt; tenor Richard Cassilly, soprano Leonie Rysanek, pianist

   Corbett Monica, who died at 68, once predicted that television
would produce ``a comedy version of `Gilligan's Island.''' Flip
Wilson was comedy in its purest, most hilarious form, telling the
truth when he said ``What you see is what you get.'' Henny
Youngman, 91, said, ``Take my wife _ please.'' Jack Lord, 77,
barked, ``Book 'em, Danno!'' E.G. Marshall, 84, exuded more dignity
than real-life lawyers and judges. Esther Rolle, Phil Hartman, and
Peter Lind Hayes left the gift of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Leeds and Norman Fell did not have famous names but anyone
with a television set knew their faces. They died, as did a whole
supporting cast: Dick O'Neill of ``Cagney and Lacey,'' Mary Frann
of ``Newhart,'' Grandpa Jones of ``Hee Haw,'' Sylvia Field Truex,
Mrs. Wilson on ``Dennis the Menace;'' Richard Paul, the mayor in
``Murder, She Wrote,'' Michelle Thomas of ``The Cosby Show,''
Virginia Graham, a talk-show hostess, and Douglas Fowly, who was
Doc Holliday on ``Wyatt Earp.''

   Children's television lost its pioneers: Buffalo Bob Smith,
puppeteer Shari Lewis, Jeffrey Moss of ``Sesame Street,'' and Bob
Trow of ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.'' Joan Hickson, 92, was Miss
Marple on the BBC; Michael Zaslow starred on ``One Life to Live;''
and Clayton (Peg Leg) Bates, 91, hoofed on ``The Ed Sullivan

   In Massachusetts, Frank Sargent brought dignity, humor and
courage to the governor's office. David Nelson, a federal judge,
and Kirk O'Donnell, a Washington lawyer, enriched public life and
their early deaths saddened many. Johnny Powers was among many who
enlivened Massachusetts politics: Tony Scibelli, Fran Doris, Jim
O'Brien, Julian Zuk, John Slater, and Ed O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Some who died symbolized their institutions: John Prescott of
the New England Aquarium; Bill Ohrenberger of the Boston school

School Committee; Arthur Curley of the Boston Public Library;
Caroline Graboys of Brockton's Fuller Museum of Art; WBZ's Carl

``Boston Billy'' Melchin. And St. Elizabeth's Hospital will not

   Barry Goldwater, Bella Abzug, and George Wallace could, at one
time or another, push every emotional button on the political
spectrum, but they all shared a poll-proof passion for their
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy in New Hampshire, Alan Shepard dreamed of the stars,
and as a man, he slipped the surly bonds of earth as an astronaut.
Florence Griffith Joyner, who streaked across the finish line with
three gold medals, died at 38. Dr. Benjamin Spock died at 94 after
a lifetime of political activism mixed with practical advice to
millions of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Udall served in Congress with distinction and a wit badly
needed today.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra was Ol' Blue Eyes, the Chairman of the Board, and
a half-dozen other nicknames suggesting his mastery of popular song
as he squeezed and massaged each tune and lyric to hypnotic effect.
He died at 82, but in his prime, he was not the most famous
Italian-American voice in America.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Roventini, 88, became the world's most famous bellboy
when he advertised a cigarette by hollering ``Call for Philip
Morris!''

   Michael Kennedy died in a skiing accident on New Year's Eve a
year ago. A few days later, Sonny Bono died in a similar accident.
Other voices stilled include: Lewis Powell, the retired Supreme
Court Justice; Senators Jennings Randolph, Floyd Haskell, Albert
Gore Sr., Abe Ribicoff, and Terry Sanford; Representatives Steve
Schiff, Dante Fascell, George Danielson, Charles Diggs, Chalmers
Wylie; political managers Matt Reese and Jack T. Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Sutton and Dave Powers suffused the JFK era with laughter;
Carl Gorman was a hero as a Navajo ``code talker;'' Telford Taylor
prosecuted Nazi war crimes; Lu Conein was a CIA operative; Jim
McDougal was a Whitewater investor with Bill Clinton; Clark
Clifford was an adviser to presidents; Bill McCarthy ran the
Teamsters; Governor Lawton Chiles enlivened the politics of
Florida, as Paul O'Dwyer did in New York and Lenore Romney in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Big-city mayors took their cities through tough times: Tom
Bradley of Los Angeles, Coleman Young of Detroit, Annette Strauss
of Dallas, and the Sicilian dynamo, Joe Alioto of San Francisco. A.
Leon Higginbotham Jr. fought for a vision of civil rights far
different from that espoused by Eldridge Cleaver or Kwame Ture
(Stokely Carmichael); Bebe Rebozo and Maurice Stans were buddies of
Richard Nixon; Thayer Illsey and Toni House labored to provide

   Across the world, dictators died: Cambodia's Pol Pot, Bulgaria's
Todor Zhivkov, and Nigeria's Sani Abacha. Heroes, too: Moshood
Abiola, Nigeria's most famous political prisoner; former French
foreign minister Maurice Schumann, a voice of the French Resistance
in World War II; Elias Freij, mayor of Bethlehem for 25 years; and
Constantine Caramanlis, who restored democracy to Greece in 1974.

gum in 1928; Otto Wichterle developed the soft contact lens;
Ferdinand Porsche Jr. built a sports car; Sherwood (Shakey) Johnson
began a pizza chain; Eddie Shipstad co-founded the Ice Follies;
Hazel Bishop left her mark in lipstick; Jheri Redding lathered up
shampoo; J. Gordon Lippincott helped craft the Campbell's soup
label and other corporate logos; Albert Lipper helped start Weight
Watchers; Harold Robeson invented an exploding dye pack to foil
bank robbers; and Robert Townsend, the former Avis rent-a-car
honcho, wrote the first and funniest of the inside-business books,
``Up the Organization.''

   The phrase ``singing cowboy'' evoked a paragon as pugnacious as
he was melodious. Rex Allen was such a role model, as was
baseball-and-broadcasting tycoon Gene Autry; and Roy Rogers, ``King
of the Cowboys.'' Blonde leading ladies died: Alice Faye, Irene
Hervey, and Penny Edwards; and blond leading men: Richard Denning,
Gene Raymond, and Lloyd Bridges, a durable presence wet or dry.
</P>
<P>
   Film also mourned scene-stealing character actors: the
eloquently brooding J. T. Walsh, Gene Evans, hero of Sam Fuller war
movies; the forever pixieish Roddy McDowall; Maureen O'Sullivan who
played other roles than Tarzan's Jane; Leonid Kinskey, the
bartender in ``Casablanca;'' and Mae Questel, the voice of Olive
Oyl and Betty Boop.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd Hatfield immortalized Dorian Gray on celluloid; John Derek
was an actor who tutored his beautiful wives; Robert Young
transferred movie stardom to long-running television fame. Behind
the cameras, Akira Kurosawa created Japanese classics; Alan Pakula
and Gene Fowler Jr. were directors; Freddie Young and Charles Lang
were cinemaphotographers; Lew Grade was a British mogul; Anatole
Dauman fathered the French New Wave; and Jean Marais was a 1950s
matinee idol in France.

   In music, Tammy Wynette stood by her man and Carl Perkins sang
of his ``Blue Suede Shoes.'' Others who sounded their final note in
1998 include: saxophonist Benny Waters; pianist Floyd Cramer;
guitarists George Van Eps, and Attilla Zoller; singers Betty
Carter, Johnny Adams, O'Landa Draper, and Blue Lu Barker; trumpeter
Frank Motley; pianist Dorothy Donegan, bass player Bob Haggart,
Nashville producer Owen Bradley; blues drummer S. P. Leary; and
Junior Wells, master of the blues harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Rabbitt, a country singer-songwriter, left, as did Bob
Merrill, who wrote the scores for ``Funny Girl'' and ``Carnival.''
Wendy O. Williams was the lead Plasmatic; Chico Ryan sang with Sha
Na Na; Carl Wilson was an original Beach Boy; Todd Duncan, was the
original Porgy in ``Porgy and Bess;'' and Rob Pilatus, was half of
the less-than-original Milli Vanilli.

   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, what Steve Kahn knew about teenage
girls' fashions, you could fit in a pot of lip gloss. Now, at age
33, Kahn is king of its domain, the president of Delia's, the
world's largest and one of its trendiest teenage fashion catalog
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have teenage daughters, you may never have heard of
Delia's. If you do, you know it not just as a company or another
catalog cluttering the mailbox, but rather as a cultural
phenomenon, an icon of what demographers are starting to call
Generation Y.
</P>
<P>
   There are 31 million teenagers in the United States _ the baby
boomers' children, just now coming of age. And last year they spent
$122 billion, one-third of it on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in seven of these teenagers _ 13 percent _ have their
own credit cards, and another 13 percent have credit cards in their
parents' names.
</P>
<P>
   Even among those 17 and younger, nearly one in five _ 18 percent
_ have access to a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Michael Wood, director of Teenage Research
Unlimited, a survey firm in Northbrook, Ill., ``There's more
attention to the teen market than ever before. Everybody's waking
up and taking notice that this group is growing for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   More teenagers have part-time jobs now than ever before. They
belong to the first computer-literate generation. They feel
empowered and entitled. More have parents who are affluent than do
not. And so, Wood noted, ``Everyone is trying to figure out a way
to harness their buying potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kahn found the way. What started as an experiment, run out
of his Greenwich Village apartment, is now a $170 million business
operating from 48,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan and
a warehouse in Pennsylvania 10 times as large.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who shuffles around his massive headquarters in jeans,
sneakers, and a crew shirt, happened onto this market almost by
accident. An analyst on Wall Street, he was at first attracted to
the direct-mail industry in general. ``The dynamics and growth are
dramatic if you find a customer base that isn't being served,'' he
said. ``You can grow the business very, very quickly if you find
something that works.''
</P>
<P>
   So he and Chris Edgar, a former roommate from Yale, decided to
take a shot. Their original idea was to create a clothes catalog
for college women and to recruit sorority sisters to sell the goods
on campus, like Avon women.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, though,'' Kahn said, ``was we placed ads in the
back of magazines like Seventeen and Sassy, and we started getting
all these orders from high school kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The trickle soon grew to a flood. ``Kids tend to congregate,''
Kahn noted. ``If something's cool, they'll take it to school in
their backpacks. Next thing you know, you have the whole school
calling you for the catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dean, director of W. A. Dean Associates, a
catalog-consulting firm in San Francisco, admitted that Delia's
success surprised everyone in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cataloguers focused on 25- or 30-year-olds, on up,'' Dean
said. ``Nobody was focusing on 18 to 25, much less teenagers. We
all missed two facts. First, these kids have money and credit
cards. Second, they love to get mail _ and they weren't getting
any. They weren't getting any other catalogs, so when Delia's came
along and found them, they gave it their undivided attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key to Kahn's success was that he made Delia's look like
a magazine. ``Magazines are a big part of teenagers' lives,
especially teenage girls,'' Wood said. ``They look to magazines for
advice on beauty and fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kahn puts it, ``We see Delia's as something like MTV or
Seventeen. We're an arbiter of style and taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Delia's has attracted a fair degree of brand
loyalty. Other teen catalogs followed in its wake _ Zoe, Just
Nicky, Wet Seal, Moxie Girl _ but Delia's is the one showing
staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were first on the block,'' Wood said, ``and they built
some equity in their name early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kahn nor Edgar knew much at first about what teenagers
wanted. When the business started taking off, they hired 18- and
19-year-old women, mainly students at nearby New York University,
to staff the telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of them started criticizing some of our product,''
Kahn said, ``saying, `Kids don't want to buy this, they want to buy
that.' So we hired them as our first buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 workers staff the phones these days, 100 of them
working at once in the peak late-afternoon hours. They take phone
orders in a gigantic room at the Delia's headquarters, on Hudson
Street in Manhattan's West Village. Most of them are 18- and
19-year-old women who know the merchandise and who know how to talk
to 14- and 15-year-old customers without condescension.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 or so employees work on the corporate side, with the
top executives ranging in age from 26 to 36.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Kahn has been diversifying. He has started or bought six
other teen catalog companies, including TSI Soccer (sporting
goods), Content (home furnishings), and Droog (clothes for teenage
boys).
</P>
<P>
   More drastically, he bought a chain of teen retail stores called
Screem, and has opened a couple of Delia's outlets, which he hopes
to expand to full-blown ``lifestyle stores'' that will sell the
entire Delia's family of products.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street did not look favorably on these acquisitions. After
Kahn took over Screem last summer, Delia's stock plunged 30
percent. The stock recovered nearly half of its declines after the
company announced on Christmas Eve that it was setting up an online
shopping operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some uneasiness of what's on the company's plate,''
Kahn acknowledged. ``We have a core group of holders. When they
hear you're moving from one channel to another, they get nervous
about the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean said the big question is whether Delia's can survive the
transfer from mail-order fantasy to retail reality. Some, like
Eddie Bauer, did. Others, like Sharper Image and J. Peterman, are
having troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the history of retail will declare Delia's as
the company that turned teenage girls into a viable market segment.
``We preceded the whole focus on this question, `Can you sell to
girls?' '' Kahn proclaimed. ``We are the focal point for people who
look at this demographic.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RANDOLPH, Mass. _ When high school senior Henry Cooke marched
off to a Bicentennial reenactment in 1975, he could not have
realized that he was also on his way to a career.
</P>
<P>
   He was marching with the Randolph-South Suffolk Militia Company
_ ``a very grandiose name for a very small unit'' _ but still, he
said, he needed ``a proper uniform.'' What passed for proper in
those early days of Colonial reenactments was something put
together out of a commercial pattern book with the help of his
mother, who was not only a patient mother but a sewing teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``By today's standards,'' Cooke said, ``it wasn't very great.''
Its design was based on an artist's conception of what a
Revolutionary War soldier's uniform probably looked like _ and it
was put together with inauthentic Velcro and zippers.
</P>
<P>
   But authenticity has become the rule as interest in ``living
history'' reenactments _ from 18th-century wars in New England, the
Civil War in the South and Midwest _ has grown. And today's high
standards for reenactor uniforms are as much the result of Cooke's
historical research as they are of his hand-sewn craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take the rather plain-looking uniform of a common soldier in the
re-created 10th Massachusetts Regiment, a unit that Cooke helped to
organize, modeled on a light infantry regiment in Washington's army
that fought all the way down to Yorktown.
</P>
<P>
   It is of blue wool kersey, a heavyweight coating cloth, with
white facings _ but not just any old blue. It is as close to the
actual blue that historical research can achieve, based on three
sources: a contemporary print of a French artilleryman _ many of
the uniforms for Washington's army came from France _ and two
scraps of cloth that were discovered by purest chance.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kansas Historical Society's museum in Topeka, Cooke found
a small coverlet in which the padding was held in place by ties
that in turn were anchored by 1 1/4-inch circles of an indigo-dyed
blue woolen cloth. Quite likely, Cooke said, these scraps of cloth
came from cut-up uniforms brought along by New England settlers of
the Kansas Territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the clincher was a small black scrap of woolen cloth found
tucked inside a leather cartridge box in the collection of Don
Troiani, a Connecticut military artist. The box was known to have
belonged to a Revolutionary War soldier from New England.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap of cloth had been used to blacken the soldier's
leather gear but after Cooke cleaned and restored it, its original
indigo-blue color appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the color and texture known, Cooke had the cloth made
up by an English mill _ which also makes material for Ralph Lauren
and other designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing,'' said Cooke showing off a sample of
the cloth, but there was one final step taken in the interest of
absolute authenticity. The dye was chemically formulated so that it
would ``degrade'' over time in the same way that the original cloth
did, acquiring ``a yellowish-greenish cast in areas exposed to
daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   For the white facings, Cooke also uses a kersey, but for the
lining he uses a coarse but thin _ and breathable _ worsted.
``Breathability was really important,'' said Cooke, ``when you were
wearing a couple of layers of wool.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The thread he uses to stitch the neat, 2-inch long buttonholes
is one of the very few concessions Cooke makes to modern
technology. ``Historically, they used a mohair thread,'' he said,
``but that's not readily available, so we use a coarse grade of a
silk twist thread.''
</P>
<P>
   For the buttons, Cooke had an original that was found in an
archeological dig at West Point where the ``10th Mass.'' was
stationed on and off for about five years. From that model _ with
the words MAS X REG on three lines circled by a border _ Cooke had
a local tool-and-diemaker cut a die from which he casts buttons for
his uniforms in pewter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These accidental finds,'' said Cooke, ``help us understand the
clothing that the common soldiers wore.'' And knowing what people
wore, he said, ``is a way of breathing life into the dusty pages of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice, warm woolen uniform,'' Cooke said, laying out
his own 10th Massachusetts jacket on his worktable. ``But he's got
50 pounds of equipment on his back, and it's July, and he's
sweating profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke noted that the jacket has had 8 inches lopped off its
tails. ``They did that when they got to Virginia,'' he said. But
they kept the incongruous heart-shaped decorations on the bottom of
the jacket that concealed the hooks that held the tails up during
marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really capture the stark terror of being packed in
ranks and under fire,'' Cooke said. ``But you can capture the
boredom and the misery of his everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It takes Cooke about 40 hours to make one of these jackets,
which sell for $2,000. A more elaborate officer's uniform can run
about $5,000. In all, he makes about a dozen uniforms a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out making shirts, then jackets for fellows in my
own unit,'' said Cooke. ``They'd been prevailing on wives and
girlfriends and were lucky to get one set of clothes out of them
before they threw up their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Tufts _ and with a master's thesis on the
social evolution of the 10th Massachusetts _ Cooke found ``a dearth
of positions in museums'' and decided ``to stay with uniform-making
on a full-time basis until something better came along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 14 years ago. From uniforms for his 10th Massachusetts
unit, Cooke branched out to make them for other reenactors _ the
pre-Revolutionary units whose uniforms were similar to the red
coats of British Army units.
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating uniforms for reenactors, Cooke makes them for
artists like Troiani, who uses live models in his paintings of
historic battles. Cooke recently completed a two-year project for
the Braintree Historical Society, researching and then making a
uniform like that worn by General Sylvanus Thayer, a Braintree
native who was superintendent of West Point from 1817 to 1830.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as the interest of New England reenactors has
turned to the French and Indian War (1754-'63), Cooke has
researched and made the forest-green jackets for the re-created
Rogers Rangers. On a mannequin in his workshop is the brick-colored
jacket for an officer in the 40th Regiment of Foot, a British unit
that fought in that war.

   Cooke's workshop is the ell of an 1850s house on South Main
Street. Originally it was the home _ and workshop _ of a shoemaker
when Randolph, like several other South Shore towns, was a center
for a home-based shoemaking industry. Later, it was Cooke's
grandparents' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm continuing the use,'' Cooke said of the workshop ell.
``I'm bringing it back to manufacturing, just clothes instead of
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ell houses boxes of buttons and bags of cloth samples, a
shelf of books on Colonial uniforms, a tray of needles and pins _
and a modern sewing machine on the worktable, used strictly for
interior seams.
</P>
<P>
   Along with uniform-making, Cooke does consulting and restoration
work for museums and private collectors.
</P>
<P>
   A recent consulting assignment for the Bostonian Society,
researching and making the uniforms for its current Boston Massacre
exhibit, has Cooke, as a costumed mannequin, appearing both in the
mob of city residents and as one of the British soldiers _ ``firing
on myself, as it were.''

LAWYER ADDS TO FAMILY'S PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvey Silverglate is dogged by worries that his strategy for
defending British au pair Louise Woodward badly miscalculated the
jury's reaction. Now he has miscalculated again, this time even
more grievously, by offending an innocent family during their
bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate led a team of lawyers that represented Woodward, who
was rightly convicted last year in the death of the Eappens' infant
son, Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Now he chooses to announce _ in an interview in Massachusetts
Lawyers Weekly _ that he had evidence he chose not to introduce
that might have shown that the Eappens' son, Brendan, who is now 5,
played a role in the death of his brother. But Silverglate also
chose not to disclose to the Weekly what that evidence is.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Without presenting the merest speck of evidence, a
man who has spent years wearing out many a soapbox defending the
rights of the unjustly accused now publicly implicates an innocent
child.
</P>
<P>
   He begins by grumbling that he was never given credit by the
media for his gentle treatment of the Eappens, apparently believing
he should be lauded for not attacking innocent people who had lost
a child. He then moves on to his new-found evidence about how
Matthew Eappen died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that we had some stuff, and I'm not going to
tell you what it was, that any fair person would have said that
it's reasonable for us to put on,'' Silverglate told the Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of whether the older brother is well-behaved or not;
well, that's relevant. You're not calling a kid a murderer when you
(contend) that this kid might have pushed his brother and he might
have hit his head on a doorpost. That's relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's recall, as if we could forget, that Silverglate had an
entire trial to float any theory he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to argue that Matthew Eappen died from an injury
suffered three weeks before. The jury, understandably, didn't buy
his theory that a baby could suffer an injury, crawl around seeming
fine for weeks, and then die. The jury, in fact, thought Louise
Woodward was a liar.
</P>
<P>
   It was Silverglate's singular accomplishment this week to extend
the pain and suffering of a family that has already suffered so
much. But Silverglate has already had the only thing any lawyer is
entitled to: his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Silverglate said the Eappens were
``imperfect people'' whose elder son was rambunctious. So what? In
the Weekly article, he raised the notion that Brendan might have
pushed Matthew into a doorpost. But Wednesday, he admitted he had
no proof that anything of the sort had ever taken place. It was
just a theory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wasn't blaming the Eappens or Brendan,''
Silverglate said. ``My whole point was that you can't blame them _
and you can't blame Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nauseating. But also transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Having served minimal time, Woodward is home free in England.
Silverglate remains the losing lawyer in the case _ and a sore
loser he is. So he must assure the world that he could have won.
It's not that he wasn't a good enough lawyer, or that the jury
didn't believe his case, or that he was defending a guilty client.
No. His only sin was being too nice a guy.
</P>
<P>
   And we didn't even appreciate it. What is wrong with us?
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate clearly remains incredulous that the jury didn't buy
his case. He actually said Wednesday he didn't raise his theory
about Brendan because he thought the scientific case he had
assembled was so overwhelming. He said he had expected an acquittal
in 30 minutes, and knew the jury had decided to disregard the law
when he didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate's arrogance is his own business. And it's his right
to continue to maintain his client's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eappen family is nursing a pain that will never heal.
This is a family that has suffered the death of a child, a circus
of a trial, then the dim-witted media martyrdom of a confused young
woman who was entrusted with the care of their baby and tragically
failed to live up to that trust.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate said Wednesday that he was merely outlining
alternative theories of the case to a legal audience. But there's
nothing theoretical about this case. It's a matter of an infant's
death and a family's agony.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this case was a tragedy. But that is no excuse
for a self-aggrandizing lawyer to start pointing fingers at young
children to soothe his own bruised ego. Here's one New Year's wish
for Harvey Silverglate: a heart.

1998: MORE HATE SPEECH FROM THE LEFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst political slur of 1998, to judge by the media
attention it drew, was uttered by Al D'Amato, New York's Republican
senator. In a private meeting with supporters during his reelection
campaign last fall, D'Amato called his Democratic opponent,
Representative Charles Schumer, a ``putzhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is not nice to call people ``putzhead,'' and I wasn't
sorry to see D'Amato spanked for his boorish language. But it is
also not nice to call people white-sheeted racists, yet so far as I
know, none of my media brethren spanked Illinois Senator Carol
Mosely-Braun when she implied that George Will, the noted
commentator, belonged to the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because he could not say `nigger,' he said the word
`corrupt,' '' Mosely-Braun offered by way of rebutting Will's
columns about her many ethical lapses. ``George Will can just take
his hood and go back to wherever he came from.'' (In fact, Will
hadn't said the word ``corrupt.'')
</P>
<P>
   Why did Moseley-Braun's vile slander get a pass while D'Amato's
crudity became a national story? Because in one case, a liberal
insulted a conservative, while in the other, a liberal was insulted
by a conservative. I devote a column each year to illustrating the
pervasive double standard by which liberals are permitted to say
vicious things about conservatives _ things that would get a
conservative beheaded by sundown if he said it about a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In Salem, Mass., the superintendent of schools declared that
Barbara Anderson _ the state's leading taxpayer activist _ ``should
be tried for murder'' for her opposition to raising property
levies. In Berkeley, Calif., advocates for the homeless denounced
bookseller Andy Ross _ who campaigned to keep vagrants from sitting
and lying in the streets _ as a ``fascist,'' and defended the
swastikas that were painted in front of his store. In Washington,
Republican foes of a campaign finance bill were likened to
``terrorists'' by Gwen Ifill, a reporter for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   This is liberal hate speech, and I choose the word ``hate''
advisedly. Conservatives tend to view liberals as people whose
views are profoundly misguided, people woefully in need of
straightening out. But liberals are more likely to see
conservatives as hateful _ people whose views should be suppressed,
not debated, people who deserve only contempt.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Alan Dershowitz, a formidable liberal who defends
rapists and murderers, could publicly curse congressmen who voted
for impeachment as ``the forces of evil. Evil. Genuine evil.'' This
is why Tom Shales, the Washington Post's gifted TV critic, could
suggest of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr: ``Beneath the
dullness lies pure evil.'' This is why liberal talk show host Phil
Donahue could go postal during a conversation about politics ``and
begin shouting,'' as the New York Post reported this month, ``how
much he hated Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun wasn't the only liberal to sling the racism
mudball in 1998. Charles Rangel, the congressman from Harlem,
smeared Republicans in May. ``Don't you believe that they don't
want to dismantle the Social Security system. They are afraid to
come out from under their hoods and attack us directly.'' The
novelist E.L. Doctorow compared Bill Clinton's critics to the
murderers in Jasper, Texas: ``The president of the United States
(is) being dragged through the town by a pickup.'' Keith Olbermann
of MSNBC identified Lauch Fairthcloth, the conservative North
Carolina senator, as ``one of the junior Grand Wizards of the vast
right-wing conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the pre-election radio spot aired in St.
Louis: ``When you don't vote, you let another church explode. When
you don't vote, you allow another cross to burn. When you don't
vote, you let another assault wound a brother or sister. . . . Paid
for by the Missouri Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Repugnant stuff. Yet liberals routinely get away with injecting
it into the public discourse. Just ask Starr, who would have been
crucified if he had hurled at his critics the sickening libels many
of them hurled at him.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, the MSNBC commentator, announced in August that Starr
made him think of Heinrich Himmler, who ran the Gestapo for Hitler.
In February, Larry King compared him to Nazis. In October, Vanessa
Redgrave also compared him to Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it sometimes seems as if liberals can't look at a
conservative or a Republican without seeing the SS. The GOP
decision to block a vote on censuring Clinton, US Representative
Tom Lantos of California snarled, is something one would expect
``in Hitler's parliament.'' When New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
displeased an artists' association, it publicly depicted him with a
Hitler moustache.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer poison, nothing compares with the diatribe
uncorked by Alec Baldwin on the Conan O'Brien show. A liberal
activist and staunch Clinton supporter, the actor was condemning
the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in other countries,'' he shouted, ``we would all
right now, all of us together _ all of us together would go down to
Washington and we would stone Henry Hyde to death! We would stone
him to death! Wait! . . . I'm not finished. We would stone Henry
Hyde to death and we would go to their homes and we'd kill their
wives and their children! We would kill their families!''
</P>
<P>
   That is hate speech so monstrous, the outcry against it should
have cost Baldwin his career. But Baldwin is a liberal. So of
course there was no outcry, and his incitement cost him nothing.

THE RUSH TO GET ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two overriding demographics in the life of the
American consumer. The first is that no one has any time. The
second is that you're either on the Web or you're not. More than
anything else, these two demographics are taking the stock market
into unexpected places and changing the indices of value.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Charles Schwab Corp., the discount brokerage firm based
in San Francisco, achieved a market capitalization of $25.5
billion, making it the second-highest-valued brokerage firm in the
United States. (The first is Morgan Stanley Dean Witter). That same
day, Merrill Lynch had a market capitalization of $25.4 billion,
making it the third-highest-valued brokerage firm in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three months ago, it was unthinkable that
investors would even consider Charles Schwab in the same category
as Merrill Lynch. Schwab was thought of as a discount house.
Merrill was considered a powerhouse. What changed? The answer is
simple. Charles Schwab is Web-savvy and Merrill Lynch is not.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders were on the verge of
dominating the book industry. Today, on-line bookseller Amazon.com
has a market value ($17.5 billion) that far exceeds the combined
value of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Disney Corp. bought ABC for $19 billion and
seemed well on its way to becoming the premier media and
entertainment company of its time. Today, America Online has a
market capitalization greater than Disney's, a financial advantage
that will likely grow in the months and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Why? First, more and more Americans are getting on line. In
November 1996, the Voter News Service poll found that 25 percent of
American voters (who differ not much from nonvoters) were on the
Internet. In 1998 that number had increased to 40 percent. Assuming
that the trend continues, 65 percent of American voters will be on
line by November 2000. That's critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the cost of computing is getting cheaper by the day. It
is now expected that by the end of 1999, a high quality Pentium II
computer will cost roughly $500. By the year 2003, it is widely
assumed that a majority of American households will have as many
computers as people residing therein, just as most American
households now have more than one television set.
</P>
<P>
   Third, despite the almost unbelievable intransigence of the
regional Bell operating companies, high-speed Internet connections
will soon be available in most households. The days of 28 bits per
second are, no thanks to Bell Atlantic, coming to an end.
High-speed ADSL and cable modems should be standard features of
telephony (and commodity priced) by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is fueling the current ``dot-com'' frenzy on Wall
Street. Like other Wall Street crazes, this, too, shall pass. The
truth is that many of the dot-com companies will fail. They don't
have realistic business plans. They don't make a profit. In the
words of thestreet.com columnist James Cramer, ``most are just
rarefied press releases backed by cheap public capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer predicts that 1999 will be the year of reckoning for the
dot-com sector. Having given e-commerce stocks a bye in 1998, he
says, investors in 1999 will begin to apply the same criteria to
dot-com companies that they apply to ``bricks and mortar''
companies. The comparison, he thinks, will cause a proportionate
correction in valuations.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably right. But the two key demographics will
continue to alter the arithmetic of valuation. A couple of weeks
ago, American Online's Robert Pittman released a survey showing
that AOL could double its price, charge a fee for e-mail, charge a
fee for instant messaging, and still keep its customer base.
Overnight, that would double AOL's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   AOL won't be doing that any time soon. It is focused on gaining
market share. Eventually, AOL knows that most Americans will look
to the Web to alleviate what market researchers call ``time
famine.'' This is the reason why the potential of companies like
AOL is so enormous. The demand for services that give time back is
insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   In its first incarnation, e-commerce was about disintermediation
_ a fancy term for cutting out the middleman. In its next
incarnation, e-commerce will be about bundling services that save
time or act as ``intelligent agents'' for consumers. All the while,
it will continue to deliver value and best prices. This year's
Internet Christmas shopping numbers are evidence of this emerging
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that don't understand the dynamics of the new
demographics and the new technology will find it ever more
difficult to compete. A dot-com share price correction likely will
occur this year. But the larger dot-com correction is occurring
every day, and it is changing the rules of business and the
arithmetic of valuation.

RESOLVED TO ESCAPE THE NEW YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hold on a minute, I'm gazing at my crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   What lies ahead in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Aaaaggh! I see a long line of newly outed adulterers and another
trial, full of sex and scandal, that will creep into our heads,
sleazy detail by sleazy detail. I see even more extreme weather,
evidence that global warming is turning our planet topsy-turvy.
We'll discover to our horror that another ubiquitous object of the
'90s is a probable carcinogen _ and do nothing about it. There will
be another ethnic slaughter, another famine, other shocking acts of
terrorism. Many more species will topple into the oblivion of
extinction. TV sitcoms will be even more stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Are you hiding under the couch yet? Is there anyone with half a
brain looking forward to spending the next 365 days in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit we seem to have no choice, since death is such an
unattractive alternative. Unfortunately, alcohol and drugs are much
less effective, leaving far too many unavoidable moments of
sobriety between binges. But I have a plan, which I've already set
into action.
</P>
<P>
   I'm heading for the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going there with a new friend named Claire, the heroine of
Diana Gabaldon's incredibly engrossing novel, ``Outlander.'' When I
first met her, Claire was taking a second honeymoon with her
husband, Frank, in Scotland. World War II had just ended and
Claire, a former army nurse, was hoping to renew a relationship
interrupted by a six-year separation. One evening, traipsing around
the local version of Stonehenge, Claire stepped into the cleft of
one of the tallest standing stones and emerged into the year 1743,
a time of clan rivalry, incipient revolution, powerful
superstition, and really old-fashioned men.
</P>
<P>
   By 20th-century standards, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned to find myself in the 1740s without my cell phone,
my conditioner, or any knowledge of Scottish history, but Claire
was such a trouper I just followed her lead. I watched her get
captured by one of her husband's ancestors, Captain ``Black Jack''
Randall, who was far less savory in person than he appeared in the
history books. Luckily, she got rescued by a couple of local
fellows, including a Scot named Jamie Frasier, the kind of hero
you'd get if you crossed Tom Hanks with Sylvester Stallone, or Brad
Pitt with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he only took one bath a week.
</P>
<P>
   Claire adapts a whole lot better to the 1740s than I ever would,
but she was raised by her uncle, an archeologist whose travels from
one primitive site to another taught her the art of coping. Her
medical skills come in handy as well, and before you know it, she's
become a healer at Castle Leoch, all the while, of course, secretly
plotting to return to the stones and to her own century.
</P>
<P>
   Since Claire predates feminism and Jamie's never heard the words
``macho pig,'' she's forced to use epithets like ``barbarian'' and
``sadist'' when she gets mad. It's been fascinating to watch this
couple try to achieve a reasonable balance of power while avoiding
the soldiers pursuing Jamie and the villagers who want to burn
Claire as a witch.
</P>
<P>
   I can't seem to get these folks out of my mind. I think about
Claire in the shower, while I'm driving, and when I'm making
dinner. Because Claire came of age in the 1940s and I'm a part of
the 1990s, I brood about her greater adaptability. I wonder what
I'd do if I were in her place. I also think about the gulf between
daily life in the 1730s and my life today, trying to figure out
just how mixed a blessing progress is. I worry about what will
happen to her and Jamie next.
</P>
<P>
   You may think reading will provide only a temporary respite from
the next 365 days, but you're wrong. ``Outlander'' is 850 pages
long, and I'm reading it twice because the first time through, I
was too caught up in the action to savor the ways in which the
characters grow. When I'm done, there's the sequel, ``Dragonfly in
Amber'' (947 pages), and the sequel to that, ``Voyager,'' (870
pages), and ``Drums of Autumn,'' (Well, you get the idea). Gabaldon
has more books in the works.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather spend my evenings with Claire than with Peter
Jennings. I'd choose the company of the warden of Wentworth Prison
over a member of the Judiciary Committee any day. Even when things
go wrong, at least they make sense. I like knowing who the bad guys
are.
</P>
<P>
   Do me a favor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call me until the millennium arrives.

REPLACING A SASH CORD ISN'T TOO HARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have old windows with pulleys and ropes, which I like very
much, but I can't find someone to fix them. Who does such work?
</P>
<P>
   BETTY JEAN KELLY, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. A handyman (not me!) might do it, but if you have just a few
windows it might be hard to find anyone to do a small job. Besides,
it is generally a do-it-yourself project, because it is
uncomplicated. I think it is worth doing because weighted windows
are among the best you can get; they never get out of adjustment
(except when the ropes break), they can be weatherstripped
effectively, and they go well with storms.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to do it. Unscrew or pry off the side stop, a thin
board 2 to 3 inches wide that sits on the jamb, holding the lower
sash in place. Lift out the lower sash and set it aside. This will
reveal a little trapdoor in the jamb; open it to reveal the weight
pocket. Carefully reach into that pocket to retrieve the weight
that has fallen to the floor. This is tricky and risky, because the
space is tight and you want to avoid scratching yourself on all the
nail points sticking out in that pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Weight retrieved, mount the sash on the sill in its approximate
down position. Thread the new sash cord (hardware stores sell them
but clothesline will also work) over the pulley and down the pocket
until it appears in the trapdoor; pull it out and tie the weight to
it; insert the weight into the pocket and pull it up until it
touches the pulley; back off about 2 inches; thread the cord into
the groove on the edge of the sash; cut it so you can tie a knot in
its end to fit into a hole at the bottom of that groove.
</P>
<P>
   Done right, it will work perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't retrieve the weight, buy one of the correct size. A
wrong-size weight will not work well. Weights might be hard to
find, but Schwartz's Hardware in Watertown sells them.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can do to keep from ever having to replace that
sash cord again is to use a sash chain instead. They are solid
brass and will not rust, but they must be nailed into the groove of
the sash and attached to the weight with copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have heard that muriatic acid will remove cement that got
brushed onto a patio when the bricks were remortared. Does it work?
How is it used? And how long does it take to remove the cement?
</P>
<P>
   R. MURRAY CAMPBELL, Cohasset, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You heard right, but your other questions are interesting
because there are no directions on the acid bottle as to how to do
the treatment. Muriatic acid attacks the lime in cement and mortar,
and that is how it removes it. How to do it? Mix the acid 1 to 1
with water (pour acid into water; doing it the other way will cause
splashes, not a nice thing with acid. And, as with all acids, wear
skin and eye protection when working with them). Brush on the
solution with a paintbrush or pour it on the smeared cement or
mortar. It will fizz up for a few seconds; when the fizzing stops,
rinse. Scrubbing with a scrub brush or wire brush will help remove
stubborn areas. Repeat as necessary. Let the rinsed area dry off
completely before repeating.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you can do all this the day after the work was
done, or 10 years later; time is no factor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Ah, pet odors (specifically cat urine) and how to get rid of
them. There are a million treatments, some more effective than
others, but B.R.L. of Wellesley, Mass. called to tell us he found
the cure: ``I tried everything without success, but this is what
worked: Pour gin on the stain. I used three-quarters of a bottle,
but it really works.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, B.R.L. I can think of better uses for gin (does
Beefeater work better than Gilbey's?), but I have no argument with
whatever works. I wonder what it is in gin that does it: the
juniper? If it is the alcohol, then why wouldn't rubbing alcohol do
better? It may be that the alcohol must be grain rather than
isopropyl. In any event, I have added it to my list of cures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am filling all kinds of holes in my walls and foundation to
stop invasion from critters, and have heard that Stuffit, a
nonrusting ``steel'' wool or gauze, works wonders. I have looked
everywhere for it without success. Where can I find it? You are my
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   EVELYN MILONA, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The buck stops at the handyman's door, and you can buy
Stuffit from Allen Special Products; telephone 800-848-6805. They
can also tell you if any stores near you carry it.

IN '98, THE MESSENGERS WERE THE MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What kind a year was 1998 for the news media? A mighty strange
one. It began with cybernerd Matt Drudge breaking the biggest
scandal since Watergate and ended with porno king Larry Flynt
forcing the resignation of the House Speaker-elect. Geraldo Rivera
went from a trash TV talkmaster to respected newsman. ESPN wiseguy
Keith Olbermann jumped to MSNBC to try serious news and _ in this
season of ``all Monica all the time'' _ returned to sports to
restore his self-respect. It was a year in which almost every line
between news and entertainment was blurred.
</P>
<P>
   So here, with the unerring clarity of 20-20 hindsight and in no
particular order, is a look at some of the major players that
shaped _ or distorted _ journalism during the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Willes: After the former General Mills executive became CEO
of Times Mirror Co. and later become publisher of its flagship, the
Los Angeles Times, he elicited gasps of horror with his vow to blow
up the sacred wall between a newspaper's editorial and business
departments. He's toned down the rhetoric, but encouraged major
collaboration between journalists and bean counters in an effort to
build circulation by as much as 500,000. If his experiment
succeeds, Willes will spawn scores of imitators. If he fails, in
his words, ``We risk being remembered as the crash dummies of
American journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Drudge: In one year, this self-proclaimed Walter Winchell
of the '90s has gone from anonymity to his own Fox News Channel
show. His master stroke was to pilfer and post Newsweek's Monica
Lewinsky scoop on his Web site in January, breaking the scandal
that has rocked Washington to its core. He posits himself as an
outsider in a ``turf war with the establishment press.'' And Drudge
is the most dramatic symbol of the emergence of cyberspace as a
major media force.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kaplan: After years of enduring crummy ratings when there's
no O. J. freeway chase or Gulf War, CNN imported this former ABC
``World News Tonight'' executive producer to build numbers. Kaplan
hinged his ``appointment viewing'' strategy on ``NewsStand'' shows
pairing CNN and its Time Inc. brethren. But the June 7 debut
alleging the United States' use of nerve gas in the Vietnam War was
a disaster. Apologies were issued, heads rolled (even Kaplan's
momentarily wobbled), and CNN boss Ted Turner lamented that
``nothing has upset me more in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown: America's best magazine editor brought more
eyeballs, more buzz, and more red ink to The New Yorker before
suddenly resigning to become Miramax's multimedia guru. Everyone
seemed happy with the surprise selection of Pulitzer Prize winner
David Remnick to succeed her. And while traditionalists decried
Brown's fondness for popular culture and her proclivity for S&AMP;M
photo features, time will tell whether Remnick can match her feel
for the Zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brill/Jackie Judd: The cocky founder of Court TV became
America's most ambitious media scold with ``Brill's Content''
magazine. His mission impossible is to sell a journalism trade
publication to a mass audience of 500,000 subscribers. Yet he may
never replicate the clout of his first issue, a strategically savvy
assault on Monicagate coverage in which he called the media ``an
enabler of (Ken) Starr's abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd's ABC report on Jan. 23 of a semen-stained Lewinsky dress
became exhibit A for the loud chorus accusing the media of
recklessly reporting rumor. When the story proved true, Judd had
done her part to salvage journalism's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Scaife/Salon magazine: When Hillary Clinton complained
about a right-wing conspiracy, the reclusive Scaife became a
household word. The Pennsylvania publisher has donated hundreds of
millions to conservative causes, funding everything from reporter
Christopher Ruddy's allegations that Vincent Foster was murdered to
The American Spectator's dirt-digging on the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the online magazine Salon became the White House's
favorite junkyard dog. First, it unearthed GOP House Judiciary
chair Henry Hyde's decades-old adulterous relationship. More
recently it alleged a ``personal history of marital infidelity,''
on the part of GOP Congressman Dan Burton, a Clinton foe who once
called the president a ``scumbag.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith/Mike Barnicle/Stephen Glass: Two star Globe
columnists and the New Republic Wunderkind departed after mixing
fact and fiction. Their cases generated paroxysms of introspection
in a media business desperately afraid of eroding public trust.
Little wonder then that American Society of Newspaper Editors
president Edward L. Seaton recently referred to the high-profile
spate of embarrassments as journalism's ``spring and summer from
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevorkian and ``60 Minutes'': ``Is he dead now?'' With that
question to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, Mike Wallace punctuated the
decision by ``60 Minutes'' to broadcast the euthanizing of the
terminally ill Thomas Youk. A defiant ``60 Minutes'' staff said
they were only interested in sparking a meaningful debate on the
issue of assisted suicide and said the program ``performed a public
service.'' Angry critics accused ``60 Minutes'' of airing a
ratings-driven snuff film.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Unger: The Boston magazine editor refused to apologize for
a headline on a profile of Harvard's ``Skip'' Gates _ ``Head Negro
In Charge'' _ that enraged numerous black activists. Some observers
think the flap put the magazine back on the map with its suburban
readers. It certainly revealed how Boston's festering racial wounds
can reopen at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra: Once the wonders of ``father's little helper'' hit the
media, it was a full-blown frenzy. A ``Nightline'' segment began
with a satisfied user extolling Viagra's virtues thusly: ``The
skies opened, and a bolt of lightning came down and God said, `I
love you.' '' The intense Viagra coverage illustrated the
newsworthiness of America's continued quest for better living
through chemicals. And it also served to remind us how many news
executives happen to be middle-aged males.

<P>
   &UR; Hesitance on treating hypertension found
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While US physicians are more often criticized for being overly
aggressive in treating sick people, a new study in the current New
England Journal of Medicine suggests doctors may not be pushing
hard enough to control high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dan R. Berlowitz, a senior Veterans Administration health
official, and Dr. Mark A. Moskowitz, general internal medicine
chief at Boston Medical Center, followed 800 veterans treated at
four Massachusetts VA medical centers and a fifth in Providence.
About 40 percent had high blood pressure, or readings of 160/90 or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although these hypertensive men saw doctors on average six times
a year, in only one visit out of four, did doctors take some action
to increase their medication, which the study authors consider an
unacceptably low rate. ``Although physicians may have been closely
monitoring patients' blood pressure, they repeatedly delayed making
changes'' in medication, the doctors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study clearly demonstrates that physicians are not
aggressively treating hypertension or taking the simple, necessary
steps to reduce high blood pressure in a patient,'' said Moskowitz.
He and Berlowitz say their findings _ involving patients with an
average age of 65 who visited VA hospitals and clinics in Bedford,
Lowell, Jamaica Plain, Providence, and West Roxbury _ probably
apply to the general population of older and hypertensive people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Foods' benefits miss many mothers-to-be
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of women in America apparently do not know of the
critical benefits that eating foods rich in folate and folic acid
can have in preventing birth defects, according to the January
Journal of the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   As many as three-quarters of spinal and brain birth defects
could be prevented if pregnant women consumed adequate daily
amounts of the nutrients, found in foods such as spinach, pasta,
lentils, and breads and cereals, many of which are fortified with
folic acid, and pill supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But two studies in the journal found that 75 percent of
low-income women in Hartford, Conn _ and a majority of pregnant
low-income women in Atlanta _ had never heard of spina bifida or
neural tube defects and could not say which nutrients or foods can
prevent them. ``This worries me that women don't know about the
importance of folate, because it is such a simple solution to
problems that can cause such heartache,'' said Elizabeth Ward, a
Boston dietitian and author of an association book called
`Pregnancy Nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences recommends all women of
childbearing age consume 400 micrograms of folate daily, which can
be achieved with a bowl of cereal and large glass of orange juice
for breakfast plus a good helping of green vegetables with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Infants' health rises with mothers' milk
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another new study important to pregnant women and new mothers
bolsters the case for breast-feeding of infants.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Jeanne Raisler, now of the University of Michigan
Nursing School, found a fairly clear ``dose-response'' relationship
between the extent to which infants got their nutrition from their
mothers and the rate at which they got sick with diarrhea, coughs,
or other illnesses requiring a trip to the pediatrician. The study
appears in the January issue of the American Journal of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Raisler and colleagues followed 7,092 infants from the National
Maternal and Infant Health Survey found that those who were fully
breast-fed for their first 6 months had up to 30 percent fewer
illnesses than those who got most of their nutrition from formula
or prepared foods.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, infants' rate of illnesses dropped as the portion of
breast milk in their diet rose. The study took steps to factor out
other things that could affect their rate of illness, such as their
parents' economic status, infant birthweight, what month they were
born, and whether they went to day care or had older siblings or
people at home who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   While the study bolsters the case for breast-feeding among women
for whom it is possible, Raisler said follow-up studies should be
done to determine whether there is some minimum level of
breast-feeding _ say, 50 percent of the diet for 6 months _ that
seems to guarantee immunity against minor illnesses.

   As acceptance speeches go, it ranked right up there with Cuba
Gooding's jumping jacks and Jack Palance's one-armed pushups. Sure,
it was the Emmys rather than the Oscars, but that hardly put a
crimp in Camryn Manheim's zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she squealed, clutching the little statue she won for
her role as feisty lawyer Ellen Frutt on ``The Practice,'' ``is for
all the fat girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Such sweet revenge is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   On both network and cable, prime time and daytime, plus-sized
personalities are everywhere, emoting and yukking it up in all
their zaftig glory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Manheim now has an entire sisterhood of full-figured
peers, including Kristie Alley and Kathy Najimy, Star Jones, Emme,
Rosie O'Donnell and Roseanne Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Need further proof of TV's newly democratic stance? Even
``Baywatch'' is flirting with the idea of a character not cut along
the Barbie-esque lines of Pamela Lee or Carmen Electra. According
to a spokesperson, the show's casting director and producers have
met with plus-sized actress Kiki Hall, who is under consideration
for a guest-starring spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a story idea in development,'' the spokesperson says.
``We're always looking for fresh faces.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Alicia Silverstone's chubby arms sent
shockwaves through the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the 1996
Academy Awards, the movie world has also begun to turn its back on
the tyranny of female perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all the loving odes to Jennifer Lopez's colossal
behind of late, Kate Winslet's curvy form has also given the status
quo a swift kick in the pants. Though hardly rotund, Winslet
radiates a certain womanly beauty not seen in American films since
the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   And in the teen realm, who has popped up on screen more often
lately than the defiantly pudgy Christina Ricci?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's hip to be hippy these days. But an even bigger stamp
of approval is coming from, of all places, the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   Models, who have long waved the goddess flag, are being held to
much less rigorous standards today. Of course, the pendulum had to
swing a lot further in the other direction first _ the emaciated
likes of Kristen Owen or an Amy Wesson just wouldn't have happened
10 years ago _ there's nonetheless a mini-revolution afoot in Model
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the success of Ten/20, Wilhelmina's booming plus-sized
division. Although there are other New York-based agencies with
healthy plus contingents, Wilhelmina represents the brightest stars
in this particular constellation, including Kate Dillon, Mia Tyler
and Natalie Laughlin.
</P>
<P>
   The division, which celebrates its fourth anniversary in
January, now handles roughly 40 girls on a full-time basis, as well
as an additional 10 to 15 who are either still in school or who
live outside the United States and are only here sporadically.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems like only yesterday that Ten/20 director Susan
Georget had to beat the bushes to build her model roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no girls at all at first,'' she recalls. ``I even
started stopping women on the street and in the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent 10 years at Plus Models before starting the
division at Wilhelmina, Georget is hyper-aware of what a tough sell
large sizes can be. But she's never been more optimistic about the
market's prospects than she is right now.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the scads and scads of catalog assignments her models
routinely land, there are ad campaigns, billboards in Times Square,
even a smidge of runway.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been several magazine profiles and special,
large-sized fashion stories _ primarily in Mode and Galmour _
featuring Dillon, Laughlin and Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle, Georget admits, is incorporation into the
editorial mainstream. In other words, real victory can't be claimed
until full-figured models are booked alongside ``straight-sized''
girls for the same story.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hasn't happened in any meaningful manner yet,
although a new teen publication, Girl, took a stab at it in its
premiere issue. But while she refuses to give details, Georget says
Dillon will shortly be seen in a major fashion story by a marquee
name photographer.
</P>
<P>
   A watershed event? It is by fashion's snooty standards. For
decades, most of the more influential fashion magazines have
somehow managed to operate in full denial of the fact that American
women grow heavier with each passing year. Depending on which study
is cited, the average U.S. female currently wears a size 12 or
larger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't just women who are packing on the pounds.
According to the new guidelines set by the National Heart, Lung and
Blood institute (a branch of the NIH) this past summer, 97 million
American adults _ 55 percent of the entire population _ are now
considered overweight or obese. And recent findings by the American
Academy of Pediatrics peg a full 25 percent of U.S. kids as
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, then, that some may view the media's new
``fat acceptance'' less as a feminist manifesto and more of a
wholesale dropping of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   If it's possible that fashion spreads depicting scarecrow-thin
models can send one message (``Starve yourself''), it's equally
conceivable that layouts featuring large-sized mannequins can
telegraph another (``Eat _ consequences be dammed'').
</P>
<P>
   While neither extreme is ideal, there is little doubt which side
the p.c. faction is weighing in on. One New York-based weight-loss
specialist, Dr. Howard Shapiro, has found himself caught in the
crossfire of various fat acceptance groups when he's made the
rounds of daytime chat shows such as ``Sally Jessy'' and ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an issue with people who push acceptance of fat without
stating the consequences,''he says. ``You can't push for obesity
without telling people that they're at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to be overweight, I have no problem with
that,'' he adds. ``But that person's position should be, `I'm
accepting the fact that I'm overweight and know that the potential
for health risks is greater. I have a higher potential for heart
disease, for certain types of cancer, for a stroke.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent and teen-age girls are in even greater danger of a
health backlash, Shapiro says, if they somehow latch on to the
notion that being fat is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're obese as a kid, and you continue to keep that weight
on as an adult, you will develop the same types of problems at a
younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens with people who are struggling is that they'll
take the path of least resistance,'' he adds. ``And if someone
teaches them that being overweight is great, they'd rather do that
than work at being thin. So they find a niche where they're
accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's getting easier every day to find that niche. All it
takes these days is a click of the remote control or a quick trip
to the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't mind being a little more voluptuous now,'' Shapiro
says. ``It's the trend at the moment.'' &QL;

   Running out of the house without a scrap of makeup on is a
definite no-no, at least according to the old rules of seduction.
As Estee Lauder pointed out in her autobiography, ``Why should you
look like a faded Polaroid snapshot? Who's going to remember you
that way?''
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're running at the gym? Is it acceptable, or even
wise, to look like a faded Polaroid when you're fighting for breath
on a treadmill?
</P>
<P>
   After all, you never know when a blue-chip bachelor could be
polishing his muscles right next to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many women who met their husbands at the Vertical Club,
and these are women who are very makeup savvy,'' says makeup artist
Laura Geller. ``They did not go to the gym in schmattas or wearing
loose sweatpants. They're wearing G-strings up their tushies, and
they look really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises when a woman goes overboard, troweling on the
foundation, blush and mascara and shellacking her hair with
powerful sprays. This is the look that MAC creative director Frank
Toskan describes as ``eerie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the informal poll of makeup artists below, a host of opinions
surfaced on the topic of workout beauty. While a few were
vehemently opposed to even a drop of coverup, most counseled a
light application of products that breathe.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, minimal mascara and lip balm are considered fine.
For a face that can withstand even the most ferocious kickboxing
class, the makeup artists recommend waterproof and longlasting
formulas.
</P>
<P>
   Several brands, including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome and
Revlon, sell a variety of products that won't budge. And Almay
bills its new Amazing Lasting Sheer Makeup as the base ``that's got
you covered from wake-up to workout.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DICK PAGE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's completely absurd to wear makeup at the gym _
just short of certifiable. It's the urban equivalent of going to
the beach with makeup and jewelry on. Nothing looks worse than
breaking a sweat through makeup _ it's kind of grim _ so I would
not use foundation. I guess you could have your eyelashes dyed. And
maybe a nice lip pencil a couple of shades darker than your lips
and a dot of lip balm.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MARIA VEREL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Women should absolutely wear makeup to the gym. If you see the
man of your dreams and you wish your lashes were a little more
defined, there's no going back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cover the occasional blemish with a spot concealer and
invisible powder. I would highly recommend a waterproof mascara. A
trick for the lips is nude lipliner smeared over lip conditioner to
brighten the color of your lips. And don't rub your face, only
blot!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRED FARRUGIA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advise a French woman to wear makeup at the gym,
but American women are very put-together and never go out without
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a woman at a sports club should look like she has
a healthy glow, but not like she's wearing cosmetics. Why not stick
on a pair of false eyelashes? And rub in a little bit of gloss on
the lips and eyes and a dot of creamy pink blush on the cheeks. On
the body, hydrating cream makes muscles gleam. A very important
touch: a French manicure.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAURA GELLER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can get down and dirty and sweat and still look
good. Try waterproof mascara, a little bit of liner, oil-free
dual-finish powder and long-wearing lipstick. Or put on one of my
Lip Shines if you don't want to look like you're wearing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VINCENT LONGO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen girls wear full-on makeup at the gym, and it's just
not that appealing. But there's a way to look pretty without going
over the top. You can brush your eyebrows with a fixative so they
look nicely arched. You can curl your lashes and put on mascara. I
don't mind if there's a little stain on the lip or on the eyelid.
The best way to achieve this is with pencils because they're more
resistant to perspiration. You can even go to the extent of
applying a light oil on your body as a moisturizer. It gives you
beautiful sheen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRANK TOSKAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming dependent on makeup psychologically is a mistake.
It's eerie to see a woman with a full face of makeup jogging. If a
woman insists, she should wear products that are translucent and
not powdery-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHASE ASTON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think that you should wear makeup to the gym.
But if a woman is living by `The Rules,' then I seriously suggest
she have her eyelashes tinted to a fluttering soft black. If she's
a slave to makeup, she can invest in a lip stain, so she'll always
have that perfect pout. And she should pinch her cheeks
regularly.'' &QL;

HOME PROJECT RESOLUTIONS FOR '99 _ AND HOW TO KEEP THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Year's resolutions are made to be broken, which is a great
way to get a guilty conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But we have a little list. We've made up a list of resolutions
that you can keep. In fact, you'd better keep them, because if you
don't, your house and garden will disappear in a compost pile of
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   And, only one resolution for each month makes them easier to
keep and ready to start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   OK, tighten your belt, and here we go. &QL; 
 &QL; 
January &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get rid of mildew. That's a funny resolution; doesn't mildew
grow only in warm weather, outdoors?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again. It doesn't grow in cold weather outdoors, yes, but
indoors it thrives with moisture, in living space and especially in
basements, and often in attics.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you see it, attack it with bleach and water. Clorox is
a good bleach, but you can buy the same thing under Brand X for
less cost. Make a mix of one part bleach and three parts water and
paint this on all black smudges, little dots, and other suspect
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful using bleach on upholstery or clothes, but almost
every other surface _ paint, varnish, stain, concrete, metal, _ can
take the bleach with aplomb. And, as always, wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback of bleach is that it can be very hard on bare wood.
</P>
<P>
   Some mildew fighters have found that Era, a Proctor &AMP; Gamble
laundry detergent with enzymes, is designed to remove protein
stains (grass, fruit, blood). Judson Escalant of Chatham found it
works well for mildew. Use it three parts water to one part Era, or
straight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baking soda in place of bleach also works on mildew. &QL; 
 &QL; 
February &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep the mildew away. This is a tough resolution because it may
be impossible to keep mildew away completely. It will grow where it
is warm and damp, and dampness can occur in many places. Outdoors,
it is a losing battle, and the best you can do is keep after it.
</P>
<P>
   But, you can try, indoors. The way to try is to elminate
dampness by ventilating house, basement and attic.
</P>
<P>
   Also, insulate walls and ceilings and floors, so that these
surfaces will be warm, and water vapor will be less likely to
condense on it.
</P>
<P>
   If you open windows for a few minutes twice a day, you wll
release a lot of the moisture, which is constantly being built up
indoors. And, you will not lose much heat at all.
</P>
<P>
   As for the basement, chances are fair to good that you don't
have to ventilate in winter, because there is less moisture in cold
air. But it's a must in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can paint some surfaces with a new Muralo paint that
claims to be mildew-proof. It's called Perma-White, both exterior
and interior, and in various glosses. Muralo guarantees that the
paint will be free of mildew for five years.
</P>
<P>
   That is a gutsy guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Perma-White can be tinted to off-white and pastel shades. It is
a hard finish, helping to s make it mildew resistant because mildew
has a hard time growing on hard, shiny surfaces. That is why mildew
does not grow on glass, shiny metal, and glazed ceramic tile. &QL; 
 &QL; 
March &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clean out, clean up, and clean down. Clean out the garage, the
basement, the closets, and the attic. If you haven't used something
in five years, throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, anything you think is valuable, antique,
sellable, and usable. OK, it's a lost cause and a broken
resolution. Put everything back. But neatly. Build an extra closet,
if necessary. Build an extra room for the closet, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At least you got everything clean.
</P>
<P>
   And so on, and so on, to: &QL; 
 &QL; 
April &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This one's easy, and maybe even fun. Get out in the garden and
grub, taking up winter debris and raking, spading, fertilizing,
seeding, and planting perennials and early annuals.
</P>
<P>
   This way, everything will be perfect for the coming glories of
spring and summer outdoors. Build and install bat boxes and bird
houses. Bird feeders, too, and keep them stocked.
</P>
<P>
   Consider yard ornaments, made of concrete and other
weather-resistant materials. They are large and small, and come in
every shape and form, whimsical to serious, with a fountain or two
thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful that you don't get too artsy-crafty, with
flamingos and other inappropriate animals. &QL; 
 &QL; 
May &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the perennials and annuals can wait until this month.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a mulching mower and don't waste all those grass clippings.
Use the mulching mower to grind up your leaves in autumn, too; you
can put them on the garden beds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
June &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paint everything in sight; better yet, stain.
</P>
<P>
   The painting season is underway, and you can join all the
painters, painting siding, trim, decks, and outbuildings.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to scrape, sand, and wash what you are about to
paint, and think seriously about using stain instead of paint,
which doesn't seem to work well in many outdoor cases, peeling
before its time.
</P>
<P>
   You can also paint aluminum siding. Sand it to reduce gloss and
roughen the finish, wash with a strong detergent and water, and
finish with two thin coats of a latex house paint, or solid latex
stain. Pittsburgh Paints makes a latex paint specifically designed
for aluminum siding.
</P>
<P>
   Sonme authorities say you can paint vinyl siding, but I would
avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   You can use solid latex stain in place of paint. While it can
peel, it may not peel as much as paint.
</P>
<P>
   And, on bare wood, consider semitransparent stain, especially on
decks and deck floors. Semitransparent stain will not peel.
</P>
<P>
   Stain will last about five years, not as long as most paints if
they do not peel; but with luck, you'll have no peeling.
</P>
<P>
   And, above all, apply thin coats.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, oh! Resolution Alert! Wouldn't you know, the last six
resolutions were broken as we ran out of space.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they'll just have to wait until next Sunday.

EMOTIONAL CLAUSTROPHOBIA INSIDE ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FROM A SEALED ROOM 
By Rachel Kadish 
Putnam, 356 pp., $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rachel Kadish's ambitious first novel begins in a sealed room, a
Jerusalem bedroom sealed against a feared Scud missile attack, the
kind that hit Tel Aviv and Haifa a number of times during the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   As quickly becomes clear in the book, the sealed room works as a
metaphor on several levels: an Israeli couple's stale marriage and
the stagnancy of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians
(this is before the Oslo accords of 1993). But while Kadish begins
and ends her novel with that room, giving us a poignant and
surprisingly powerful tale in the changes that take place outside
it, she might have served her readers better by discarding the
metaphor, or at least not trying so hard to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that although Kadish begins the book with one
story _ about Nacham and Tami, the Israeli couple whose apartment
contains the sealed room _ she abruptly shifts gears after the
first chapter and spends the rest of the book weaving a tale about
an immature American student who is running away from her
strong-willed do-gooder mother, only to discover the dark
underbelly of Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Maya's relationships _ with her mother, who heals souls in the
bleakness of Brooklyn's slums; with Gil, her Israeli boyfriend
whose father's death in the Yom Kippur war leaves him deeply
flawed; and with her mysterious downstairs neighbor _ turn out to
be the heart of the novel. Readers who are patient enough to stay
with the book, despite its dry beginning and abrupt shift in story,
are well rewarded in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, who obviously has spent time in Israel and seems to know
the country and its people well, does a nice job in capturing the
sensibility of modern-day Sabras (native-born Israelis), their
ambivalence over the peace process, their unapologetic wit, and
their steadfast loyalty to the land and each other. She also
accurately depicts the religious and ethnic hostilities that divide
Israel, not only those between Jew and Arab, but between Jew and
Jew.
</P>
<P>
   When Maya moves out of the university dorm, where she is
attending a semester abroad, and into her boyfriend's apartment,
her roommates talk with disdain about the ``blacks'' who live in
her new neighborhood. The term confuses Maya, until she realizes
that it refers not to people with dark skin, but to the
ultra-religious Jews, who dress in black, are exempt from military
service, and are ostracized and indeed loathed by the country's
more secular Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her astute characterization of the broader cultural
milieu, Kadish is equally adept at building a tone of quiet menace,
as Maya becomes increasingly isolated from her university friends
and more dependent on Gil, a moody loner who may be talented as an
artist but has flunked his country's most important test: its
mandatory military service.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Kadish carefully assembles the building blocks of what
is to become a dangerously abusive relationship, the most poignant
parts of the novel revolve around Maya's relationship with two
women: her mother, who is dying of cancer, and her elusive
downstairs neighbor, who is a Holocaust survivor and quite mad as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The story of mad Shifra and what she wants from Maya the
American is perhaps the novel's strongest and most haunting
feature. Kadish sketches Shifra's life, as a young Polish woman
caught in the horrors of the Holocaust, with a lyrical touch, and
while her prose is sometimes disjointed and grandiose, it succeeds
in capturing attention in a way that Maya's relationship with her
abusive boyfriend, or her cousin Tami's airless marriage, does not.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it is not the metaphor of the sealed room or the
fact that Nacham and Tami's marriage suddenly blooms (as does the
Israeli peace process) as the room becomes unsealed that pack the
emotional punch in this novel. What ultimately proves to be most
affecting is what Maya learns about life from the two women in her
life _ her mother and her neighbor, who keeps trying
(unsuccessfully of course) to fix the unfixable and change the
unfathomable past.

BLUNDERS AND BRILLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Journalism is the first rough draft of history,'' the saying
goes. But we technology journalists write up the first rough draft
of prophecy. We wander in a wilderness of books, trade magazines,
and Web pages, listening for voices to guide us and our readers
down the True Path toward the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   I've already owned up to my most idiotic prediction of the year,
the inevitable failure of the Apple iMac. Some failure; I'm using
one of them right now.
</P>
<P>
   It's harder to grade my other judgments of the waning year,
since I don't usually make ex cathedra pronouncements of the sort
that got me in trouble with the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, I hit the bull's-eye. Back in February, I began
singing the praises of the free Linux operating system as an
alternative to Microsoft Windows. I even suggested that embattled
browser-maker Netscape Communications Corp. do a deal with a Linux
distributor to hit Microsoft where it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   From my keyboard to Jim Barksdale's brain. The Netscape CEO made
just such a deal in September with Red Hat Software Inc., the top
Linux distributor. The giant chipmaker Intel also signed on. And
now there are reports that IBM Corp. is talking to Red Hat about
providing worldwide customer support for Linux users. From geek
curiosity to major industry in less than a year; yes, I'd say I got
Linux right.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the columns that hit the target but miss the
center ring. I wrote that 1998 was to be the year of ADSL, a
dazzling technology that can download Internet data at millions of
bits per second over home telephone lines. Yet only a tiny handful
of consumers have ADSL service at home.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't exactly wrong; my calendar was just running a few
months fast. Indeed, for computer firms and phone companies, 1998
was indeed the year of ADSL. At last, there's an industrywide
technical standard, so that everybody's ADSL gear will work with
everybody else's. Major computer makers, such as Compaq, now build
ADSL chips into some of their machines, and telephone companies are
just beginning to offer the service in cities like Washington, D.C.
Boston's due to go on line with ADSL in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the industry doubt that consumers want high-speed
access. An October study from the Gartner Group predicted that by
the year 2003, nearly two-thirds of US consumers with Internet
access will still be using those slow telephone modems.
</P>
<P>
   I also ran way ahead of the curve in a March column in which I
sang the praises of network computers. Remember NCs? These cheap,
diskless devices, remotely controlled by powerful server computers,
were supposed to replace PCs in many corporate offices. Nearly
every tech expert in the land predicted they'd sell by the
millions. It just hasn't happened; dramatic PC price drops
eliminated a major advantage of NCs. Now most of the pundits have
turned on the NC makers with fangs bared.
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I still say they'll catch on. I can see hints that it's
happening. IBM just sold several thousand of them to a couple of
major companies. Here at the Globe, we're testing an NC from Wyse
Technology Inc. that could replace hundreds of old terminals
scattered throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   NCs still have big advantages. Firms can save a fortune by
managing thousands of computer terminals from a central control
point. And millions of workers who merely need access to a few
basic computer functions shouldn't have to master a device as
complex and fragile as a traditional PC. The NC is an idea that's
too reasonable to die.
</P>
<P>
   So I've got a spectacularly bad prediction on the iMac, and a
Linux call that was so on-target it's spooky. Yes, my timing was
off on ADSL and network computers, but I bet those columns will
read like works of genius by next December. Of course, by then,
I'll have another year's worth of blunders to answer for.

SILVER STRINGERS GET NEWS LIFE ONLINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MELROSE, Mass. _ Bill Jodrey is a quiet sort, exceedingly humble
and polite, and unless he's prodded and cajoled, he won't tell you
about the summer he left home and went out to ride the rails,
sleeping standing up in ice cars and looking hungrily for work.
Natalie Thomson, on the other hand, is a gregarious soul who will
tell you outright that she went to work after World War II _ ``not
to fulfill myself, but for money'' to feed and clothe her kids.
</P>
<P>
   Stories are told in this modest meeting room at the Milano
Senior Center. Russ Priestley shyly explains that he once flew
fighter planes; he still misses the thrill of navigation. As for
Don Norris, he allows that he once raced motorcycles, wrote about
them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the eight people gathered here have 587 years of life
experience; their median age is 73.4. Along with their longevity,
these game seniors also have three computers, one scanner, and a
digital camera, and several times a week, they put those years and
that high-tech equipment to work, publishing a vibrant on-line
newspaper. They call themselves the Silver Stringers, and their Web
site (silverstringer.media.mit.edu) is not just quaint living
history, it's a celebration of life itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I retired involuntarily after I fell down and broke my leg,''
explains Virginia Hanley, 71, a self-described ``gypsy'' who once
worked at the US Embassy in Bonn. ``You get in a rut. I was sitting
around reading romance novels and mystery stories, and this project
really did wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   This project was launched a few years ago by the News in the
Future program at the MIT Media Lab; MIT provided the software and
the technical know-how, but the Stringers did the rest. The MIT
folks would like to see the project emulated in communities all
over the world, and the Melrose group is its role model. ``MIT
can't get rid of us now,'' says Norris, with a wily grin. ``They
can't afford to let us go.''
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about gee-whiz technology here. The site is
just plain photos and text: no plug-ins, no sound effects, no
streaming video. But it is the technology at its best, bringing
together both real and virtual communities. Most of the 30 or so
volunteers didn't know each other before they joined the Stringers,
and they've received e-mail from readers in Ireland, Russia, and
Mozambique. The site generates about 450 hits a day, not bad given
all the competition on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, it brings the volunteers together a few times a
week to debate and dissect their product. When should they publish
the full text of Jodrey's ``Tales of the Open Road,'' which
chronicles the summer of 1932 when Jodrey, now 85, quit high school
to travel as a hobo? How should they archive their special sections
on the Great Depression and World War II? Who's going to cover
local news? (``Does that mean we have to go out to the
nightclubs?'' asks Hanley, who finds the idea hilarious. ``No more
going to bed at 9:30.'')
</P>
<P>
   While the endeavor is strictly amateur, the meetings are as
irreverent and as salty as anything out of ``The Front Page.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely changed people's lives,'' says Walter Bender,
director of MIT's News in the Future. ``The technology isn't the
important thing. The thing that's important is that they sit around
every week and argue with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Argue they do. Bob Ross, self-appointed editor of the biography
section, is vexed because some people haven't gotten their copy in
yet. ``I sent out e-mails, in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, saying, `Get
your damn bio in,' '' he says, pointing a finger at one errant
scribe. Ross, whose Southern drawl bespeaks his Georgia roots, is
the unofficial comedian and curmudgeon of the group. He'll be happy
to add a visitor to his e-mail joke list, providing she isn't
offended by off-color gags. ``Look, I'm 75 years old, and I just
bought my fifth computer,'' he says. ``We have grand ideas for this
project. We are dreaming. And it's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also vital. Older citizens have been using the Web since
its inception; the American Association of Retired People Web site
records 500,000 individual user sessions a month. But the Silver
Stringers project is more than just a ``See Grandma e-mail'' or
``See Grandpa check the weather'' story. It's about connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never meant to be a reporter,'' Hanley says, ``but you know
what? Now I wish I could live another 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting, the Silver Stringers engaged in a heated
debate about how to word their on-line holiday greeting. Thomson
was adamant that they not leave anyone out and advocated a secular
message, something like ``Happy Winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can find holiday servings all over the Net. CNN
has a page celebrating Kwanzaa (www.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/kwanzaa/) ;
NORAD is tracking Santa's journey (www.noradsanta.org); and the
Jingle Bellies, as in singing pigs, grunt out seasonal standards
(www.forthnet.gr/astronet/business/jingles/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   But the real news is that the PNC Bank Christmas Price Index _ a
compilation of the price of gifts in the song, ``The Twelve Days of
Christmas'' _ has risen 6.53 percent this year to a grand total of
$14,214. Check out the amusing analysis at
www.pncbank.com/12days/cardindex.html. The price of a partridge
remained flat, but the pear tree rose astronomically.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silliness aside, there is one site that captures the spirit of
the season _ and the communal spirit that the Silver Stringers
embrace. VolunteerMatch.org is an on-line service that links folks
with time to spare with organizations that need assistance. It's
the brainchild of ImpactOnline, a nonprofit organization in Palo
Alto, Calif., that aims to get the virtual community involved in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Say you want to volunteer at a soup kitchen
next week. You go to VolunteerMatch, punch in your Zip code and a
few preferences (how far you can travel, how often you choose to
serve, and so on). The service zaps out a list of volunteer
opportunities, along with contact information; it might hook you up
with the Greater Boston Food Bank or Boston Cares. The cost to you
and the social service agency? Nothing, except a little good will.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was launched in April, it has provided volunteer
opportunities for about 14,000 individuals nationwide. ``People
don't just want to use the Internet to get stock quotes or find out
about the weather,'' says ImpactOnline president Jay Backstrand.
``There's this notion that the technology divides people and keeps
them in their homes. This is a way to change that paradigm.''
Forget the singing pigs: This is the Internet at its best.
</P>
<P>
   And one last thing: Happy winter.

NATIONS STRIVE TO LIMIT FREEDOM OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As promised, the Internet is turning into an
unstoppable geyser of information, a source of data, news and
opinions that flow freely around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Except in China, which blocks access to sites about Tibet,
Taiwan, democratic movements and dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Saudi Arabia, which censors sites critical of the
royal family.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Germany, where a judge sentenced a CompuServe manager
to two years in prison for allowing access to pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Except in Cuba, which has seized laptop computers from
dissidents as ``subversive instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, despite grand promises, the Internet is not yet an
unrestricted electronic village green for the world. The more
information that becomes available, the more governments try to
stanch the flow with new filtering technologies or strict limits on
who can use computers. Democracies as well as dictatorships are
cracking down on sites that are found to be too dangerous, too
lurid, or too controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restrictions are coming fast and furious,'' said Barry
Steinhardt, chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an
advocacy group based in San Francisco, and head of the American
Civil Liberties Union's task force on cyber-liberties. ``The
Internet is very frightening to many governments because it's an
inherently democratic medium, so the first reaction is to reach out
and control it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 countries restrict access to Internet sites, from
Bahrain, which bans electonic versions of Playboy magazine and home
pages that the government says are pornographic, to Singapore,
where the Ministry of Information and the Arts keeps out sexually
explicit material and news critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen other countries are considering restrictions.
The European Union, for example, is weighing proposals to ban child
pornography and xenophobic materials. In Germany, freedom-of-speech
advocates are outraged by a judge's decision in May to sentence the
CompuServe official to jail (the judge suspended the sentence).
</P>
<P>
   The United States, too, is trying to restrict the Internet. A
1996 law, the Communications Decency Act, criminalized on-line
communcations that were ``obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another
person.'' Under that definition, independent counsel Kenneth W.
Starr's report to Congress on President Clinton probably would have
been banned from the Net. The Supreme Court struck down the law,
but another aimed at sites harmful to children is supposed to take
effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of civil liberties groups _ such as Global
Internet Liberty Campaign, Digital Freedom Network, Internet
Freedom, OpenNet, and Britain's Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties _
vehemently oppose restrictions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But many specialists argue that the issue is more complex.
Shouldn't Germany have the right to restrict false and provocative
Nazi propaganda? Shouldn't American states have the right to stop
electronic dissemination of step-by-step instructions on assembling
a car bomb? And why should any government allow child pornography
to proliferate?
</P>
<P>
   ``In all countries, you will find people who argue that certain
things should not be available to other people,'' said David
Webster, chairman of the Transatlantic Dialogue on Broadcasting and
the Information Society, a group that includes private industry and
government. ``No politician gets up and says: `I think the
availability of pedophilia material is concomitant to liberty.'
He'll lose his seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The impulse to restrict access has been highlighted this month
in China, where the government is holding its first trial of a
``cyber-dissident.'' Lin Hai, a 30-year-old software engineer, is
charged with inciting subversion by providing 30,000 Chinese e-mail
addresses to a dissident group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Lin, who says he is innocent, faces a maximum penalty of life in
prison. Lawyers who follow China's one-sided judicial system say he
is likely to be convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, a physicist named Wang Youcai, who registered an
independent political party, was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
His crime: communicating with democracy activists inside and
outside of China. As President Jiang Zemin cracks down on dissent,
other cyber-sedition trials are likely in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Less dramatic but just as important, China's day-to-day
censorship of the Internet affects scores of groups. The
International Campaign for Tibet, for instance, often receives
reports that the Chinese government has blocked access to its web
site, said communications director Teresa Perrone. But she added
that enterprising scholars in China often find ways to circumvent
the censors and look at the group's information.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups report that when the government blocks sites, the
information still reaches Chinese via e-mail, bulletin boards, chat
rooms, web sites with code words that filters cannot detect and a
variety of creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``China may be the extreme case because they attempted to up a
pretty impervious wall around the Internet,'' said Adam Clayton
Powell III, vice president of the Freedom Forum, which advocates
unrestricted media. ``However, because China wants to be a world
economic power they need high-speed, real-time, financial
information.'' Financial reports from services such as Dow Jones or
Reuters often contain political news.
</P>
<P>
   For every new restriction on the Net, there are new ways to get
around it, said Vint Cerf, senior vice president for Internet
architecture and technology at MCI-Worldcom. ``It just isn't
possible,'' to keep things away from Net viewers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jonathan Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, said improved
technology will make it easier to keep track of who is looking at
the Net and to restrict what is seen. ``China has fairly crude
tools for filtering, but my prediction is the Internet of 2000 is
one that China will have less difficulty in regulating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries that have sampled the Internet have found it
distasteful. Last year, Vietnam decided to allow the public to use
Internet services. But 10 days ago, the Communist Party decided to
set up a committee to consider restrictions as a way of
``correcting mistakes and bias,'' the Liberated Saigon newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stronger the central government, the more conservative
they are in terms of allowing political information on the
Internet,'' said Grey Burkhart, a retired communications expert
from the Navy reserve who helps international groups get access to
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart has taken a special interest in developing countries,
including Russia, Bosnia, and Syria. It isn't easy. Despite the
government's pledges to open Syria, the country still has no
Internet service provider. To access the Internet, computer users
have to make long-distance calls to Lebanon and other countries.
Syrians aren't allowed to have cellular telephones, which are
considered a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Syria allowed computer modems to be
installed and an Internet service is promised.
</P>
<P>
   The most restrictive countries, including Iraq, North Korea and
Cuba, are those that control all forms of media, not just the
Internet. In Havana's airport, several laptops carried in by
passengers and intended for dissident groups have been seized in
the last couple of years, said Frank Calzon, executive director of
the Center for a Free Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Police even took a $150 electronic typewriter from a dissident
becaue it was ``an instrument of high-tech subversion,'' Calzon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Latin America, which has a tradition of
censorship, has been quite open to the Internet. Pedro Armendariz,
the director of Investigative Editors and Reporters in Mexico, a
non-profit group, has traveled to conferences in Brazil, Argentina,
Colombia, Peru and throughout Mexico. Outside of Cuba, he has found
no restrictions on the Net, other than the expense of service and
unreliable telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would dare to say that far from having serious restrictions
in Latin America, we have a problem with sorting through so many
things on the Net and discriminating about what is useful and what
is garbage,'' Armendariz said.

SOONER THAN EXPECTED, OUTZEN'S TIME HAS COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ He's 20. He's excited, not nervous. That, says
Marcus Outzen, doesn't happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good, doesn't it? Makes for a good story line, too.
Inexperienced sophomore quarterback comes off the bench in the
middle of the season and leads his team to the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fairy tales, of course, can come true, which is what Marcus
Outzen feels will happen Monday night when Florida State meets
Tennessee for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The original script, drawn up at the start of the season, had
Outzen, a 6-foot-2-inch, 220-pounder whose main duties included
running the scout team offense, sitting, watching, learning, and
ultimately waiting while Chris Weinke, a 26-year-old sophomore ran
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is at schools like Florida State. ``I was a
sophomore and I was going to sit and learn and wait my chance.
Everybody comes here thinking they can play, but not everyone can
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not right away. So Outzen, who came out of the same
high school, Fort Walton Beach (Fla.), that produced University of
Florida Heisman winner Danny Wuerffel, came to FSU knowing he would
have to wait his chance.
</P>
<P>
   But even Outzen, who grew up rooting for the Seminoles, began to
wonder following what has become almost an obligatory freshman
redshirt year at FSU, when he saw not only Weinke, but Dan Kendra
ahead of him on the depth chart, both with a couple of years of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was discouraged, but I never really considered transferring
out of here,'' said Outzen. ``I always wanted to be a Seminole.''
</P>
<P>
   Until midway through the Virginia game Nov. 7, Outzen was a
Seminole-in-waiting, playing only sporadically in mop-up duty
behind Weinke, who was quickly turning into an All-America type.
</P>
<P>
   Then Weinke went down with a neck injury that went from minor to
major when a burner eventually required season-ending, if not
career-threatening surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was Outzen's team in a very real sense. ``I've
always had confidence in myself,'' he said. ``I was never one to
get real nervous about things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State coaching staff was. Weinke was untested when
he was handed the job following an injury that ended Kendra's
season before it started, and then Outzen had to follow Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen led the Seminoles past Virginia in relief and then to
wins over Wake Forest and archrival Florida as the starter. It
wasn't Heisman stuff, but it wasn't throw-up-your-hands-in-dismay
stuff either. He did his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a blue-collar worker,'' said Seminoles coach Bobby
Bowden. ``Do you remember (Billy) Kilmer? Who was that quarterback
at California . . . (Joe) Kapp? He's that kind of quarterback. His
ball wobbles. It flutters, but it gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   Outzen, only three games into a career that might return to
backup status next season if Weinke recovers, still has not picked
up all the nuances of playing for FSU. Like Weinke first did, he
sometimes throws the ball before he has to and makes some bad
decisions based on inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Already he's getting advice from teammates such as tailback
Travis Minor, who has warned him to slide if he takes off on a run.
``He was looking at everybody like, `Slide? I don't even know how
to slide,' '' said Minor, who said it was an indication of Outzen's
personality, which is to take everything head on.
</P>
<P>
   For any quarterback, that can be dangerous. But with one game
remaining in a season that has surprisingly turned into another
championship run for the Seminoles, who seemed to have
self-destructed with a September loss to North Carolina State, why
not take gambles?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll find a way to get the job done,'' said offensive guard
Jason Whitaker. ``When he was in high school he found a way to win
and he can do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can. Maybe this was all scripted from the start and
Marcus Outzen shouldn't really be nervous about playing the No. 1
team in the country on national television for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Outzen with a smile, shaking the red crew cut
that has earned him the nickname ``Rooster'', ``is the most
exciting thing I could be involved in as a 20-year-old.''

UNION, NEW BALANCE STRUGGLE TOWARD FIRST CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A union negotiating its first labor contract with New Balance
Athletic Shoe Inc. is questioning the Boston-based sneaker
company's vaunted commitment to US workers, arguing that New
Balance has increasingly turned to low-wage Chinese factories and
US temporary workers to make its shoes.
</P>
<P>
   New Balance has vigorously denied union charges that some of the
company's shoes were made in sweatshop factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, New Balance has portrayed itself as a
David that employs US workers to take on such sneaker Goliaths as
Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd., which routinely have their
shoes made at overseas factories with cheaper labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the charges by the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial, and Textile Employees, or Unite, that many New Balance
shoes are made in China by underpaid workers would seem to be a
direct attack on New Balance's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Giant Nike spends millions on superstar endorsements from the
likes of Michael Jordan. But to sell its shoes, New Balance has
appealed to US consumers partly on patriotic grounds, with a
red-white-and-blue sales pitch that sometimes talks up its
commitment to the American worker.
</P>
<P>
   New Balance says its commitment to American workers is
undiminished. As demand for its shoes has surged, production is up
both at its US facilities and at overseas factories, a company
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Unite insists that the timing of its so-called
``expose'' of New Balance's ``exploitation'' of Chinese workers is
not an attempt to embarrass the company and win concessions at the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   In using Chinese factories, including one with a history of
``sweatshop conditions,'' New Balance is no different from many
other US athletic footwear companies, according to Unite.
</P>
<P>
   A union representing 250,000 workers in the United States and
Canada, Unite won the right to represent about 70 workers at a New
Balance distribution center in Lawrence last spring and is now
negotiating its first contract with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Unite is the first union ever to represent New Balance workers,
the company said. All told, New Balance said it employs 1,600
full-time workers, most of them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unite contends that New Balance is trying to enjoy the best of
both worlds, marketing itself as committed to US workers at the
same time that it's exploiting cheap labor overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to present themselves as the good-guy alternative,
but they're just like Nike,'' said Unite spokeswoman Judy
Marblestone.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Nike and New Balance shoes were made at the same
Chinese factory where workers were sometimes paid as little as 19
cents an hour, Marblestone said. ``New Balance has a responsibility
to these workers.''
</P>
<P>
   New Balance spokeswoman Katherine Shepard denied there had been
any exploitation. Not only does New Balance use a consulting firm
to ensure that overseas production complies with all human rights
standards, Shepard said, but New Balance's US shoe production is up
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   With five US factories, New Balance says it is the only major
athletic footwear company to make shoes in the United States,
though it often augments production by contracting work out to both
domestic and overseas shoe factories. Many of the New Balance shoes
made overseas are also sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For most sneaker companies, 1998 has been a wretched year. Only
Adidas and New Balance have escaped the nearly industrywide
doldrums caused by a weakening in demand, a shift in fashion
preferences, and the pro basketball lockout.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many of its rivals, New Balance has enjoyed
double-digit growth for the last few years, Shepard said. Projected
sales for 1998 are $630 million, up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand, she said, has outstripped New Balance's US capacity to
make shoes. At three Maine factories, 1998 production was up 15
percent, precisely in line with sales growth, she noted. But just
increasing domestic production was not enough; to meet demand, New
Balance also had to contract more work out to overseas factories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New Balance has made its commitment to US workers a
big part of its marketing campaign, and it vigorously fought the
Federal Trade Commission, which objected to New Balance's use of
the phrase, ``Made in the USA,'' in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   While a global economy has made it increasingly difficult for US
manufacturers to assemble their products entirely with US-made
components, New Balance agreed to reword some ads, though it
continues to highlight its commitment to American workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's this commitment that Unite is challenging. According to the
union's analysis of trade figures, New Balance's imports from China
were up 36 percent for the first nine months of 1998, when compared
with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Unite did a spot check of retail stores this fall, 66 of
the 119 New Balance shoes sampled were made entirely in China,
Marblestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said she couldn't comment on Unite's charges but said
that production has been up from all sources, domestic and foreign.
</P>
<P>
   A small percentage of New Balance shoes are made entirely in the
United States, and some are made entirely in China. Many shoes are
made in the United States, using some Chinese materials. In those
cases, the company has said previously that 70 percent of the
shoe's value in dollars and labor have come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unite and the Massachusetts AFL-CIO said that they staged a
protest in Boston the weekend before Christmas near a Foot Locker
store, one of the industry's most important retail customers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Foot Locker protest, Kathleen Casavant,
secretary-treasurer of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, said in a
statement: ``It's shameful that New Balance, a company right here
in our back yard, is profiting on the backs of workers suffering
sweatshop conditions in China and low-wage, no-benefit temporary
workers in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiators for Unite and New Balance are still
trying to iron out such contract issues as the use of temporary
workers in the Lawrence distribution center.
</P>
<P>
   The center opened 18 months ago, and New Balance is still trying
to gauge the appropriate size for the full-time work force, Shepard
said. Until that can be resolved, New Balance is likely to use
temporary workers off and on.
</P>
<P>
   Marblestone insisted there was no connection between Unite's
negotiations and its sweatshop protest. Unite has staged similar
protests against such retailers as Guess? Inc. and May Department
Stores Co., she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the timing of the New Balance protest, she said Unite
waited until the holidays because that's the time of year shoppers
are out and most likely to notice a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about the decent treatment of workers,'' said
Marblestone, who added that job security is another key issue in
the contract negotiations between Unite and New Balance.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the same artists are involved, this sequel to
``Babe'' loses its way in the big city, turning the noble piglet
into little more than a supporting player.1 hour, 36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' PG (mild sexual talk)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor's movie brings out all the weaknesses and
few of the strengths of Brian Friel's prize-winning play about five
unmarried sisters living in rural Ireland in the summer of 1936.
However, whatever's worth having in this movie belongs to star
Meryl Streep, who shines as the uptight, controlling oldest sister.
1 hour, 34 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight.1
hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated, but contains sexual themes and
brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center. 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll Be Home for Christmas'' PG (profanity, rude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a college kid who has to hitch his
way home to New York in time for Christmas Eve. If he's late, he'll
lose the Porsche his dad has promised. This Disney comedy has some
clever moments as Thomas, a scam artist, has to learn the meaning
of family. But it aims too often for the far-fetched. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. We're not making this
up. The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of
those stale Hollywood sermons about taking time out for your kids.
It's less substantial than a snowball in July. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
D
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer: Ringmaster'' R (profanity, sex, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   If you like ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' you'll probably
appreciate this rude and crude look at putting on an outrageous
daytime talk show _ here dubbed ``The Jerry Show.'' Follow two
groups _ including a mother and daughter sleeping with the same man
_ as they angle to get on ``Jerry,'' then sit back and watch the
fights break out. 1 hour, 50 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film, alas, is a
fairly feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse on stage. See it for her; check out the concession stand
in-between her numbers. 1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' PG-13 (profanity, sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Clair Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest's ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a
Holiday'' wastes a good cast, led by Anthony Hopkins. It's more
interested in corporate politics than the romance between Clair
Forlani and Brad Pitt, playing a puppyish Grim Reaper. 2 hours, 54
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential. 1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' R (violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock classic. It's very
well made and acted, with a terrific performance by Vince Vaughn as
Norman Bates. But it's an odd cinematic experiment that never seems
to know exactly what it intended to prove. 1 hour, 38 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie''G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing.2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' R (violence, profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche.1 hour, 50 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but simple. It's a
character-driven black comedy with some powerful moral-qualm
undercurrents. In the deep snows of rural Minnesota, two brothers
(Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a
downed plane with $4 million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to
split the money leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events.
1 hour, 57 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew saves an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal its juju. The movie is full of jokes
and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed for
Trekkers who need an update on their intergalactic family album. 1
hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 26 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug Hamilton
write for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

IN SEARCH OF SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARRABASSETT VALLEY, Maine _ We spot the first snow on the
ground north of Waterville, sparse little patches of crusty white
on the brown farm fields. But at least it is cold now so that
skaters on the ponds offer some proof that winter has finally
arrived in the north country.
</P>
<P>
   As we gain elevation driving from Kingfield to the base of
Sugarloaf, the snow is thicker off the roadsides but still not
abundant enough to lend any whiteness to the dark pine woods on one
side nor the rock-strewn riverbed on the other. Even the
Carrabassett itself is low, a dry trickle in this dry northern
winter.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with sinking expectations that we make the familiar
swing around the Oh-My-God corner for our first view of Sugarloaf
this year, its dark pyramidal bulk streaked with the white lines of
ski trails.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, white! Amazing as it seems, there is a ski mountain up
there.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about the reporting of ski conditions and the
trustworthiness of using adjectives. ``Skiing's great. Skiing's
lousy. Skiing's OK.'' What does it all mean? One person's ``good''
is another person's ``wretched,'' and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of describing ski conditions with summary
adjectives was dropped by the ski areas after a lawsuit some 20
years ago ruled that a skier was misled by the term ``excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the reader/skier who's wondering what kind of skiing
really awaits as we head into the final weekend of the vacation
week, here is as non-summary strewn a description as we can
conjure. This was the skiing Tuesday, before any snowfall that has
been predicted for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the roads here are so bare that pedestrians around
the village have to actually watch out for cars. A bad sign. Normal
winter in a ski town the roads are so packed with ice the cars must
creep through the deep ruts and holes that pitch them up and down
like rocking boats.
</P>
<P>
   But now the roads are bare and dusty, what ice there was having
been washed away by last week's rain, leaving only the ash residue
used to aid traction. And it is with another sinking feeling that
we walk across the bare fields from the condo to the chairlift,
strung for half a mile from the base of the mountain down to the
condo cluster we are staying in.
</P>
<P>
   From chairlift height we see the real condition of this stingy,
constipated winter. The chairlift tract is a jumble of rocks and
stumps with just enough snow teasing it to make the scene really
ugly. Off to the left, several closed trails have the same teased
effect _ just enough snow to put a white tinge on the stubble and
rock. As if they are needed, ropes are strung across the trail
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   As the lift closes over the landing we slide off on snow _ real
snow, white, deep, and packed! Amazing!
</P>
<P>
   Even more amazing is the first run. It is 8:35 a.m. and Tote
Road winds out in front of us with groomed snow from side to side.
At this hour we have the trail pretty much to ourselves and as we
gain conidence that we are not going to ski off the edge of the
earth, we pick up speed. Every switchback turn, every rill and
drop, and the three faces on this 2 1/2-mile run are packed and
groomed. The snow is not deep underfoot, but the carving is easy
all the way down, and we finish the run with a fast runout back to
the quad.
</P>
<P>
   Next trail: Narrow Gauge, a classic cruiser, somewhat steeper
than Tote Road and with a steep headwall that skiers like to use to
launch themselves up to full speed. We hold back a bit over the
top, expecting ice, rocks _ whatever unfriendly things are usually
buried in snow. Except for one extremely steep face down a
whaleback where few windblown rocks appeared (in plenty of time to
avoid) the Gauge was covered with snow.
</P>
<P>
   With confidence buying a bit of speed now, we launched down the
headwall. Snow still! All the way onto the flatter runout to the
lift. It was as good a run as we have had on the Gauge, one of
Sugarloaf's bread and butter trails.
</P>
<P>
   Now, truth to tell, with 35 of over 100 trails open, the crowds
did gang up on the lower quad (one 15-minute wait was the longest
of the day; the rest were under 10) and on some of the trails. Tote
Road became a bit zooey by mid-morning, and the Gauge was busy, but
not claustrophobically so.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Ramdown and Widowmaker were busy at times,
and the cover began to get skied down everywhere by midday. But
then, a fortuitous combination of diminishing crowd and warming
temperatures made the afternoon skiing a delight on most of the
open acreage.
</P>
<P>
   We are not here to kid you. At this writing ski country is in a
serious snow drought. Small southern areas without snowmaking are
hurting desperately. But snowmaking areas in the northern states
and the Berkshires have been cranking the snowguns for an unbroken
two weeks now, and you do not have to be some diehard nut case to
find plenty of skiing pleasure on the slopes at this very moment.
</P>
<P>
   Is it ideal? Hell no. And perfection in the form of a few
foot-deep dumps is undoubtedly on the way. But, as is the case at
Sugarloaf, and all the major resorts where snow production is the
primary focus, the skiing is surprisingly good.

SPILLS AND CHILLS IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The big skiing and snowboarding stories kept coming all year,
from a righteous boycott of the Olympic establishment by a
super-athlete, to a misguided righteousness that led to big-time
crime in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   _JANUARY _ The year started with the untimely and wholly
unnecessary death of Michael Kennedy who, as he played a game of
pass football on Aspen Mountain with family members, skied into a
tree, dying instantly from head injuries. Weeks later, when Sonny
Bono died in a similar collision with a tree, the age of safety
helmets was given a huge boost that is obvious on the slopes today.
</P>
<P>
   _JANUARY _ The great ice storm of '98 may have been a nuisance
around the Boston area, but it was absolutely paralyzing in the
north country, ruinous to trees, farmland, and buildings, and it
took the electric power grid down for over a month in some areas.
It was a momentous storm, with exactly the right mix of moisture
and temperature to maintain a prolonged icing that built an
ever-thicker coating for at least eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Life was disrupted in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, but no
industry was harder hit than skiing. The ice storm came after a
meltdown period, so that some ski areas were out of business for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by the storm was the state of Maine, which regards
as heroes the legions of electric power workers from all over the
country who converged on the Pine Tree State and worked until
spring getting the power grid put back together.
</P>
<P>
   _JANUARY _ As snowboarding was making its debut in full medal
Olympic competition, Norwegian Terry Haakenson, considered by most
observers to be the best halfpipe rider in the world, announced his
boycott of the Nagano Games, largely, he said, because the
International Ski Federation and the Olympic organizers were trying
to use snowboarding to market the Games to a younger generation.
Meanwhile, said Haakenson, Olympic officials are corrupt, old men
entrenched in their jobs who live a life of luxury off the efforts
of athletes who are forced to live in Spartan quasi-military
conditions. Haakenson followed through on his threat and never
showed up at the Games, and his charges, that once seemed
exaggerated, have gained credence with recent revelations of
corruption at the highest levels of Olympic management.
</P>
<P>
   _FEBRUARY _ Those who had been at the Alpine World Championships
in Nagano in 1996 warned of extremely fickle weather in the
mountain ski venues, weather that could switch from wintry blizzard
conditions to warm monsoon rains and back again within a matter of
hours. Sure enough, Olympice ski racers encountered weather that
switched from wintry blizzards to warm monsoon rains within hours.
It was clear that the Olympic site slection committee had again
rolled the dice with Nagano, and just made it under the wire. By
the Games' end, all five make-up days built into the schedule had
been used.
</P>
<P>
   _FEBRUARY _ Picabo Street finally stood on the highest step of
an Olympic medal platform as, following a training crash and
concussion a week before the Games, she won the Super-G, fulfilling
her promise as the hottest female speed skier in the history of the
US Ski team. That career all but ended a month later when Street
suffered a high-speed crash in the last World Cup downhill, with
knee injuries so severe she was forced to take off this year from
racing. Street said she likely will not ski speed events again,
though she is still considering trying to make the technical team
so she can race when the Olympics come to the US in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   _FEBRUARY _ Even as Alberto Tomba, the most famous ski racer of
all time, wound up his Olympic career with an inglorious fall in
the slalom, a new boffo, larger-than-life ski racer was coming on.
Austrian Hermann Maier may have been the fastest downhiller in the
world, but it was his famous flight and agony-of-defeat
crash-landing for which he will be best remembered in Nagano. Maier
hit a badly banked lefthander going way too fast, flew sideways off
the hill, and landed in a snow fence 300 yards down the course.
Said the former bricklayer with a grin: ``It wasn't Lufthansa, but
it wasn't bad.'' Maier went on to take gold in the Super-G.
</P>
<P>
   _OCTOBER _ Vail will recover from the $12-million arson fire
that wiped out several buildings, including a large summit
restaurant, but the environmental movement was dealt a lasting
blow. As the damage to buildings and lifts was being assessed, a
group calling itself Earth Liberation Front (ELF) claimed
responsibility for the fires, which they set in protest of an
880-acre expansion plan into the wilderness designated as lynx
habitat. Though no lynxes have been spotted in the area for 25
years, ELF said in its note: ``Putting profits ahead of Colorado's
wildlife will not be tolerated. This action is just a warning.''
</P>
<P>
   With the World Alpine Championships at Vail just a month away,
officials have stepped up security, importing police from the
overseas countries represented by competing ski racers. Regular
patrols will be on duty to make sure ELF doesn't make good on its
threat before an international audience.
</P>
<P>
   _OCTOBER-DECEMBER _ With plans to move on to the more lucrative
world of pro ski racing, Tommy Moe, the 1994 Olympic downhill
champion, announced his retirement on the heels of teammate AJ
Kitt. Weeks later, the third US downhill veteran, Kyle Rassmussen,
also retired after years of complaining about life on the road away
from his young family.
</P>
<P>
   The plot thickens. Kitt and Moe formed a team to compete in the
pro Ford Downhill Tour, but in training last week, Kitt broke his
wrist in a high-speed crash, and is out for the season, leaving Moe
partnerless on the eve of the first race at Aspen. Moe then called
Rassmussen, who hasn't been on skis all year, and who threw some
belongings together and made it from California to Aspen the night
before the race.
</P>
<P>
   Beating veteran Olympic champions such as Leonard Stock and
Peter Wirnsberger from Austria, Luc Alphand from France, Conrad
Cathomen of Switzerland and Felix Belczyk of Canada, Rassmussen won
the Aspen race last Sunday with an average speed of 78-plus miles
per hour, 1.4 mph faster than Alphand and Wirnsberger. Moe placed
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   _OCTOBER-DECEMBER _ The tears flowed freely in Italy when
favorite son Alberto Tomba announced his retirement. After 50 World
Cup wins (second only to Ingemar Stenmark with 86) and five Olympic
medals in three games, Tomba, 33, decided to hang up his skis. The
impact on the World Cup scene is severe, according to marketers at
recent races at Alta Badia and Siestre, Italy. On days when Tomba
used to race, 15,000 boisterous, bell-banging, flag-waving fans
would turn out to cheer La Bomba, often to victory. Now, alas, the
last two Italian World Cups drew a scant 1,000 fans, even though
Italy fielded two strong skiers. To a lesser extent, said World Cup
observers, Tomba's absence is being felt at venues throughout
Europe.

A WALK IN THE SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Jan. 5)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we trudged across the flat, wide expanse of Squaw Valley via
snowshoes, I grumbled to my companions that we were working harder
at having fun than anyone else in the valley, except for maybe the
hiker we passed who was carrying his dog. The dog had apparently
pooped out and was ready to hit the lodge and take a nap. We were
starting to feel like the dog on this first venture on snowshoes.
</P>
<P>
   To us it felt like hiking with ankle weights and wet jeans,
particularly going uphill, which is where we unwisely began our
experiment. Actually we didn't go straight up a hill, we snowshoed
straight to the bottom of a hill through a parking lot. Then we
were so hungry we decided to eat half a sandwich each and then went
up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   In our group there were three who normally prefer skiing _ one
downhill, one cross-country, one who will do both.
</P>
<P>
   We all are fairly fit. We were ready to try something that is
supposed to be the newest thing in the snow. But we were whipped by
the first hour. The downhiller begged to take off her shoes and go
stand in line for hot drinks. I was remembering that the first time
I tried cross country skiing I also whined, and so I insisted we
push on.
</P>
<P>
   That's when we hit the flat part of Squaw Valley, which might
have been a good starting place but we'd given our all on the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to it, they had told us at the rental counter.
``Just walk,'' said the rental clerk who pointed out the door.
</P>
<P>
   They have this mantra, the snowshoe people, which you read in
every magazine story and advertisement about the sport. It is, ``If
you can walk, you can snowshoe.''
</P>
<P>
   They're right, but it's not a graceful walk. It's a hampered
walk, more lurch and drag, at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk rented us boots to go with the snowshoes. I've since
learned that it's better, even advisable, to use your own hiking
boots. They're broken in, they're comfortable and as long as
they're waterproof they'll work just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The boots we rented were the same that snowboarders use _ fat,
wide shoes that give you cartoon feet. So maybe we were having as
much a problem adjusting to them as to the snowshoes underneath.
</P>
<P>
   We decided the hardest part of the sport, after the energy
expenditure, is bending down to put the snowshoes back on after
they slip off the boots.
</P>
<P>
   That is not supposed to happen, I have since been told.
</P>
<P>
   All grumbling aside, the best part of being on snowshoes is that
you take yourself right into the middle of a Christmas card picture
and are virtually alone. There is no great gang of snowshoers
breathing down your neck. If you want, it can be just you and the
snow, the waterfall, the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The guy at the rental center said ``purists don't use ski
poles'' so we didn't ask for them, but not being purists we
actually could have used them. I've since read that ski poles can
help you scoot uphill and save the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to cross country skis, it's easier to get uphill on
snowshoes _ you feel a little like Spiderwoman - but it's not as
much fun coming downhill. Nordic ski centers and ski resorts across
the country are all starting to offer snowshoeing as a sideline.
Most ski rental places in the Lake Tahoe area rent snowshoes and
encourage them as an inexpensive alternative to skiing, a good
aerobic workout and something to do when the snow isn't good enough
for skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The December snow at Tahoe, so far, has been good for both, but
Victoria Crummy at Dave's Rentals in Tahoe City said snowshoes work
in almost any snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have conditions that aren't conducive to skiing you
can snowshoe. And you can go anywhere.'' She started to say the
thing about ``If you can walk...'' but added that ``you do have to
take a little bit wider step than regular walking.''
</P>
<P>
   She, like most, say you don't need lessons, although there are
places like the Royal Gorge area at Donner Summit that advertise
guides, and presumably, with that, a little guidance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a workout. Melanie Griffith reportedly boasts that she
lifted her butt by three inches taking a daily snowshoe running up
Aspen Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A writer for Health Magazine figured if you snowshoe a 20 minute
per mile pace on packed snow you burn about 510 calories an hour.
If it's loose snow you burn twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   People who live in the mountains and can't bear to give up
jogging for the winter naturally take to snowshoes and there is now
a special jogging snowshoe that is smaller and narrower than the
regular ones.
</P>
<P>
   The snowshoe frame is made out of lightweight space-age metals
and plastics. The bindings which hold the boot are made of rubber,
plastic or synthetic fabric. Underneath the shoe are crampons, the
steel teeth that bite into snow and ice for traction. Most
snowshoes are about a foot and half long, 6 to 8 inches across. The
shoes don't look like they have a right and left, but technically
the binding buckle is usually on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of snowshoes is you can pick a spot and walk off,
although Royal Gorge allows snowshoers to use their cross country
ski trails as long as you stay off the groomed part.
</P>
<P>
   Other Tahoe rental places, like Dave's which has four locations
renting snowshoes, will provide lists of good snowshoes sites like
state park land.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of common sense is advised as cross country. Bring
a map, compass, sunglasses, flashlight, and matches. Also an energy
bar and water bottle. So far there is no dress requirement for
snowshoes. Layers like you use in cross country skiing will work,
including long underwear, tops and bottoms in a polypropylene or
polyester synthetic, wool or synthetic blend pants with waterproof
nylon overshell; warm shirt or fleece with sweater and windproof
nylon shell; polypropylene sock liners under wool socks; waterproof
boots; waterproof gaiters over the boots; wool or fleece cap and
face mask, and wool or fleece gloves with overmitts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people just wear layers on top and jeans with gaiters,''
said Crummy.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who is an avid downhiller said he can't imagine why
anyone would want to snowshoe unless you lived in the mountains and
needed a way to get from your house to the garage.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be the way of all trends. You go through an awkward
period and gripe and then you either mush off or keep trying it
until you flaunt it.
</P>
<P>
   We're thinking of trying it again.

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE; 1998 WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't believe anyone who says 1998 wasn't a corking-good year at
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics l-o-o-o-ve to carp about subpar films and crushed
expectations and directors or actors or studios on the verge of
precipitous slides.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there were great films and there were bad ones, and
there were pundits poised to comment on each and every one. And, as
usual, the year drew to a close with dour talk of slim pickings at
Oscar time.
</P>
<P>
   A weak field of pictures, they say. Too many bombs. Too few
standouts. Too much money blown on big-studio dross.
</P>
<P>
   Phooey. Balderdash. Cow manure. Bunk.
</P>
<P>
   So rich was the recent movie year that coming up with the
obligatory 10 Best List was an absolute snap. It took five minutes,
tops.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was choosing a mere 10; on reflection there
were half a dozen others that deserved a berth.
</P>
<P>
   And that's taking into account the delayed Albany market, which
won't see a handful of Oscar-caliber, end-of-'98 releases until a
month or so into '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters,'' ``A Civil Action,'' ``The Thin Red
Line,'' ``Affliction,'' ``Central Station,'' ``Waking Ned Devine''
_ all are drumming major Academy buzz, and none have yet opened
anywhere near my hometown. We're patient souls, we Northern
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it's been a most rewarding spell at the cineplex.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice year for Elizabethan drama (``Elizabeth,''
``Shakespeare in Love,''), for World War II films (``Saving Private
Ryan,'' ``Life is Beautiful,'' the coming ``Thin Red Line''), for
political satire (``Bulworth,'' ``Primary Colors''), for
traditional animation (``The Prince of Egypt,'' ``Mulan''), for
computer-bug animation (``A Bug's Life,'' ``Antz'') _ and for the
Fiennes brothers, Joseph and Ralph, who lent their talents to no
fewer than three of the top-10 films listed below. They are:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN'': ``Ryan'' was the big-wow movie of
the year, a masterfully ghastly World War II film that opened with
a graphic 25-minute D-Day sequence of unforgettable power and gore.
Steven Spielberg's hyper-realistic direction, paired with a
transparent performance by Tom Hanks, made this the movie of the
moment, of the summer and of the year.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL'': Another World War II film, this one _
directed by and starring beloved Italian comic Roberto Benigni _
managed to find bittersweet comedy in the Holocaust. Benigni played
a Jewish bookseller, trapped in a concentration camp, who shields
his young son from Nazi horrors by turning them into an elaborate
game. The result was a profoundly touching ode to parental love.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``THE TRUMAN SHOW'': The evils of television have rarely been
so cunningly detailed; not since ``Network'' has a film so
brilliantly plumbed the Machiavellian depths of the boob tube. Jim
Carrey turned in a subtle, un-Carrey-esque performance as Truman
Burbank, a young man who slowly realizes that his home is a sound
stage and that his life is literally a soap opera. Peter Weir's
masterpiece also gave us the year's most surreal image: Carrey
climbing, Magritte-like, along a wall of painted clouds.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``A BUG'S LIFE'': ``Bug'' wasn't just the best
computer-animated arthropod movie of the year (forget ``Antz'') _
it was one of the best, giddiest animated movies ever. An insect
spin on ``The Magnificent Seven,'' this irresistible Disney-Pixar
production gave us eccentric multilegged characters voiced by a
whip-smart cast (Kevin Spacey, Dave Foley, Denis Leary, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus). Hilarious and perfect.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``ELIZABETH'': This revisionist-feminist take on England's
Virgin Queen was also a vicious, gripping thriller. Indian director
Shekhar Kapur's English-language debut featured a breathtaking Cate
Blanchett as Elizabeth, a smouldering Joseph Fiennes as her lover
and a crackling Geoffrey Rush as her politically savvy, morally
skewed advisor. It exploded every prejudice we ever had against
period films.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND'': Though it was released so
long ago (back in March) that it doesn't feel like a '98 release,
Richard Kwietniowski's compassionate, quietly funny look at a
stuffy Englishman's (John Hurt) mad crush on an American teen idol
(Jason Priestly) was one of the year's sweetest pleasures. Hurt was
devastating as the obsessed Giles De'Ath (pronounced ``Day-Ath'');
Priestly was good and cool. The result was Thomas Mann's ``Death in
Venice,'' transformed by American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT'': Whodathunkit: a sophisticated,
adult-oriented, biblically themed animated musical featuring
neither upbeat anthems nor cutie-pie anthropomorphic sidekicks. And
who would have guessed that DreamWorks' superlative take on the
life of Moses, deliverer of Israel, would be such a deeply touching
film? Val Kilmer voiced Moses; Ralph Fiennes voiced the Pharaoh
Rameses; the rest of us voiced amazement.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'': The year's other insanely watchable
Elizabethan film also featuring Joseph Fiennes (again in
heaving-chest mode), also boasting Geoffrey Rush in a vivid
supporting role. But where ``Elizabeth'' shows the grim, gruesome
side of the 16th century, John Madden's ``Shakespeare in Love''
incorporates lyrical eroticism with bursts of wacky lightness.
You've never seen a drama _ or a comedy _ like this before.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``BULWORTH'': Warren Beatty's outrageous rap-riff on the
moral bankruptcy of modern politics didn't do too well at the box
office, but so what. It's a shocking bit of filmmaking, this tale
of a suicidal Congressman (Beatty) who hires a hit-man to do him
in, then adorns hip-hop clothing and raps his way to prominence. Go
figure.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``MEN WITH GUNS'': John Sayles' hard, unwavering study of
South American terrorism was a rough piece of celluloid, made with
(mostly) unknowns and scripted in numerous tongues. ``Saving
Private Ryan'' notwithstanding, it contained some of the most
harrowing footage released in '98 and it concluded, against all
hope, with a nod toward redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a few Honorable Mentions: ``Beloved,'' for Oprah
Winfrey's tragic plainness and Jonathan Demme's metaphoric
direction; ``Out of Sight,'' for George Clooney's star turn
(finally) and Steven Soderbergh's bemused direction; ``Mulan,'' for
Disney's David Lean-inspired animation and girl-power message;
``The Spanish Prisoner,'' for the Rubik's Cube in David Mamet's
brain; ``One True Thing,'' for Meryl Streep's spectacularly gauged
performance as a woman dying of cancer; ``Primary Colors,'' for
John Travolta's unnerving impersonation of Bill Clinton; and
``Touch of Evil'' and ``The Wizard of Oz,'' for bringing back the
joys of movies past.
</P>
<P>
   Good year? Nah, it wasn't a good year. It was great.

HIDDEN AMONG THE CHEESY BLOCKBUSTERS WERE SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Put ``Stepmom'' and ``Patch Adams'' out of your mind. Because if
you do, you'll find it's been a better year for movies than you
might expect.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred to me as I sat in on a TV panel discussion where a
man railed about the standard issues. ``Hollywood is bankrupt of
ideas,'' he said, confident that no one had ever thought to utter
such a remark.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that two of the most idiosyncratic and distinctive
movies of 1998 _ ``Home Fries'' and ``Rushmore'' _ came out of the
studio system, I had to agree to disagree. (''Rushmore'' is even
from the studio that released ``Armageddon.'' ) And that's not even
mentioning the best picture of the year, ``Out of Sight,'' the
silky and entertaining adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel,
which showed that the glimmer of talent George Clooney displayed in
Robert Rodriguez's ``From Dust Till Dawn'' wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sight,'' Clooney gave a grown-up movie star performance. Of
course, there was the added enticement of Scott Frank's script and
Steven Soderbergh's purposeful direction _ not to mention Jennifer
Lopez's seductive confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The panelist then attacked ``There's Something About Mary,''
acting as if it were a sign of the eve of the millennium.
Certainly, ``Mary'' isn't much of a movie, but to attack it on
grounds of bad taste is absurd. If you're a 12-year-old, you've
grown up with what used to be called bad taste. You watch ``South
Park'' and sing along to the ``Kenny's Dead'' video. You can catch
the ``Master of My Domain'' episode of ``Seinfeld'' when you get
home from school. Bad taste has become the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   1998 also had more odd coincidences than any year in recent
memory. There were two films on World War II made by major
directors: Steven Spielberg's masterful ``Saving Private Ryan,''
which, with its constant, harrowing stream of shock, was staged
like a horror movie, and Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line,''
an allusive adaptation of the James Jones novel.
</P>
<P>
   There were also several movies on that ``somebody's watching
me'' theme. ``The Truman Show'' featured Jim Carrey, giving his
first non-tricked-up performance on the big screen, as a man whose
entire life had been a television show. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer
scrambled his team into motion to produce the garishly enjoyable
``Enemy of the State,'' in which every move that Will Smith made
was tracked with surveillance equipment, something he's no doubt
used to by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy'' almost cleared the metallic aftertaste of one of the
year's worst coincidences, the near-simultaneous release of ``Deep
Impact'' and ``Armageddon,'' which was also produced by
Bruckheimer. As knuckle-headed as Bruckheimer's ``Con Air'' _
perhaps the stupidest, and loudest, movie ever to run through Dolby
labs _ ``Armageddon'' pitted its macho
foreign-object-hurtling-toward-the-Earth story line vs. ``Deep
Impact's'' small, more emotional goofiness.
</P>
<P>
   Macro vs. micro. Or is that Kraft's macaroni &AMP; cheese vs. micro?
In terms of which was worse, it was too close to call, especially
in the kind of competition that no one in his right mind would want
to judge.
</P>
<P>
   The most suspect coincidence of the year was when DreamWorks'
``Antz'' and Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' happened to hit theaters
within a month of each other. Suspect because ``Antz'' was an
answer released before ``Bug's Life'' posed the question: Is there
a satisfying movie to be made using computer animation in the wake
of ``Toy Story''? ``Antz'' proved there definitely ain't two of
'em.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely unique when two major directors choose the same
kind of material for release in the same year, and for both movies
to end up as the most anticipated pictures of the year. Malick's
return to the cinema with ``Line'' after a self-imposed 20-year
exile came just as a ``Ryan'' backlash began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line'' will add to this year's
a-tree-falls-a-phone-call-it-joins-all-synchronicity. Nick Nolte's
finely calibrated bluster _ it was once said that if John Wayne
could act, he'd have been Nolte _ is one of the notable
performances in ``Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolte turns in a risky, tuned-in job in ``Affliction,'' which
we'll also see here early in 1999. His work makes 1998 the first
year in a while that's likely to result in an actor getting Oscar
nominations in both lead and supporting categories. (We last saw
this in 1983, when Jessica Lange notched nominations for starring
in ``Frances'' and co-starring in ``Tootsie.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that, in a year with a number of independent films
worth talking about, no one bothered to call 1998 The Year of
Independent Film. (Maybe it's because that overused benediction has
worn thin to the point of transparency.) 1998 saw the release of
``Gods and Monsters'' _ a bio-pic based on a novel about the life
of horror film pioneer James Whale _ a movie so independent that
production shut down because they ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to be one of the year's best films. As was
Darren Arenofsky's ``Pi,'' a slender-budgeted cyberthriller that
also fell into the paranoiac subgenre of ``Truman'' and ``Enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   If any film defined independent, it was Todd Solondz's
``Happiness.'' This cruel, powerful meditation on urban loneliness
_ Solondz's sole theme thus far _ forced pseudo-indie October Films
to put its money where its mouth is. October blinked over the
subject matter _ or rather, its parent company, Universal did _ and
dropped ``Happiness'' after financing it. (You'd think that
Universal would have had better things to find offense in, like
releasing ``Meet Joe Black.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even the ambitious failures, like ``Beloved,'' the lovingly made
if miscalculated adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, had something
going for them. In ``Beloved,'' it was the extraordinary level of
the performances _ Danny Glover has never been better, and Thandie
Newton and Christine Elise shone. (''The Thin Red Line'' is a
bigger failure, and will be taken far more seriously.)
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty's mess of a political satire ``Bulworth'' broke a
sweat trying to return political discourse, and passions, to the
movies. In a year in which political discussion had nothing to do
with the way the country is run, the ideas running through
``Bulworth'' at least seemed original.

MICHAEL AND KAITLYN WERE TOP NAMES OF 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Move over Andrew and Megan. Here come Madison,
Tyler and Alexis. And don't even try to mess with Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Among American parents favorite names for newborns in 1998,
Michael was the most popular _ for the 35th year in a row. Kaitlyn
reclaimed its No.1 spot for girls after being bumped out of that
position by Sarah last year, according to BabyCenter of San
Francisco, an Internet company that offers on-line baby gear and is
a resource center for expectant and new parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew, which broke into the top 10 list last year, fell
from its No.9 spot and was replaced by Tyler in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among girls' names, Madison made it to the 10th spot on the 1998
10-best list. Jessica _ which hogged a top spot for most of the
decade _ and Megan were squeezed off the top 10. The other eight
favorites for girls were Emily, Sarah, Hannah, Ashley, Brianna,
Alexis, Samantha and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   After Michael, which means ``he who is like God,'' the biblical
names of Jacob and Matthew came in second and third, followed by
Nicholas, Joshua, Christopher, Brandon, Austin, Tyler and Zachary.
</P>
<P>
   BabyCenter reported the list after analyzing more than 1 million
Social Security registrations during the first eight months of the
year as well as surveying 2,500 new parents who used the web site.
The South of Market on-line company, which also published the list
of top 100 names of each gender, said the numbers came from all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   If the most popular boys' names seemed _ no offense guys _ a
little stuffier, it's because parents, especially fathers, seem to
take less chances with boy names, according to Lara Hoyem, a
spokeswoman for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are less interested in naming babies generally, but their
interest rises more often when having a son,'' Hoyem said. ``Men
are more conservative ... Men are like, `You've got to be kidding.
You're not going to spell it that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of the nya-nyas and the other name calling they
grew up with on the playgrounds, baby boomers in general haven't
been as adventurous with names in recent years. Forget Freeddom
John from the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   What parents seem to be doing instead, says Hoyem, is giving
children more traditional or classic names, but spelling them in
unusual ways. Emily, she said, came up on the list with a variety
of spellings, including Emilly and Emmily. Some parents opted to
make Alexis, Alexus, like the car. Then there's Kaitlyn, whose
Greek origin means ``pure.'' Parents spelled it Caitlyn, Katelyn
and Catelyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative spellings are huge,'' said Hoyem of this year's
trend. ``Parents are trying hard to figure out a unique way to give
their baby a name that isn't so unique. I guess this is how parents
are being risky.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also found some other trends: so-called geographic
names _ such as Dakota, Sierra and Savannah _ are on the rise.
Hoyem also has seen old-fashioned names from the turn of the
century _ including Emma, Hannah, Isabella and Anna _ moving up the
list. Traditional men's names are also being given to girls, she
noted, including Taylor, Bailey and Sidney.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyem said what's unknown is whether the national trends match
each region of the country. She found out by talking to an expert,
for example, that William is the No. 1 boy's name in the south, and
predicts it will become more popular nationally over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyem noted that only about 8 percent of those surveyed named
their children after a relative or friend. Most said ``uniqueness''
was their biggest concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is more informal (about last names) and it's more
important now to have a unique first name,'' she said. ``Before
children weren't seen as individuals. Now they are. They're not
just the child of Jack and Jane.''

YOU SAY YOU WANT A RESOLUTION ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may have been an errant resolution last year right about
this time that had something to do with not writing columns about
New Year's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and you're looking a lot slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   That about settles it then.
</P>
<P>
   Let's keep focused, people, and get these things resolved:
</P>
<P>
   UPN: You will think twice _ maybe three times _ before giving
the green light to a comedy about a black butler to Abraham
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   All of us will one day, without prodding, sit down and watch
``Unhappily Ever After'' on The WB, just in case someone can figure
out why it's still on.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart: You will admit your problem and you will eat.
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture writers: You will stop this nonsense about whether
Ally McBeal is or is not a feminist role model. She's a character
created by a man to be entertaining, period.
</P>
<P>
   NBC: You will show up on this list quite a bit. Resolved. Next
you will admit that paying the ``Mad About You'' stars a million an
episode was a pretty obvious mistake, given that anyone who watched
the show knew it was as fresh as a piece of vending machine carrot
cake.
</P>
<P>
   We will all vow to stop being enablers and cease this ludicrous
viewing of ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC: In turn, you will stop blowing up cars or stretching
faux-shocking stories throughout an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Phillips: During the May sweeps you will admit what
everyone already knows: That you are a replicant from ``Blade
Runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not already, will begin watching ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' because it's so pop culture savvy that no one who
loves quality _ and quirky _ television should miss it. What more
could you want than a splendid mix of action, comedy, romance and
cynicism?
</P>
<P>
   People who like ``The Nanny'' will agree to wear red arm bands
so we can see them coming.
</P>
<P>
   ABC: Knowing that your new shows are rounding into their own,
you will silently but swiftly rid yourself of ``Home Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   We will all watch more golf on television and we will love it.
Well, some of us will more than others.
</P>
<P>
   We will only watch Congressional hearings if those taking the
pompous high road are subsequently defrocked by Hustler and paraded
in front of the C-SPAN cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity: You will get drunk and have sex with someone at your
college, then wake up the next day with a major headache and
supreme guilt. Welcome to the real world, babe.
</P>
<P>
   Some kid on ``Kids Say the Darndest Things'' will rise up and
tell Bill Cosby: ``It's shows like this that are driving me and my
peers to the Internet and GameBoy.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS: You will stop apologizing for the fact that most of the
viewers you have are older.
</P>
<P>
   NBC: By showing ``pro'' wrestling you will admit, in public,
that you are taking on a lot of water and the panic and fear can
not be turned back anytime soon, thus explaining and exposing
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   We will take a yoga class or read, maybe, instead of watching
``Touched By An Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox: You will stop showing animals attacking people, any video
of any kind where a car crashes, magicians giving away their trade
secrets or people being kicked ``accidentally'' in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   And all the networks will stop forever the use of ``World's
Scariest'' in their titles.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Rooney: You will, with great patience and attention to
detail, cut your eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   The History Channel: You will at least try to cut back on the
Hitler documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   We will, despite all of our highbrow rantings, sit down with a
beer and watch a double episode of ``Cops'' at least eight or so
times a season.
</P>
<P>
   And if the location is Las Vegas or there's a domestic
disturbance, we'll have two beers and possibly invite some friends
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biography'': You will, just to be different, become a little
more in-depth.
</P>
<P>
   TV programmers (you've got a lot to improve on, so sit
patiently): You will take fewer meetings with people who have
already delivered to you really bad TV shows. You will not, in a
knee-jerk moment, program more ``news'' magazines. You will tell
the truth to the young writers on your shows: ``This is not good
enough. Nor funny enough. Try again.''
</P>
<P>
   You will not copy other shows, particularly lousy ones. Not all
of your female characters will be thin. Your gay characters can
actually, you know, kiss and have sex. You will cancel an older,
lame show instead of ``infusing'' it with new characters.
</P>
<P>
   You will stop marketing all of your shows to teenagers. You
will, at least once a week just for practice, say ``Good Lord
that's a stupid idea. Get your ass out of my office.''
</P>
<P>
   You will not, under any circumstance, allow Tony Danza to be on
television ever again.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime: You will program shows for women, because that's what
you say you do.
</P>
<P>
   USA Channel: Not all of the women in your movies will be
defenseless and in peril.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Files: You will cancel yourself, out of shame.
</P>
<P>
   We will all stop watching MSNBC until they come up with
something other than ``Investigating the President.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we will all turn the channel if something about
President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky or Kenneth Starr comes on.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. That one's already resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Springer: To learn a lesson and prove that you do have a
soul, you will allow yourself to be bludgeoned by several of your
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The networks: You will no longer give sweetheart deals that
result in horrible shows like ``Jesse'' and ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   CBS: You will schedule in sweeps, because the people demand it,
a bout between Sammo Hung and Chuck Norris.
</P>
<P>
   The networks: You will not release 40 or more new shows in less
than a month next September. You will not release 15 or more shows
during the ``midseason'' to cover for your mistakes. You will not
air reruns all summer, leaving us hanging.
</P>
<P>
   We will all lose a little weight this year. Except Calista
Flockhart.

THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HOLLYWOOD: THE HIGHS, LOWS OF '98  
 (ADV: WITH MOVIES98-BEST AND MOVIES98-WORST) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Hollywood shuffle: Take one step forward by going
two steps back.
</P>
<P>
   If we want to peek at the kinds of movies we'll see over the
next two years, we have to look back only at the trends that made
1998 another box-office bonanza at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   - Hollywood does Hollywood: ``The Truman Show,'' ``Holy Man,''
``Ringmaster'' and ``Pleasantville'' played upon our obsession with
TV, while many movies dealt with the moviemakers: ``Gods and
Monsters,'' ``Love and Death on Long Island,'' ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss,'' ``The Tango Lesson,'' ``Orgazmo,'' ``Celebrity'' and
``Twilight.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Hollywood turn its cameras inward? For the same reason
writers write about writers: It's something they know.
</P>
<P>
   - Private Ryan saves war movies: ``Saving Private Ryan''
reopened national debate about patriotism and the terrible
sacrifices demanded by war. It also changed how Hollywood will make
war movies.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, all directors will have to face the brutal choices
of war: Do they go the ultra-realistic route that Spielberg took?
</P>
<P>
   - Dumber and, well, worse: The dumb-comedy genre got even dumber
as stupid pictures cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   The smart Adam Sandler (``The Wedding Singer'') was popular but
not nearly as popular as the dumb Adam Sandler (``The Waterboy'').
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary''became the biggest surprise hit
of the year by combining dumb gags with outrageous stunts. Stuck
zippers will be the cream pies of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Will movies try to outdumb each other? Yes, but they're already
doing that. From now on, filmmakers will be challenged to come up
with grosser-than-Mary stunts.
</P>
<P>
   - Kids have a great year at the movies: ``A Bug's Life'' is
soaring, followed by other well-made, family-friendly ventures:
``Antz,'' ``The Rugrats Movie,'' ``The Prince of Egypt,'' the
second ``Babe.'' Also on the plus side: ``Mulan,'' ``Paulie,''
``The Parent Trap,'' ``Madeline'' and ``Barney's Great Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   This coming year, we can expect more computer animation and more
attempts to spin off kids' TV shows into movies.
</P>
<P>
   - Blacks don't: Serious films about experiences of Black people
took a big hit when ``Beloved,'' ``He Got Game,'' ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back,'' ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' and ``Hav Plenty''
did not attract enough moviegoers of any color.
</P>
<P>
   That means we'll see even fewer Black films with depth and more
quick-hit pictures, such as ``Rush Hour'' starring fast-talking
Black comics.
</P>
<P>
   _How do you tell satire from the real thing? Obsessed with
Washington politics, Hollywood produced three satires of the
Clinton years: ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Bulworth'' and ``Primary
Colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Wag the Dog'' became a phrase of political currency,
these films did only so-so box office. So, we may not get too many
Washington comedies in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Other than what the politicians come up with on their own, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   - Classics stay classy: Studios continued to mine classic novels
for material: ``Cousin Bette,'' ``Les Miserables,'' ``Washington
Square'' and ``Mrs. Dalloway.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these movies don't bring in big box office, the studios
don't have to pay for the book rights because they're already in
the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   Classics also lend class to studios that make their real money
off violence and dumb jokes. Besides, they've got to do something
with those storerooms full of costumes.
</P>
<P>
   - Got to dance, don't have to sing: Although musicals were
scarce, movies kept dancing. ``The Tango Lesson'' and ``Gadjo
Dilo'' introduced passionate dancers from Argentina and Romania,
respectively, while ``The Last Days of Disco,'' ``54'' and ``Dance
With Me'' tried to revive disco fever.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a swing-dance movie in the works?
</P>
<P>
   - Duel winners: Dueling movies continued the trend of rival
studios making similar pictures around the same concept, with both
succeeding at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Two asteroid movies (``Deep Impact'' and ``Armageddon'') and two
ant movies (``Antz'' and ``A Bug's Life'') did not cancel each
other out. People simply went to see both.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, it's not stealing if everyone makes money.
</P>
<P>
   - Oscar may come late: Looking ahead, a few big films will still
make a run at the 1998 Oscars because they opened in LA in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Those contenders include a World War II drama, ``The Thin Red
Line''; ``A Civil Action,'' starring John Travolta as a crusading
attorney; and ``Hurlyburly,'' with Sean Penn and Meg Ryan in a
story about drug addicts. &QL;

THE BEST OF THE BEST FOR 1998  
 (ADV: WITH MOVIES98B AND MOVIES98-WORST) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's a list of the best movies of 1998:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ The biggest impact film of the
year, Steven Spielberg's masterpiece follows a squad of D-Day
survivors on a doomed mission to rescue a single soldier from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most authentic and one of the most heartbreaking
films ever made about the inevitable slaughter in mechanized
warfare. No filmmaker has ever captured the frenzied panic of
ground battles in so much intense detail.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on a few men and what they endure, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' becomes the narrowest but deepest war epic yet.
</P>
<P>
   It galvanized the nation and will influence filmmakers for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Life Is Beautiful'' _ The rarest of films: one that can
make you laugh and cry at the same time. This bittersweet tale
about a happy-go-lucky clown trapped in a Nazi concentration camp
combines classic slapstick comedy with heart-wrenching poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   It's all the more remarkable because the writer, director and
star, Italy's Roberto Benigni, hasn't shown this kind of sublime
talent in previous films.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ This comedy, with the Bard as the
hero of his own romantic fantasy, is a smart, bawdy romp about
love, sex, actors, sword fighting and the curious ability of a
woman to be both Juliet and Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   By vividly, lustily bringing Shakespeare's times to life, the
movie will introduce a new generation of movie lovers to a master
of both tragedy and farce.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Beloved'' _ The year's most challenging drama, this
adaptation of the Toni Morrison novel uses a woman's horrific
plight during slavery to examine the psychological destruction
inflicted upon women by the men who wield the power in this world.
</P>
<P>
   The movie played mostly to women, although its lessons are
directed toward men. Or, as star Oprah Winfrey says when Danny
Glover claims he never mistreated a woman in his life, ``Well, that
makes one of you.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``A Bug's Life'' _ Is it a kids' cartoon? Or an adult comedy?
Everyone is laughing too hard to figure out the difference.
</P>
<P>
   This second film from the computer-animation wizards who created
``Toy Story'' is teeming with jokes flying off in so many
directions that repeat viewings won't wear out the humor.
</P>
<P>
   The producers even came up with a clever marketing gag: changing
the funny outtakes over the closing credits in midrelease.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Bulworth'' _ An outrageous comedy in which Warren Beatty
(as writer, director and star) insults everyone _ or if he missed
anyone, it was by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty plays a U.S. senator who suddenly starts doing the
unthinkable: telling the truth about politics to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wag the Dog'' got more press, but this satire struck closer to
the reason so many Americans have grown cynical about politics:
They should be.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Gods and Monsters'' _ Strange, memorable drama about two
men with nothing in common _ the aging director who created the
original ``Frankenstein'' movie and a young gardener running from
himself _ who become key players in each other's lives.
</P>
<P>
   This thought-provoking film is full of psychological surprises
that highlight the difficulty and importance of finding out who we
really are.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Sliding Doors'' _ The most innovative romance in decades,
this English film shows how the small decisions we make in our
lives can change everything.
</P>
<P>
   The movie cleverly follows a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) down the
dual paths of her life, based on the simple switch of making or not
making a train.
</P>
<P>
   This fascinating film will get you thinking about the workings
of fate in your own life.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Mrs. Dalloway'' _ Dutch filmmaker Marleen Gorris
(``Antonia's Line'') turns Virginia Woolf's novel into an intricate
evocation of the interplay between daily life and the free-floating
tempo of memories.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the movie about an aging Englishwoman in the 1920s is
like curling up inside a great book.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Waking Ned Devine'' _ The comedy for people who complain
they don't make grand old comedies the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of two schemers trying to con themselves a share of
the Irish lottery is a delightful charmer, full of Irish wit and
winsome humor.
</P>
<P>
   Five films that would have made the best list if we counted by
15s instead of 10s: ``Gadjo Dilo,'' ``The Tango Lesson,'' ``Men
With Guns,'' ``Waco: The Rules of Engagement,'' ``Babe: Pig in the
City.'' &QL;

LANGUAGE PROFESSORS CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE `CULTURE WARS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Cold War ended long ago, and the Vietnam War
even longer, but ``culture wars'' are boiling hotter than ever on
American campuses.
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. colleges and universities, political radicals,
feminists, lesbians, blacks and other groups are scrutinizing
American life in imaginative new ways, ranging from scholarly
studies of lesbian detective novels to Marxist theories of loves
and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The trend angers some old-fashioned professors, mostly tenured
scholars who foresee apocalypse in the latest campus trends: drama
teachers who'd as soon discuss Quentin Tarantino as Aristophanes,
Marxist scholars who excoriate imperialist attitudes in
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' and ``queer theorists'' who
deconstruct homophobic messages in classic literature.
</P>
<P>
   These and other trend setters strutted their stuff at this
week's Modern Language Association of America (MLA) conference in
San Francisco. For anyone wishing to plug into the intellectual
Zeitgeist, the annual MLA conference is the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   In a session titled ``Can We Talk? Is Dialogue Possible Between
the Cultural Left and Right?'' academics tried to cool down
passions on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Both leftists and right-wingers on campuses have tended to
indulge in ``demonization of their opponents,'' charged an
organizer of the session, English Professor Donald P. Lazere of
California Polytechnic University at San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that if both sides calm down, then they might realize
they have ideas in common. For example, he argued, the late Marxist
philosopher Herbert Marcuse's book ``One-Dimensional Man,'' a Bible
for 1960s radicals, criticizes mass culture in ways similar to
Allan Bloom's ``Closing of the American Mind,'' a best-selling
critique treasured by political conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session, though, the semi-civilized
atmosphere crumbled into accusation hurling. Several women in the
audience repeatedly demanded that a panelist explain why he had
omitted Virginia Woolf's name from a list of his favorite
novelists.
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the session, a man in the audience stood and
complained that a top official of the MLA, the controversial
Columbia University scholar Edward Said, had written a ``snide and
intemperate'' letter in the organization's journal. ``This man is
going to be the next president of the MLA?'' the man asked
incredulously. Said was not present.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of MLA sessions this week, most were standard
academic stuff, such as ``Edith Wharton and Her 1920s
Contemporaries'' and ``Marlowe and Shakespeare: The Anxiety of
Influence.''
</P>
<P>
   But a fair share of this week's sessions might sound goofy to
mainstream, middlebrow Americans who prefer Tom Clancy, People
magazine and Martha Stewart to Jacques Lacan, Lingua Franca
magazine, and the always-unhappy films of Todd (``Happiness'')
Solondz.
</P>
<P>
   For example, MLA sessions included discussions of
``posthumanist'' values in the ``Swamp Thing'' comic; of ``Robots
in Early Brazilian Science Fiction''; and of the deeper meanings of
celebrity autobiographies by Roseanne, Marilyn Manson and ``Lone
Ranger'' Clayton Moore.

INTERNET COMPANIES PUSH ON-LINE CALENDARS AND ORGANIZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This coming year, two San Francisco-area
Internet companies are betting that on-line customers will abandon
paper-based or hand-held electronic organizers and keep track of
their lives on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Mountain View-based Visto and Woodside-based
Magically Inc. have posted Web sites that feature personal on-line
calendars and telephone number managers a user can access from any
computer with a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of these Web applications argue that these sites will
be a success because of the openness of the wired crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, you were a nobody if you didn't have an
unlisted phone number,'' said Rao Machirajau, chief technology
officer with Magically Inc. ``Now, everybody has a Web page where
they're spilling their guts. So keeping things like appointments
and telephone numbers on-line is no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Users of these Web-based organizational tools can store
information ranging from telephone numbers to addresses and even
events calendars on the sites by entering the data onto a
datebook-like template. Magically and Visto then store the
information on servers that are accessible on any computer logged
into the Internet. The information is protected by a password
selected by the individual user.
</P>
<P>
   Besides calendar and phone number services, sites like
Magically's MagicDesk (www.magicaldesk.com) and Visto
(www.visto.com) are trying to lure subscribers with free e-mail and
on-line data file storage areas.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that users will be so enamored of the service that
they'll eventually subscribe to the premium pay sections of these
personal information sites. These sites include larger data storage
areas and capabilities to synchronize the on-line information with
a computer's personal information manager program, hand-held
machines like the Palm Pilot and, eventually, cell phones and other
portable devices. These upgrades cost about $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having your information at a central point on the Web, you
can walk up to any computer and access it,'' said Steve Cox, vice
president of marketing for Visto. ``I have this saying: It's the
content, stupid. It's not the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said these services allow workers to become more portable,
enabling them to move back and forth between home and office with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a service that frees people from having to not schlepp
around disks or use other devices to carry their information back
and forth from the office,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an idea that has caught the attention of major Web
portal sites, like Yahoo, which has posted its own calendar and
phone service. Excite and Lycos are expected to launch their own
versions of the service early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of these services may be hampered by the usual
Web complaints: Privacy and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information software and other devices are fast,'' said
Bridget Leach of Giga Information Group, an information technology
research firm based in Cambridge, Mass. ``The Web is slow and some
people won't want to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach said concerns over privacy could also hamper the growth of
the on-line personal information market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some hesitancy putting such personal information
up on the Internet,'' Leach said. ``But there were those concerns
about e-mail, and it didn't stop people.''
</P>
<P>
   Financially, both firms are banking on private capital to get
off the ground. Magically is a closely held company funded by
several venture capital firms in Hong Kong and an undisclosed
telecom company, according to Machirajau. The site went on-line
Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Visto is also a closely held company, funded with Silicon Valley
venture capital, including a July infusion of $9 million from New
Enterprise Associates, a VC firm that has computer pundit Stewart
Alsop on its board, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy O'Neill, an analyst with Dataquest, a San Jose-based
market research company, said the main beneficiary of these new
organizer sites will be the sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are what we call `sticky applications,''' O'Neill said.
``The Web sites want people to get dependent on them and keep
coming back. If you spend a good two hours on a Saturday entering
your phone numbers and appointments at Yahoo, you're not going to
want to do that again if you're thinking about switching your home
page. It worked with free e-mail. It'll probably work with these
new services.''

HER RESOLUTION IS A RERUN: NO MORE TV
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, a new year.
</P>
<P>
   New goals, new energy, new lifestyle, new life.
</P>
<P>
   Less weight, less stress, less conflict, less mess.
</P>
<P>
   No analyzing, no scrutinizing, no whining, no fear.
</P>
<P>
   And no TV.
</P>
<P>
   None. Zip. Nada.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Really.
</P>
<P>
   Last time lasted a month. Or was it two?
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks, actually.
</P>
<P>
   That's Marifeli. On the phone from Arlington, Texas. Again. Same
time last year, right, Marifeli? ``It's happening this time,'' she
promises, chuckling. ``No ... really ... I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious about kicking her TV habit. Serious about dropping
``Ally McBeal'' from her diet.
</P>
<P>
   Serious about saying ``See ya'' to ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
(''I just love his brother'') and ``JAG'' (''Is he fine or what?'')
and ``Early Edition'' (''Did you know she's the first Buffy?'') and
``Touched by an Angel'' (''It inspires me, you know?'') and ``Law &AMP;
Order'' (''Ben Bratt'') and ``Friends'' (''Chandler just cracks me
up'') and ``ER'' (''It grosses me out. ... but I like that'') and
``Spin City'' (''the gay guy and the straight guy are so funny'')
and ``that show with Sarah Jessica Parker. You know. The one about
sex.'' HBO's ``Sex in the City? ``Right. Love that,'' says
Marifeli. ``It's my life. ... That will be a hard one.''
</P>
<P>
   Marifeli is divorced and the mother of a precocious 5-year-old.
Time's ticking, she says. Too much of it spent in front of the tube
and ``not talking, just zoning out'' with daughter Eliza, who
already has her own 8-inch-screen TV perched on top of a colorful
Mickey Mouse dresser. A giant stuffed Teletubby sits on top of the
TV, waving its little hand, as if to say, ``C'mon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Po,'' Marifeli says. ``Or Tinky Winky. You know, the
green one.'' (That's Dipsy, actually.)
</P>
<P>
   In Marifeli's three-bedroom home near Lake Arlington, there are
three other sets. One each for the living room, the bedroom, the
kitchen. ``It's a little one, though,'' Marifeli says about the
kitchen set, which keeps her company while she cooks. ``Plus, it's
black and white. That doesn't count.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   Marifeli sounds like a habitual TV watcher with a bad case of
the guilts. She's like a chain smoker who can't quit. An alcoholic
who needs a lift. A drug addict who needs a fix.
</P>
<P>
   Marifeli's morning pick-me-ups: Katie Couric on ``Today,'' some
``SportsCenter,'' some ``CNN,'' a tiny bit of ``Good Morning,
Texas'' while heading out the door. (''You like the new girl? I
think she's trying too hard.'')
</P>
<P>
   Evenings are devoted to a prime-time menu, most of which she
tapes for viewing after Eliza has been tucked in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Taping, says Marifeli, is the most efficient way to consume TV.
You can fast-forward through the commercials. ``I also move right
on through the secondary stories that aren't working,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? ``Do you watch `Fantasy Island'? On that, there are two
major stories and then a side story, usually about that fat guy and
the skinny guy who help out the fantasy guy. So I sit on my couch
and fast-forward every time they come on and stop when one of the
main-story people appear.''
</P>
<P>
   And? ``And that cuts an hour show to 35 minutes. I do the same
with `JAG' with (stories about) that pudgy assistant, and `Cupid'
sometimes, with the roommate, even though he's got this great body
and nice smile. ...''
</P>
<P>
   So she's able to cram a couple dramas and a few sitcoms in a
two-hour slot. During late-night, she spot-checks talk-show guests,
flipping back and forth from the talkers to ``Nightline,''
depending on the subject. Marifeli's weekends revolve around the
tube as well. She's pulled away when hanging out with Eliza, but
evenings and late at night, she leaps into her sleep gear, cuts off
the lights, arms herself with tea (winter) or ice cream shake
(summer) and a remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's soothing,'' she says. ``And intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Intimate enough to call Benjamin Bratt ``Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   And you'll be able to give this up?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she promises. ``Although ...''
</P>
<P>
   Although?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this ad the other day about Eddie Murphy. I just love
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs.'' Airs Jan. 10 on Fox. It's ``Good Times'' in clay
animation. Murphy is a producer and voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That looks really, really funny,'' she says. ``Maybe I'll
check that out just to see. And the Sarah Jessica Parker show,
since that's cable. That doesn't really count.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not.

WHITE CASTLE, KRYSTAL HAMBURGER CHAINS AREN'T LINKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Two restaurant chains _ White Castle up north and Krystal in
the South _ sell identical hamburgers. Why does the company use two
different names?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.L.N., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: White Castle and Krystal are separate companies that both
specialize in small, square burgers topped with steamed onions.
</P>
<P>
   White Castle, which began in Wichita, Kan., became the first
hamburger chain in 1921. The company has about 340 restaurants in
10 states _ mostly in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Krystal, which began 11 years later in Chattanooga, Tenn., has
around 340 restaurants in 10 Southern states, though none in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity between burgers hasn't been lost on the
companies. Krystal and White Castle have a verbal agreement not to
compete in the same cities, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for preserves made by a Trappist monastery. They
used to be sold at a store in downtown Fort Worth. Are they still
produced?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.L.K., Haslet, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Trappist Preserves have been made by monks at a Massachusetts
abbey since 1954. They also sell fruit and wine jellies, marmalade
and jam.
</P>
<P>
   For product information, call (508) 885-8730 or write to
Trappist Abbey Gifts, St. Joseph's Abbey, Spencer, MA 01562-1233.
</P>
<P>
   You also can order Trappist Preserves online at
www.spencerabbey.org/preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has happened to S&AMP;H Green Stamps? I have nine books and
don't know what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   _ M.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Most stamps are redeemed today through the Sperry &AMP;
Hutchinson mail-order catalog.
</P>
<P>
   To receive the free catalog, call the National Mail Order Center
at (800) 435-5674 or write to National Mail Order Center, Box 5775,
Norcross, GA 30091-5775.

DON'T FORGET THE CAMERA AND NINE OTHER INCREDIBLY EASY TRICKS OF
THE TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RALPH LAUER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trip is costing you a fortune, not to mention the dysentery
you've had to deal with, the bus ride that almost ended in a
1,000-foot free fall into a ravine and the communal bath you took
with what seemed to be a tribe of herders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the opportunity of a lifetime, and here you stand,
looking at the most beautiful scene since the creation of the
heavens. You reach for your camera and realize it's ... on the bed
... in the hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Photography mistake No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave home without it. And don't leave the hotel without
it either. Looking like a tourist geek is a small price to pay for
pictures that will let you remember your trip for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   To get started in your photo-taking, you need to purchase a
camera before you leave home. Here comes that walk into the camera
store, a look down that long aisle of lenses, all looking back at
you. Now you know how Monica feels. To simplify, I will limit this
to discussion of 35mm cameras, although most of the photo tips
apply to other formats as well.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of cameras, as with most things, is proportional to
the amount of money you are willing to spend. A $1,500 single-lens
reflex camera (the ones where you see through the same lens that
the film looks through) and zoom is capable of creating
higher-quality images than that handy disposable number, but how
you use either camera determines how well your photos come out.
</P>
<P>
   The more-expensive version will have more bells and whistles
enabling you to do more, but under optimum light conditions, the
images from the expensive camera won't be substantially better than
the images from a less-expensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Disposables have plastic lenses, fixed shutter speeds and
apertures, and some even have built-in flashes. Their drawback is
that you can't make any adjustments for the changing conditions of
light you will encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Point-and-shoot cameras are a step up from disposables, giving
you improved quality in lenses, and a camera that makes some
adjustments for different light conditions, while still offering
the simplicity of just pointing the camera and pressing the shutter
release. They come in a variety of styles and sizes, with some even
being waterproof. Most have built-in flashes and some include data
imprinting, so you can record the date and time of an exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate option is the SLRs, or single-lens reflex cameras.
These are the ones professionals and wannabes have hanging around
their necks. They give you control of the shutter speeds (how fast
the picture is taken), the aperture (amount of light the lens lets
in), and the ability to change lenses. Some will have built-in
flashes, but most don't. The price of the gains made in quality and
flexibility is paid in size, weight and cost, with some of these
types of cameras costing more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   After you've settled on your camera, the next thing you need is
film. If you're using a disposable camera, then it's already in
there. If you're using something else, this is where things can
start to get complicated. You must choose between slide and
negative films, and each comes in varying speeds (sensitivity to
light).
</P>
<P>
   For most travelers, negative film is the best bet, because we
all want prints to hang on the refrigerator to impress our friends
with all the places we have seen. Leave the slide film to the pros,
who are the ones who need to reproduce stuff in those slick
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   As far as ISO (that's the speed of the film for the wannabes), a
quick guide is to use one that goes as fast as your subject. If
you're taking pictures in bright daylight of slow-moving subjects
like that German castle or the Great Wall of China, then a
100-speed film will give you the finest grain and best detail. For
medium-speed subjects, like that spitting camel at the pharaoh's
tomb, a 200 or 400 speed will be fine. And then if you have one of
those fast subjects, like Uncle Bob running with the bulls in
Pamplona, then 800 will be your favorite, because you probably live
on the wild side and this film's ability to shoot at night during
those wild carnival parades in Rio will come in handy. Just
remember that there is going to be a bit more grain in those shots.
</P>
<P>
   Now we come to aiming that infernal camera.
</P>
<P>
   Don't shoot straight into a light source; it gives the camera a
false exposure and will silhouette whatever it is you're trying to
photograph. If you have a hard time looking directly at it, then
the film will be squinting just like you.
</P>
<P>
   When you travel, you want the picture-taking as simple as
possible, so let those automatic settings do what you paid for them
to do in the first place. In most situations, the cameras are
perfectly capable of setting the exposures.
</P>
<P>
   Try to fill the frame with your subject, getting as close as
prudently possible. You are not going to want a wide-angle close-up
of a lion on the Serengeti plain since that would put you within a
paw stretch of being dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The more colorful the scene the better, so make sure your travel
partner has not just started dressing like a goth princess, unless
you're at a Transylvanian castle.
</P>
<P>
   Try framing the most important subject matter off-center, such
as a third left or right, to prevent that perfect symmetry of a
face like a bull's-eye in the center of the photo.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to remember is to shoot photos of
subjects that are important to you, because these are your
memories, not the local visitors bureau's photos.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauer's Top 10 rules for pleasing photos:
</P>
<P>
   1. Always carry your camera with you. If you want pictures, you
need the camera.
</P>
<P>
   2. Don't forget that darn lens-cap thing. The world is real
black to the film if you don't take it off.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fingers belong behind the lens. Thumbs make remarkably
unattractive photos, so be careful that you hold the camera so no
part of your hand is visible to the lens.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't put everything in the center of the frame. You paid for
the rest of the film so you might as well use it.
</P>
<P>
   5. Try to look at the world from a different viewpoint, either
high or low.
</P>
<P>
   6. If things are moving fast, you need to hold still.
</P>
<P>
   7. Keep the camera dry; lake plunges, rain and spilled Cokes
will ruin your equipment.
</P>
<P>
   8. People don't have to be photographed from a distance. Most
don't bite, so you can get close. Ask first, if you feel
uncomfortable. Holding the camera up and pointing at it and then at
the person you would like to shoot is the international code for
``Can I take your picture?''
</P>
<P>
   9. There are beautiful things everywhere, so don't limit
yourself to tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   10. Shoot what you like, not what everyone else does.
</P>

   PBP_GO SMOKE (DEVELOPING) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So who are
these doctors who are fighting for Ed Holloway's right to smoke in
a Palm Beach County building as he works as a planner? Holloway,
who has two forms of cancer, says he suffers from post-traumatic
stress from his tour of duty in Vietnam. He got some doctors to say
that he needs to smoke. So is their opinion supported by medical
thought on the subject? And what can the Army tell us about
Holloway and his tour in Vietnam? (Moffett, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP_WE SMOKE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A visit to the front
lines of the smoking wars. How do the county workers forced outside
to light up feel about their persecution by the majority? And what
do non-smokers think about the enemy? (Hayes, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP_CHILD SEAT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A new University of
Florida study of child safety seats found that 95 percent of
children aren't strapped in correctly _ and greater danger for
injury or death in a car accident. The statewide study, funded by
the Florida Department of Transportation, examined more than 1,500
safety seats in vehicle inspections during the past year. The main
problem is parents failing to use a metal locking clip on the child
seat, which prevents the seat from being thrown forward in the
event of a collision. (Banstetter Palm Beach Post)

   AUS-Y2K-COMPUTER-BUG_ The Millennium Bug could start a preview
of disaster today, as some computers that don't recognize years
that begin with anything other than 19 try to update their internal
calendars by looking ahead one year and trip over Jan. 1, 2000.
They could crash or, more likely, begin spewing erroneous
information. What kind of computers? Probably not those that
operate Austin's services, such as water or electricity, police,
fire or EMS. Officials are on top of those. More likely the cash
registers or accounting systems of small businesses that haven't
been able to afford Y2K fixes. State, city and UT experts say we'll
have to wait and see. (Stanley, American-Statesman)

without electricity. (DuBose, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    More than any other figure of our time, Benjamin Spock embodies
the cultural contradictions of expertise _ and of our dependence on
it. His most famous piece of advice _ ``Trust yourself. You know
more than you think you do'' _ was the opening of a book that by
its seventh edition had bulked up to almost 900 pages. Inside were
detailed instructions on everything from managing colic to
inculcating idealism.
 &HT;    He set out to write a book that would be ``unauthoritative,
uncondemning and unscolding,'' and in many ways he succeeded. He
made it a point of honor to incorporate the criticisms of readers _
from suburban mothers who thought he was too stern about what one
called the ``miraculous'' pacifier (he later endorsed it for fussy
babies) to feminists who thought his use of the pronoun ``he'' to
describe the baby was sexist (after 1976, the baby is frequently a
``she'').
 &HT;    But this modesty of tone only reinforced h is authority. If he
had not revolutionized the dispensation of child-rearing advice in
this way _ making it seem less harsh and directive toward parents,
making it friendly _ we would not have today's veritable industry
of such advice. We would not have T. Berry Brazelton or Penelope
Leach, Spock's most obvious heirs, but neither would we have more
than 2,000 how-to books for mothers and fathers and even
grandparents, a cacophony of expertise that sometimes makes it
almost impossible to hear your own small voice.
 &HT;    There were child-rearing books before Spock published ``Baby and
Child Care'' in 1946, but they could never have worked for the
postwar generation, never have sold the astonishing 50 million
copies that his have sold. His predecessors had little interest in
psychological growth or self-expression. Nor did they treat
demonstrative familial love as a sort of secular religion, in the
now-familiar way that Spock and his followers would. Luther Emmett
Holt's ``The Care and Feeding of Children,'' first published in
1894, was still in print between the wars, a hoary classic urging
strict dietary habits and expeditious toilet training.
 &HT;    In 1928 Holt was joined on many home bookshelves by John
Watson's ``Psychological Care of Infant and Child,'' a staunch
behaviorist blueprint that stressed regimentation in eating and
elimination, warned parents not to hug or kiss their children and
blamed mother-love for a generation of mollycoddled complainers
unfit for the rigors of modern capitalism.
 &HT;    It was never at all clear whether many parents actually took
such Draconian advice. It was clear that they resented being told
they should. Indeed, pediatricians in the '30s and '40s were
increasingly ``confounded and annoyed,'' as one of them recalled,
``by the large numbers of distraught, angry and frazzled mothers''
who complained they could not stick with the rigid feeding
schedules then in vogue (``don't watch the baby; watch the clock,''
as the slogan had it) and who resented the ``objective'' training
methods advocated by Watson and his ilk.
 &HT;    Watsonism had begun to give way to the child-centered,
Spock-sanctioned approach that would have us, say, walk our colicky
babies for hours in the middle of the night rather than let them
cry it out, or painstakingly ``kidproof'' our houses rather than
swat a toddler who menaces the porcelain.
 &HT;    Feminists have pointed out that this labor-intensive paradigm is
in some ways more subtly punitive too, since women who feel they
come up short may blame themselves for a failure of maternal
instinct rather than of mere technique. But it is worth remembering
that the discipline of listening to your baby howl when she was
hungry was oppressive in its own way.
 &HT;    All those angry mothers storming their pediatricians' offices
had something to be angry about. What they did not have was a
popular voice of authority to whom they could turn for
confirmation. And that, of course, was where Spock came in.
 &HT;    With the first edition of his book, Spock gave voice to this
backlash against emotional asceticism in child-rearing _ a wry and
tolerant voice, soothing but never condescending. That is why the
charge that it was he who sired the hippie generation with his
``permissiveness'' was always so bogus.
 &HT;    The baby doctor eventually emerged as a leading critic of the
war in Vietnam and a champion of civil disobedience, and when he
did, campus demonstrators began brandishing signs reading ``I was
raised on Dr. Spock.'' But the equation never had much evidence in
its favor.
 &HT;    Spock was no advocate of loosey-goosey, anything-goes
child-rearing, and he repeatedly tried to correct the misimpression
that he was. He doubted the efficacy of physical punishment, but he
believed in the parent's mission to civilize, and his own two sons
remembered him as exacting and judgmental, a stickler for table
manners. As adults, they resented his strictness, but they turned
out fine. Both became husbands and fathers.
 &HT;    The elder son, Michael, is a former director of the Boston
Children's Museum. John Spock is a partner in a construction
company in Los Angeles. Spock himself went through a late-life
evolution. At 73, he divorced his wife of 49 years and married Mary
Morgan, a much younger, somewhat bohemian woman.
 &HT;    They led a nomadic life, partly in a Winnebago they called the
Tortoise, and adopted a macrobiotic diet, which he credited with
prolonging his life after a small stroke. He had come full circle _
back to a belief in the morally edifying effects of simple food and
fresh air that his formidable mother had tried to instill.
 &HT;    The paradox that makes Spock such a man of our time is that for
all the precious encouragement he did provide over the years, he
and his imitators have also helped to undermine the confidence of
many parents. You see subtitles like ``How to Be Natural'' and
instantly become self-conscious. You're told to relax into
parenthood, and the more often you're told, the less relaxed you
feel, and the more likely you are to turn to other sources of
professional advice.
 &HT;    Readers took notice of this tendency even in the '50s, but in
the last decade or so it has intensified. Even fewer of us live
near mothers or fathers or aunts or grandparents whose daily
counsel we can rely on, and even more of us spend enough time away
from our children each day to feel that we must get to know them
anew each evening.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Spock said that babies ``learn very soon
that their mother has less conviction than the baby has. This is
why there are so many pesky children who are arguing with their
parents all the time. It's wrong for children to be brought up
thinking they can bully and shame their parents into silence. But
it's also hard on parents.''
 &HT;    Maybe the best favor we could do for ourselves, and the best
tribute we could pay to Spock, is to stop buying parenting books.
Or OK, maybe just one. His.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I met George Wallace only twice _ very publicly _ and I have no
idea whether his latter-day denials of being a racist at heart are
true or not. What I do know is that his political career was
founded on racial discrimination, and that he left a political
heritage that exploits racial feelings for political gain.
 &HT;    Both of our meetings _ at the ``schoolhouse door'' in 1963 and
in the Oval Office in 1965 _ were calculated by the governor to
enhance his political role as a leader of white supremacy in
Alabama and in the South generally. The stand in the doorway at
Tuscaloosa fulfilled a campaign pledge and gave him huge national
exposure through television.
 &HT;    It had no substance; nobody, including Wallace, had any doubt
that Vivian Malone and James Hood would be admitted to the
university. That reality _ and perhaps the fact that on a very hot
day Wallace made me stand in the sun while he was in the shade _
made me angry at his posturing for political purposes. But given
the potential for violence on the part of Klan-related racists, we
felt we had no choice but to allow him to demonstrate his
identification with all those who opposed desegregation. We were
confident that he would eventually step aside.
 &HT;    Wallace met with President Johnson on a Saturday morning in 1965
to discuss problems of racial tension in Alabama. We thought he
requested the meeting to argue that racial integration would not
work and would lead to more civil disorder. The times were
difficult. That morning there were pickets on Pennsylvania Avenue
assailing the president.
 &HT;    Wallace hoped to exploit these demonstrations for his
segregationist ends. Feeling the anger of many whites at the
continuing civil rights demonstrations _ despite enactment of the
1964 Civil Rights Act _ he thought, mistakenly, that he could
embarrass LBJ into being critical as well. The president was the
better politician. He used the occasion to announce the
voting-rights bill in the Rose Garden _ while the Governor used the
back door to avoid the TV cameras.
 &HT;    But Governor Wallace was no slouch at politics. He sensed the
enormous white resentment in the North and West as well as the
South - especially among blue-collar workers and farmers _ of black
leaders, of black social and economic progress and of perceived
special treatment under the civil rights laws.
 &HT;    He recognized too that old-fashioned Southern racial politics _
``out-segging'' the other candidate _ was not politically viable in
the North and, after passage of the Voting Rights Act, in the South
either. He had always, as governor, posed as the candidate of the
working man _ the white working man _ and he took his image
national as a third-party candidate in 1968, winning five states
and 13 percent of the popular vote.
 &HT;    Baldly stated, that extraordinary achievement was based on race,
on the resentment of whites toward blacks. But race was not
Wallace's theme as it had been in Alabama earlier in the '60s. He
chose crime, welfare, aid to developing nations and the like -
issues his audience could easily recognize as racial without that
having to be stated. And he cynically exploited that
identification.
 &HT;    Unhappily, that success was not ignored by major party
candidates, and race continues to be exploited, as it was by
Wallace, by national candidates vehemently denying racial prejudice
and carrying no segregationist baggage. Crime and welfare are
identified by many people as race problems; after all, you need
only look at the disproportionate number of blacks in prison or on
welfare.
 &HT;    Both issues have some legitimacy irrespective of race, which
facilitates their use as surrogates for prejudice. To take only a
particularly crude example from the 1988 presidential campaign of
George Bush: the use of Willie Horton in TV ads to discredit Gov.
Michael Dukakis. Wallace claimed that none of this was about racial
hatred, and perhaps that is true.
 &HT;    But using nonracial issues, which much of the public nonetheless
sees as problems of black inferiority, exploits racial feelings for
political purposes and subverts the political process through
denial of racial prejudice. Frankly, I preferred the George Wallace
who stood in the schoolhouse door, spouting nonsense about states'
rights and the Constitution as he defended segregation. At least
that stand, however misconceived, was honest.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Supreme Court should decide Senate's impeachment
jurisdiction
 &HT;    By Jack Bass
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate must insure the integrity of the process as it
confronts the articles of impeachment against President Clinton.
The first question the Senate should address is whether it has
jurisdiction to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   If the lame-duck House of Representatives had passed any other
legislation after the election, it would be dead. Is its authority
for impeaching the president different?
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933,
shortened the time between congressional elections and members
taking office and was aimed at preventing a lame-duck Congress from
overturning the will of the people in the previous election. The
1998 election surprised pundits with its gain by congressional
Democrats. This outcome reflected national polls showing most
Americans don't want President Clinton removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The same Republicans arguing against a Senate ``rush to
judgment'' by substituting censure for an impeachment trial made
their own rush by voting for articles of impeachment before their
numbers decreased when the 106th Congress takes office on Jan. 4.
Because impeachment is a political process, the House Republican
leadership had a right to make this political decision.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a question of unresolved law, not politics, whether
under the 20th Amendment the Senate in the 106th Congress has
jurisdiction to act on articles of impeachment passed by the House
in the 105th Congress. Although the Senate received the articles of
impeachment through its clerk, the senators took no action.
</P>
<P>
   This is a situation without precedent.
</P>
<P>
   This unique constitutional question is so grave _ a matter of
removing the president _ that the Senate and the American people
deserve an answer from the most authoritative source. That clearly
is the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In an impeachment trial, the Senate acts not in a legislative
capacity, but a judicial one. It serves as judge and jury. As a
court of limited jurisdiction, the Senate lacks authority to try
the impeachment case if its action violates the 20th amendment,
even if both sides agree to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Based on established principle, the Supreme Court does not issue
advisory opinions. But the genius of the law is its adaptability.
</P>
<P>
   A rarely-used procedure of the federal courts offers a means of
resolving the legal question of jurisdiction definitively. In its
judicial capacity, the Senate could certify the matter to the
Supreme Court as a question of law.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1963
certified as a question of law to the Supreme Court whether
Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett was entitled to a jury trial for
criminal contempt because of attempting to thwart James Meredith
from breaking the racial barrier at the University of Mississippi
by enrolling under a Fifth Circuit court order. The judges on the
court of appeals had divided 4-4 on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge John R. Brown of the Fifth Circuit said this case
``must be looked upon as one of the great constitutional crises of
the United States.'' The current situation arguably amounts to a
greater crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to prevent the Senate, acting in its judicial
role, from certifying this question of law to the Supreme Court.
The Senate could ask both sides_the House managers and the
president's lawyers_to argue the case in written briefs. The
Supreme Court has the authority to accept or reject the case.
Although President Clinton as defendant has the authority to raise
the issue and get it to the Supreme Court, it would be easy for the
justices to say no_that it's the Senate's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As a legal and constitutional issue of overriding importance,
the Senate and the American people deserve to know from the highest
authority that the procedure to be followed meets the requirements
of the Constitution. That means a decision by the full Supreme
Court. The Senate and the nation might be served well by the
resultant delay providing a cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court approves Senate jurisdiction for a trial,
it can then proceed with unquestioned legitimacy. If not, the new
House of Representatives can decide whether to seek new articles of
impeachment, in the same manner as with any legislation that dies
at the end of a previous Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue against a rush to judgment are correct. Before
commencing a trial, the Senate owes it to itself and the American
people to move with dispatch to get an authoritative answer to this
unprecedented constitutional question of jurisdiction. As the final
arbiter of the constitution, the Supreme Court should accept its
responsibility to provide it.
</P>

rights, ``Unlikely Heroes'' and ``Taming the Storm.'' His most
recent book is ``Ol' Strom: An Unauthorized Biography of Strom
Thurmond,'' co-authored with Marilyn Thompson.

CHIMPS RETIRED FROM SPACE PROGRAM FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The sign says Primarily Primates. It is the only
clue that more than 500 monkeys, chimpanzees, gibbons, capuchins,
langurs and one very large orangutan are living out their
retirement behind a chain-link fence down a gravel road on the
outskirts of town.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nation's largest and oldest monkey and ape
retirement village. It's about to become home to some of the
world's most famous chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force gave up ownership of its 141-member chimp
colony last year, acknowledging the contributions of the animals
who tested the safety of space travel before man, but sending their
descendants off without a pension check.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chimps will go to a research company, some get to
retire here. But as they settle in, so does the reality that, in
the long run, there's no money to feed them, no money to care for
them, no money to build enclosures for the others.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky aren't so lucky after all.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's chimpanzee colony was born in the 1950s, when
the first animals were captured in the African jungle and brought
to the United States. They were dubbed ``the astrochimps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ham was 3 years old and 3 feet tall when scientists shot him
into space on Jan. 31, 1961. He flew at 5,000 miles an hour to a
height of 155 miles above the Earth before his space capsule
plunged into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A Marine helicopter fished the capsule out of the ocean 420
miles from where it was launched at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Scientists
found him inside _ unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Ham the chimp became the largest animal sent
into space, astronaut Alan Shepard followed him. A year later, a
chimp named Enos rode the Mercury space capsule twice around the
planet two months before John Glenn made his famous orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force credits the chimps with making inroads in space
travel. They also cite the contributions of chimp studies involving
ejection seats, G-forces and sleep deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1970s, the Air Force stopped using chimps for
research. It leased the entire colony to Albany Medical College,
which over the past 40 years has leased and loaned the chimps and
their descendants to scores of other biomedical research centers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, none of the chimps trained for space travel is alive. Ham
and Enos died in the 1980s. Minnie was the last. She died in March.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what has happened to the other Air Force chimps is
something of a mystery to the caretakers at Primarily Primates, the
9-acre sanctuary where some of the chimps will retire. Many of the
documents have been purged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the chimp research is so secretive and so harmful to
chimps that labs don't want you to know exactly what they're
doing,'' said Wally Swett, president of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Swett and his staff know that one chimp, Betty, was a subject in
sleep studies and motion sickness projects in 1964 and 1965;
nutrition and kidney studies in 1969; and eye-refraction studies
from 1963 to 1970. And they know she has been used for breeding
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   They know Penny was 8 years old when she was used for an
estrogen study, 11 when used to study arthritis, and 24 when
injected with a human breast tumor extract three times in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The few pages of biographical information provide hints about
the other chimps: Dee was inoculated with hepatitis B in 1974;
Clair underwent an experimental surgery in 1968; Violet was part of
a kidney biopsy project; Cliff was a psychology test case; Heidi
was used to study rapid decompression; Sierra was part of a puberty
study.
</P>
<P>
   Swett talks about his newest residents, the Air Force chimps,
while chopping vegetables in a yellow kitchen in a cinder-block
office. It's time for the morning feed, and blue buckets sit on the
floor around him, full of sweet potatoes, broccoli, carrots,
apples, bananas and monkey chow.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, with less than two weeks left, we did our proposal. We
literally did it the night before,'' Swett said. ``We did it
because that 31 (of the chimps) are well-deserving vets. They've
earned a well-deserved honorable discharge after years of service
to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of four founding members of Primarily Primates, Swett was
in San Antonio 20 years ago when the group took in three squirrel
monkeys whose only crime was acting like monkeys instead of the
pets their owners expected.
</P>
<P>
   Swett has watched the land behind a chain-link fence fill with
primates. His group has saved them from roadside zoos and freak
shows, animal shelters and pet farms, and research laboratories.
Forty of the retirees here are chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   One of the chimps here is from a Moscow circus, another was on
display at a Panama racetrack, and another was found in a
Pittsburgh basement, bolted to the floor by a 6-foot-long chain.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the chimps came from a Pennsylvania company's hepatitis
vaccine study. Others came from a medical school's colon cancer
studies. Seven ornery males are veterans of the Matthew Broderick
movie ``Project X.''
</P>
<P>
   One chimpanzee, Sherry, arrived with only three fingers on her
hands, and no explanation why.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials said they knew Primarily Primates had
rehabilitated chimps, and the group's experience was one factor
that helped it win possession of the chimps. The group might have
won custody of more chimps, but the 31 were all it could afford.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 110 were given to a New Mexico research center,
the Coulston Foundation, which has leased many of the chimps during
the past 40 years. The Coulston Foundation will add the Air Force
chimps to 650 others used for research in the treatment of
arthritis, AIDS, hepatitis, diabetes and Alzheimer's. It is the
largest facility of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Swett sat on the committee that tried to persuade Congress to
retire the chimps with an endowment that would ensure their care.
It would have cost taxpayers $37,000 per chimp, or $6.4 million.
But the proposal came in 1992, at a time of military cutbacks, when
Air Force employees risked losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 Air Force chimps that came to Primarily Primates
live in an enclosure built for a group of chimps that was coming
from a Louisiana lab that closed. Those chimps have been bumped to
another sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The other 21 are at the Coulston Foundation, and that's where
they'll stay until Primarily Primates builds more enclosures. If
the group doesn't raise enough money, it will have to house the
chimps in small cages, put them to sleep or give them to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary to think about,'' said Stephen Rene Tello,
corporate secretary for Primarily Primates. It's Tello's job to
worry about how the group will house, feed and care for the retired
chimps.
</P>
<P>
   His organization used to rely on publicity to stir the support
of the group's 11,000 members. But this time, the media have
focused primarily on the 110 other chimps, and the fight over their
control. A third group that lost in the bidding process has
challenged the Air Force's decision to award chimps to the Coulston
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The retiring chimps have been forgotten in the feud.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily Primates has raised money to retire tamarins, langurs,
gibbons, capuchins, even an orangutan named Punkin. But this time,
the group has $150,000. It needs $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   So Tello wrote newsletters to his group's members, and as he
did, the first 10 retirees came in a truck down the gravel road to
the sanctuary. They were lured into their new homes with apples and
marshmallows, while the male chimps in enclosures around them
strutted and posed.
</P>
<P>
   Swett and Tello learn more about them every day. Connie is
missing a finger, and Joan has a knot on her head. Clair has a lazy
left eye, Dee is affectionate, and Gigi has a steel plate where a
piece of her skull was removed.
</P>
<P>
   The chimps are adjusting well. Tello watches them interact,
climb, explore. He found them sleeping together the first night,
huddling on the same shelf to stay warm during a Texas freeze.
</P>
<P>
   This is how retirement should be, Tello says. It's a long way
from outer space.

'98 WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR UNCONVENTIONAL HOLLYWOOD FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they write the cultural history of the '90s, it seems
eminently possible 1998 could go down as one of the decade's more
audacious and interesting movie years, if not a major turning point
in the Hollywood cavalcade.
</P>
<P>
   It was a year in which more money was taken in than ever before
by a progression of bloated, overproduced and prototypically
tasteless Hollywood blockbusters: films like ``Armageddon,'' ``Deep
Impact,'' ``Dr. Doolittle'' and ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a year in which the American independent movement
produced, according to a CNN estimate, more than 1,000 films,
almost all of which were amateurish and unreleasable: an
incomparable glut of low-budget mediocrity that fueled the least
memorable Seattle International Film Festival in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the downside is that 1998 was a year in which more and
more foreign film industries edged toward collapse, including
once-healthy Hong Kong _ up until this catastrophic year the
world's second-largest film exporter.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden among all the happy statistics at year's end, a
pessimistic critic could also find unmistakable signs of an
industry in trouble: fewer tickets sold, too many screens built,
too much product for the existing audience, increasing studio
reliance on big-budget stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was also a year in which Hollywood filmmakers seemed
to launch their own in-house rebellion against the tyranny of the
system. Again and again in 1998, we saw major studio films (many of
which, sadly, failed at the box office) that at least tried to be
original, daring and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg, Warren Beatty, Brian De
Palma, Peter Weir, Steven Soderbergh, James Ivory and perhaps a
dozen others flouted the conventional wisdom of '90s filmmaking to
take huge risks and try something new in terms of story and
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The year produced perhaps the greatest barrage of unconventional
and original films since Hollywood's last golden age of the early
'70s. This was the year's true movie phenomenon. Despite Eddie
Murphy and ``Armageddon,'' Hollywood stretched itself in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly telling that in this year of impeachment and
political trauma, the movies gave us three brilliant and
entertaining political comedies _ ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Primary
Colors'' and ``Bulworth'' _ that collectively define our national
malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The year also seemed to produce at least one excellent film in
every genre, including one of the greatest war films of all time
(``Saving Private Ryan''); the most captivating swashbuckler in
ages (``The Mask of Zorro''); an exquisitely touching western
(``The Horse Whisperer''); and a shrewdly seductive intellectual
thriller (``The Spanish Prisoner'').
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year in the '90s in which I had no trouble
coming up with a 10-best list.
</P>
<P>
   In no particular order (and leaving out films like ``The
Apostle'' and ``Wag the Dog,'' which opened in '98 but are
officially 1997 releases), my favorites were:
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth _ This hilarious, uniquely thought-provoking political
satire about an imbalanced U.S. senator who challenges the system
was the year's most daring and outrageous comedy and a film that
could have only been made by a director/star with Warren Beatty's
clout, audacity and liberal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan _ Steven Spielberg's World War II epic about
a squad of soldiers on a dubious mission just after the Normandy
landings is one of Hollywood's greatest war movies: perhaps the
only one that has ever captured the true horror and utter
helplessness of combat.
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries _ This exquisite domestic drama
based on the life of expatriate author James Jones in Paris of the
'60s was the most successful Merchant-Ivory production in years and
that rare Hollywood film that actually celebrates a functional
family.
</P>
<P>
   Nights of Cabiria _ The seven-minute ``lost'' sequence added to
Fellini's 1957 masterpiece made this revival the one ``director's
cut'' that justifies itself: the new footage helped fill out the
heroine's character, sharpened Giuletta Masina's immortal
performance and made a great film even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on a Hard Body _ Shot on video with a budget of about 50
cents, this account of a bizarre endurance contest sponsored by a
small-town Texas auto dealer was often brilliant, always totally
engrossing and hands down the year's best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight _ Steven Soderbergh turned Elmore Leonard's caper
novel into an off-beat and totally entertaining star vehicle that
was visually innovative, structurally fragmented, and wonderfully
determined to go against expectations at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Leading Man _ Almost no one saw it, but John Duigan's slice
of West End London life was arguably the movies' most thoroughly
enjoyable, intellectually intriguing and effortlessly sexy
contemporary backstage theater comedy-drama since ``All About
Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare in Love _ This Oscar-bound, what-if romantic comedy
about the Bard of Avon finding the inspiration he needs to write
``Romeo and Juliet'' was a voluptuous romance, a delightfully goofy
historical pastiche and the year's most witty and sophisticated
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show _ Jim Carrey pulled off the year's most
remarkable change-of-pace role as the poor soul who discovers he's
the subject of a reality-based TV show in this funny and profoundly
moving religious parable directed by Peter Weir.
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro _ Who says Hollywood can't make a rousing,
romantic, utterly irresistible historical swashbuckler of the old
school? The movies' umpteenth retelling of the legend of the Robin
Hood of Old California was all of this and more.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORST
</P>
<P>
   And (also in no particular order), the 10 worst were:
</P>
<P>
   Vampires _ John Carpenter's latest movie bloodbath was a
disturbing parable that deliriously communicates the joy of ethnic
cleansing (the victims are vampires, but they look and die just
like people) and seems otherwise designed to bring out the absolute
worst in its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved _ This endless, almost incomprehensible, Oprah
Winfrey-produced film version of Toni Morrison's post-Civil War
novel almost requires a second viewing to fully appreciate what a
botched job of basic storytelling it was. The year's biggest
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon _ It may be the year's biggest grosser, but this
grindingly unoriginal, $100 million video game about the near-end
of the planet was moronic, filled with overblown and unnecessary
special effects and annoyingly played for wisecracky guffaws and
chest-pounding heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Krippendorf's Tribe _ This lewd, scatalogical, shockingly amoral
and numbingly overacted (by star Richard Dreyfuss) farce about an
anthropology professor who fakes a research project was the new
Disney company's idea of fun for the whole family in '98.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals _ Ploddingly scripted, unimaginatively directed
and agonizingly predictable, this continuation of 1993's ``The
Fugitive'' _ with Tommy Lee Jones back as Inspector Gerard _
outdistanced ``Speed 2'' as the decade's worst sequel to a good
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wide Awake/Simon Birch _ Something about the sheer clumsiness
with which these two films _ both about the consciousness-raising
of a young boy _ were calculated to be ``inspirational'' makes them
stick in the mind as landmarks in uninspired movie sappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Mafia!/BASEketball _ These two comedies from the Zuker-Abrahams
gang _ the first a spoof of ``The Godfather,'' the second a send-up
of professional sports in America _ proved that the strain of movie
satire that began with ``Airplane!'' 18 years ago has now been
completely played out.
</P>
<P>
   The Impostors _ Few comedies of 1998 fell quite as flat as this
Stanley Tucci-directed farce about two '30s-era New York actors on
the run who take refuge on an ocean liner populated by the most
charmless and unfunny ensemble of characters since ``Ship of
Fools.''
</P>
<P>
   The Odd Couple II _ Talk about beating a dead horse. This
collection of tasteless old-age jokes _ the nadir of the '90s
Matthau-Lemmon ``Grumpy Old Men'' cycle _ was so depressingly
vulgar and painful to endure that it erased all one's good memories
of the Neil Simon original.
</P>
<P>
   Two Guys and a Girl _ James Toback's three-character ode to
love-and-commitment in the '90s was an incomparably bad movie: so
shallow and empty, so overflowing with pretentious and unbelievable
dialogue, and finally so boring, that it played like a slap to the
face.
</P>
<P>

on Long Island,'' ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' ``The Horse Whisperer''

LOOKING AT THE '98 TV SEASON, CONSIDER SHOWS' OTTER POSSIBILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spawning a hit show isn't easy. TV series fail for all sorts of
reasons. Bad writing. Bad acting. Bad scheduling. Bad breath.
</P>
<P>
   Even bad lettering can doom a promising show. For want of the
right consonant or vowel, a show can shrivel and die before the
audience has had the chance to embrace it and love it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these 10, all of which premiered during a hit-starved
1998 but will never see 1999 because their titles may have been off
by just one letter.
</P>
<P>
   1. Original title: ``The Closer.'' Should have been: ``The
Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of playing a hotshot ad executive in another ho-hum
workplace comedy, Tom Selleck could have plowed fertile new ground
as a middle-age gay man who strikes out on his own in the cutthroat
world of personal-organization specialists.
</P>
<P>
   2. Original title: ``Prey.'' Should have been: ``Trey.''
</P>
<P>
   The original premise was on the right track, focusing on a new
superspecies of humanoid that threatened to eat the rest of us
mortals for lunch. With a more straightforward title, and with
William Gates III playing himself, this series might have opened
new doors (and a few windows) in television drama.
</P>
<P>
   3. Original title: ``Maximum Bob.'' Should have been: ``Maximum
Bod.'
</P>
<P>
   Beau Bridges was enjoyable as Elmore Leonard's quirky Southern
judge, but Pamela Anderson Lee might have fleshed out the role more
fully.
</P>
<P>
   4. Original title: ``Kelly Kelly.'' Should have been: ``Kelly
Killy.''
</P>
<P>
   This sitcom from The WB had Shelley Long playing a stuffy
academic (first name: Kelly) who marries an earthy fireman (last
name: Kelly). With a simple title revision, the network could have
tapped into that elusive 18-to-72-year-old demographic hooked on
aging French skiers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Original title: ``Ask Harriet.'' Should have been: ``Ash
Harriet.''
</P>
<P>
   This undercooked turkey on Fox was about a male sportswriter who
gets canned but manages to stay employed by masquerading as a
female advice columnist. Big yawn. If it had been about a woman who
disposes of cremated remains _ no matter the risk or the prevailing
winds _ wouldn't you have tuned in?
</P>
<P>
   6. Original title: ``Push.'' Should have been: ``Tush.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC could have kept the original premise: world-class athletes
striving to make it to the Olympics. A more honest title would have
avoided confusion among those who thought it was about drug
dealers, thus guaranteeing more viewers tuning in to see those
spandex-wrapped glutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Original title: ``House Rules.'' Should have been: ``Horse
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC missed a bet by packaging this as another monotonous buddy
comedy. Had it gone with the recent trend toward courtroom shows,
complete with Mr. Ed as the presiding judge, it might have a
stableful of Emmys by now.
</P>
<P>
   8. Original title: ``The Simple Life.'' Should have been: ``The
Wimple Life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of two Martha Stewart sendups CBS tried in '98. (The
other was ``Style &AMP; Substance.'') Neither caught on. But if Judith
Light had played a nun with a penchant for gilding the convent's
doorknobs, CBS might have something to run in place of ``Becker.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Original title: ``Damon.'' Should have been ``Demon.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon Wayans as an undercover cop? Mildly amusing, but hampered
by unreasonable expectations when a show is named after the star.
With Wayans playing the keeper of hell's fire, the pressure is off
and it's only a matter of time before he's reunited with Jim
Carrey's bizarro fire inspector from their ``In Living Color''
days.
</P>
<P>
   10. Original title: ``Significant Others.'' Should have been:
``Significant Otters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than another steamy soaper a la ``Melrose Place,'' Fox
would have been wise to go with its current strength: reality-based
programming such as ``World's Wildest, Wackiest, Scariest
Refrigerator Magnets,'' or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Who could possibly resist a weekly series about the mating
habits of a dysfunctional family of web-footed aquatic mammals?
</P>
<P>
   Ok, so here's my favorite new shows of 1998:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Sports Night,'' ABC. Smart, fast-paced and oh-so-appealing.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Maximum Bob,'' ABC. Dared to be wacky and politically
incorrect, and it got the ax.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Felicity,'' The WB. Keri Russell gives the savviest network
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Cupid,'' ABC. Cool idea from newcomer Rob Thomas; an
Emmy-worthy effort by Jeremy Piven.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Dawson's Creek,'' The WB. Slowing down a bit, but it was an
auspicious start.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC. Supporting players lift this one above
the mass of mediocrity.

   PERMANENT-COLLECTIONS (New York) _ In terms of material things,
there's no place like New York and no time like the Christmas
holidays. The movement of people heading for the city's major
blockbuster art exhibitions in their final days produces
object-oriented human gridlock. Right now it feels like the whole
world is here on a class trip. If you desire an esthetic experience
that doesn't threaten life and limb, the city is rife with
relatively quiet, empty places to contemplate outstanding works of
art and related visual phenomena, places slightly or way off the
beaten path _ be they the less-popular galleries of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Brooklyn Museum of Art; the
city's only indoor earthwork (Walter DeMaria's ``New York Earth
Room'' in Chelsea) or the great scale model of New York City at the
Queens Museum of Art. By Roberta Smith.

   HOLIDAY-MOVIES (Undated) _ Critic's notebook: To a movie critic,
the holiday season now ending might be summed up in a single
Shakespearean phrase: ``the winter of our discontent.'' Hollywood
has come up sadly short this season in releasing movies that
combine mass appeal with high artistic merit. End-of-the-year
crowd-pleasers like ``Stepmom,'' ``Patch Adams,'' and ``You've Got
Mail'' are no match against ``Titanic,'' ``Good Will Hunting'' and
``As Good as It Gets,'' the previous holiday season's prestige
blockbusters. For audiences in search of holiday movies, here are
10 films currently playing that are worth a look. They are listed
in order of preference, with special attention given to worthy,
underrated acting performances. By Stephen Holden.

PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE EMPLOYEES ALSO A DANGER AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Workplace violence has become such a powerful
concern in recent years that a phrase, now almost a cliche, has
been added to the office lexicon: ``going postal.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is workplace murders that draw most of the media's
attention, they are rare compared with the work force weaponry of
passive aggression: gossip, rudeness, condescension and the cold
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Employees smart enough to realize that shoving or threats leave
the door open for easy retaliation have adopted covert ways to get
back at supervisors, colleagues, subordinates or the entire
company, according to a new study that examines who commits these
misdemeanors and why.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists and employee assistance programs see the traumatic
results of aggression in their counseling sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come in daily _ and I'm not exaggerating _ with
stories of what bosses have done to them, what co-workers and
subordinates have done to them, what customers have done to them,''
said Rudy Nydegger, a clinical psychologist in private practice and
professor of psychology and management at Union College in
Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harmful, in so far that it interferes with job
satisfaction or morale,'' he said. ``This will impact people's
willingness to be at work, willingness to go the extra mile. It may
go so far as to impact productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Baron, a professor of management and psychology at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Joel H. Neuman, director of the
Center for Applied Management at the State University of New York
at New Paltz, and Temple University professor Deanna Geddes
surveyed 452 anonymous employees in six states to test their
central hypothesis that hostility and difficult behavior, like
``dirty looks'' or failing to return a call, are far more common
than threats or physical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers anticipated one finding _ that workplace
violence is not rampant _ they also learned more about the factors
behind hidden aggression: that perceived injustice is strongly
associated with such hostility, which tends to be committed by
society's high achievers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers' findings will be published in the scientific
journal Aggressive Behavior this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Baron, the author of 39 textbooks, including ``Human
Aggression,'' said he began to grow concerned about six years ago
when he started reading media accounts of violence, which he feared
was beginning to suggest an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, three dozen people have died over the past 13 years at
post offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But disgruntled co-workers account for just 4 to 6 percent of
1,000 workplace deaths reported annually, according to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. Postal Service now bears the brunt of the
violent stereotype, Neuman maintains there is no evidence to
demonstrate that the post office, the largest civilian employer,
has an inherent condition that triggers violence.
</P>
<P>
   He and his co-researchers set out to tally the daily aggression
that is much more familiar to employees. (If a Top 10 list of
pettiness can seem harmless or even comical, remember the last time
someone seemed to grimace when you made a suggestion at a staff
meeting.)
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, more than a quarter of employees said they are
occasionally on the receiving end of some hostility once a month or
less: belittling criticism or backbiting, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer _ 16 percent _ said they are the occasional victims of
roadblocks, such as the missing memo or being overlooked for
meetings. Only 2.7 percent said they experience overt aggression _
assault, theft or threats.
</P>
<P>
   Perceived unfairness prompts these acts, the researchers found,
and the people who commit them have a surprising profile: They tend
to have Type A personalities. Perfectionists, yes, but also
hurried, pressured and irritable.
</P>
<P>
   These passive-aggressive retaliations, much like a spouse's
selective memory about doing their half of the chores, exact losses
that can't be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the last time you withheld a cost-saving suggestion,
merely out of spite. ``This doesn't show up on a balance sheet,''
said Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   Covert aggression ``siphons off human energy. The energy ought
to be going to the job. I shouldn't be worrying about what the
person in the next office is going to do to me,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   Both passive and aggressive people need lessons in
assertiveness, said Erica Sufrin, an associate professor at Albany
Medical College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's direct communication, it's timely communication, it's
polite communication, it's clear communication. It's communication
that gets you where you want to go,'' said Sufrin.
</P>
<P>
   Passive people get stuck because they fear confrontation. One of
my jobs is to show them how to interact assertively and not have
confrontation,'' he said. ``For the aggressive folks, there's a lot
of emphasis on putting into words, early on, what they are feeling,
to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era that has seen its share of staff shortages and
downsizing, counselors and researchers say that the powerful, free
tools of courtesy and respect go a long way toward minimizing
workplace trespasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just saying you're sorry when something terrible happens to an
employee can go a long way to reduce some of that anger,'' said
Neuman.

TRANSMONTAIGNE OPENS BEACHHEAD IN UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN D. ABBEY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENSSELAER, N.Y. _ TransMontaigne Inc., a major player in the
national oil distribution industry, has opened a beachhead in
upstate New York with the idea of linking it to a growing national
network that could include future local acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based firm said its TransMontaigne Terminaling Inc.
unit has purchased the Sunoco Inc. petroleum products terminal
located on the Hudson River at Rensselaer.
</P>
<P>
   Sale price of the operation was not released, in part because
details of the deal include Sunoco's continued use of the facility
for trucking and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   TransMontaigne president Richard Gathright said the Sunoco
purchase comes on the heels of his company's purchase of a major
Northeast and mid-Atlantic distribution operation from Louis
Dreyfus Energy Corp. of Wilton, Conn. The Dreyfus unit, whose
closest terminal is in New York City, is part of the global S.A.
Louis Dreyfus &AMP; Cie. of France.
</P>
<P>
   Gathright said the Sunoco facility ``is really to support an
existing business for our company. Our whole goal is to put
together a supply network for major oil companies. Our grid is now
from the Rockies to the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunoco spokesman Bud Davis said the terminal had been on the
market for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Gathright said the firm is looking at other local facilities and
businesses for possible acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Sunoco will continue to use the facilities under a long-term
terminal services agreement and will base its local trucking
operation there.
</P>
<P>
   The Rensselaer terminal facilities include 510,000 barrels of
storage capacity, three truck-loading racks and a recently rebuilt
dock capable of handling both barges and ocean-going tankers.
Products currently handled at the facility include premium and
regular gasoline, low-sulfur diesel and heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   TransMontaigne, operating through wholly owned subsidiaries,
provides services to the petroleum and chemical industry from
locations of production and manufacture to utilization.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hoovers Inc., TransMontaigne gathers, transports,
stores and markets refined petroleum products and crude oil. It has
four natural gas gathering and processing facilities that are
capable of processing 85 million cu. ft. of natural gas a day.
</P>
<P>
   The company's TransMontaigne Transportation Services subsidiary
owns and operates more than 740 miles of oil pipeline, as well as
10 storage facilities in seven states with a total storage capacity
of about 4.8 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with 375 employees, had fiscal 1998 sales of $1.97
billion, up 69 percent from the previous year. Net income was $7.6
million, with profit growth of 17.4 percent.

<P>
   Giants are beginning to walk the earth.
</P>
<P>
   They are coming in the form of $1 trillion companies, uniting on
a global scale from top-flight leaders in individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't conglomerates, multinationals or merger
creations. They are a breed of business much sleeker, more powerful
and easier to group and run together.
</P>
<P>
   They're ``alliances.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have been exploding in the 1990s, said author Cyrus
Friedheim, vice chairman of corporate consultant Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton. The new enterprises will focus all their resources on
dominating one, or a few, fields. They will restructure whole
industries, change their economics, and turn the basis of
competition upside down, Friedheim writes. They will, collectively,
have all the capabilities necessary to win in a tough, competitive,
global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Friedheim writes his observations of the new business form in an
enlightening book, ``The Trillion-Dollar Enterprise: How the
Alliance Revolution Will Transform Global Business'' (Perseus
Books, 253 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   An alliance, simply put, is a group of companies that form a
network that, in turn, operates as a single company. But the
grouping is far more efficient, especially in use of its capital,
than the typical merger and acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   As Friedheim writes: ``It is consolidation without huge
investment, battles over ownership, postmerger headaches, and
regrets. The investment dollars can go into building market
positions, new products, capacity, and capabilities for enterprises
rather than for shares of an acquired company.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliances are also far easier in global operations, Friedheim
writes. The headaches over starting a company's presence abroad or
working with foreign regulatory boards in an acquisition can be
avoided when striking this other form of relationship agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are finding this method appealing, Friedheim
writes. He labels the 1990s as the dawn of the age of
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, more than 10,000 alliance formations were being made
annually. The rate is expected to double by the turn of the
century, Friedheim writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving from highly parochial, well-guarded,
impermeable, turf-conscious castles to collegial, sharing,
permeable, flexible, moving areas of influence and
responsibility,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Who is doing this? Friedheim sprinkles numerous examples
throughout his book, including such efforts as General Motors and
Toyota building a plant in Fremont, Calif. Pepsi and Lipton have
aligned to put Lipton products in Pepsi's distribution system. An
example found in the Fort Worth-Dallas area is the planned
agreement between British Airways and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Another major source of alliance agreements is with the major
emerging market of China. Virtually any new business in China has
to work with a partner in the country, Freidheim says.
</P>
<P>
   Along that line, Freidheim writes that of the 20,000 alliances
formed globally between 1994 and 1996, about 75 percent were made
across national borders. Interestingly, the United States trails
the rest of the world in these global alliances, producing only
about 54 percent of its total during that time. In comparison, 90
percent of alliances in Europe and the Pacific Rim were made across
borders.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, however, alliances in the United States have
taken hold, Friedheim writes. In 1998, the U.S. average more than
doubled to more than $50 million in alliance investments from the
year before. But this country still lags in its skills for this
type of deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should expect very high growth in alliance activity in the
United States, a relative newcomer, as it catches up to Europe and
Asia,'' Freidheim writes. But ``European and Asian companies
indicated (in a survey) that their U.S. counterparts were behind in
the critical skills of integration planning and implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the need to read Friedheim's book, which provides not only
an excellent overview of a major business trend, but also a
textbook look at how to form the alliances, and then manage them.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers two looks at the future of the huge partnerships,
one bright and one dark, that provide thought-provoking
possibilities that economists, politicians and other people of
influence should analyze in the wake of the emerging giants.

   ``If It's Broken, You Can Fix It: Overcoming Dysfunction in the
Workplace''
</P>
<P>
   By Tom E. Jones
</P>
<P>
   AMACOM, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Do any of your employees have unstable relationships, harmful
habits, poor organization or lack of confidence or are unable to
make good choices? Chances are good that they may be what
behavioral scientists call ``dysfunctional.'' Organizational
development specialist Tom Jones discusses the increasing problem
of dysfunctional people in the work force, an area where typical
management concepts will likely fail. The book discusses how to
identify dysfunctional people and how to get the most out of them.

   ``Kiplinger's Practical Guide to Your Money''
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Miller
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger Washington Editors, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   Author Ted Miller is the editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance
Magazine. In this book, he discusses money from soup to nuts,
covering all of the basics, including buying a home, car, college
education, life and health insurance and investments. With 720
pages, this book does more than just supply simple answers. But the
book is still just a primer, albeit a well-done one; don't expect
in-depth coverage.

   ``The Five Temptations of a CEO: A Leadership Fable''
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Lencioni
</P>
<P>
   Jossey-Bass, $20
</P>
<P>
   This is the first business fiction piece by Patrick Lencioni,
president of a management consulting firm based in San Francisco,
but the plot line is similar to other books written to illustrate
business situations. A lone chief executive officer, troubled about
an impending board meeting in the morning, finds hope and
redemption talking to a janitor on a train home. A quick read that
might touch a few managers, if they bother to read it.

SAN FRANCISCO REOPENS CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When San Francisco's City Hall, the peoples'
palace, reopens its gilt doors Jan. 5 for the first time in four
years, old-timers will recognize the place _ bits of it, that is.
</P>
<P>
   They'll find the mayor back in his usual spot in the east wing;
the Board of Supervisors in the west; and the city attorney in her
southeast corner alongside the mayor _ though only with some of her
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all other departments and hearing rooms have shifted
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by architect Arthur Brown in the French Renaissance
style, City Hall is considered by many experts to be San
Francisco's most beautiful structure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the building, which was constructed in 1915, had
become obsolete in an age when everyone from high officials to low
clerks need computers, FAX machines and video equipment to
function.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake rattled plaster from the walls,
drove the mayor and supervisors out to temporary quarters and
forced $293 million in renovations to the old domed building.
</P>
<P>
   While less conspicuous than the glittering gold leaf on City
Hall's restored dome, which rises to 301 feet, higher than that of
the nation's Capitol, many details now enrich the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Three early-day birdcage style elevators, out of service for as
long as most people can remember, have been restored to public use,
re-gilded and outfitted with high-speed cabs. Lead crystal
chandeliers have been recast in southwestern France and oak
paneling has been installed here and there to improve acoustics and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Airy sky-lighted spaces on the main floor will be open to the
public. High above, on the fourth floor, hand-crafted architectural
details provide the wandering mind a break from the daily grind of
city business.
</P>
<P>
   On the first floor, the awesomely scaled rotunda, together with
the grand stairway that leads to the Board of Supervisors chamber,
has been cleaned and polished. The offices of the assessor and
recorder are still on the first floor but take less space than in
the old days. Some of their staffs have been moved to an upper
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling changes affect the building's first floor
light courts, areas rarely seen by the general public. As City
Hall's bureaucracy grew in size, these huge (60 feet by 120 feet)
skylit spaces became off limits to the public as they came to be
crammed with desks. They are now open spaces, available for
walk-throughs, receptions, exhibits or simply adding to the
esoteric experience of a palatial interior.
</P>
<P>
   The south light court is being outfitted for exhibits as a
museum of San Francisco history.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the first floor, gold-trimmed birdcage-style
elevators have been rebuilt to high-speed velocity. None has been
available for public use for many years. There are six other
elevators of more recent vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown and his assistants will occupy the same
second-floor suite overlooking Civic Center and Polk Street as the
city's mayors before him. A new addition to the executive suite is
a large conference room intended as a place where the mayor can
meet department heads and hold negotiation sessions with the likes
of labor leaders and real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Manus, principal architect of the team that designed the
renovation, said the public will find a City Hall that has been
``brought it back to its original glory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-opening tour, Manus pointed out details that otherwise
might go unnoticed by the casual visitor: new chandeliers that
conceal fluorescent lights and are operated by motion detectors;
new carpeting; the addition of two stairways between the basement
and first floor; a surrounding concrete moat, part of the seismic
reinforcement project, that would allow the huge structure to move
several feet during a major earthquake; and accessibility ramps for
handicapped persons on the second floor.

BRENDA BLETHYN: MOMMIE WRETCHED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Brenda Blethyn got an Oscar nomination for her
performance as a rough-edged, foul-talking working-class mother who
had deserted her baby daughter in ``Secrets &AMP; Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother she plays in ``Little Voice'' makes her ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies'' character look like Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first read it, I said to Mark (Herman), the director,
this person is so big, so loud, so larger than life, that I don't
want that to be confused with the performance,'' Blethyn said on a
recent visit to Houston. ``I was worried that the perception of the
performance might be over the top rather than the character being
over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman told her not to worry about it, and that was all the
go-ahead Blethyn needed to cut loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't try to pull it back,'' she said, with an
aren't-I-naughty grin and a twinkle in her eyes. ``I took a deep
breath and went for it. She is horribly, embarrassingly over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   In style, Blethyn, 52, seems unlike her characters in either
movie. She has a strong English accent, but it's no match for the
sludge-thick inflection with which she coats her salty dialogue in
``Little Voice.'' Her real-life manner is subdued and dignified,
although quite capable of rattling off a good giggle now and then.
She's even a nonsmoker, something that will amaze those who have
seen her venting away in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn was little known internationally before ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies,'' but she was already popular in England, where she has
starred in a couple of TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been out of work, touch wood, and I've done a vast
amount of television and mainly theater, national theater, West
End,'' she said, adding, as though I might suspect she's
exaggerating, ``I got Best Television Comedy actress.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some folks in England would say she is a comedian,
rather than a dramatic actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any difference in playing comedy or drama, except
the story,'' Blethyn said. ``You still have to be honest in
whatever situation. The characters have always got to be rooted in
reality, whatever you are doing. Otherwise, it's not funny. It's
not one's responsibility to bother with (the story).''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Little Voice,'' one of the more unusual films of the year,
she is the mother of an introverted young woman who sits in her
room, never talking, but who is capable of singing in the style _
both voice and mannerisms _ of famous performers such as Judy
Garland, Shirley Bassey or even Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter, called Little Voice, is played uncannily by
British star Jane Horrocks, who actually does all the voices, as
she did when the film was a play.
</P>
<P>
   With a sleazy talent agent, played with oily perfection by
Michael Caine, the mother tries to force Little Voice to become a
cabaret star. Horrocks' stage performances in the movie are amazing
to watch _ even for such seasoned actors as Blethyn and Caine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she first did the nightclub scene, Michael and I sat
there. She finished one number _ it was Shirley Bassey _ and
Michael and I looked at each other, and our eyes were full of tears
because it was so wonderful. Good thing the camera wasn't on us,
because that's totally the wrong reaction (for our characters).''
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn says she doesn't ``want to turn my back on theater or
television'' but since ``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' films have kept her
busy. She's made several movies not seen in the United States,
including one co-starring Kris Kristofferson. And she has finished
a few since ``Little Voice,'' including ``Daddy'' and ``Them,''
co-starring Ben Affleck, Laura Dern and Andy Griffith, and written
and directed by Billy Bob Thornton (``Sling Blade''). It's due out
in 1999.

AUTHOR DAZZLES WITH CHOCOLATE COOKBOOK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See FOOD-CHOCOLATE-RECIPES) 
 
By DAI HUYNH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rich and smooth, chocolate tickles the throat and
seduces the senses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love chocolate not only because it tastes so good, but
it also feels so good. It's just one of those things that
captivates people,'' pastry guru Nick Malgieri says.
</P>
<P>
   Malgieri's love affair with the cocoa bean started long before
the prestigious Peter Kump's New York Cooking School named him
baking program director.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would buy me chocolate bars as a little boy,''
recalls the New Jersey native.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the first-generation Italian-American started stockpiling
chocolate recipes while his teen-age buddies were collecting Marvel
comics and U.S. stamps. So it's a little wonder the 51-year-old
Malgieri wrote ``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to Extravagant
Showstoppers'' (HarperCollins, $40).
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary goal was to put all those chocolate recipes in one
place so I can get to them easily,'' he says, only half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by glossy color photographs, the richly illustrated
book is a chocolate bible. It features 380 chocolate recipes,
ranging from crusty pies and creamy puddings to melt-in-your-mouth
cookies and elaborate cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to collect my thoughts on chocolate and share them
because I think some of what I do with chocolate is unique,''
Malgieri says.
</P>
<P>
   Adding new twists to old standards is Malgieri's signature. Take
his simplified version of the Swiss chocolate meringue cookies, for
example. The traditional recipe requires whipping the egg whites,
then pouring hot sugar syrup over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare to do,'' says Malgieri, who discovered that
heating and whipping the sugar and egg whites together works just
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot more simpler and straightforward to do, but it
doesn't sacrifice the essential taste or texture of the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with simple step-by-step recipes using three or
four ingredients are challenging creations such as the lavish
yogurt poppyseed cake with white chocolate frosting and a luscious
frozen chocolate bourbon souffl.
</P>
<P>
   Among Malgieri's favorites are the Supernatural Brownies, a
discovery he stumbled upon while making a batch of old-fashioned
brownies for a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make enough for everyone, I increased all the ingredients
by 50 percent _ except for the flour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't just take the brownies out of the pan and add a cup
of flour. They were already in the oven.''
</P>
<P>
   The brownies ended up even fudgier and were a hit with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find recipes all over if you're looking,'' Malgieri
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Take the time he found a recipe for ``the world's greatest
brownies'' scribbled on an index card next to a train-station
garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   And once, Malgieri bribed a Sicilian abbess with a food
processor in exchange for a pistachio couscous recipe. ``It's
unique in all the world. I was trying like crazy to get this
recipe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they didn't give me the recipe, but they did produce the
nun that makes the recipe, and she was willing to answer questions
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether making couscous or chocolate eclairs, Malgieri
recommends using the best ingredients available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make something good out of ingredients that aren't
good,'' he says.

SUPERNATURAL BROWNIES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   From ``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to Extravagant
Showstoppers'' by Nick Malgieri (HarperCollins, $40). Although the
name sounds like an exaggeration, you'll agree that these brownies
are absolutely out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
2 sticks unsalted butter, plus more for greasing pan &QL; 
8 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, cut into 1/4-inch
pieces &QL; 
4 large eggs &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 cup each: granulated sugar and firmly packed dark brown sugar &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract &QL; 
1 cup flour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350
degrees. Prepare a 13-by-9-by-2-inch pan: Grease inside of pan with
butter. Line pan with parchment or foil; grease parchment with
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Bring pot with 3 inches of water to a boil; turn off heat. Place
2 sticks butter and chocolate in small, deep stainless-steel bowl;
set bowl in water. Stir until butter and chocolate melt.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, boil water in bottom pot of double boiler; turn
off heat. Place butter and chocolate in top pot. Or place butter
and chocolate in microwave-safe bowl and microwave on medium,
stopping every 30 seconds to stir, until butter and chocolate are
melted. (Melted chocolate will hold its shape in the microwave, so
stirring frequently is essential to prevent burning.)
</P>
<P>
   Whisk eggs together in a large bowl, then whisk in salt, sugars
and vanilla. Stir in chocolate mixture, then fold in flour.
</P>
<P>
   Pour batter into pan and spread evenly. Bake 45 minutes until
top forms a shiny crust and batter is moderately firm. Cool in pan
on a rack. Wrap pan with plastic wrap and keep at room temperature,
or refrigerate it until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   To cut brownies, invert pan onto a cutting board, remove
parchment, and place a second cutting board on top. Turn brownies
right-side-up and trim away edges. Cut brownies into 2-inch
squares. Serve brownies on their own, with ice cream or with a hot
fudge sauce. To store, wrap brownies individually and keep at room
temperature in a tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid.
Or freeze them.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 24 brownies. If you have a 12-by-18-by-2-inch commercial
half-sheet cake pan, this recipe doubles easily.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: Add 2 cups chopped walnuts or pecans (1/2 pound) to
the batter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CRISP CHOCOLATE BISCOTTI &QL; 
 &QL; 
From ``Chocolate.'' This is based on a recipe by Ellen Baumwoll,
proprietor of Bijoux Doux in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
2/3 cup alkalized (Dutch process) unsweetened cocoa powder &QL; 
2 teaspoons baking powder &QL; 
Pinch of salt &QL; 
1 1/4 cups sugar &QL; 
1 1/2 cups chopped skinned hazelnuts or walnuts &QL; 
4 large eggs &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract &QL; 
 &QL; 
Set rack at middle level of oven and preheat to 325 degrees. Line 2
baking sheets or jelly-roll pans with parchment or foil. Mix flour,
cocoa, baking powder and salt; sift mixture into a mixing bowl.
Stir in sugar and hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk eggs and vanilla together, and stir into flour mixture to
form a dough. On a lightly floured surface, press dough together.
Divide dough in half, and roll each half into a log nearly the
length of the pan (14 to 18 inches). Place each log on a pan, and
flatten slightly. Bake 30 minutes, until logs have risen and are
firm. Cool logs in pans.
</P>
<P>
   After logs have cooled, lift them from parchment and diagonally
cut each into 1/2-inch-thick slices with a serrated knife. Place
biscotti, cut side down, on parchment-lined pans, and bake another
20 minutes until dry and crisp. Cool in pans.
</P>
<P>
   Serve biscotti with coffee, ice cream or red wine. Store in a
tin or plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. Makes about 4
dozen biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: For Chocolate Espresso Biscotti, add 3 tablespoons
instant espresso powder to flour mixture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
INSTANT CHOCOLATE MOUSSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From ``Chocolate.'' This dessert is ready in only a few minutes;
it needs only time to chill before serving.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
1 (16-ounce) bar bittersweet chocolate &QL; 
1 cup whipping cream &QL; 
2 tablespoons dark rum, other liquor or strong coffee &QL; 
4 egg whites &QL; 
1/2 cup sugar &QL; 
 &QL; 
Use a paring knife or vegetable peeler to shave 6 curls of
chocolate from bar. Chop chocolate bar into 1/4-inch pieces. In
heavy saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to boil. Remove from
heat. Add chocolate; let stand a few minutes. Whisk mixture until
smooth, and pour into a large bowl. Whisk rum into mixture; cool to
room temperature. Do not allow to solidify; if it does, warm bowl
briefly in a larger bowl of warm tap water and stir smooth with a
rubber spatula.
</P>
<P>
   When mixture has cooled, combine egg whites and sugar in mixer
bowl and place over a pan of simmering water, whisking constantly,
until egg whites are hot and sugar has dissolved. Use electric
mixer to whip into a meringue; mixture will cool and inflate in
volume. Do not overbeat, or egg whites will become dry.
</P>
<P>
   Fold meringue into chocolate mixture, and spoon into 6 stemmed
glasses or (6-cup) serving bowl. Garnish with chocolate shavings
just before serving. Makes about 1 quart mousse (6 generous
servings).
</P>
<P>
   Variations:
</P>
<P>
   Instant Milk Chocolate Mousse: Substitute milk chocolate for
bittersweet chocolate. Decrease sugar to 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Instant White Chocolate Mousse: Substitute white chocolate for
bittersweet chocolate. Decrease sugar to 1/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Striped Parfaits of Chocolate Mousse: In stemmed glasses,
alternate layers of white, milk and dark chocolate mousses. Garnish
with mixed white, milk and dark chocolate shavings.

IN WINTER, EXERCISE A LITTLE MORE CARE ON THE HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Saturday, Jan. 2, 1999   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (If the material presented here today looks familiar, it is
because the author has offered winter driving advice in this space
before and continues to do so annually.)
</P>
<P>
   In New England along about now, snow is likely, covering
windshields and roads. We can expect, as a matter of course,
freezing rain, sleet, wet snow, powdery snow, wet roads, icy roads,
an overabundance of salt and sand on the roadway, slush, slop,
bitter winds, and other winter miseries _ sometimes all in the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   You can't do anything about the weather, but you can help
yourself cope with it. There are two common hazards in winter
driving: 1. Poor visibility; 2. Reduced traction. There are a
couple of universal rules that apply: 1. Start early and take your
time; 2. Don't make any sudden moves.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility is something you can improve. That ice or snow on the
windows is an obvious place to start. Start the engine, turn the
heater on to its highest temperature setting, and put it in the
defrost mode. Turn on the electric rear-window defroster, if you
have one. If it is just frost on the glass, start scraping the side
windows while the windshield is getting warmed by the defroster _
do the windshield last; it will have had time to warm and will be
the easiest.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to clean side view mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   With snow, start with the roof, then the windows, then the front
and rear deck, then the lights and bumper areas.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just the windows and let nature take care of the rest?
What you leave on the roof may slide off and block your rear view;
it may fly off and bother another driver. What you leave on a rear
deck may slide down to the bumper, depending upon the shape of the
car. Today's bumpers act like shelves on many cars, holding snow
and blocking tail or stop lights. If you don't pay attention to
keeping bumpers and lights clear, those following may never know
you're trying to stop until it's too late. And you might earn a
citation _ the court kind, not the award kind.
</P>
<P>
   If you are driving in rain, snow, fog, or overcast conditions,
make yourself more visible by turning on headlights (not your high
beams, please). The rule of thumb should be: If the wipers are on,
the lights are on. In some jusrisdictions, that's the law.
</P>
<P>
   On the road in winter, reduced speeds are often advisable, even
when it isn't raining or snowing. In below- or near-freezing
temperatures, water on bridges will freeze before the rest of the
roadway, presenting a hazard. Any sort of precipitation increases
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Rain reduces visibility and road friction. (Road friction is
friction between your car's tires and the road and is what allows
you to move and to exercise control of the car.) Icy rain or slush
is worse than summer wetness. Avoid jackrabbit acceleration, hard
braking, or any sudden moves that can result in a skid. If you do
skid, it is most likely that it is the rear wheels that have lost
grip. Attempt to steer in the direction the car is sliding. With a
manual transmission, disengage the clutch and coast; with an
automatic, just take your foot off the gas _ don't try to fiddle
with the shifter. As you regain control, be gentle with steering
wheel and accelerator. As the tires regain grip, adjust the
steering to the direction you want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   If the front wheels are sliding, a less common occurrence
compared with rear-wheel skids, declutch a manual gearbox, remove
your foot from the gas pedal. Don't try to steer, straighten the
front wheels, and wait for them to regain traction as the car
slows. Of course, this all assumes you have a little room for
maneuver; skid on the Mass. Pike in rush hour and you are almost
certain of sliding into something solid.
</P>
<P>
   In rain or slop, you may encounter hydroplaning, especially if
you're speeding. If the tire can't shed water fast enough, a wedge
of water builds up ahead of it, and a film of water is established
between the tire and the road _ your tire is no longer in contact
with the road, and there is no friction. Don't move the steering
wheel. Do get off the gas, declutch a manual, and let the car coast
until it regains traction. Hydroplaning is less likely with
front-wheel drive, but it does occur.
</P>
<P>
   In snow, keep plenty of distance between you and the driver in
front. Signal early and don't rush. You are better off following
the beaten track, even though it is often more slippery in the
polished ruts. The ridges of packed snow tend to guide the car in
the established track. If you must pass, you will need more room
than usual and may have trouble crossing those ruts. Approach the
ruts at a shallow angle at a speed only slightly higher than the
rest of traffic so as to avoid a skid.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers know about snow, slush and ice, but there is one
slippery situation that seems to escape the notice of many:
saline-soaked pavement. In temperatures near the freezing mark,
roads that have been heavily salted to eliminate the inconvenience
of snow can be especially hazardous. That salty solution remaining
after the snow melts is somewhat viscous _ oily _ and can be as
dangerous as ice.
</P>
<P>
   Salt also complicates visibility. Before you start out, be
certain your windshield-washer reservoir is full and the wiper
blades clean. A paper towel run along the edge of the blade will
pick up an often surprising amount of crud that otherwise would be
spread all over the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Braking in snow or slush can be hazardous, so allow enough room
to avoid the need for panic stops. Anticipate stop signs,
intersections, traffic lights (assume they're about to turn red;
they probably are). Apply the brakes gently. In an emergency,
resist the urge to slam the pedal and hold it there. Your brakes
will lock the wheels, and the car will skid. Hit the brake fairly
hard, then ease off to the point where you have braking action but
not wheel lock. Slow pumping _ squeezing of the pedal _ is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   If you have antilock brakes, the opposite applies. Slam the
brake pedal and hold it down _ hard. Do not pump antilock brakes.
The result could be a loss of control. Antilock brakes prevent
wheel lock, but they don't add traction. How quickly you can stop
determines how fast you should be driving.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not going to stop in time, and can't steer around all
hazards, look for something soft to hit (not a pedestrian) _
sliding along a snow bank may slow you enough to prevent major
damage in a collision. It is better, too, to risk sideswiping a
parked vehicle than to hit a vehicle moving toward you.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stuck in the snow, don't sit there spinning your
wheels _ it will make things worse. It can also overheat the tire
to the point of explosive blowout. Do shovel snow away from the
wheels or use sand, ashes, or traction mats to help regain footing.
In most cars, only one wheel at a time will spin, but you can trick
a rear-drive car into using both wheels _ pull on the emergency
brake a couple of notches.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking back and forth is the usual prescription for working out
of this kind of difficulty, but you can really ruin a transmission
doing it. The tendency is to reverse direction before the wheels
have stopped spinning. With an automatic, the wear and tear can put
you in a transmission shop; with a manual, you can take years off
the clutch. The wheels should be completely stopped before
shifting.

TOPS IN FOOTBALL, BOTTOM IN GRADUATING PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Saturday, Jan. 2, 1999; normally moves Friday)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (Last of two parts)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is the top-ranked college football team in the country
going into this weekend's major bowl games, but in my third annual
Graduation Gap Bowl, it is one of the lowest ranked in the
classroom. Tennessee had the second-worst graduation rate out of
the teams that were either ranked by the Associated Press or were
picked to play in the holiday bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's graduation rate of 27 percent was second only to the
20 percent of Arkansas. Tennessee had the fourth worst graduation
rate for African-American players, 15 percent, the sixth worst
graduation rate for white players, 48 percent, and the third worst
gap between the graduation rates of African-American players and
the general student body (15 percent vs. 56 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was hardly alone. Of the nation's top 12 ranked teams,
eight of them (Tennessee, Ohio State, Kansas State, UCLA, Florida,
Texas A&AMP;M, Arkansas and Georgia Tech) were also among the worst 13
in graduation gaps between African-American players and the general
student body. They had gaps of at least 30 percentage points, way
above the Division 1 average of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M had the largest gap, with a 68 percent student body
graduation rate and 20 percent for its African-American players.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer said, ``There's
more pressure on coaches now than ever before. It's amazing. Right
now you have to win the division. Then you have to win the
conference. Then you have to win the conference again: the
championship game. Then you hope that you're going to (win a major
bowl game). Otherwise you have not had a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is No. 1 on the field. It it also No. 2 in the
Graduation Gap Bowl. What Fulmer can never say out loud is that it
is easier to handle the pressure to win when he is under no
pressure to graduate his players. The following are the rankings of
the 47 teams on the field and off.

<P>
   EAGLE ROCK, Va. _ A man who lives atop a mountain here communes
with the dead. He swears they've told him _ the dead that is _ to
rid America of its poor.
</P>
<P>
   So he travels rural roads, into towns that don't show up on
maps, into towns you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he'll be driving, down through the Georgia pines,
across that endless Mississippi Delta, and he'll feel his body get
to aching, he'll feel the sleep climbing up into his eyes, he'll
wish he were twenty years younger. But he just keeps going. Rolling
toward the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Once, right here in Virginia, he drove the car into a ditch.
Asleep at the wheel. Three weeks later he was up, rolling again.
Trying not to think about the busted ribs, the broken hand, or the
dark things the doctor had said about his heart. The dead _ slave
ancestors buried in a plot 30 feet from his front door here _ won't
let him be. ``I can feel them,'' the man says.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harris Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old William Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Emma Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma was Emma Ray's namesake and daughter. Poor thing:
she died in infancy.
</P>
<P>
   The world hardly knows the man on the mountain, though he may
have done as much to lift the hearts and raise the sights of the
Southern black poor as any man alive.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Donald Anderson. He's an intellectual. He's kind and
generous. He's also vain _ and, with his wobbly cowboy walk, lofty
manner, and green eyes, something of a curiosity to almost everyone
he meets.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can be absent minded about the small things, Anderson
is a demon about the big picture: Poor folk will rise. And from
that dream has grown an organization _ inspired by the resolute
localism of the British House of Commons and the ideals of Thomas
Jefferson _ that, for thirty years, has been quietly bringing true
grass-roots democracy to rural communities across America's South.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it The Assembly _ a network of mini-parliaments, formed
of 50 citizens each, that is built anew in every town Anderson
enters, that first shadows and then dislodges the traditional
government structure. He works in the tradition of other ground-up
community organizers, but his targets are among the toughest, and
his methods and passion uniquely and entirely his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, everywhere he went, it seemed, folk tugged at
his elbow, dropped words into his ears, told him he couldn't
sweet-talk his way into rural communities as an outsider and
organize them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it forty-one times,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For thirty years, in unknown places, in misbegotten towns.
</P>
<P>
   There he stands, in the homes of poor folk, shaking hands that
have lifted contaminated well water that very morning, telling men
who have trouble with the alphabet that they can sidle right up to
Thomas Jefferson and his beliefs and make something large of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He's seen barely literate souls, men and women, transformed into
leaders. In some counties whole political structures have been
upended, turned around, set loose in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments, too, when his whole vision gets reduced to
the simplicity of goodwill _ a warm coat found and draped around
the shoulders of a woman living in a shack the cold wind owns.
</P>
<P>
   In all, his assemblies have brought $20 million in development
to the rural South, but he hasn't been feted at one testimonial
dinner. He hasn't had one medal draped around his neck. He seems
not to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he cares about is a roof over his head,'' says Wyche
Fowler, the former US Senator from Georgia whose friendship with
Anderson dates back 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Anderson _ whose National Community Development Organization
has previously concentrated on the American South _ is moving
north. He wants to reopen the debate about the crumbling cities of
America. The other week he was in Cleveland. Then Washington, D.C.,
where his organization is headquartered. Washington might well be
the nation's largest think tank, where, day in and day out, the
problems seem to outfox the thinkers. There he was, under the roof
of an urban church, eyes gleaming, telling mothers and fathers who
live on a street where crime has started to creep badly to hold on,
telling drug addicts that Thomas Jefferson is getting ready to
march into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   He's been on this road before. He was there in the Sixties, when
there was footstomping and rage on behalf of the poor. But then the
political climate changed, the rage quieted. A lot of the marchers
went home.
</P>
<P>
   As for Donald Anderson, he kept dreaming. Then he came down off
the mountain, tossing off the highclass dreams his own parents held
for him _ breaking their hearts without meaning to _ and swearing
to cure a nation of what ails it, rumbling against time as the dead
men and women who sleep near him _ ``the folks in the back yard,''
he calls them _ kept whispering, driving him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeds of hope &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to slip into rural communities, where the citizens
were often distant and disconnected from one another. He planned to
organize in groups of 50. Each group would elect officers and
representatives. Collectively, an Assembly would be drawn from the
group representatives. The Assembly itself would agree on one
problem _ sewers, schools, housing _ and attack it with unity and
vigor.
</P>
<P>
   It was early 1968 and Donald Anderson was looking for someplace
to test his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin told me about Surry,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   That Martin.
</P>
<P>
   They'd met in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   An impoverished old Virginia farming town, Surry had long been a
place where blacks outnumbered whites, yet a black had never held
elective office. In 1959 public school officials _ with the state's
blessing _ boarded up the schools in nearby Prince Edward County
rather than integrate. The move ignited ``massive resistance''
across the state to integrated public education. In Surry whites
pulled their children out of the schools. All-white private
academies flourished.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson reached Surry, he met Walter Hardy, C.C. Pettaway,
and Thaddeus Lane. Three black men. Three poor men.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and Pettaway had risen to become community leaders. Hardy,
who had worked as a gardener and a chauffeur for a well-to-do white
family, was working at a packing plant. Lane was scuffling as a
small farmer. Pettaway got by on welding work.
</P>
<P>
   Three common men. Donald Anderson saw royalty in them. But they
were suspicious of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was a communist,'' remembers Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came here as a surprise to us,'' says Walter Hardy. ``Came
here with a white secretary. That was a no-no in this area. We
didn't know if he was fly-by-night or what. He came here with a
set-up we had never heard of, talking about the British House of
Commons.''
</P>
<P>
   Three men, and not a one without scars.
</P>
<P>
   For years C.C. Pettaway had been quiet as stone. Then they let
the schools go to ruin rather than integrate. He had children, and
they needed to learn, to grip schoolbooks. When the schools finally
reopened, whites didn't return. Somehow a lot of the public
education money got siphoned off into those all-white private
academies. Quiet no more, Pettaway went to court and sued.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, too, until he couldn't stay away from the restaurant any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the ``Whites Only'' sign finally came down at the
Surry House Restaurant, C.C. Pettaway ambled inside. He ordered a
steak. He waited a long time, but it finally came. He sat there,
joyful as a man at a feast. It wasn't the steak, which was actually
a bloody mess when he knew good and well he had ordered it
well-done. It was just knowing it was his.

CATHERINE CAMPBELL HEARST, FORMER UC REGENT, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Catherine Campbell Hearst, a longtime member of
the University of California Board of Regents and mother of
celebrated kidnap victim Patricia Hearst, died late Wednesday at
the UCLA Medical Center following a stroke. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst made her mark as a regent, standing firmly with
former Gov. Ronald Reagan at a time when the free-speech and
anti-war movements rocked the foundations of the university system
and the nation as well.
</P>
<P>
   But her day-to-day life was shattered Feb. 4, 1974, when her
daughter Patricia was kidnapped by an obscure revolutionary group
called the Symbionese Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hearst was later tried for joining her captors in a bank
robbery. She received a seven-year sentence, which was commuted by
President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst and her former husband, Randolph Apperson Hearst,
had four other daughters _ Catherine, Virginia, Anne and Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``She remained very involved with her daughters; she was a very
concerned mother,'' said Bernard Shaw, Mrs. Hearst's son-in-law and
Patricia Hearst's husband. ``I spoke to her once a week on the
phone. She was always interested in who was doing what. Even though
her girls had grown up, she was still a great parent. We will miss
her deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mehawk, who worked as secretary to Randolph Hearst for 25
years, said she always considered Mrs. Hearst ``a great and lovely
lady who had a marvelous sense of humor.'' Mehawk praised Mrs.
Hearst as ``a real Southern lady, very gracious, very kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Born July 5, 1917, Catherine Wood Campbell left her native
Atlanta, where she had attended Sacred Heart School and graduated
from the Washington Seminary, in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to San Francisco and, in 1938, married Randolph
Hearst, a son of William Randolph Hearst who later became president
of The San Francisco Examiner and chairman of the Hearst Corp.
Randolph Hearst is now a trustee of the Hearst Corporation and the
Hearst Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was a philanthropist and socialite, modeling in
benefit fashion shows and organizing events on behalf of several
charities.
</P>
<P>
   She drew praise as an amateur artist. One painting _ ``Venice in
the Rain'' _ won top prize in a private exhibition. In her later
years, she continued painting, often taking her paints and brushes
on trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst _ who lived in Hillsborough, a San Francisco suburb,
throughout her marriage _ was a member of the Junior League, a
director of the San Mateo Society for Crippled Children and Adults
and a trustee for Crystal Springs School for Girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, then-Gov. Goodwin J. Knight appointed Mrs. Hearst to a
two-year replacement term on the UC Regents' board. She remained a
regent for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1960s, Mrs. Hearst and the other regents were
thrust onto the front lines of an emerging battle over the limits
of free speech and the role of universities in military research.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst, a Republican, generally took a conservative
approach, and between 1963 and 1972, she supported restrictions on
allowing communists to speak on campus.
</P>
<P>
   She also supported the removal of radical activist Angela Davis
from a teaching position at UC-Berkeley. She opposed the use of
campus facilities for antiwar teach-ins and other protests.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Mrs. Hearst was proud of her involvement in
education and was an admirer of Phoebe Hearst, mother of William
Randolph Hearst, whose pioneering work in higher education is
reflected by the streets and buildings named for her at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hearst was a lifelong exponent of continuing education
for women in particular, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was the target of a possible assassination attempt
in June 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet was fired into a car in which she was a passenger, en
route to a regents' meeting in Los Angeles. The slug missed Mrs.
Hearst and the driver, lodging behind the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   During the incarceration and trial of her daughter in 1975 and
1976, Mrs. Hearst was a vocal advocate for Patricia, whom she
perceived as a victim of her kidnappers and of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph and Mrs. Hearst separated in December 1978, and were
later divorced. She moved to Beverly Hills and she became even more
involved in support of the Catholic Church. She was also a member
of the Beverly Hills Garden Club.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst is survived by two brothers, Steven and Jack
Campbell of Los Angeles; the five daughters, Catherine M. Hill of
California, Patricia Hearst Shaw of Connecticut, Virginia Randt of
Idaho, Anne Randolph Hearst of New York, and Victoria Hearst of
Colorado; and four grandchildren, Amanda Hearst, King Randolph
Harris and Gillian and Lydia Shaw.

 EAGLE ROCK, Va.: ... all, Shakespeare.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young Donald told himself that the great minds of the world
didn't see color. He believed that if he offered the world his
colorblind gifts, then the world would toss colorblind appreciation
back at him. His aunt Helen told him he possessed ``a beautiful
naivete.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 Donald Anderson boarded a bus _ had to walk to the back
and take his seat _ for Ann Arbor and enrolled at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   What few black kids there were on the Ann Arbor campus tended to
knot together. It gave them a sense of security. Donald Anderson
kept his distance. He didn't want to be grouped with any particular
clique. Some blacks thought him strange.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year Anderson was talking to a professor about
transportation economics, which fascinated him. He was thinking of
graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't teach transportation economics right in America,''
the professor told Anderson. ``You should go to to London and study
at the London School of Economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson smiled. Such beautiful instruction, he thought, such
colorblind guidance.
</P>
<P>
   London would have to wait until Anderson finished a two-year
Army stint, but when he set foot in the ancient city in 1955, he
swooned. He made his first friends there, and of course there was
the Bard _ the Old Vic was right across the road from the London
School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   After London he returned to Ann Arbor to attend the University
of Michigan Law School. By 1960 he would hold two degrees from
Michigan and one from the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Academically, he was loaded. He waited for the offers to come in
from the blue-chip law firms. None came. He found a job in
Pittsburgh, clerking for a judge. But he soon grew bored.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned the name Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the New York
congressman, and told Anderson that Powell was always looking for
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson sent a query letter to Powell. He was invited in for an
interview. Maxine Dargans, Powell's chief clerk, knew the applicant
was white _ the rich credentials, America 1962 _ and she raised her
head with the arrival of every white man into the office. Donald
Anderson arrived. The revelation was too rich. Powell hired him on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of 1962 was a wonderful time to be in Washington,
and downright intoxicating to be on Powell's staff. After having
languished in Congress for years, Powell was now chairman of both
education and labor committees.
</P>
<P>
   Following Kennedy's death, the anti-poverty machine roared.
There were momentous victories. But there were troubles. Powell was
investigated for overspending committee funds and for refusing to
settle a slander lawsuit from a woman in Harlem. In 1966 Powell was
refused his seat. He would return to Congress in 1968, but minus
the power. His last term in office, 1968-1970, was sad: humming
gospel tunes, missing votes, sick with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Anderson left Washington. Like so many, he had first been
dazzled, then disillusioned. He'd always thought politicians had
too much power over poverty programs. He started dreaming. About
Thomas Jefferson, about the British Parliamentary system, fashioned
to respect order and process. He started dreaming about all the
poor faces he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an epiphany,'' recalls Wyche Fowler.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson told his parents. They listened, but didn't hear. But
when they heard, they were aghast. Russell Anderson didn't sleep
outside so his son could gallivant around the country, some sort of
savior for the poor. Celeste Anderson's treasured son couldn't
vanish into a web of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He needed seed money. He looked across the Virginia countryside.
A lot of folk looked at him and rolled their eyes, closed their
doors. But a Virginia farmer who had made a mark in local politics
listened _ and helped. ``A most unusual Christian,'' is how
Anderson describes Edwin Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in race relations,'' says Lynch,
now a retired Virginia landowner. ``He wasn't happy with the
federal government,'' Lynch recalls about Anderson. ``He thought he
had a system that could work better.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has taken his Assembly into North Carolina and South
Carolina. He's glided into Alabama. He's convinced those whose
faith had lapsed in small towns in Georgia to pull out chairs and
invite him to sit down and listen.
</P>
<P>
   His reception, however, can vary from place to place.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he'd walk into a room and it wouldn't be long before
he'd realize that his critics were already there, were, in fact,
the very people sitting around the table awaiting his pitch _ some
with white faces, some with black faces. He'd start pulling out the
forms, the Assembly literature. He'd start talking about C.C.
Pettaway, about the Surry school district and the high test scores
of the children. Those around the table would listen. They'd nod.
And then the inquisition would begin. They'd want to know what it
was he was really selling. They'd want to know what political
office he was after. They'd want to know just where he would be
when the drought came, because he sounded like a farm-belt
evangelist, promising rain, and they didn't believe in rain
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson couldn't understand why everyone didn't see the wonder,
the beauty of it all _ communities full of rural folk who had
started rumbling. He knew some mighty fine poetry, and yet, he
couldn't find the words to properly explain the joy on C.C.
Pettaway's face when Pettaway saw his community rise up _ without a
rifle shot being fired as had happened in so many other Southern
rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   His dream has, at times, bumped headlong into reality _ money
has often been short. But then last year Donald Anderson caught a
second wind. Some new foundation money flowed in. He got that
little beautific smile on his face again. He told his staff, now up
to 14 full-timers, it was time to turn north, to take on urban
American and the very symbol of urban disarray: the nation's
capital. And also time to burrow to the very bottom of the South,
to that one place that has long befuddled anti-poverty workers and
haunted him and the family of slaves he sleeps near every night. He
told himself that it was time to go to Mississippi because if he
couldn't make peace with Mississippi, he wondered if he could keep
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi is a lot like Virginia was 30 years ago,'' Donald
Anderson says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Different, sure enough' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Claude King is Don Anderson's man in Mississippi, and Don
Anderson's man in Mississippi is two hours into a drive, zooming
out from Jackson into the delta, going to meet some Assembly folks.
</P>
<P>
   King's been around Mississippi for years. Before Mississippi he
rolled around other parts of the South, doing anti-poverty work,
holding on until the money ran out, packing up when a program
folded.

   On this day, Claude King's feet are covered in lizard cowboy
boots. His tummy's a huge and wide thing. ``Maann

   &UR; When Donald Anderson first shared his dreams of lifting the
hearts and raising the sights of the South's black poor, a lot of
people rolled their eyes and closed their doors. But that didn't
stop him. Now, after 30 years, his ``Assembly,'' a network of
mini-parliaments, has transformed once disenfranchised men and
women in small, forgotten towns into leaders. Anderson works in the
tradition of ground-up community organizers, but his targets are
among the toughest, and his methods and passion uniquely his own.
His story is written by Wil Haygood and photographed by Bill
Greene, of the Globe staff. &LR;

 EAGLE ROCK, Va.: ... it was his.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardy's awakening began when he entered the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I had a country until I went to the Army,'' says
Hardy. ``White officer said to me, `This is your country too.'
Being from little ole Surry, I didn't realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Lane and Pettaway and Hardy wanted to do things,
dreamed of doing things. But even with blacks a clear majority in
Surry, they couldn't crack the ranks of office holders. Truth be
told, they'd never raised a loud voice. They thought Surry would
always be Surry.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Donald Anderson. This stranger to Surry spelled out
his vision in detail, and before long infant hope was born of his
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they want,'' Anderson says. ``They want jobs
for their community. They want better housing. They want recreation
to take the youths off the street. What they want is a better
society.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went in Surry: every month, an Assembly meeting. And every
month, another little community feud stamped out in favor of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' explains Walter Hardy, ``you talk about peanuts
and corn at the same time. But with the Assembly, you weren't
allowed to talk about peanuts until you got the problem of the corn
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years, in 1971, the Surry Assembly announced a slate
of candidates to run for board of supervisors. Surry had never had
a black on its five-member board of supervisors, and now three men
_ common men _ were running. And all three won.
</P>
<P>
   In time, too, Thaddeus Lane, an unschooled farmer, a man who
remembers paying a $1.50 poll tax to cast his first vote years ago,
would win election as county treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor rebellion,'' Donald Anderson called it.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy and the other black board supervisors had no experience
with power. ``We finally knew we had to stop criticizing,'' says
Hardy. ``We had to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   So they brought in experts to offer them technical advice. They
applied for and received foundation funds to help them attack
county poverty. They brought in a doctor. They got funds to build a
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Surry schools were in scary shape. Most of the white
children had been pulled out, and even many rural black kids stayed
away, their parents fearing violence. But in time, propelled by
priorities set in the local Assembly, the Surry school system
revolutionized itself. Good teachers came and stayed. An all-black
school system began to integrate itself as whites poured back into
the system. Surry High School went from last in the state in test
scores to the top third on national standardized tests. Today, 95
percent of Surry graduates go on to further their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Williams is principal of Surry High. If he could work 40
hours a day, he would. It's the kids; they elevate him. He'll see a
knot of kids coming down the hall toward him and it's like
something warm and righteous flowing into him. He'll start
backslapping. He'll start complimenting. He'll start goading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Mr. Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mr. Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this boy here could be brilliant,'' Mr. Williams says,
pulling a kid toward him. ``Gotta stay on him though. Gotta stay on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mornings Frank Williams will be sitting in his office and
the phone rings and it's Don Anderson on the other end. He's coming
into Surry, now. He forgot to call yesterday to make an
appointment, and he's sorry. But he's on the way and he's got some
think tank folks with him and a congressman and a corporate
executive and he can't wait to show them the school, to show them
the classrooms, to share the latest news of the latest test scores
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say, `OK, Don, anything for you,' '' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Anderson, whooshing into the building, quick
hellos to Frank Williams and others, then bolting down the hallway
with his visitors, pointing out kids, poking his head in
classrooms, interrupting the classrooms with his giddiness, talking
in that stop-and-go-like fashion of his _ ``Well, uh, hi, uh, well,
uh, isn't this beautiful!'' Kids getting a good education. It fills
him like helium. Then he's turning, galloping toward the exit
because he's running late for his next appointment. And there's
Frank Williams, standing in the middle of the hallway, smiling,
shaking his head, one eye on the backside of the vanishing Anderson
and the other eye on the kids coming toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance you don't know how to take the brother,''
Williams says of Anderson. ``But once you understand where he wants
to go, the man becomes a giant . . . In the old days we had a
saying. `That brother's been touched.' Don's been touched. You
don't know why.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`He had an epiphany' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man who would change the lot of America's poor and
disfranchised has never known a day of poverty in his life. ``We
had cars during the Depression,'' Donald Anderson says, twin
touches of pride and arrogance in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was born 66 years ago in Pittsburgh, into a family of Negroes
who walked with arched backs, who flaunted their college degrees.
``We did not hobnob with the humdrum,'' as Anderson puts it.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Celeste, was a teacher, his father, Russell, a
biologist enamored of microscopes, bugs, and genetics.
</P>
<P>
   An aunt was a psychologist. An uncle had an advanced genetics
degree. Another aunt, Helen Baker, would become the first black
woman to attend the University of Maryland law school.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Uncle Sylvester Anderson, who didn't have
credentials to flaunt, but who taught young Donald another kind of
lesson. Sylvester was a river rat in Virginia, where the family's
lineage began. An old black man who beat the last march of slavery,
but who heard enough stories to pass along. Donald Anderson would
sit across from Uncle Sylvester and just stare. His uncle seemed
ancient to him. It was Uncle Sylvester who saved money to buy land
on a mountaintop in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   So Donald Anderson's childhood, wrapped as it was in the
travails of black America, was nevertheless rich in example and in
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Like the one Helen Baker taught him. Diagnosed with a rare form
of cancer as she was about to enter law school, she was given a
year by her doctors. She was blessed with 20 more. On her deathbed
she turned to her nephew, Donald, and with a clarity that was
fairly stunning, summoned up words that would stick with him: ``I
knew that every day I woke could be my last. That meant this
minute, this hour . . . was the most important one. Therefore,
whoever is standing in front of me is king of the world, if kings
are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's father was, he says, ``a brilliant man.'' Also
something of an intellectual pioneer in a race-divided land. He
lectured widely overseas and in his own land, though he knew, when
in America, to travel with a blanket and sheet. Jim Crow didn't
make exceptions for the exceptional, and often Russell Anderson
would wind up bundled up outside.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 the Anderson family had relocated to Washington so
Russell Anderson could begin a medical internship at Freedman's
Hospital (now Howard University Hospital).
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, heady minds were rolling in and out of the
Anderson home. Mordecai Johnson, the influential president of
Howard University, would visit. So would Howard Thurman, the
renowned minister. Young Donald Anderson heard their echoes, saw
their footprints.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy, even with sisters and a brother, a mother and
father, grew lonely. ``Whenever we moved onto a street, all the
`best friends' were already taken,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   The friends he did find were between the hardcovers of books.
His sisters and brother would be outside playing, and Donald would
be upstairs, reading, aloud: Victor Hugo, Edgar Allan Poe,
Alexandre Dumas and, above all, Shakespeare.

<P>
   But still the connection was made. Slowly but surely
Mississippians began signing on to the Assembly, or investing it
with their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Two among them live on a road in Lamont, Mississippi. It's a
road that leads to a shack, that is really a home, a good home,
because two people who've never left each other's side live there.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette and Leeandrew Priest's children are all grown, living
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a daughter in Jackson,'' he says, making Jackson sound far
away as Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
   There's a three-inch layer of green sewage running through the
backyard, around the sides of the house. Odessa Carter, who lives
across the road, who was the first recruit for the Assembly in
Lamont, is standing with Claude King next to the Priests, looking
down on the sewage, shaking her head, vowing that the Assembly will
do something. She mentions putting pressure on the local health
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The couple don't know how they hold on. They hold on by holding
on to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road, Claude King had said that the Assembly in
Lamont will have to get every eligible voter registered. When
that's done, he said, there will be a face to face meeting with
Lamont health officials. ``It's a powerful tool,'' King says about
voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Claude King's next stop is a restaurant in tiny Marks,
Mississippi. He's looking for Robert Jamison, the Assembly's man in
Marks. Jamison eventually shows, and he's hungry. Soon enough,
there's a plate of food in front of him: lima beans and corn bread
and candied yams and fried chicken. A glass of ice tea, sweetened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through rural areas, and you have people who don't even
know elections are going on,'' Jamison says, vowing that the
Assembly will change all of that.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later he's on Cotton street _ Martin Luther King once
visited Cotton Street, and someone spotted tears streaking his
cheeks in front of a shack without running water. Now Jamison
stands in front of another shack with green slime that's formed its
own ravine. ``Still,'' he says, turning the clock back and turning
it forward, ``people are living like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He's vowing to do something, to have the people energized by the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison's got an office downtown. Sometimes it'll be crowded:
mamas with sons in jail who need help. Mamas whose cupboards at
home are empty of food. People who need jobs. The oil mill in Marks
used to employ 500 people. Now it's down to 90 praying souls who
hope they'll have a job next week, next month, tomorrow. Soon,
Jamison believes, the hungry will be turned into parliamentary
officers. Assembly believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the idea,'' Jamison says about Marks citizens who've
been introduced to the Assembly. ``The Assembly is set up so a
person can express his ideas. Everybody can get up and say their
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles from Marks _ as the Mississippi crow flies _ lies
Glendora. It's Johnny B. Thomas's town. Everybody calls him Johnny
B. He used to work over at Parchman Penitentiary. As Southern
penitentiaries go, Parchman used to be the scariest. Johnny B.'s
daddy did time at Parchman for killing a man outside a grocery
store in Glendora. Victim was a black man so he only got five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Johnny B.'s got the Assembly up and running in Glendora.
He's putting together a library. He's got three books so far. He
had some officials in recently for an economic summit. They held
hands and prayed at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty, unemployment, housing, you name it,'' Johnny B. says
as far as plotting tasks for the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Simply working together is as much a revelation as the prospect
of getting things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We blacks came from the plantation,'' the mayor says. ``We've
been totally taught not to do anything together. Back in '68 I came
off the plantation. My momma got lucky enough to get a little piece
of land and got us out.''
</P>
<P>
   A cottony darkness is falling across the delta now. Claude King,
Donald Anderson's man in Mississippi, is heading home.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, everyone has a story. Some just haunt. Some are
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Claude King's story.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, his wife, got sick a few years back. By then they were
separated. Night after night he'd visit her in the hospital.
Sometimes she'd be asleep when he arrived, asleep when he left. But
watching her lying there on crisp white sheets, he started falling
in love again, with Virginia, with the woman he had married, then
distanced himself from. One day, in the hospital, he told himself
that as soon as she got better, he was going to ask her to move
back in with him, to become husband and wife again. One evening he
left. The phone rang at home. When he got back to the hospital
Virginia was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, Brian, one of his sons, was walking down a
road, was hit by some speeding fool, and killed. King just cried.
He didn't have enough faith left in him to fill a teacup. Then
Donald Anderson called, told him he needed him in Mississippi, told
him he was important, told him they could save some souls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don's different, sure enough,'' Claude King says. ``But you
gotta love him.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`On the verge of glory' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donald Anderson doesn't know why, but he's looked at poor
people, folk with less than fifty bucks to their name, and he's
felt energized, emboldened, strong as an ox all over again.
</P>
<P>
   He's put 60,000 miles on one car, driving from county to county,
state to state. He's felt like a traveling preacher.
</P>
<P>
   This is what he likes most: the improbability of it all. How to
explain Thaddeus Lane, uneducated, now the Surry treasurer? How to
explain Robert Jamison, going in and out of the Marks jail in
Mississippi?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to organize the whole South,'' Donald Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   To him, it's all made perfect sense: the tragedy of Shakespeare
and American slavery; the pure honest gesture of reaching down and
helping the poor; the love of family, those living, those dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everyone,'' he says, ``who can look down over the
plantation on which their ancestors were slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends sometimes wonder if he's a happy man. He's never
married, there are no children. ``No one woman would stay with
Donald,'' says his sister Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems missing from Anderson's life is no match for what
he has made of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the verge of glory,'' he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Anderson is dead. Died in Florida, free as the wind. His
son Donald brought him here, to the mountaintop, placed that
learned and super-educated man in the ground. With the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Old Emma Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Old Harris Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Little Emma.
</P>
<P>
   A green-eyed man sat down one day and wrote some verse, apropos
of nothing, save perhaps, life, death, and all the rain that comes
in between. The verse, framed, hangs in his mountaintop home. On
good bright afternoons, the sun slides into the cabin and catches
the words cleanly, lighting them:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If We Shall Die
</P>
<P>
   And Pass Away
</P>
<P>
   Merge with the earth
</P>
<P>
   As if we have not lived
</P>
<P>
   Then Why?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's down off the mountain now, cemetery dirt on his shoes,
heading for Washington, where he knows he'll find some poor folks,
kings and queens to him.

<HEADLINE>
IN WINTER, EXERCISE A LITTLE MORE CARE ON THE HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Saturday, Jan. 2, 1999   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (If the material presented here today looks familiar, it is
because the author has offered winter driving advice in this space
before and continues to do so annually.)
</P>
<P>
   In New England along about now, snow is likely, covering
windshields and roads. We can expect, as a matter of course,
freezing rain, sleet, wet snow, powdery snow, wet roads, icy roads,
an overabundance of salt and sand on the roadway, slush, slop,
bitter winds, and other winter miseries _ sometimes all in the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   You can't do anything about the weather, but you can help
yourself cope with it. There are two common hazards in winter
driving: 1. Poor visibility; 2. Reduced traction. There are a
couple of universal rules that apply: 1. Start early and take your
time; 2. Don't make any sudden moves.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility is something you can improve. That ice or snow on the
windows is an obvious place to start. Start the engine, turn the
heater on to its highest temperature setting, and put it in the
defrost mode. Turn on the electric rear-window defroster, if you
have one. If it is just frost on the glass, start scraping the side
windows while the windshield is getting warmed by the defroster _
do the windshield last; it will have had time to warm and will be
the easiest.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to clean side view mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   With snow, start with the roof, then the windows, then the front
and rear deck, then the lights and bumper areas.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just the windows and let nature take care of the rest?
What you leave on the roof may slide off and block your rear view;
it may fly off and bother another driver. What you leave on a rear
deck may slide down to the bumper, depending upon the shape of the
car. Today's bumpers act like shelves on many cars, holding snow
and blocking tail or stop lights. If you don't pay attention to
keeping bumpers and lights clear, those following may never know
you're trying to stop until it's too late. And you might earn a
citation _ the court kind, not the award kind.
</P>
<P>
   If you are driving in rain, snow, fog, or overcast conditions,
make yourself more visible by turning on headlights (not your high
beams, please). The rule of thumb should be: If the wipers are on,
the lights are on. In some jusrisdictions, that's the law.
</P>
<P>
   On the road in winter, reduced speeds are often advisable, even
when it isn't raining or snowing. In below- or near-freezing
temperatures, water on bridges will freeze before the rest of the
roadway, presenting a hazard. Any sort of precipitation increases
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Rain reduces visibility and road friction. (Road friction is
friction between your car's tires and the road and is what allows
you to move and to exercise control of the car.) Icy rain or slush
is worse than summer wetness. Avoid jackrabbit acceleration, hard
braking, or any sudden moves that can result in a skid. If you do
skid, it is most likely that it is the rear wheels that have lost
grip. Attempt to steer in the direction the car is sliding. With a
manual transmission, disengage the clutch and coast; with an
automatic, just take your foot off the gas _ don't try to fiddle
with the shifter. As you regain control, be gentle with steering
wheel and accelerator. As the tires regain grip, adjust the
steering to the direction you want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   If the front wheels are sliding, a less common occurrence
compared with rear-wheel skids, declutch a manual gearbox, remove
your foot from the gas pedal. Don't try to steer, straighten the
front wheels, and wait for them to regain traction as the car
slows. Of course, this all assumes you have a little room for
maneuver; skid on the Mass. Pike in rush hour and you are almost
certain of sliding into something solid.
</P>
<P>
   In rain or slop, you may encounter hydroplaning, especially if
you're speeding. If the tire can't shed water fast enough, a wedge
of water builds up ahead of it, and a film of water is established
between the tire and the road _ your tire is no longer in contact
with the road, and there is no friction. Don't move the steering
wheel. Do get off the gas, declutch a manual, and let the car coast
until it regains traction. Hydroplaning is less likely with
front-wheel drive, but it does occur.
</P>
<P>
   In snow, keep plenty of distance between you and the driver in
front. Signal early and don't rush. You are better off following
the beaten track, even though it is often more slippery in the
polished ruts. The ridges of packed snow tend to guide the car in
the established track. If you must pass, you will need more room
than usual and may have trouble crossing those ruts. Approach the
ruts at a shallow angle at a speed only slightly higher than the
rest of traffic so as to avoid a skid.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers know about snow, slush and ice, but there is one
slippery situation that seems to escape the notice of many:
saline-soaked pavement. In temperatures near the freezing mark,
roads that have been heavily salted to eliminate the inconvenience
of snow can be especially hazardous. That salty solution remaining
after the snow melts is somewhat viscous _ oily _ and can be as
dangerous as ice.
</P>
<P>
   Salt also complicates visibility. Before you start out, be
certain your windshield-washer reservoir is full and the wiper
blades clean. A paper towel run along the edge of the blade will
pick up an often surprising amount of crud that otherwise would be
spread all over the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Braking in snow or slush can be hazardous, so allow enough room
to avoid the need for panic stops. Anticipate stop signs,
intersections, traffic lights (assume they're about to turn red;
they probably are). Apply the brakes gently. In an emergency,
resist the urge to slam the pedal and hold it there. Your brakes
will lock the wheels, and the car will skid. Hit the brake fairly
hard, then ease off to the point where you have braking action but
not wheel lock. Slow pumping _ squeezing of the pedal _ is
effective.
</P>
<P>
   If you have antilock brakes, the opposite applies. Slam the
brake pedal and hold it down _ hard. Do not pump antilock brakes.
The result could be a loss of control. Antilock brakes prevent
wheel lock, but they don't add traction. How quickly you can stop
determines how fast you should be driving.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not going to stop in time, and can't steer around all
hazards, look for something soft to hit (not a pedestrian) _
sliding along a snow bank may slow you enough to prevent major
damage in a collision. It is better, too, to risk sideswiping a
parked vehicle than to hit a vehicle moving toward you.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stuck in the snow, don't sit there spinning your
wheels _ it will make things worse. It can also overheat the tire
to the point of explosive blowout. Do shovel snow away from the
wheels or use sand, ashes, or traction mats to help regain footing.
In most cars, only one wheel at a time will spin, but you can trick
a rear-drive car into using both wheels _ pull on the emergency
brake a couple of notches.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking back and forth is the usual prescription for working out
of this kind of difficulty, but you can really ruin a transmission
doing it. The tendency is to reverse direction before the wheels
have stopped spinning. With an automatic, the wear and tear can put
you in a transmission shop; with a manual, you can take years off
the clutch. The wheels should be completely stopped before
shifting.

 &HT;    .....................
 &HT;    PARIS _ The confrontation with Iraq is an example of the dilemma
the United States faces when it is determined to act on its own and
fails to persuade key powers to participate, or at least to
withhold a negative judgment.
 &HT;    Far from forcing Saddam Hussein to concede that his power has
been ``degraded'' by bombing, as Washington has proclaimed, the
recent U.S.-British attack brought the reaction of deliberately
provoking further conflict. Far from shrinking, Iraq attacked U.S.
and British planes imposing the no-fly zone.
 &HT;    Evidently, Hussein feels that if he pushes hard and cleverly
enough, he can wedge away all but Great Britain from supporting the
United States. He is aware, as Washington avoids making clear, that
the United States can bomb alone but it can't enforce effective
sanctions alone.
 &HT;    It is likely that, overplaying his hand as usual, Hussein will
wind up without the added indulgence and sympathy he seeks from
both the Arab world and the rest of the U.N. Security Council. The
impasse will continue. But it will have shown that he can still
demonstrate defiance.
 &HT;    And the United States will have been obliged to admit, as it did
implicitly with its limited attack to ``degrade'' but not to oust
Hussein, that unilateral action doesn't achieve what it wants.
 &HT;    But unlike previous empires that wanted control and tribute, the
United States doesn't have a very clear idea of what it wants. That
is not just a lack of strategic vision or lucid articulation of
policy; it is in the very nature of this new way of trying to
organize the world.
 &HT;    Washington doesn't have a plan to impose. That will have to
emerge bit by bit from coalition debate.
 &HT;    But what matter _ on the eve of the 21st century, America calls
itself ``the indispensable nation'' and, indeed, while it can't do
whatever it wants anywhere in the world, nothing constructive can
be done without it.
 &HT;    Back in the mid-1900s, soon after World War II, Henry Luce, who
had founded the Time-Life empire, proclaimed the next 100 years as
``the American century.'' A generation later, it didn't look like
that at all. The Cold War, Vietnam and a challenging Third World
sapped American confidence and made its people ponder the risks of
involvement. The bountiful era seemed ended.
 &HT;    Now, once again, the American role is indisputably preeminent.
There has never been such a pile-up of power. Political, military,
economic, cultural, technological _ America is dominant in every
field. Even some American analysts call it an empire because it
parallels the power of classical Rome in its ability to prevent any
other nation or group of nations from imposing their contradictory
will.
 &HT;    But if the United States is imperial in reach and weight, it is
a unique kind of dominance unknown to history _ one consciously
based on a coalition of resources and wills that must constantly
seek convergence. This coalition is open to all who wish to join,
and there are endless appeals to the ill-defined ``international
community'' for support and legitimation.
 &HT;    When the United States does not take adequate account of the
perceived interests of its various partners, it feels limits on its
power one way or another. Those limits are both internal and
external, but the constantly felt need to rally others shows that
Washington does acknowledge such a thing as an international
community, and one which is taking on substance.
 &HT;    Consider the ``new strategic concept'' being devised for NATO to
announce on its 50th anniversary in April. NATO was formed for the
straightforward purpose of deterring, and if necessary defending
against, a Soviet attack on Europe.
 &HT;    Its success has made that goal obsolete. But its members do not
consider NATO obsolete and must therefore find a new definition and
role. Over the years, the alliance has already evolved, and with
the admission in April of new members formerly in the enemy Warsaw
Pact, it will take another important step in being transformed from
a defense pact to a collective security pact.
 &HT;    But the United States is proposing much broader language for the
new strategy, calling for the defense of members' interests in the
world at large. This is an approach that the French, for example,
consider nothing short of the United States proclaiming itself a
global policeman.
 &HT;    Despite its power, the United States will undoubtedly need to
settle for a more modest commitment.
 &HT;    American responsibilities in parts of the world outside Europe
are not often well-defined and institutionalized. They are
nonetheless recognized. What is also apparent is that this American
role, more than ever before, is being played with _ and through _
the international community, and cannot succeed otherwise.

ULTRASOUND HEALS BONES ULTRAFAST; JUST ASK TROY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sound medicine should get some credit for the fact the Cowboys
are hosting Saturday's NFC playoff game against the Cardinals at
Texas Stadium _ ultrasound, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' perfect sweep of the NFC East had only just begun
when Troy Aikman fractured his left clavicle in a run-in with the
Denver Broncos on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   With low-intensity ultrasound to speed rehabilitation _ and a
great offensive line to help protect against further injury _ the
Cowboys' superstar quarterback is back in the game with his
precision passes back on target.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's collarbone continues to heal, thanks, in part, to the
Sonic Accelerated Fracture Healing System, a battery-operated,
hand-held device that delivers ultrasound pulses directly to the
fracture site. Aikman has said he uses the gadget for 20 minutes
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike electrical stimulation devices that use energy currents
in a similar way to heal older, ``nonunion'' fractures that refuse
to mend, the SAFHS is specifically designed to speed the healing of
new or fresh breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely different from other therapeutic ultrasound.
It uses the same intensity as a fetal sonogram, so it is obviously
very safe,'' says Pat McBrayer, president and chief executive
officer of Exogen, the New Jersey-based company that manufactures
the product. ``What's happening at the cellular level is that the
pulsating ultrasound is creating a mechanical force on the bone to
help stimulate new bone growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, low-intensity ultrasound produces minute
mechanical strains within the fracture and improves blood flow to
the fracture site to stimulate the healing process, according to
reports presented at last summer's annual meeting of the American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   The new device, which is available by prescription only and
costs a hefty $2,500, is, says McBrayer, popular among professional
and weekend-warrior athletes and is also recommended for the
elderly, whose bones sometimes have difficulty healing.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is going to be in a cast, a hole is cut in the
cast above the fracture and capped (much like a gas cap on a car)
so that the cap can be removed to admit the pulsating sound waves.
When a cast is not indicated, as in Aikman's case, the small
ultrasound transducer is held against the skin, directly over the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Studies published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery
indicate that the device cuts healing time by an average of 38
percent and is 93 percent successful.
</P>
<P>
   Exogen also counts Antonio Freeman of the Green Bay Packers,
former Dallas Stars' star Greg Adams, Dallas Mavericks player Kurt
Thomas and Olympic luminaries Picabo Street and Dominique Moceanu
among its celebrity patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultrasound speeds up fracture healing so it is prescribed a
lot for athletes to get them back to their sports more quickly,''
says Dr. Paul Freudigman, a Dallas orthopedic surgeon who turns to
the SAFHS mostly for complex fractures at risk for nonhealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultrasound provides mechanical stimulus to the bone cells,
which the cells translate into an electrical environment more
conducive to healing,'' Freudigman says. ``You use it on fractures
that are difficult to heal with traditional methods _ and
athletes.''

PETA KICKS `NIKITA' UP A NOTCH FROM ITS FILM ORIGINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story lines of the drama series ``La Femme Nikita'' are so
intricate and multilayered that any viewer coming to the show cold
would find it nearly impossible to comprehend. Though its murky,
obscure approach is one of its enjoyable pleasures, it also can
frustrate the heck out of newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a friend recently tried ``La Femme Nikita'' for
three consecutive episodes in its customary 9 p.m. CST slot Sundays
on cable's USA Network. She was rather confused, but became
enamored with stories that explored the life of lethal agents
fighting faceless, often nameless global terrorists in nondescript
cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
   I told her that in the action-adventure genre, paranoia has
always been palatable (Chris Carter is a master at this with ``The
X-Files''). On ``La Femme Nikita,'' the joy is that you can't
figure out good cop from bad, even after the ending credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Femme Nikita,'' which opens its third season at 9 p.m. CST
Sunday, is one of the few series to improve upon its theatrical
origins. And I'm referring to the superior 1990 French film of the
same name, not the Americanized '93 remake, ``Point of No Return,''
which tried to turn mousy Bridget Fonda into a trained assassin in
pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for a TV series based on that movie, aside from
re-creating its film noir style and sophistication, is the
continuation of a somewhat unbelievable premise. In the film,
Nikita was a drugged-out loser condemned to death for her part in a
murder spree; moviegoers actually witnessed her pointing a gun in
the face of a police officer and pulling the trigger. (Because
television needs sympathetic characters, this Nikita was railroaded
into the crime.)
</P>
<P>
   Nikita's alternative to the death penalty was to work as a
government assassin, to give up family, friends and any crumbs of
the life known before entering what's known as Section One. It's a
heartlessly violent place where dialogue is held to a minimum, no
one is trusted, and almost everyone goes about his daily duties
with a grim facial expression. Since membership is involuntary, you
could say Section One has something of a morale problem.
</P>
<P>
   Over two seasons, we've learned the inner workings of not only
Nikita, played by Peta Wilson, but of the others who make up
Section One. Madeline (Alberta Watson) is the master strategist who
remains indifferent no matter the death toll; Walter (Don Francks),
a hippie throwback who devises gadgets for the operatives; Birkoff
(Matthew Ferguson), the computer genius with his hidden agenda;
Operations (Eugene Robert Glazer), the Section One leader who gives
the death orders; and Michael (Roy Dupuis), Nikita's trainer and
stone-faced love interest.
</P>
<P>
   And I use ``love'' loosely. Only a vampire slayer pining for a
vampire represents a more doomed relationship. Yet it's been
fascinating to watch Michael, a cold, calculated operative torn
between being loyal to Section One and protecting Nikita.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Femme Nikita'' is probably the most patient drama I've ever
seen, judging from the sweet time it takes to peel off the layers
of its characters, all of whom have dark pasts of some kind.
(Longtime viewers will find tonight's revelations quite juicy.)
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born, theatrically trained Wilson has proved that
she can embody serious grit without making you think she's merely a
woman playing tough girl. As Nikita, she's found an ideal
multidimensional action role, the likes of which, outside of
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' are nonexistent for women.
</P>
<P>
   Her first season and most of the second were spent fighting off
her inner demons. Nikita constantly looked for ways to either
justify her existence or make a run for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I still human?'' she asked last season behind tears. ``I
fear that I'll forget what it's like to feel humane.''
</P>
<P>
   The only unfortunate thing about ``La Femme Nikita'' is that it
conflicts in this time period with another soul-searching drama,
ABC's ``The Practice.'' But that's what VCRs are for.
</P>
<P>
   This week in TV:
</P>
<P>
   ``Biography'' (7 p.m. CST Sunday, A&AMP;E): First part of a
four-hour documentary on the legendary Rat Pack. Frank Sinatra,
Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford are
glimpsed through archival footage and interviews with
contemporaries. Part II airs Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' (3 p.m. CST, Monday, Fox): Saying that
even she's confused with Tuesday being Wednesday and the fact that
``Christmas is Easter,'' O'Donnell declares the death of taped
talk. Beginning Monday, the show will be shot live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (8:30 p.m. CST, Tuesday, NBC): Another sharp
episode for one of the new season's bright spots. Will (Eric
McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) eavesdrop through the heating
vent and become hooked on the real-life soap opera in their
neighbor's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In My Sister's Shadow'' (8 p.m. CST, Tuesday, CBS): Nancy
McKeon secretly becomes involved with her younger sister's
ex-boyfriend who, of course, turns out to be psycho. Oh, dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Justice: The Sinatra Kidnapping'' (8 p.m. CST
Tuesday, A&AMP;E): When Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped from a motel in
California, the FBI, the media and even the mob leapt into action.
This ``American Justice'' installment shows how the 53 hours
following the kidnapping unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lateline'' (8 p.m., Wednesday, NBC): Yeah, I thought it was
canceled, too. Al Franken returns in this spotty sitcom about a
late-night news program. After a few months of ``Sports Night,''
``Lateline'' looks mighty thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind Closed Doors With Joan Lunden VII'' (9 p.m. CST
Thursday, ABC): For those who missed the others, Lunden takes
viewers to places rarely seen. Here, she performs with the famed
circus Cirque du Soleil and flies in the controversial U-2
reconnaissance plane. But will Joan in a spacesuit be enough to
intercept viewers from ``ER''? She's executive producer, but
apparently she couldn't stop ABC from pitting her against the
most-watched show on TV.

 &HT;    New book, old spirit drawing attention to historic resort
 &HT;    By Mike Williams

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMERICAN BEACH, Fla. _The Ritz-Carlton hovers on the north
horizon, a symbol of elegance and excess, while to the south,
luxury condominiums crowd the oceanfront as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, between the manicured golf course developments
and posh, gated neighborhoods, a half-mile stretch of gorgeous
beach is lined with boarded-up businesses and modest homes, many of
them fallen into disrepair. On a blustery December day, the village
is
</P>
<P>
   so deserted it seems almost haunted.
</P>
<P>
   If there are ghosts about, they are friendly ones for MaVynee
Betsch, the colorful, exuberant, unofficial mayor of what was once
one of America's few all-black beach resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there is the little bar where Ray Charles and Duke
Ellington would play,'' she says, pointing toward a low brick
building with grass growing over the few parking spots in front.
``And that lot over there, that used to be the home of the first
black female mortician in the state of Florida. I tell you, baby,
it was unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1935 by Betsch's great-grandfather, black insurance
magnate and millionaire Abraham Lincoln Lewis, American Beach
thrived during the 1940s and 1950s. With segregation barring them
from beaches elsewhere, African-American vacationers came here by
the bus loads on summer weekends, filling the cottages, the small
motel and the juke joints.
</P>
<P>
   But just as segregation led to American Beach's birth,
integration nearly killed it.
</P>
<P>
   With other, previously all-white beaches suddenly open to blacks
in the 1960s, the crowds dwindled. Homes went untended as owners
grew old or moved away. Businesses shuttered their doors or opened
only on summer weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, American Beach is struggling back to life. A few
homes have been built, and other dilapidated structures have been
refurbished. A determined group of homeowners has applied for
grants and begun beautifying the streets by adding palm trees and
landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   The unincorporated village has become part of the Florida Black
Heritage Trail, drawing tourists and history buffs. There is a move
to list American Beach as a National Historic District and to
safeguard it from overdevelopment with a special zoning
designation.
</P>
<P>
   And MaVynee Betsch, a striking woman who once sang opera in
Europe but who now lives an eccentric's life roaming her
great-grandfather's town, has become something of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   A walking history book
</P>
<P>
   A new book by Atlanta native Russ Rymer, ``American Beach: A
Saga of Race, Wealth and Memory'' ($25, HarperCollins) celebrates
Betsch's family, their role in founding American Beach and the
unique part the town has played in African-American history and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a documentary film about the town scheduled to air
on public television in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anthropology department at the University of Florida has
discovered us,'' said Betsch, her voice bursting with pride.
``We've got graduate students writing papers about us and bus loads
of students coming for tours. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so must the students. It's not every day they meet a walking
history book, a woman raised into Jacksonville's upper class black
society in the 1940s who became a classically trained singer,
toured Europe and then mysteriously dropped out to lead a
back-to-nature life in the
</P>
<P>
   dilapidated lap of her family's past glory.
</P>
<P>
   Betsch is a presence: She fills the space around her with a
natural grace and energy. She also looks nothing like any other
person walking the oak-canopied roads of Amelia Island, where
Hilfiger-clad joggers jostle among the luxury cars and golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   Now 63, Betsch's skin is as smooth as a 20-year-old's. Her eyes
are clear and piercing. She dresses in felt wraps or wool Mexican
serapes over sweat pants, one arm dangling stacked bracelets,
fingers festooned with seashell rings. The other hand sports
18-inch fingernails, which she usually keeps clutched to her middle
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is her hair _ gloriously gray-black, nearly 8
feet of it, teased into what Rymer called a ``cock's comb'' over
her head, then tucked under the collar of her serape and bundled at
her side.
</P>
<P>
   She usually wears a black lace headband, and a tiny dot of a
silver earring pierces one nostril, with four or five more lining
her ear lobes.
</P>
<P>
   Matching her appearance are her voice, rich and radiant, and her
words, erudite but earthy and radical to the core. Her feminism and
eco-warrior outlook must leave her piney woods neighbors in Nassau
County _ the ones driving the beat-up pickups and building the
condos for the rich folks _ scratching their heads in puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   RV with an attitude
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she feels a kinship with the good old boys,
whom she sees as allies in the fight against the polo-clad,
BMW-driving types who frequent the Ritz and Amelia Island
Plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, these rednecks from Fernandina drive by and give me the
thumbs up,'' she says. ``They come to American Beach to fish. They
know what it's all about. They know we're trying to keep what we've
got here. The developers are over there with their eyes sparkling.
They want this beach. But it's the only public access left around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days Betsch can be found in the Titan RV given to her by
her sister, former Spelman College president Johnnetta Cole. The
vehicle is parked at the foot of Lewis Street, rusting, grass
growing up around the tires, the sides plastered with bumper
stickers bearing such zingers as, ``Politicians and diapers need to
be changed often for the same reason,'' and ``Flush Rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsch has turned the RV into an ad hoc shrine, even going so
far as to scrawl in magic marker on the side, ``Black Heritage
Museum.'' Inside are stacks of documents, articles, books, T-shirts
and other ammunition for her wars to preserve her town from the
looming forces of homogenization.

</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN BEACH, Fla.: of homogenization.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine love of life
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rymer's book and the attention it has brought,
Betsch laughs, a high cackle brimming with delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving it,'' she says. ``The book signings, the guest
appearances. I used to have it in Europe, but over there I was even
more exotic _ I was the only black in town. I'm getting a kick out
of it coming around again.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsch clearly loves her gypsy's life. No car, no possessions to
speak of, not even a permanent roof to sleep under. She regularly
bivouacs in the dunes, lulled by the crashing surf that dazzled her
as a girl. She is like a biblical prophet, wandering in the
wilderness, striking dumb her opponents with insights from another
plane of consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Once wealthy, accustomed to a diva's life in Europe, she gave
away all of her money to environmental causes _ whales, rain
forests, Earth First, you name it. She doesn't seem to miss the
money at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right whales are back, and look, they named one for me,''
she says, holding up a T-shirt touting the cause of the giant
endangered mammals, which winter off North Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't find Betsch in her RV-turned-shrine, you'll most
likely find her walking the streets of American Beach, her
orange-splashed toenails protected only by flip-flops, her serape
wrapped tight against the winter chill, her face a positive light
of energy. Puppies and kittens come out on the sidewalks to greet
her, sometimes trailing as if she were Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   If Betsch has to go to a County Commission meeting in Yulee, 15
miles distant, she bums a ride with a friend. She does that a lot,
taking to the microphone to rail against the latest depredations of
the developers, to argue against cutting down trees to widen roads
or dismantling old bridges where poor people like to fish.
</P>
<P>
   At such meetings, the unfamiliar openly gape, but the old hands
greet her warmly. She is treated with something of bemused
affection _ at least by some _ and respect by most, who know she
will be there, doggedly fighting for every tree, bird, bush and
grain of sand on American Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer, who spent a few years living in nearby Fernandina Beach
to research his book, ``adores'' Betsch.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``she loves the book,'' he said, noting that they
talk frequently by phone since Rymer now lives in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really has an occult sense. She doesn't believe in cosmic
accidents. I think she probably believes I was part of her
great-grandfather's plan, that A.L. Lewis thought it was time for
this chapter to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsch's latest dream is to obtain an unoccupied building near
the entrance to American Beach as a permanent home for her ad hoc
museum.
</P>
<P>
   She shrugs off reports of recent troubles at the beach. Last
summer, crowds of black youths got so rowdy that sheriff's deputies
cracked down, even blocking the road into town for several Sundays,
outraging some residents but pleasing others upset by the noise.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some nasty infighting between various
factions in American Beach, with one prominent leader of a group
generally opposed to Betsch cozying up with developers _ at least
to hear Betsch tell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the old divide-and-conquer strategy,'' she says.
``They're trying to split us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, all of the factions seem to agree on Betsch's bedrock
principles: preserving American Beach's history and stopping the
march of mega-development. Even Betsch's opponents have printed
brochures extolling the town's history and want only single-family
residences in American Beach _ no condos or high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   Rymer hopes the growing historical consciousness and the
advocacy germinated by Betsch will save American Beach. His book
portrays how that worked for Eatonville, another all-black town
near Orlando, where homage to writer Zora Neale Hurston has helped
revive the town, bringing scholarly conferences, an annual heritage
celebration and a sense of identity.
</P>
<P>
   He also says the town's struggle to hold onto its unique history
has lessons for mainstream America as well, where he sees the
forces of greed and commercialism threatening to overwhelm more
traditional cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beach really is a last vestige of really important
history,'' Rymer said. ``America will be much smaller if it
disappears, and it won't be much larger if it's replaced by another
nine holes of golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsch vows that will never happen, not as long as she draws a
breath _ and not after that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to scatter my ashes over NaNa'' _ her name for
the giant sand dune that towers over the village _ ``and I'll come
back to haunt them if they don't leave us alone,'' she says,
laughing.

 &HT;    Martin leads Falcons on fashion front
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Sundays he's a Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   During the remainder of the week, however, Atlanta Falcons wide
receiver Tony Martin acts more like a peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Martin, the 14-2 Falcons' second-leading receiver this
season, who the best-dressed player on the team is and he'll
respond, nonchalantly, ``Myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of his passion for clothes _ and the extent of his
wardrobe _ came to light recently when Martin and his Los
Angeles-based personal clothier, Troy McSwain II, spent an
afternoon selecting fabrics for a new batch of suits. Though he
buys his shoes and sportswear from upscale retailers around the
country, Martin has most of his suits made-to-measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's made at least 20 suits for me already,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The closets in Martin's Atlanta penthouse are sizable enough to
run pass patterns in. McSwain estimated that, between the
receiver's homes in Atlanta and Florida, there's probably more than
$1 million worth of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Before choosing which fabrics his newest suits would be made of,
Martin had to first weed through his existing wardrobe to see what
needed augmenting. The task proved as daunting as beating Deion
Sanders in single coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was supposed to do this,'' Martin muttered as he
attempted to arrange his clothes by color.
</P>
<P>
   And what colors there were: Martin doesn't shy away from wearing
bright yellows, red or purples or bold stripes or plaid patterns
any more than he would avoid running pass routes over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style is different,'' he said. ``I get away with wearing
things other guys couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   McSwain interjected: ``I'd call Tony's style funky but
distinctive. He doesn't want anything ordinary. I've got to go to
the crayon box to keep him satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his mother _ a voracious shoe collector _ instilled
in him the clotheshorse gene. He added that his dress-to-impress
inclinations don't stem from a desire to impress women (he's
recently became engaged to actress Lisa Raye) so much as he feels
in competition with other men . . . especially his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask anybody on the Falcons, and they'll tell you I can put
on anything and be sharp in it. I always want to look better than
the next guy; I am going to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask any of McSwain's clients, and they'll say his work is of
standout quality.
</P>
<P>
   When performers Boyz II Men stepped on the Grammy Awards stage
in white sequined suits and handmade white alligator shoes not long
ago, McSwain was the man behind their sartorial splendor. ``I
called my shoe vendor. He just happened to have some white
alligator,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   For fighter Mike Tyson's upcoming return to the boxing ring in
Las Vegas, McSwain is making white suits for at least 25 members of
Tyson's entourage. ``It's kind of a new coming,'' he says.

 &HT;    The South bids a warm welcome to new century
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While New York, London and Paris cemented their
millennium-celebration itineraries months ago, many cities around
the South have taken a pokey approach to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's ambitious ``Carnivale of Lights'' festival is still
seeking investors, leaving First Night, the annual alcohol-free
gathering, as the only confirmed large-scale event for the City Too
Busy to Plan. Likewise, in Alabama, the one definite big bash is
Mobile's First Night party. (For information on First Night events
around the country, call 617-357-0065 or visit
http://www.firstnightintl.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Southerners who want to attend a memorable millennium party
that's close to home do have a few options, ranging from a swank
Memphis ball to a down-home blowout at Opryland. Here are a few hot
Dixie destinations for New Year's Eve 1999:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asheville, N.C.: Like its walk-in fireplaces, the Grove Park
Inn's Grand Millennium Celebration promises to be colossal.
Beginning Dec. 29, the elegant hotel will host three days of nearly
continuous entertainment by musical acts such as Percy Sledge, the
Drifters and Cleo Laine, plus comedians Robert Klein and David
Brenner. During the last minutes of 1999, visitors will hear the
taped premiere of ``The Grove Park Inn Grand Millennium Suite,'' a
newly commissioned work by North Carolina composer David McHugh
that traces the history of Western music. Cost: $4,000 per couple,
$599 per child. 1-800-438-5800.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nashville: Countrified resort Opryland pops the cork on its
Grand Celebration 2000 on Dec. 30. Three days of festivities
include a champagne brunch Dec. 31; a ``New Year's Day Sports
Spectacular'' featuring multiple big-screen TVs for football
viewing; and ``Country Salute 2000,'' a New Year's Day dinner and
country music concert. The $1,999-per-person price tag includes
accommodations at Opryland Hotel. 1-888-976-2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Orlando: Though Walt Disney World has yet to firm up details
for its millennium party, rest assured it'll be anything but
low-key. Park officials have announced plans for a 15-month
celebration beginning Oct. 1. They promise it will rival the
similarly lengthy 25th-anniversary blowout of 1996-97. There are
also New Year's Eve parties scheduled for Disney's satellite parks,
MGM Studios and Epcot. In deference to sleeping fauna, the
festivities at Disney's recently opened Animal Kingdom park will be
relatively sedate. 407-824-4321.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Memphis: The Junior League of Memphis has selected the
handsome Peabody Hotel as the site of its 1999 Crystal Ball, a
benefit to raise money for community projects. Ball
``sponsorships'' range from $500 per couple for admission to a
lobby gala to $30,000 (minimum contribution) for a suite at the
hotel, valet parking for 10 cars and invitations for 20 guests to
the Crystal Ball Sponsor Party. 901-452-2151.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  New Orleans: If you're not up to the boozy excesses of Bourbon
Street, you may want to book passage on the Delta Queen's
Millennium Cruise. The venerable steamboat, which has been
chartered by the AAA Rochester Travel Agency for the occasion,
leaves New Orleans on Dec. 29 and travels up the Mississippi before
returning Jan. 3. A New Year's Eve party is planned, though
entertainment has yet to be finalized. $1,350 per person includes
onboard accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Charleston, S.C.: Guests of the opulent Charleston Place hotel
can celebrate in style at the Millennium Gala, which includes a
five-course dinner, free-flowing champagne and music by the
Charleston Symphony Orchestra. $2,000 buys you admission to the
party and accommodations for up to 12 nights from Dec. 25 through
Jan. 5. 1-843-722-4900.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jekyll Island (Ga.): The Victorian-style Jekyll Island Club
Hotel plans to lure revelers to the coastal Georgia hot spot with a
lavish millennium package including accommodations for three
nights, a six-course New Year's Eve dinner for two and the first
breakfast of 2000. Price: $1,100 per room, double occupancy.
912-635-2600.

 &HT;    Medical tests no match for loving family
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Years ago I used to think only country and small-town
people gathered when one of their number was in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   I understood, because we in Creola, Ala., regarded a trip to the
hospital as major, on a par with a trip to Roche Mortuary, the
final stop in many lives.
</P>
<P>
   City people are usually different, I think. There are so many
hospitals and so many doctors, and it's not always a grave,
death-dealing malady that sends you to either. But I tell you the
country custom of relatives gathering can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I had an appointment at Piedmont Hospital for some
tests, nothing fearsome, no drastic surgery, nothing threatening.
But my family decided I needed backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come,'' said one of my grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``No need to,'' I said. ``They'll put me in some lab place and
you in a waiting room, and it will be very boring.''
</P>
<P>
   John, my eldest grandson, said, ``Bird (his cousin) will be
there. Talking to Bird doesn't bore me . . . much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, don't bother,'' I urged. ``No drama, no excitement. Their
television set probably doesn't work. Their magazines are last
year's, and they don't tell you the result of their test for three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come,'' one of them maintained.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. I looked down one of those long, carpeted
corridors, and there was the most beautiful throng I ever saw _
what we call ``the Original Four,'' my first grandchildren. Two are
brothers, the others a brother and sister. They are very close to
the same age.
</P>
<P>
   I took them to swim. I rode them around in a pickup truck. I
stood by bellowing warnings when they learned to drive the riding
mower.
</P>
<P>
   I took them on picnics and down the road to visit a neighbor's
goat _ known to the four as ``the biddy-go.'' We made kites
together and flew them in Capt. Erle Miles' pasture.
</P>
<P>
   I got some of them their first haircuts, a tremulous business,
which worried them all. ``I might cry,'' said the haircut victim.
``He might cry,'' reiterated his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't cry, and he's been getting haircuts, now and then,
ever since. Not regularly enough by grandmother standards, but not
tear-inducing for him.
</P>
<P>
   Memories swamped me as I caught up with them _ all so big and so
beautiful. The boys are all 6 feet 3 inches tall and more. The girl
a shade under 6 feet. They stood tall, and they peered into my face
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   I kept hugging them, more than they cared for, I know, but they
put up with it and made jokes to divert me. And then we walked down
toward the place of tests together.
</P>
<P>
   I suddenly felt invincible. With this crew at my side, lab
technicians with needles couldn't hurt me. Doctors' reports held no
disquietude.
</P>
<P>
   It's what country people have always known. You need your
kinfolks with you when you are poorly.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor told me in some Asian countries families come with
their ill to a hospital and camp out on the grounds, setting up
cook fires and bedrolls. The ill recover faster if they have loving
relatives standing by, the doctor said. I believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I reported to my daughter in Omaha, Neb., how ``the
mob,'' as we used to call them when they were 4 and 5 years old,
came through. ``I'm glad we raised them,'' I said. ``Me, too,'' she
said. ``I think of that every day.''

 &HT;    Celebrating 2000
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton, Illustrations by Vernon Carne
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How did you usher in 1999? Was Thursday night another
New Year's Eve of lukewarm pink Champale, slightly scorched Jiffy
Pop and Dick Clark on the tube? Hey, that's OK. We're not passing
judgment here. But no way is that going to cut it come next New
Year's Eve, when people worldwide will be partying like it's, well,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be put off by those naysayers who point out that the
millennium doesn't start until Jan. 1, 2001. Nobody except maybe
Stanley Kubrick is waiting until then to celebrate. There's just
something about a curvy two followed by three fat zeroes that
screams ``turning point!''
</P>
<P>
   You need to start making your millennium travel plans now.
Already, the resorts at Walt Disney World in Orlando are booked.
Many cruises and hotels have been full for ages _ London's Savoy
Hotel started getting reservation requests 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is better'' is the unofficial motto of the festivities.
Liberally applying phrases such as ``once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity'' and ``symbolic milestone,'' travel agencies and event
organizers are vying to rties, such as those in New York, Sydney
and Rio, everybody is going for bigger and better,'' says Nick
Hanna, author of ``The Millennium: A Rough Guide to the Year 2000''
(Rough Guides, $8.95). ``There also seems to be a significant
convergence of grand themes that are central to some of these
projects. The environment features prominently, as do questions
regarding how we relate to each other and the world, the future of
work and play, the meaning of change and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   High-flown notions, those. Speaking of elevated ideas,adventure
tour organizers Blyth &AMP; Co. will offer, among other excursions, a
trek up Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, timed to reach the summit Jan.
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe subconsciously, people are connecting a personal journey
with the millennium,'' ventures Blyth managing director Peggy
Foster. ``People are saying they've always wanted to do something
like (climb Kilimanjaro) and they feel that this is a significant
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities timed around
symbolic milestones don't come cheap. The Kilimanjaro hike will set
you back $7,595 a bargain compared with some options.
</P>
<P>
   Want to rent a Times Square hotel for New Year's Eve? All you
need is $3 million, and the Millennium Broadway, a 580-room luxury
hotel in the heart of New York's party zone, can be reserved for
you and yours. Don't want to be in the same time zone, much less
neighborhood, as Dick Clark and his follow-the-dropping-ball
routine? Scots Castle Holidays will let you play ``Braveheart'' at
one of several castles in Scotland within hurling distance of
Edinburgh's boisterous hogmanay celebration. Rental fees for the
week (Dec. 29-Jan. 5)start at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you prefer a more mobile soiree. Intrav offers an
around-the-world trip on a chartered Concorde. Beginning Dec. 24,
the 18-day journey whisks you to Hawaii, Australia, Egypt, India,
Kenya and, on New Year's Eve, Hong Kong. Cost: $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   You'll only have to pony up $30,000-plus for accommodations on
Silversea's Millennium 2000 cruise to the South Pacific, which
promises two New Year's Eve parties, one on each side of the
international date line. Along that longitudinal marker, you'll
find two sites _ New Zealand's Chatham Islands and the island
nation of Kiribati _ claiming to be the first place on Earth to
greet the millennial dawn. But since neither is well-equipped to
handle visitors, a better bet may be Samoa, which is unchallenged
in its boast of being the last place in the world to celebrate the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   If your body is as in shape as your bank account, you might make
your mark by riding a bicycle around the world. The Odyssey 2000
tour leaves Los Angeles on Jan. 1, 2000, and travels to more than
50 countries in 366 days. And no, you don't pedal to all of them _
27 plane flights will get you to your cycling destinations. It'll
set you back $36,000, but, hey, you get a free bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need big bucks or toned legs to join the global
party. For Drumming in the Year 2000, all you need is something to
beat. Organized by the All One Tribe Foundation of New Mexico, the
event begins at midnight in the last time zone. Participants around
the planet will then commence banging drums for one disquieting
hour.
</P>
<P>
   And what would a celebration of the 2,000th anniversary of the
birth of Christ be without a giant pagan party? Organizers of One
Million Pagans aim to lure legions of ``earth spiritualists'' _
Wiccans, shamans and other ``free thinkers'' _ to the California
desert Dec. 30, 1999, for a few days of concerts, workshops and
rituals. At midnight on New Year's Eve, they will form a circle to
``heal the earth and project a positive future,'' according to the
Web site. Event director Thor, a.k.a. Dave Francis, won't give the
exact location for fear of recriminations. But, he says, ``there
will be a lot of pagans descending on the Palm Springs area.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that pink Champale doesn't sound so bad after all.

 &HT;    Mrs. Dull: The Atlantan who wrote the book on Southern food
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey Illustrations by Walter Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a name like Dull, she had to be good. And she
was.
</P>
<P>
   Henrietta Stanley Dull _ plain old Mrs. Dull to the generations
of Southerners who took her classes and clipped her newspaper
recipes _ wrote just one cookbook during a long life that began
before Sherman marched through Georgia and ended after King marched
on Washington. It was a homely-looking volume, with a matronly
silhouette of the author, drawn by her daughter, on the cover. Yet
``Southern Cooking'' was for much of this century the definitive
treatise on the subject. Seventy years after its 1928 publication,
you can still find it at bookstores in a new printing by Cherokee
Publishing Co., the South's own Fannie Farmer continuing to
admonish cooks not to pour gravy over their fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``She boiled Southern food down to its essence and put it
between the covers of a book that she wanted to last a long, long
time. And it has,'' says food historian John Egerton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dull died 35 years ago this month in Atlanta. She was part
of a progression of cookbook authors _ all women _ who set the
canon of Southern food: Mary Randolph in the 1820s (``The Virginia
Housewife''), Sarah Rutledge in the 1840s (``The Carolina
Housewife''), Annabella Hill in the 1860s (``Mrs. Hill's New Cook
Book''), Abby Fisher in the 1880s (``What Mrs. Fisher Knows About
Old Southern Cooking''). Mrs. Dull added to their collective wisdom
and updated it for a new century of gas ranges and electric
appliances. As the last year of that century begins, it seems
fitting to remember the woman who was for so long the reigning
authority on Southern cookery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been making a scrapbook,'' her 77-year-old granddaughter
said when I phoned. ``Would you like to see?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Woodside, one of Mrs. Dull's seven grandchildren,
dragged out a musty box of keepsakes when I visited her Buckhead
town house, and we quickly covered the floor with them. Yellowed
tear sheets of her Atlanta Journal food column. Neatly scripted
notes for her talks, the pages bound by rusty safety pins. Her
working copy of ``Southern Cooking,'' stuffed like a goose with
recipes and memos fastened to the pages with straight pins and
bobby pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the prettiest food,'' Woodside said wistfully, as she
leafed through the volume. ``She made a cake for my birthday when I
was in college. Three tiers with peach blossoms on it. I can still
see her forming the petals by hand and laying them out on wax
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sis Hennie,'' as Woodside called her, made everything from
scratch, but she didn't think badly of those who couldn't spare the
time to do likewise. Once, when she saw her granddaughter fixing
biscuits from a tube, she assured her that it was all right. ``You
do what you have to do in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dull was proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   She was born during the Civil War on a plantation near
Dublin(Ga.), in the Middle Georgia countryside the Union Army would
soon ravage. At 6, she learned to cook corn pone on an open hearth.
As a young woman, she married a Virginian named Sam Dull and
settled in Atlanta. He took ill and became an invalid, leaving his
wife to support their six children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly I found I had to be the bread winner,'' she told a
women's group years later, according to the brittle notes her
granddaughter still has. ``I knew how to make good things to eat
and have them made. I mastered a gas range. I made it work for me
and talk for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dull's oven started talking in the late 1890s when she sold
cakes and pies to fellow members at First Baptist Church of
Atlanta. She was soon one of the city's most sought-after caterers.
In 1910, the Atlanta Gas Light Co. hired her to travel around the
state conducting cooking schools for housewives who needed
assurance that the new gas ranges were safe and easier to use than
wood stoves. She spoke in auditoriums to assemblies that numbered
in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to have a ticket if you wanted to see Mrs. Dull, and
they weren't that easy to come by,'' says Anne Kilpatrick, a
retired Atlanta dietitian, who attended several of her sessions as
a girl in Athens(Ga.). ``To me, she represented authority. You'd
hear housewives say, 'Well, Mrs. Dull says ...' and that would
settle it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Mrs. Dull approached the new Sunday magazine of The
Atlanta Journal with a proposal to do a cooking column. The editor
assigned a young staffer, Margaret Mitchell, to coach her on
writing. Every week the page would appear under the same headline _
``Mrs. Dull's Cooking Lessons'' _ with a different photo of the
author, looking as serious as a heart surgeon, as she cracked eggs
or mixed batter. On the bottom of the page, she conducted a
``chat'' with her readers, exchanging recipes and housekeeping
tips.
</P>
<P>
   The column led naturally to the cookbook _ 350 pages and 1,300
recipes that form a snapshot of a transitional era when Southerners
were moving from farm to city, but still knew how to wring a
chicken's neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the recipes, she's really a link between the
19th and 20th centuries,'' says Damon Fowler, the Savannah(Ga.)
culinary historian. ``On one hand, she's forward-looking; she has
this tomato sherbet that would be very chi-chi at a nouvelle
Southern restaurant today. On the other hand, she still has this
connection to the land; she tells you how to deal with a real
possum.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't kidding. On Page 55, Mrs. Dull gives instructions for
cleaning and cooking the oily little marsupial: ``Scrape well _
remove feet, tail and entrails _ like you would a pig. Cut off
ears, remove eyes and head if desired.''
</P>
<P>
   When I read the recipe to Woodside, she made a gagging noise and
changed the subject to her grandmother's squash casserole.
</P>
<P>
   In print, Mrs. Dull can come across as a stern schoolmarm who
doesn't brook any small talk. ``She didn't want to be chatty or
trendy,'' Egerton says. ``She wanted you to pay attention because
she was only going to tell you once.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dull was apparently much warmer in life. Friends and family
remember her as a vivacious, short little thing who ate lightly and
liked big hats and read her Bible everyday. She never learned to
drive, preferring to call Yellow cab. She was unfailingly polite,
so much so that when the newspaper asked her to step down in 1945,
because of her age, she was terribly upset but never said a harsh
word to the college-trained home economist who replaced her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure she thought I was a straggly little ole gal,'' says
Grace Hartley, the food writer who took her place. ``But she
wouldn't dream of saying anything because she was a Southern lady.
So she just tried to ignore me.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Hartley, who ended up writing for the Journal
even longer than Mrs. Dull, was very much a child of her cooking.
``I grew up on her recipes,'' she says. ``We took the Journal by
rural route, and my mother had a drawer full of those columns.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left the paper, Mrs. Dull's book was hitting its
stride. The first edition, published by the small Ruralist Press in
Atlanta, had sold a modest 14,000 copies. But in 1941, the New York
publishing house of Grosset &AMP; Dunlap picked up the title and moved
more than 150,000 copies in a dozen years _ a remarkable figure for
a regional cookbook, then or now.
</P>
<P>
   The title went out of print after Mrs. Dull's death, at 100, in
1964. For some reason, Grosset &AMP; Dunlap never renewed the
copyright. The family earns nothing from the facsimile edition that
Cherokee Publishing has brought out in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That book never made her rich,'' her granddaughter says.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after she retired, the Journal sent a reporter to
interview Mrs. Dull at her Morningside home on the occasion of her
90th birthday. He found her cooking, as usual. But there was
something troubling her, something elemental to Southern cooking
that she feared she had omitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was so mortified the other day,'' she said. ``I
looked for turnip greens in my book and I found I'd left them out.
I owe them an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Mrs. Dull, you didn't owe turnip greens an apology. They're
on Page 91, with kale and collards, right where you put them before
most of us were born.

 &HT;    A new wave of Latin-influenced groups is poised to take the
world of pop music by storm
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rock 'n' roll has a new pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   It's with an n.
</P>
<P>
   Often ignored by radio and MTV and underplayed on the pop
charts, the rock en espanol movement _ rock bands from Latin
America and elsewhere that sing in the Spanish language _ is
becoming a force that could change the face of popular music in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the best-known such groups still seem part of a distant
phenomenon. Yet bands as distinct as Mana, Cafe Tacuba, Los
Fabulosos Cadillacs and Plastilina Mosh have all played to Atlanta
club audiences. They also sell surprising numbers of records, a
fact reflected in the creation of a new category, ``Latin
Rock/Alternative,'' at the 1998 Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Mana, a Mexican rock act whose Police- and U2-influenced pop has
made it an arena-size attraction, has sold more than 500,000 copies
nationwide of its latest CD, ``Suenos Liquidos'' (Warner Bros.). Of
those, 1,685 copies were sold in local stores monitored by
SoundScan. That sum, the band argues, should be tripled since it
doesn't include the independent ``mom and pop'' outlets that are
the music's stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our turn has come,'' says Maribel Schumacher, vice president
for Latin music at Warner Bros., where her duties include
developing the U.S. market for Spanish-speaking rock acts.
``Everybody's a little tired of alternative music. This is
something new. Maybe 10 years ago, Hispanics were not considered
the greatest, the hippest, the coolest, but now the environment is
more hospitable. I remember friends dying if their parents spoke to
them in Spanish. Now, everybody's comfortable in their skins.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of a group such as Mana, which built its U.S.
following through years of touring the backwater circuit, does,
however, reflect a generational shift. Traditional, ballad-driven
forms, such as ranchero, are a part of its sound, but have been
powerfully modernized. ``A lot of kids that have grown up in the
U.S., whose parents have hard labor jobs, they don't identify
themselves with this type of (older) music,'' says Alex Gonzalez,
Mana's drummer. ``That's why these kids have hooked up on rock en
espanol. They say: This represents my culture and my age. It's
music that makes me feel proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock en espanol is showing up on the recording industry radar
screen at a time when pop music has become increasingly
multilingual. The youth culture watchdogs at Spin picked ``the
global pop underground'' as its No. 2 music trend of last year,
citing such ``internationalist'' stars as France's Air and Japan's
Cornelius as leading examples. If, as the rise of hip-hop and DJ
culture suggests, traditional rock music is waning, the movement
provides an exciting new context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music from other places doesn't sound so strange anymore;
there's a nice homogenization going on in society,'' says Yale
Evelev, who runs Luaka Bop, a 10-year-old Warner-distributed label
launched by former Talking Heads singer David Byrne as a kind of
hip, multicultural outpost. Its eclectic roster includes Colombia's
edgy, antic Bloque, New York's high-energy King Chango and
Venezuela's nutso Los Amigos Invisibles. ``And rock en espanol
groups have changed. They used to be fairly derivative: the Latin
(answer to) the Police, Peter Gabriel, R.E.M. Groups now have real
strong identities, culturally based. They bring something to
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, much of it thrives on the outsider cache that has
always been a mark of integrity to young fans, whether the genre is
punk rock, rap or metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scene is so fresh,'' says Louisiana native Randy Ebright,
the 21-year-old ``crazy gringo'' in Molotov, a Mexico City-based
act whose frantic raunch is influenced by the Beastie Boys.
``People in Mexico are trying to be pioneers. Groups that are
coming up don't rely on radio at all.'' Ebright came to Mexico with
his parents six years ago, got deeply involved with the underground
rock scene and stayed behind when they returned to America. ``Where
I'm from,'' he complains, ``the whole scene is all saturated: the
music business is one big Nike commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect to hear ``Rap Soda y Bohemia,'' Molotov's
version of Queen's ``Bohemian Rhapsody,'' on the radio anytime
soon. Though rock en espanol acts are infiltrating the alternative
rock market _ Molotov joined the ska and punk roster on the extreme
sports-themed Warped Tour; Argentina's Los Fabulosos Cadillacs
toured with swing's Cherry Poppin' Daddies _ they haven't
established a strong presence on the airwaves, in any language.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-language radio typically broadcasts three formats
_tropical (island music, like salsa); Mexican regional (ranchero,
banda, Tex-Mex); and pop (Selena, Luis Miguel, Jon Secada). As
Warner Bros. Schumacher notes, ``Rock doesn't fit in unless it's a
ballad, a very romantic ballad. These artists didn't have their day
in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mana played Oakland, Calif., where it drew 13,000 fans,
drummer Gonzalez says, ``We were promoted on urban radio stations,
not Latin. That's going to be the future.''
</P>
<P>
   With more a potential Spanish-speaking audience of 30 million in
the U.S., the crossover potential works both ways. The
Atlanta-based septet Mandorico attracts an enthusiastic crowd of
Anglo and Latin fans to its local club performances, which fuse
reggae, hip-hop, Latin jazz and Afro-Caribbean rhythms in fiery,
upbeat dance tunes. ``We're just regular old American kids,''
confesses vocalist Jesse Lauricella, 23, a New Jersey native who
got turned onto rock en espanol during a six-month visit to Mexico,
and studied Spanish literature at Georgia State University(Ga.).
Though, he adds, the group's conga player is Puerto Rican.
``Spanish sounds better in the context of the music that we
create,'' he says. ``It's a beautiful language, it flows better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandorico's bilingual audience is a sign of the times. ``You now
have third-generation Hispanic kids who straddle both sides of the
fence who speak among themselves in this hybrid language:
Spanglish,'' Schumacher says. ``And their peers understand them
because they're not just hanging out with Hispanics, they're
hanging out with everybody. I think they're going to start creating
their own music, their own sound. It's going to enter the
mainstream a little bit like rap did in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was a trend,'' she adds, ``and, hey, it
didn't go away.''

 &HT;    `Careless Love' eyes downward trajectory of the shining star of
rock 'n' roll
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sad, sad, sad. Tracing what seems a grand and irrevocable arc
through an American life that, finally, became an American tragedy,
music historian Peter Guralnick has produced the second half of his
colossal biography of Elvis Presley. To read it, to dip into its
careful accumulation of details, to ride that downward spiral as
the pure unleashed icon devolves into a drugged-up, constipated
kitsch machine, is to marvel. And to mourn. Because if Elvis
somehow channeled the truest, most incandescent passions of the
republic, if he really was the definitive figure Guralnick insists
he must be, and this is what happened to him _ then, damn, what
would happen to the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you've read it all before. The Presleyan Saga has
taken on a near-biblical aura in the two decades since the singer's
death in 1977. But if that implies holiness or reverence, it's of
the oddest, most contradictory kind: What demigod is born again in
the public imagination to mysteriously haunt Midwestern fast-food
chains? Only the most populist sort, I suppose, and Guralnick's
understanding of that is part of what makes ``Careless Love'' so
involving.
</P>
<P>
   That, and Guralnick's stamina for research. Picking up where he
left off four years ago with ``Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of
Elvis Presley,'' this most sympathetic critic and celebrant of
American roots culture copiously illustrates how the singer, having
changed forever the face of popular music, gradually evaporated.
Now that rock 'n' roll, by any account, is well into its 40s, the
story of the adolescent immortal who becomes a middle-aged
self-parody is so common as to be a cliche. But Elvis was a pioneer
in this sense and, instead of dying young and sealing his fate in
the amber of legend, his decline and fall was played out in the
tabloids. He died a joke: some fat guy striking a karate pose in
his bulgy white jumpsuit, dripping sweat from his ridiculous
mutton-chop sideburns, his speech slurred and addled. Viva Las
Vegas!
</P>
<P>
   Good, obsessively readable chunks of ``Careless Love'' are
devoted to this pathology. Depressing as it is, Guralnick's
approach redeems Elvis as a human, not a myth or a punch line, and
calmly, methodically makes coherent what often had been obscured by
the almost ``X-Files'' level of paranoid fantasy associated with
the King's Final Years. The clearest parallel _ and not merely
because of their mutual contributions to the history of Las Vegas _
is to Howard Hughes. By the end, Elvis had become the dysfunctional
Midas of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end is where the book starts, as Presley
temporarily suspends his career to join the Army in 1958 after the
death of his beloved mother, Gladys. Nothing was ever the same
after that. ``The artistic choices he faced when he returned to an
interrupted life were far more ambiguous than the good fortune he
had so innocently embraced,'' Guralnick writes in his introduction,
``and he never came fully to terms with the burden of decision
making that those choices placed upon him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, also made clear is that Elvis enjoyed being Elvis. He was
an accomplice in that which recurs throughout ``Careless Love'':
the machinations of his Machiavellian manager, Col. Tom Parker; the
insulating kowtowing of his crowd of good old boy hangers-on, the
so-called ``Memphis Mafia''; the cheesy movies; the accommodating
parade of young beauty queens; the boredom and the prescription
pill dependencies _ which is what numbed and killed him; his
obsession with guns and police work (reaching its climax in a
hilarious, near-absurdist recount of Presley's brazen tete-a-tete
with President Nixon); the never-ending search for some deeper
meaning to it all.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning, always, was in the act. The act of being Elvis. As
fans know, there were moments when the long, slow car wreck of his
career appeared to be averted. His 1969 sessions with producer
Chips Moman at American Studios in Memphis, which became the
latter-day classic ``From Elvis in Memphis'' (a.k.a. ``The Memphis
Record''), was one of those moments when the singer reclaimed the
gospelized grandeur of his country-soul roots. The other was his
notorious 1968 Christmas broadcast on NBC. This was Elvis living up
to his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to sing for people,'' says bassist Jerry Scheff, who
recounts his first meeting with Presley as he joined his stage band
in 1968. Scheff overcame his doubts about a performer he didn't
really like, summing up why in simple terms that stand as a fitting
epitaph: ``He loved to knock people out.''

</P>
<P>
   First look: An Excerpt
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime was the worst; he dreaded sleep, even as he dreaded
that sleep would never come. Over and over he dreamt the same
dream, a variation, in one form or another, of the nightmare that
had haunted him ever since success first arrived unbidden at his
door. The core of the dream never changed: all his money was gone,
the fans had abandoned him, the Colonel was gone, he was alone.
What would the fans think when they read (``Elvis: What
Happened?'')? he pressed Billy (Smith, his cousin) again and again.
He started constructing elaborate defenses in case someone should
yell something at him while he was onstage. ``At first he thought
he'd just say that a lot of things had been written about him, good
and bad, and that he was not a perfect person.'' Then he decided
maybe he should concede that it was true, he took certain
medications, but that he needed them, and to prove it he would
introduce Dr. Nick onstage. Finally, he settled on a strategy of
limited confession, which would conclude with the statement that
``After this tour I'm going to take time to get myself straightened
out.'' But only, he made clear to Billy, if the issue came up in a
manner that he just couldn't sidestep _ ``if the audience . . .
started booing and throwing things.''

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 3
 &HT;    Sad, savvy Marilyn a co-conspirator in her own ills
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine another book about screen idol Marilyn
Monroe. What could possibly be new about the troubled, talented
sexpot who has become as much a part of American pop culture as
baseball, the Big Mac or Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, though, this biography by meticulous researcher
Barbara Leaming (``Katharine Hepburn,'' ``Orson Welles'') sheds new
light on the life, career and death of one of America's most
enigmatic screen actresses, particularly on the events and state of
mind that led to her decisions and, hence, her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the ``little girl lost'' so often painted by people
ranging from Gloria Steinhem to Norman Mailer (``Marilyn: A
Biography''). Certainly Monroe was a victim _ of a mentally ill
mother who tried to smother her in her crib, of powerful men who
exploited her sexually and, ultimately, of bloodsucking courtiers
who gladly provided her with enough Nembutal to numb her forever.
But Leaming also reveals that Marilyn was a top-rate user and
manipulator herself.
</P>
<P>
   After sleeping her way into film roles, Monroe appears to have
made every decision based on how it would affect her career and
acceptance into the rich and powerful circles of Hollywood. Her
husbands were not so much mates as they were escorts into that
world: Baseball hero Joe DiMaggio gave her insights into how to
negotiate contracts and make money, and playwright Arthur Miller
provided the legitimacy of the Broadway theater that propelled
Monroe from ``movie star'' to ``actress.'' Even the famed Lee
Strasberg, founder of New York's elite Actors Studio, comes across
as an egomaniac who saw Monroe as his meal ticket in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, it was Monroe's fear of abandonment _
fueled by a childhood spent bouncing from one foster home to
another _ that sabotaged every relationship she formed, prompting
her to look for love in all the wrong places, most famously in the
arms of the ultra-powerful womanizer John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Leaming's detail sets this biography apart from the shelves full
of other Monroe books. The author not only describes each shade of
blond in Monroe's hair as she goes from bit-part bimbo to
top-billed bombshell but also knows what photographs the actress
kept at her bedside (a portrait of Abraham Lincoln) and can call on
an inventory of each tight outfit she paraded before the public _
and why she chose to wear each.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than unraveling the mystery that is Monroe, Leaming
provides an uncanny glimpse into the inner workings of 1950s
Hollywood, where women were viewed as sweet things rather than
savvy businesswomen. Monroe's legitimacy as an actress could never
eclipse her bustline, and so, in the end, she became the Barbie
everyone perceived her to be. By the time she died naked in a
Hollywood bungalow, a telephone dangling from her hand, her efforts
to reach beyond her image were as flat as a dial tone _ an American
tragedy, but one of her own making.

SUSPECTS IN REPORTER'S MURDER RECANT PART OF THEIR CONFESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ Two Huichol Indians charged in the killing
of San Antonio Express-News correspondent Philip True have recanted
their story that they strangled him for taking photographs of their
homeland without permission.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects _ Miguel Hernandez de la Cruz and his
brother-in-law Juan Chivarras _ still admit choking the Mexico City
bureau chief. But they now say it was because a seemingly drunk
True threatened Hernandez' wife and children, and kicked him when
he approached his ranch in the highlands of Jalisco state the
morning of Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he spoke Spanish, then maybe I could have understood, but
he didn't speak Spanish,'' said Hernandez, 24, addressing the
Fourth Criminal Court on Tuesday. His statement was obtained from a
tape recording of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he enters my house and kicks me. Then I thought, maybe he
is going to take something or violate my wife or children,''
Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Chivarras, 28, were arraigned Monday on murder
charges. Investigators said the men admitted killing True, who
spoke fluent Spanish, because he offended them by taking their
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   However, Horacio Vega, the lead investigator in the case,
dismissed the suspects' latest statements, saying Mexican criminal
suspects often retract their confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens in 85 percent of the cases. Nearly all of them
change their declarations,'' said Vega. ``It's something unique to
our judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said both men participated in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   According to his new story, Chivarras was vaccinating cows when
Hernandez asked for help in burying the body. He said they left
True's camera and backpack close to the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't take anything from the gringo,'' Chivarras said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the two had True's camera when they were
apprehended. True's backpack and some other possessions were also
recovered, but it remains unclear who possessed the items. His
binoculars and wallet remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said True was killed about 9 a.m. on Dec. 4.
Investigators have said the time of death was Dec. 6 at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished photographer and avid hiker, True, 50, was
combining a vacation with a reporting trip about the Huichol
Indians who live in virtual isolation in villages and ranches in
the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. But his 100-mile, 10-day
trek was cut short halfway through his expedition.
</P>
<P>
   True's wife alerted authorities when he didn't call or return as
scheduled on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Margarito Diaz Martinez, a Huichol Indian, discovered True's
body Dec. 14 in Chapalagana Canyon while he was hunting for
javelinas. Diaz hiked out of the remote canyon to alert others.
</P>
<P>
   When a rescue team returned two days later, True's body had been
moved and buried in a makeshift grave near the Rio Chapalagana. His
backpack, camera and other belongings were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects said in their Tuesday declaration that they had
buried the body right away after dragging it to a hillside and
throwing it over the edge near the river.
</P>
<P>
   The men live far from where True was found, and moving his body
would have involved dragging him several miles through difficult
terrain to the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they are watching the case closely but had
no comment on the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are observing, following closely but from one step back,''
said Judith Bryan, spokeswoman for the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco state.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Guadalajara daily Publico on Tuesday,
the men said they were beaten after being arrested in their home by
``green judicials,'' which reporters here interpreted as meaning
army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Vega denied that the two were abused in any way.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, officials from the State Human Rights
Commission have begun an investigation into the facts surrounding
the arrest of the two suspects, who showed no external signs of
physical abuse when they were brought before cameras on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has grabbed headlines across Mexico, has been
plagued by several errors by state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an autopsy conducted by the Jalisco medical
examiner on Dec. 16 that determined True was strangled. The autopsy
noted there was tearing of the rectum, indicating possible sexual
abuse. But investigators said on Monday the damage was caused by
the body being dragged after death.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors ordered a second autopsy that was witnessed
by a forensic pathologist contracted by the FBI. Results of that
autopsy, performed Dec. 19 in Mexico City, have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the investigation, and we ask the
Mexican government to clarify the status of the case,'' said
Express-News Editor Robert Rivard. ``More than 10 days have passed
since the second autopsy was conducted, yet the family and this
newspaper are still awaiting the results, or a plausible reason why
results are not being released.''
</P>
<P>
   Several unsourced newspaper reports have also said True had a
very high alcohol level, which his wife, Martha, friends and
colleagues because True dismiss, since, according to them, the
reporter did not drink.
</P>
<P>
   In Jalisco state, many Huicholes have been shaken by True's
murder and fear it will reflect badly on their friendly ancient
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there are no repercussions in our culture and
community,'' said Carlos Salvador Diaz, a high-school teacher. ``I
don't want people to think we are killers.''

 &HT;    Worst of weather yet to come, experts say
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This was the year that turned skeptics
into believers. It even made some of the bah-humbug crowd admit
that something really weird, and probably bad, is happening to the
weather on planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   We had it, or saw it, all: Floods, tornadoes, fire and ice
storms. Trains toppling off railroad tracks warped by weeks of
100-degree-plus heat in Texas. Four hurricanes spinning at once, 10
tropical storms born in little more than a month. The warmest and
wettest January and February on record in the United States, the
hottest July ever for the entire world, the warmest year on the
whole surface of the earth since the beginning of temperature
records in the 1400s.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 people killed, 300 million displaced, $89
billion in losses around the globe. All from disasters caused by
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Is this how global warming announces itself and claims
retribution for burning fossil fuels and leveling forests? Or did
we just get caught in a nasty family tug-of-war between a robust El
Nino and La Nina?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have natural variability, but that doesn't
account for what went on,'' says Kevin Trenberth, head of climate
analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo. ``We don't have definitive answers, but there is
reason to believe this is part of the signals of global warming we
may be seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baloney, says Jerry Mahlman, director of NOAA's Geophysical
Fluid Dynamics Lab at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no bad guy out there,'' Mahlman insists. ``Basically,
we're getting jerked around by the same stuff that's been jerking
us around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``stuff,'' Mahlman means El Nino and La Nina, those fickle
phenomena that alternately heat and cool the Pacific Ocean waters
near the equator, and thus determine where winds will blow and rain
will fall. Scientists agree that they are the direct causes of this
year's bizarre heat in Texas, fires in Florida and hurricanes in
the Caribbean, and that they probably have more unpleasantness in
store for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But not all scientists are ready to blame global warming and
greenhouse gases for the antics of El Nino and La Nina.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the topsy-turviness is an impression born of the fact
that weather in the news has gotten a lot sexier than it used to
be,'' Mahlman says. ``Everybody's interested in it. You hear more
about weather far from where you live than you used to . . .
Everybody has a heightened sense of weather as something that can
get you.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate began in the 1980s, when scientists began to wonder
whether the droughts, freezes and heat waves of that decade were
early signs of global warming. In 1990, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science devoted a major part of its annual
convention to such issues for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites, computers and communications had gotten
sophisticated enough to let scientists see and connect weather
events in different parts of the world into a global pattern. What
they saw in the isobars, graphs, wind and water measurements was
troubling _ temperature inching upward through the preceding
hundred years, holes in the Earth's protective ozone layer, floods
and droughts and storms that seemed to be strangely out of place
and out of season.
</P>
<P>
   Some said flat out it was the start of the greenhouse effect _
gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons
trapping heat in the atmosphere and not letting it radiate out into
space. And that's how how it would happen, they concluded. Not
gradually and imperceptibly, but in harsh, topsy-turvy doses.
Colder cold, hotter heat, heavier rains, longer dry spells,
stronger storms, droughts where rains ought to be, floods where it
ought to be dry, and no way to pinpoint any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the industrial revolution, the earth's
surface temperature has gone up by 1 degree as carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent to 30 percent. Because
we'll keep on burning oil, coal and natural gas to keep our
factories and power plants and cars running, we probably will pump
that much more CO2 into the air during the next century.
</P>
<P>
   That would trap twice as much heat and raise the Earth's
temperature by about 4 degrees, according to climatology experts.
And that would mean trouble on a scale to make the weirdness of
1998 pale _ melting glaciers and sea ice fields, ocean levels
rising 20 inches, weather going viciously haywire.
</P>
<P>
   That's the vision/nightmare of most scientists, including
Trenberth, who are bold enough to state an opinion publicly. Others
think it's hysterical nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough data to prove it, they say. Even if it were true,
higher temperatures would mean places such as Canada, Siberia and
Minnesota would turn into breadbaskets and forestry growing regions
and what's wrong with that, even if agriculture gets wiped out
somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this gigantic heat engine made up of land, water, air,
ice that makes it so wonderful for us to live here,'' says Jim
O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction
Studies at Florida State University. ``(Global warming) means
you've just thrown another log on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather researchers made a big breakthrough when they realized
that conditions in the Pacific Ocean control the path of the jet
stream, the bands of high-altitude winds that flow from west to
east and move weather systems around the globe. When the eastern
Pacific waters are warm _ El Nino _ the jet stream flows steadily
across the continent, suppressing hurricanes and tornadoes. When
the eastern Pacific turns cold _ La Nina _ the warm water gets
pushed out to the western Pacific, where it bumps the subtropical
jet stream north.
</P>
<P>
   That sets off a loopy pattern that streams in over the
Northwest, curves down into the country's mid-section and back up
toward the east coast. And that means wicked winter storms, spring
tornadoes, fiery summers and fall hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All hell breaks loose,'' in O'Brien's words.
</P>
<P>
   We began the year in an El Nino that lasted from April 1997
until last May, but whose storm-suppressing effects lasted until
late summer. As it faded into the cold of La Nina, floods swept
over China and Bangladesh and tropical storms seemed to leap out of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 hurricanes and tropical storms of 1998 killed more than
11,000 people, most of them victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central
America. Wildfires charred more than 500,000 acres in Florida. Ice
storms put out the lights for hundreds of thousands of people in
the mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   And we've been warned that most of Florida _ even the sunny
southern tip _ probably will freeze sometime in January or
February, creating more dry vegetation to fuel new forest fires
expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a plague of tornadoes is predicted for the Ohio and
Tennessee river valleys before La Nina expires in March or April.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we'll have to wait for the next El Nino to bring the
forecast into focus again.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, known to peers as ``Mr. El Nino'' for his research on
that phenomenon, has found another ocean anomaly that may be
connected to global warming, but definitely promises trouble for
large areas of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements show that waves in both the northern Atlantic and
Pacific oceans are getting bigger and stronger, meaning the winds
that drive them are stronger. O'Brien suspects that northern ocean
storms _ like the one that hit Washington and Oregon with
hurricane-force winds last week _ have gotten stronger because
they're carrying extra heat from the tropics to the polar regions
so it can radiate into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the engine works,'' he says, ``and the engine is
running harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The engine, some say, is showing signs of overheating because of
global warming. Water is the planet's air conditioning coolant, and
raising the Earth's surface temperature causes it to evaporate.
That dries out soils, wilts plants, leads to fires and more heat.
Then the droughts that normally come during the cycles of El Nino
and La Nina get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the other half of the equation: All that evaporating
moisture has to go somewhere, so it gets carried 1,000-2,000 miles
away and caught up in a weather system _ such as a hurricane _ that
dumps it someplace _ such as Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part of the global warming scenario we'd better
watch, Mahlman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we expect with global warming is things that are kind of
scary for Florida. We expect hurricanes to be more intense . . . we
don't know if there will be more of them, but if they do form, and
the water is 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, it might crank up more
(Hurricane) Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost certainly will rain a heck of a lot more, and almost
certainly, the summertime heat index will be considerably higher
than it is now. That's kind of creepy, I know _ we even tried to
figure if we had screwed up the calculations, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   South Florida. Hotter and wetter. Creepy, indeed.

REFLECTIONS ON THE PAST YEAR AND HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As this year draws to an end _ a rough year for
the country in general and for many of us in particular _ I find
myself thinking back to a sunny June day nearly four years ago. I
was in Washington, attending a luncheon in a congressional office
building. Hillary Rodham Clinton sat a few tables away, waiting her
turn to speak.
</P>
<P>
   She's a smallish woman, trim and quick to smile in such
settings. She got up, delivered a few well-chosen phrases and sat
down again, smiling and seemingly ill at ease with all the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by that. Here's this blazingly bright Yale lawyer,
the first lady of the land. Yet she struck me as almost shy as she
spoke before a few hundred people. Not at all what I'd expected.
</P>
<P>
   And, maybe, not at all what I thought I was seeing. Maybe that
shyness was only a studied act, a refined bit of political
theatrics. And certainly it seemed a marked contrast to the
confident, almost brittle woman I'd seen on television _ the one
who had told Steve Croft of ``60 Minutes'' through a plastic smile
that she wasn't Tammy Wynette, standing mindlessly by her man
despite the magnitude of his sins against her.
</P>
<P>
   That is, however, precisely what Hillary Clinton has done all
through this year. Confronted with one of the most public and
humiliating betrayals that any married woman has ever endured, she
has stood relentlessly by her man, smiling that same smile, and
asked the nation to forgive him as she claims she has forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody knows what goes on inside anybody else's marriage.
Bill Clinton's penchant for philandering was no secret when he ran
for president, and most Americans were willing to ignore it as long
as his wife was willing to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could have predicted that Clinton's weakness for young
lovelies in thong underwear could provoke such a towering national
crisis. And certainly nobody could have predicted that his wife
would be called upon to bear such a public burden of humiliation,
whatever complicated private arrangement these people have in their
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   What's interesting, though, is this: While Bill Clinton's job
approval rating has soared past the 70 per cent mark, so has the
public's contempt for the man as a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Three in four Americans say they would be horrified if their
kids grew up to be a Bill Clinton _ somebody so fixated on
satisfying his own desires that he seems oblivious to the pain he
causes when he indulges his passions.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's approval numbers, though, are shooting
through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, the pollster headquartered in Utica, N.Y., reports
that if she moves to New York when her husband leaves office and
runs for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
she's a cinch to nail down the Democratic nomination in a state
where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5-3. She would beat every
other Democratic hopeful, including as prodigious a vote-getter as
State Comptroller Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   There's precedent for that sort of carpetbagging. Robert Kennedy
did it in the 1960s, and New Yorkers were delighted to provide him
with a U.S. Senate platform from which to launch his 1968
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, though, had at least a tangential link to New York.
Hillary Clinton has none. So why the willingness of so many New
Yorkers to have her take over Moynihan's Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to write off such imposing political popularity
as mere evidence of the power of victimhood in this whiny,
self-absorbed culture of ours. But there's more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ not a blessed soul _ would blame Hillary Clinton if she
moved out of the White House tomorrow and left her lecherous
husband to whatever fate might await him in the U.S. Senate now
that he has been impeached. It wouldn't cost her a single vote if
she chose to embark on a political career of her own.
</P>
<P>
   That she doesn't clear out says something about her _ that she's
either a saint or a fool, or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   It says also that whatever becomes of Bill Clinton, we probably
haven't seen the last of his dogged, determined wife.

 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's a list of the worst movies of 1998:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' _ Johnny Depp stars as a
fictionalized version of writer Hunter Thompson going through a
mental meltdown on a drug binge. This gross comedy of dementia
makes you feel like signing up for a detox program even if you've
never done drugs.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Tarzan and the Lost City'' _ You can picture the story
conference at the movie studio: ``Hey boss, we've got the extra
loincloth and $14.95 for special effects. Let's make another Tarzan
movie!''
</P>
<P>
   How bad is this one? The rubber snake is the best actor in the
cast.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Two Girls and a Guy'' _ A guy (Robert Downey Jr.) gets
caught deceiving two girlfriends, and they take turns yelling at
him for the entire movie. Sitting through this shrill scolding is
like being trapped in a motel room with thin walls and listening to
some other couple's screaming fit.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Orgazmo'' _ This laughless sex farce, about a missionary
who becomes a porn star, comes from ``South Park's'' Trey Parker,
who is exploring to what extent he can insult the intelligence of
his fans and still take their money. Its NC-17 rating apparently
means that anyone with an IQ of more than 17 doesn't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Sphere'' _ A science-fiction mystery so murky that half the
time you don't know what you're seeing and the other half you don't
know what they're thinking. Bonus points for the most unlikely
casting of the year: pairing Dustin Hoffman with Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Slappy and the Stinkers'' _ In a year of great kid movies,
there's still a stinker, and this tale of cute kids and a sea lion
is it. With its flying food, body odor, toilet and barf jokes to
amuse the kiddies, the movie must have started hundreds of family
fights over which parent took the kids to see it and which was
lucky enough to regrout the bathroom tile instead.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Hush'' _ Jessica Lange goes nuts as the psycho
mother-in-law from hell in a thriller that plods along with the
pace of a bad head cold. You know you'll get over it sometime, but
it doesn't feel like any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Senseless'' _ Marlon Wayans and David Spade team up in a
college comedy full of scratching and body-piercing jokes. Well,
not jokes exactly. References. ``Senseless'' is so flat and devoid
of anything approaching fun that it seems cruel to pick on it.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Palmetto'' _ An addled attempt to create the passion of
``Body Heat's'' wave of sex and crime. But Woody Harrelson and
Elisabeth Shue aren't sweating out of passion. They're sweating out
the bad directing and writing.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Lost in Space'' _ Basic rule of bad science-fiction
movies: When you have no idea what you're doing, jack up the sound
effects.
</P>
<P>
   This attempt to turn the camp TV show into a serious adventure
movie is so brainless you could hear the explosions two theaters
over.
</P>
<P>
   Five films that would have made the worst list if we counted by
15s instead of 10s: ``Zero Effect,'' `` Small Soldiers,'' ``Let's
Talk About Sex,'' ``Rush Hour,'' ``What Dreams May Come.'' &QL;

   PBP_GO SMOKE (DEVELOPING) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So who are
these doctors who are fighting for Ed Holloway's right to smoke in
a Palm Beach County building as he works as a planner? Holloway,
who has two forms of cancer, says he suffers from post-traumatic
stress from his tour of duty in Vietnam. He got some doctors to say
that he needs to smoke. So is their opinion supported by medical
thought on the subject? And what can the Army tell us about
Holloway and his tour in Vietnam? (Moffett, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP_WE SMOKE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A visit to the front
lines of the smoking wars. How do the county workers forced outside
to light up feel about their persecution by the majority? And what
do non-smokers think about the enemy? (Hayes, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP_CHILD SEAT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A new University of
Florida study of child safety seats found that 95 percent of
children aren't strapped in correctly _ and greater danger for
injury or death in a car accident. The statewide study, funded by
the Florida Department of Transportation, examined more than 1,500
safety seats in vehicle inspections during the past year. The main
problem is parents failing to use a metal locking clip on the child
seat, which prevents the seat from being thrown forward in the
event of a collision. (Banstetter Palm Beach Post)

   AUS-Y2K-COMPUTER-BUG_ The Millennium Bug could start a preview
of disaster today, as some computers that don't recognize years
that begin with anything other than 19 try to update their internal
calendars by looking ahead one year and trip over Jan. 1, 2000.
They could crash or, more likely, begin spewing erroneous
information. What kind of computers? Probably not those that
operate Austin's services, such as water or electricity, police,
fire or EMS. Officials are on top of those. More likely the cash
registers or accounting systems of small businesses that haven't
been able to afford Y2K fixes. State, city and UT experts say we'll
have to wait and see. (Stanley, American-Statesman)

`STALIN'S SPY': PASSIONATE AND RECKLESS LIFE OF A COMMUNIST SPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1964, Richard Sorge, the celebrated spy who provided
information to Soviet military intelligence from his base in World
War II Tokyo, officially became a hero of the Soviet Union. It did
him no good, since he had been executed in Japan in 1943, but it
illustrated the paradox of his remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   After his capture by the Japanese, against whom he had spied,
Sorge was offered to the Soviet Union in exchange for Japanese
spies imprisoned in Russia. ``The man called Richard Sorge is
unknown to us,'' Soviet officials replied, wanting nothing to do
with their most important espionage agent in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that the man called Richard Sorge has been
unknown to most of us. But thanks to ``Stalin's Spy,'' by the
British journalist Robert Whymant, we now know a great deal about
the romantic, intelligent, reckless and extraordinary German
communist who was one of history's most successful spies.
</P>
<P>
   That he was recognized for his accomplishments in Russia only 21
years after his execution is merely one of several paradoxes in a
history that is scrupulously and readably presented in Whymant's
book. Another is that Stalin ignored the single most important
piece of information that it would have been possible for a Soviet
spy to obtain: advance knowledge of Germany's plans to invade the
Soviet Union in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, Sorge, though a pro-Soviet communist,
credibly emerges in Whymant's portrayal as a hero, and not only to
the Soviet Union. His major motivation was hatred of Hitler and
Nazism in Germany, and his work was aimed at hastening their
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Sorge's primary duty in Tokyo was to help the
Soviet Union ward off a very real threat from Japan,'' Whymant
writes. ``However, he saw Nazi Germany as the most evil and
dangerous foe, not only of Russia but of civilization itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thwarted by Stalin's stubborn refusal to believe his warning of
the German invasion, Sorge leaked that information to an American
journalist, Joseph Newman of The New York Herald Tribune. He also
provided information to Western reporters on Japan's ambitions to
conquer Southeast Asia. ``Taking a broad strategic view, Sorge
reckoned that it was imperative to alert the Western democracies to
Japan's aggressive designs,'' Whymant concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Whymant, who spent some 20 years researching this book, tracked
down survivors of the Tokyo espionage ring that Sorge led and made
good use of newly opened Soviet archives to piece together the full
and fascinating story of ``Stalin's Spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorge was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, where his German father
worked in the oil fields. But Sorge, whose mother was Russian, was
taken at an early age to Germany, growing up in Berlin and serving
as an artillery bombardier in World War I. Wounded and
disillusioned, he returned home from the war and quickly became
active in the Communist Party. In the mid-1920s, he was recruited
by the Comintern, the Communist International, to become a Soviet
agent.
</P>
<P>
   His first posting was Shanghai, China, during an early stage of
the conflict between Chinese Nationalists and Communists. Among his
closest friends was the pro-Communist American journalist Agnes
Smedley, who introduced him to some of the people who would later
form part of his secret circle in Tokyo, including a
well-connected, secretly left-wing Japanese journalist named Ozaki
Hotsumi.
</P>
<P>
   Called back to Moscow in 1933, Sorge was soon sent to Tokyo with
instructions to report on Japan's intentions toward the Soviet
Union in the global conflict already looming.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge returned for a time to Germany to establish his
connections as a German journalist. His wartime service and his
wounds served him well as he sought letters of introduction to
German officials, including the German military attache Eugen Ott,
who would later become Hitler's ambassador to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge arrived in Tokyo in September 1933 as an officer in the
Soviet army, attached to the 4th Department, responsible for agents
operating in foreign countries. During his nine years in Japan, he
built a small but remarkable network of informers who fed Moscow an
amazing stream of information.
</P>
<P>
   Whymant's account of those years is gripping and instructive,
and not only because of Sorge's exploits in espionage. Sorge lived
tempestuously and licentiously in Tokyo, drinking to excess,
speeding around town on a motorcycle and pursuing Japanese and
German women (including a visiting anti-Nazi harpsichordist named
Eta Harich-Schneider).
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, he did not even bother much to conceal his
pro-Russian and anti-Nazi sentiments, which seem to have been
dismissed in the German Embassy as the quirks of a brilliant and
valuable analyst of Japan. While a few gaps in the record remain
unfilled, Whymant is able to tell us almost exactly how Sorge built
his Tokyo network and how he obtained the information he passed on
to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A key to his success was his friendship with Ozaki Hotsumi, his
old friend from Shanghai who belonged to the circle of advisers
around the Japanese prime minister, Prince Konoye. But the most
important intelligence that fell into Sorge's hands came from the
Germans. Sorge was so trusted in the embassy that his good friend
Ott sent him on a secret mission to Shanghai, giving him the German
cipher tables used in communications with Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stretches the imagination to suppose that these coveted
keys were not spirited out of Japan and passed on to Moscow's
code-breakers,'' Whymant writes.
</P>
<P>
   Whymant covers all of the essential questions about the Soviet
spy's career, including Sorge's growing ambivalence toward the
Soviet Union under Stalin and the sense he had of being trapped in
his role. In 1937 he ignored an order to return to Moscow for
consultations, apparently sensing that he might be imprisoned, or
executed, if he obeyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's counterespionage finally caught up with him in 1942
after interrogation of a minor member of his network. After months
of questioning, he was hanged. Had the Japanese been able to turn
him over to the Russians, he would almost certainly have been shot,
given Stalin's embarrassment at having ignored Sorge's information
about Hitler's invasion plans.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Whymant's portrayal of Sorge's life as one of
tragic ambiguity is persuasive. ``Stalin's Spy'' is an utterly
fascinating book that treats Sorge with the complexity that his
life and career deserve.

WILLIAM DUNLAP: AN ART HISTORIAN WHO KEPT THE FLAME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time in this country, there were more artists than
art historians. In fact, there was only one real specimen of the
now ubiquitous breed, William Dunlap (1766-1839), a
man-about-culture who was also a painter. His two-volume ``History
of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United
States,'' published in 1834, is a chatty but far from naive rundown
of American art from its inception to Dunlap's own day, and it
established his reputation as the father of American art history.
</P>
<P>
   Like Giorgio Vasari in 16th-century Italy, Dunlap was very much
a participant in his scene, chronicling the lives of contemporary
and earlier artists, architects, sculptors, printmakers and such
with pondered and sometimes pungent opinions. Not unduly modest, he
devoted no less than three chapters to himself, and he was high on
Benjamin West (with whom he had studied in Britain), Washington
Allston, Thomas Cole and Gilbert Stuart. He also included artists
whose names today evoke a blank stare, and those he didn't like,
among them his contemporary Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827),
whose work he brushed off with ``will soon be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest early-American show at Hirschl &AMP; Adler Galleries,
longtime specialists in Yankee art, is a salute to Dunlap and his
book. ``The American Vasari: William Dunlap and His World''
includes more than 60 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and
engravings by artists who made it into Dunlap's tome. The show runs
through Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The names range from the ornithologist John James Audubon (``How
much science gains by increasing the picture of a bird beyond that
size necessary to display all the parts distinctly, is with me
questionable,'' Dunlap wrote) to Robert Walter Weir (1803-1899), a
drawing instructor at West Point lauded by Dunlap but whose
painting ``Niagara Falls'' (1856) adds nothing to nature's
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The American Vasari'' is a bright idea for a show, and
it offers a robust selection from the gallery's remarkable
inventory of early-American treasures (with a few loans sprinkled
in).
</P>
<P>
   Portraits are the emphasis, as they were in Dunlap's time. Among
the most interesting is one by Edward Savage (1761-1817) of
Jedidiah Morse and his son, Samuel F.B. Morse, from around 1794. It
shows the future scientist and painter, with whom Dunlap helped
found the insurgent National Academy of Design in 1826, as a
fat-faced little boy at the side of his father, a Yale-educated
geographer and Congregational minister wearing black clerical garb
and an expression of high moral purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to this austere rendering is the lah-di-dah
likeness of Elizabeth Eliot Burr (1798) by Ralph Earl (1751-1801):
a Connecticut grande dame sitting in sumptuous surroundings,
dressed in a gown of gleaming white satin and holding a chain
attached to a pet squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Another standout portrait is of Rajah Rommahon Roy (1833), by
Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), the son of Charles Willson Peale. Roy
was a Hindu reformist and linguist who founded the Theistic Church
in India, and in his last years he was an envoy to Britain. Peale's
masterly portrait, in exotic high colors, shows Roy wearing a
turban and a salmon-colored shirt, his fleshy but appealing face in
mellow repose.
</P>
<P>
   A small but jaunty head-and-shoulders self-portrait of Dunlap
shows him in a dressy white cravat and dark coat. He gazes straight
at the viewer and he doesn't hide his out-of-commission right eye,
blinded in a childhood accident.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he looks every inch the cosmopolitan that he was, a
friend of James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving and William
Cullen Bryant and a polymath who, besides being an artist and art
historian, also wrote plays, diaries, a history of the theater and
another of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is by no means all portraits; there are landscapes,
still lifes, genre scenes, miniatures, historical paintings,
architectural views and even a pair of precise watercolor plans
(1806) for an underwater cannon by the steamboat pioneer Robert
Fulton (1765-1815).
</P>
<P>
   ``As a painter, Fulton does not rank high,'' Dunlap wrote, but
went on to praise him as ``a kind father, a fast friend, an
enlightened philosopher and a good republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Among landscapists, Dunlap particularly favored Cole
(1801-1848), a founder of the Hudson River School, who is
represented here by a glowing golden idyll, ``The Old Mill at
Sunset'' (1844).
</P>
<P>
   Cole was ``discovered'' in 1825 by Dunlap and two friends, the
painters John Trumbull and Asher B. Durand (at that time more noted
as an engraver than a painter). Trumbull saw Cole's paintings in
the window of a Manhattan bookstore, bought one, then took Dunlap
and Durand to view them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the sensitive and amiable painter, then seen by me
for the first time,'' Dunlap recalled, ``standing in presence of
the three above-mentioned, like a schoolboy in presence of the
trustees, and looking an image of diffidence before men, neither of
whom could produce a rival to the works he offered for the paltry
price of $25 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Works by Durand and Trumbull also appear in the show. Durand's
opus is a peaceful cliche of a landscape, dating from 1860 to 1870,
and Trumbull's is a Rubens-influenced grisaille drawing of a female
nude, made around 1795.
</P>
<P>
   In the still life offerings, nothing quite comes up to Raphaelle
Peale's study of an ear of corn and a cantaloupe half (1813), an
austere but brilliantly rendered observation of these edibles that
has the character of a fine portrait.
</P>
<P>
   As for the genre department, there is the beguiling ``What Have
I Forgot?'' (1862) by William Sidney Mount (1807-1869), depicting a
boy in a rustic yard carrying a packed basket. (Dunlap predicted
Mount would go far.) Somewhere between genre and landscape is the
jolly winter scene ``Sleigh Ride'' (1838), by the Philadelphian
Thomas Birch (1779-1851), surprising in that Birch's specialty was
marine painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists in this show were far more significant, as
artists, than Dunlap. But as a keeper of the flame, he knew that
posterity needed him.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, he wrote humbly, was to provide ``many valuable facts,
which would otherwise have been lost; and to leave information
respecting those professors of the arts who have failed, as well as
those who have attained to honorable distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Agree with his judgments or not, that's exactly what he did.

PAC-10 LOOKS STRONGER AND MORE COMPETITIVE THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Such are the strides made by the Pac-10 over the
course of the last few years that some of the league's college
basketball coaches have taken to making bold, definitive
statements.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at Berkeley couach Ben Braun, when
asked a couple months ago whether one could argue that the Pac-10
is the preeminent conference in the nation, said, ``I don't even
think you want to say arguably. I think it is the top conference.
And I think you're hearing others around the country saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Payne, the Oregon State coach who clearly has an
outsiders' view with regard to the NCAA Tournament, said the Pac-10
has ``maybe eight teams with a legitimate shot at making the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, these aren't far-fetched statements. Sure, the ACC is
probably superior to the Pac-10, but there are those who would back
up the Braun. And, no, eight conference teams won't make the
tournament, but Payne is absolutely right that eight have a
legitimate chance.
</P>
<P>
   Given that setup, here's a best guess on how the race stands to
play out from top to bottom, with a quick look at each team:
</P>
<P>
   1. STANFORD (10-2 nonconference record): The Cardinal were the
overwhelming, nearly-unanimous media pick before the season
started, but now the gap has narrowed considerably in part because
of injuries to center Jason Collins, forward/guard Ryan Mendez and
point guard Michael McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   2. ARIZONA (8-0): Gone are starters Mike Bibby, Miles Simon,
Michael Dickerson and Bennett Davison, leaving Lute Olson _ the
Pac-10's longest-standing coach _ with a bevy of newcomers to cope
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we have some very good young players,'' said
Olson, in his 16th season at Arizona. ``The bad news is they're
young.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the freshmen, the real key may be senior point guard
Jason Terry, who has the talent to be the league's MVP _ assuming
he's not exhausted from playing nearly every minute of every game.
</P>
<P>
   3. CAL (9-1): With their performance against North Carolina, the
Bears proved they not only belong in the Top 25 but they could do
some real damage in the Pac-10. Geno Carlisle clearly is a big-time
player, and Cal has several players who can hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   4. UCLA (7-2): Arizona has got nothing on UCLA when it comes to
youth. Of the Bruins' 14-man roster, 12 are either freshmen or
sophomores, but like Olson, Steve Lavin has some great young
talent. Lavin had perhaps the best recruiting class in the nation,
and he's jumping right in with post men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome
Moiso, plus forwards Matt Barnes and JaRon Rush and guard Ray
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like Arizona, UCLA's key will be its top returning guard,
Baron Davis. Davis incurred a surgery-requiring knee injury during
the NCAA Tournament last year, and he's still not back to 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   5. OREGON (8-1): The Ducks clearly are a program on its way up,
with coach Ernie Kent leading the way. Three starters are back from
a 13-14 team that tied for fifth in the Pac-10 last season, and
Oregon has been bolstered by the addition of junior college
transfers Alex Scales, a 6-4 shooting guard, and Darius Wright, a
6-foot point guard.
</P>
<P>
   6. WASHINGTON (7-3): The Huskies are much higher than this on a
lot of other so-called lists, largely because they return their
three best players _ Todd MacCulloch, Donald Watts and Deon Luton _
from a team that pushed the University of Connecticut to the limit
in the East Regional semis. But Washington has a big question mark
at point guard, and that could be enough to keep the Huskies from
challenging.
</P>
<P>
   7. ARIZONA STATE (8-4): The Sun Devils won their final six games
of the preseason, and if they come together under first-year coach
Rob Evans, they may make a move into the upper half. Mike Batiste,
Bobby Lazor and Eddie House are quite the scoring trifecta, though
Jeremy Veal will be tough to replace.
</P>
<P>
   8. USC (8-1): The Trojans, 9-19 last year, are off to their best
start since the 1991-92 season, and there are a lot of people who
see tem as the team most likely to make a move. Said Washington
coach Bob Bender: ``I think 'SC is a team that is capable of
surprising a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Henry Bibby turned to mostly young players by the end of
last season to get them ready for this year, plus Bibby added
junior college transfer Brian Scalabrine, who is seventh in the
conference in scoring at 15.9 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   9. WASHINGTON STATE (6-5): The Cougars were in a lot of games
last season, they just didn't win many, finishing 3-15 in league
play. This year might not be much better considering they lost 16.1
points and 10.1 rebounds per game from Carlos Daniel and they've
spent much of this preseason coping with a series of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   10. OREGON STATE (6-3): Corey Benjamin and his 19.8 points per
game are gone, but, actually, the Beavers tended to play better
when he was hurt last season. Still, the Beavers don't seem to have
much, and Payne's likely response is to return to a deliberate
style in which he tries to slow down the game and keep his team in
it.

IT'S GOOD TO BE THE QUEEN OF CHICAGO BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - No wonder one of Koko Taylor's many albums is called
``Force of Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old blueswoman can holler and shout with disarming
intensity. She's got a fiery, immediate way with a song. If some
singers give you the impression of whispering in your ear, Taylor
practically shouts in your face.
</P>
<P>
   But calling from her home in Chicago, Taylor sounds less like a
force of nature and more like the kindly grandma she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry I'm late,'' says the woman dubbed the Queen of
Chicago Blues. ``I was running a fever and had chills last night,
so I had to go to the doctor. But I think it's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Taylor is in pretty fine health. But being sick seems
like a terrible way to end what has been a banner year for the lady
who growls like a caged tiger in song.
</P>
<P>
   In blues circles in general and in Chicago in particular, the
woman is an institution. There was even a play mounted this year in
the Windy City about Taylor's life, ``Wang Dang Doodle.'' It
featured Queen Roy singing the songs Taylor made famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was involved in no kind of way with the play,''
she says, sounding both flattered and peeved at the same time.
``This woman was singing my songs and acting as much like me as
possible. It was a real nice show _ I really appreciated the fact
that they cared enough about me to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But watching someone else do blues the Taylor way doesn't sound
like her idea of a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the actress did a wonderful job,'' Taylor says.
``But any time you automatically sing anyone's else songs . . . Say
I pick a song of Aretha Franklin, like ``Respect.'' That track is
already laid, because she laid the foundation. You have to be a
blueprint. But this girl is trying to sound like me, to pass like
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what I'm saying,'' she continues, very
butter-wouldn't-melt-in-my-mouth. ``She is (begin ital) ``very''
(end ital) sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised on a sharecropper's farm in Memphis, it's been a
long road to the blues heights for Taylor. Willie Dixon discovered
her in 1962 and helped her land a recording contract with the famed
Chess label. Since then, there have been 14 W.C. Handy Awards (the
blues equivalent to the Grammy), not to mention a Grammy itself.
</P>
<P>
   There were dry spells, particularly in the early '70s. But once
she signed with Alligator Records in 1975, she climbed back to the
top of the ladder. There have been seven albums for the label; an
eighth is due out next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back, I am really proud of everything that I have
done,'' she says. ``It has been a struggle over the years, and
everyone knows that blues music is always on the tail end of
everyone's totem pole. It's getting better, but I'm doing a lot of
things I've never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes films, such as David Lynch's ``Wild at Heart,''
and TV spots on ``Night Watch'' and ``Late Show With David
Letterman.'' At an age when many performers slow down, Taylor is
like the Energizer Bunny: She just keeps going and going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have to say, I sing better now than I did on the old
records,'' she says, a woman proud of her accomplishments. ``It
builds and grows with experience. I've been doing it for over 30
years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I didn't start out as great as they say I am today. I
had to grow. I had to get there. The older I get, the better I get.
It's like fine whiskey _ the older it gets, the better it
tastes.'' &QL;

OPINIONS VARY ABOUT ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM Y2K BUG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wall Street economist Edward Yardeni expects the
nation to plunge into its worst recession in a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan anticipates ``some very
unusual things'' when computers try to comprehend the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Staffen of Austin, Texas, has already bought herself a
backup generator, while Knight Ridder executive David Starr thinks
the whole issue is largely a big con.
</P>
<P>
   One year from today, our plugged-in world will know the
significance of the year 2000 or ``Y2K'' problem, the widespread
computer glitch that will prompt uncorrected software and computer
chips to misread dates in 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and at least some governments are scrambling to root
out the computer bugs, checking millions of lines of computer code
and examining innumerable embedded microchips in an effort to head
off potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   But costs are mounting, and success is anything but assured.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm Gartner Group estimates that the world will
spend $600 billion _ 20 percent more than the cost of the Vietnam
War _ to deal with the Y2K issue. Merrill Lynch puts the price tag
closer to $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Gartner estimates that one in five U.S. companies will not
be ready when the date turns over. The federal government is viewed
as the world leader in addressing the problem, but a congressional
oversight committee thinks that the State Department won't have the
Y2K problem licked until 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scope of the problem, at least some disruption in
our computer-laden society appears inevitable. Just how extensive
the fallout will be is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two camps,'' said Don Jones, Year 2000 product
manager for software giant Microsoft Corp. ``One says that
Armageddon is coming with the year 2000. Planes will fall out of
the sky. The other camp says that there really is no problem. The
truth is probably in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, President Clinton's Y2K czar, figures only 2 to 3
percent of the world's embedded computer chips are at risk of
failing. But with an estimated 50 billion microchips buried in
computers and machinery around the world, that could mean that as
many as 150 million chips could be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything is going to get fixed,'' Koskinen warns. ``My
view is not to tell people there will be no inconvenience, and they
won't notice it. The chances are a lot of people will notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``millennium bug'' _ a somewhat inaccurate moniker
since the new millennium doesn't actually begin until Jan. 1, 2001
_ the Y2K problem stems from a practice begun more than 30 years
ago, during the early days of computer software writing.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to save computing capacity and apparently never
suspecting their software might be used as late as 2000,
programmers typically abbreviated year designations as two digits.
</P>
<P>
   What that meant was, in some cases, their programs would
interpret ``99'' to mean 1999 but ``00'' as ``1900.'' In the case
of some personal computers, ``00'' will be interpreted as 1980 _
Year 0 for the PC, while some embedded controllers, computer chips
implanted in specialized devices, may not be able to interpret 2000
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the approaching turn of the century, programmers
continued the practice until quite recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We failed to manage the programmers,'' said Yardeni, an
economist with Deutsche Bank Securities who has emerged as the
leading Y2K doomsayer on Wall Street. ``We created a global
computer network without any adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses may get a strong indication of what's in store Sept.
9 _ that's 09/09/99 _ another problematic date since in Cobol, a
computer language used in many business applications, 9999 means
``quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The next moment to watch is 7 p.m. EST Dec. 31 _ midnight Jan. 1
Universal Coordinated Time. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Many operations are expected to take special precautions on
those days. Chevron Corp., for instance, has issued a directive
that no company-owned or contractor-operated oil tanker will be
permitted in narrow passages or restricted waters on either Sept. 9
or Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans will run into the bug while working on their
personal computers. Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., for
instance, was making personal computers as late as September 1997
that did not completely account for the Y2K problem. Even
Microsoft's popular Windows 98 operating software has a Year 2000
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are offering consumers free software to fix the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers also may notice an incorrect date on their fax
machines and their camcorders, although the devices should operate
properly otherwise, consumer products makers say. And auto
manufacturers, after months of investigation, say motorists can be
confident their cars will run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is trying to swat down the most
pernicious rumors. Elevators won't stop between floors, regulators
say. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't plan to ground
planes. Pacemakers won't malfunction in patients' chests.
</P>
<P>
   For Uncle Sam, the world's largest computer user, the Y2K
problem presents a daunting challenge. As of Nov. 13, 61 percent of
the computer systems deemed ``mission critical'' for the federal
government had been repaired and tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which Koskinen notes ``had cornered the
market on embedded chips'' with its ``smart'' weapons, must check
and test 2,581 systems, more than a third of all the critical
government systems. As of Nov. 13, the Defense Department had
corrected slightly more than half of its critical operations.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also are concerned about the nation's Medicare
program, which pumps $250 billion into the nation's health care
system. The Medicare program actually is administered by 60 large
private insurance companies, some of which are chafing at the
government's insistence that their system be fully Y2K-compliant by
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is not that the whole system would fail, but that
some will have to have backup and contingency plans,'' Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many have expressed concerns that the FAA won't be able to get
its antiquated computer systems in shape before the date change and
will be forced to either ground flights or greatly expand time
between landings.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen has vowed to fly on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 to demonstrate
confidence in the system, although 60 percent of the information
technology executives surveyed by CIO Magazine said they would not
fly on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, attention to the Y2K issue is spotty. While the United
States, Canada and Britain are trying aggressively to deal with the
Y2K problem, even highly industrialized nations such as France and
Germany have been slow to take the threat seriously, while nuclear
powers such as Russia and China appear mystified.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., head of the House Technology
Subcommittee, tells the story of a U.S. foreign service officer in
an unnamed country who had asked about the nation's efforts to
handle the computer bug and was allegedly told: ``Not to worry my
friend. We are prepared to spray anywhere and everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, while trying to wake up much of the
world to the problem, is also busy waving the Y2K flag at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October, President Clinton signed special legislation to
allow companies to share information on ways to handle the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidelines
requiring companies to report on their Y2K activities, but critics
complain that companies have been loath to provide real information
about their efforts to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, prodded by regulators, is probably farther
ahead in dealing with the issue than any other industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. conducted on-site
inspections at 6,034 institutions regarding their Y2K efforts. In
June, 43 institutions received an unsatisfactory grade for their
activities, a number that had been pared to nine by November.
(Regulators refused to release the names of these institutions).
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, the nation's banks were required to have the
bugs worked out of their in-house systems. The idea was to give the
industry time to handle the more difficult problem of ensuring that
the links between institutions also work properly.
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 approaches, bank regulators are concerned that consumers
will begin withdrawing their funds from the nation's financial
institutions. In anticipation of that, the Federal Reserve is
increasing the amount of currency available.
</P>
<P>
   ``My suspicion is that we're going to run into a lot of
problems,'' Greenspan told a Senate committee last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The maritime industry is known to be woefully behind in
preparing for the year 2000 bug, while the health industry will
have a daunting task dealing with the numerous chips embedded in
increasingly sophisticated medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And many observers have expressed concerns about the nation's
electric power grid, fearful that power plants will be knocked out
of commission because of uncorrected problems in their own
operations or in equipment and services provided by outside
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's oil companies, meanwhile, must test for and correct
computer bugs in sophisticated equipment used from the wellhead to
the gasoline pump.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. was conducting a Y2K test on an oil
platform in the North Sea last year only to have a
contractor-supplied monitor used to detect natural gas releases
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest impact for Phillips and a lot of large companies
is not going to be the stuff inside your fence,'' said Del Clark,
director of Phillips' year 2000 program. The real risk for
companies are the suppliers and contractors they must rely on to
ensure that their products are Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty about the Y2K issue, expert opinions
about the economic damage from the millennium bug vary.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's Yardeni estimates that the nation's gross
domestic product could drop by 3 to 5 percent. ``It's going to be a
wicked, nasty recession,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds Griffith, a professor of finance at Stephen F. Austin
State University in Nacogdoches, Texas, figures the economy stands
a 50-50 chance of plunging into a depression and a 12 percent
chance of suffering a major collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimists, however, appear to be in the minority. Some Y2K
experts believe that all the computer upgrading being done by
businesses and governments will help improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, surveying 33
forecasters about the effects of the Y2K issue, found that the
average prediction calls for a 0.3 percent gain in gross domestic
product in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The economic forecasting firm WEFA, in a report issued last
June, predicted that preparations to handle the Y2K bug would
actually boost economic activity this year. The group predicted a
slowing of economic activity in 2000 but does not expect a
recession to result from the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, after conducting an exhaustive study of
companies' efforts to deal with the Y2K problem, reported it was
``cautiously optimistic'' that industry was taking the issue
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are persuaded the Y2K bug represents a real threat.
David Starr, chief information officer for publishing giant Knight
Ridder, calls the uproar over the millennium bug ``the most
overblown thing I've seen in my 20 years of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr believes many companies are being hoodwinked by Y2K
consultants, which are racking up fees correcting Y2K bugs that do
not really affect operations. He is urging companies to test their
systems before trying to fix the computer bugs, to make sure they
are worth bothering about.
</P>
<P>
   With government and business leaders unable to provide complete
assurances, the public debate over Y2K, as played out in Internet
chat rooms and on late-night radio, has taken on apocalyptic tones.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``survivalists'' are bracing for what they fear will
be a technological breakdown, while numerous religious groups are
linking the millennium bug to an anticipated End Time.
</P>
<P>
   Staffen has organized an Austin-based group known as the Frog
Pond, named for the old adage that a frog dropped in a pot of
scalding hot water will jump out while one placed in tepid water
where the temperature is raised gradually will be boiled to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We represent those who realize we're in hot water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 or so members of the Frog Pond meet weekly at a local
Denny's restaurant, where they discuss how best to store water,
preserve food and protect themselves against possible marauders.
</P>
<P>
   Christian broadcaster Jerry Falwell is hawking a $28 video ``A
Christian's Guide to the Millennium Bug,'' detailing possible Y2K
``catastrophes'' ranging from a failure of the military defense
system to a grounding of commercial aircraft worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   (Despite the intense religious interest in the new millennium,
historians point out that the 2000th anniversary of the birth of
Jesus of Nazareth has probably already occurred. The sixth century
abbot who invented our Christian system of reckoning time,
Dionysius Exiguus, miscalculated. Jesus likely was born no later
than 4 B.C., historians say).
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 percent of information technology executives surveyed by
CIO Magazine said they are upgrading security at their own homes in
the event of trouble _ including possible stockpiling of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building hysteria over Y2K is the result of a bunch of
fairly common strains in American life that are coming together,''
namely paranoia, fear of the unknown, a distrust of technology and
religious associations with the millennium, argued James Glassman,
a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me that people are so frightened of these
things,'' Glassman said. ``In a way, this could become a
self-fulfilling prophecy, if you get enough people who are
hysterical and start withdrawing their money from banks and
hoarding water and hoarding ammunition and walking around with
guns.''

JUSTICE REPORT SAYS MURDER RATE LOWEST IN THREE DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For newspaper release Sunday Jan. 3 ; broadcast release, Saturday,
Jan. 2, at 4:30 p.m. EST)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's murder rate fell in 1997 to its lowest
level in three decades, with the bulk of the decline occurring in
recent years in large cities with populations exceeding one million
people, the Justice Department announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 the national murder rate was 6.9 per 100,000 people, and
in 1997 the figure was 6.8 percent, the department said in a new
report, ``Homicide Trends in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s the murder rate dropped in big cities.
There, it fell from 35.5 homicides per 100,000 people in 1991 to
20.3 per 100,000 people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline was attributable to a drop in gun-related
violence among juveniles and young adults in those years, the study
said. It added that the murder rate among adults over age 25
declined from what it was three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The study followed an FBI report last month that said major
crime generally had declined for six successive years.
</P>

   ``This is remarkable progress, and it shows that our strategy of
more police, tougher gun laws, and better crime prevention is
making a difference,'' President Clinton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, which did not provide data for
individual cities, showed that the murder rate in 1997 was higher
in the South and the West Coast than it was in New England, the
Rocky Mountain states and the central region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s and early 1990s, there were dramatic increases
in homicides committed by young black males _ those 18-24 _ but the
figures sank in recent years. In 1985, 133.7 young black men per
100,000 committed murder. By 1993, the figure soared to 347.6 per
100,000. It began to decline in 1994 and by 1997 had dropped to
246.4 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of all young murderers, ages 18-24, while declining,
was still higher than in the 1980s. In 1985 the figure was 21.4
youths per 100,000. The peak came in 1991 when 40.8 youths per
100,000 were convicted of murder. The decline began the next year,
and in 1997 the figure fell to 33.2 youths per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 through 1997, 85 percent of white murder victims were
killed by whites, while 94 percent of black victims were killed by
blacks. During the same period, 13 percent of white murder victims
were killed by blacks, while about 6 percent of black victims were
killed by whites.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 through 1997, blacks were seven times more likely than
whites to be murdered and eight times more likely than whites to
commit murders.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the victim was killed by an acquaintance, one in
10 was murdered by a member of another race. In cases where the
killer was a stranger, three in 10 victims were murdered by a
member of another race.
</P>
<P>
   Males were more likely to be murderers and murder victims. Men
were about nine times more likely than women to kill. In addition,
male and female murderers were more likely to target men than
women.
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on FBI crime data and was prepared for the
Justice Department by James Alan Fox, professor of criminal justice
at Northeastern University in Boston, and Marianne Zawitz, a
Justice Department statistician.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's FBI report said that seven major crimes declined in
the first half of 1998, compared with the first six months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the two periods, officials noted an 8 percent drop in
murders and an 11 percent drop in robberies. Aggravated assault and
rape each were down 5 percent; auto theft declined 8 percent;
larceny-theft was down 5 percent, and burglary fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the country had turned a
``historic corner'' on crime. ``Crime is still too high,'' she
said, ``but rising crime rates are not a fact of life.''

 &HT;    Be it resolved: I'll watch for chance to say thank you
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A form of New Year's festivity that has ever puzzled me is the
``watch party.'' What, I used to wonder when we assembled at the
country church on New Year's Eve, were we watching for? Would there
be some phenomenon in the sky to tell us that we were entering a
new year?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us would rush outside and stand, shivering in the
unexpected south Alabama cold, peering at the sky. We never saw
anything to mark the end of the 12 months and usher in a new
beginning. But we felt duty-bound to watch.
</P>
<P>
   When nothing came of it, we were inclined to pass over New
Year's as a day invented by parents and teachers to incite us to
make good resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   People joke about those resolutions nowadays, and I'm not sure
anybody, least of all children, sits down with pencil and paper and
draws a blueprint for doing better and being better.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad idea, though, is it? It's like the old rite of
spring housecleaning, a way of taking a look at one's life or house
or job and wondering if there's not some way of improving it. If
sins of omission and commission assail you at year's end, there's
something therapeutic about vowing to make a change.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is probably perfect. I know that after Christmas,
there's always a period of ``I should have, why didn't I?'' to
disturb your sense of well-being, to ruffle any smugness you may
have accumulated. It may be the presents you didn't send or the
ones you undeservedly received. It may be the Christmas cards you
didn't mail off. In my case, it's almost always the thank yous I
didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   There's always a moment or two in a day or a sleepless night
when you can scribble a note to thank somebody for what they have
done for you or meant to you. I made mental lists of those people
in the dark of several nights _ and then turned over and went back
to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But when a thank you or an expression of love comes your way,
guilt knocks at your door. For several days, I have lugged around
in my sweater pocket a note from a good friend who simply scrawled
on a piece of scrap paper out of his office these words: ``I love
you. I love you. I love you. And so does Helen (his wife).'' I love
them both, but I didn't pick up scrap paper and pen and say so _ to
them or to many other people.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call from a friend in the mountains, who left a message
that he was just checking to see how I was feeling, took me back to
a friend who came and sat in my room for an entire day, listening
to a mentally ill relative purge his heart and soul of things he
had done wrong in his life. He went back to childhood, and he
poured out his guilt for failures and offenses he had committed.
</P>
<P>
   She listened patiently, and when it was over, he seemed clean
and at peace. He died tranquilly a few days later. I have never
forgotten the sacrifice she made to just sit and listen, and I
haven't ever thanked her enough, particularly when she fell ill
herself and could have used my help.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the old New England poet whose
bearded countenance hung in the second-grade classroom when I was a
child in Mobile, Ala., called New Year's one of ``the secret
anniversaries of the heart,'' one of the ``holiest of all
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been that for most of us. Balls and big
ballgames and eating and drinking fill the day for many of us. And
I wouldn't advise anybody to pass up black-eyed peas and rice,
those symbols of good luck a-coming to many of us. But more
important is to say ``Thank you'' and ``I love you,'' if you don't
write down another resolution.

 &HT;    The race is on to encapsulate the last 10 years of the
millennium in one pithy phrase.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We interrupt this decade to help you sum up this
decade. Prematurely, yes, but then, what isn't in this ``All News,
All the Time'' era in which we now live?
</P>
<P>
   It's a decade that's seen the resurrection of such 1950s
cultural icons as the martini _ although now they're mixed with
generous fingerfuls of Web surfing. A decade when we've revisited
and openly yearned for the simpler, nobler spirit of 1940s, World
War II America _ but wouldn't dream of turning off our cellular
phones and beepers while watching ``Saving Private Ryan'' in a
crowded movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the `Nervous '90s,' '' said Swarthmore College
history professor and pop culture expert Tim Burke. ``The
preoccupation is with the millennium and not with the '90s as
something in and of itself. People are looking to this decade to
summarize a lot that has come before and what will come to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As Burke's words suggest, the 1990s could turn out to be one of
those decades remembered largely for its lack of memorableness.
After all, there's not a big nostalgia market in nervousness, is
there?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the 1890s were the `Gay '90s,' then the 1990s have been the
`Gray '90s,' '' lamented Gerald Celenti, director of the Rhinebeck,
N.Y.-based Trends Research Institute. ``There was no social or
musical or entertainment glue to bind it together, no crusades,
nothing to galvanize people. It is a totally unmemorable era.''
</P>
<P>
   Others couldn't disagree more. If only we would stop going
online and checking voice mail for a while, they say, we might have
time to contemplate how much this decade has distinguished itself.
Even made a name for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be known as the information decade,'' said
Paul Levinson, a Fordham University communications professor who
points out that technology ranging from voice mail and FAX machines
to cell phones and even the Internet all were developed or
introduced into widespread use during this decade. ``It's only been
in the '90s that we've paid attention to information as a
commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one aspect of the '90s isn't up for debate, it seems: In
due time, the decade will indeed be cut open and dissected by
cultural historians bent on ``putting it into perspective''; by wry
social commentators intent on inventing some pithy shorthand name
along the lines of the ``Me Decade'' or the ``Decade of Love'';
and, of course, by collectibles connoisseurs determined to corner
the market on this era's equivalent of Beatles ticket stubs or
goldfish-populated platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the process has already begun. Maybe it's a sign of the
times (the Don't Blame Me Decade?), but it's really not our fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the 1960s reinvented the idea of the decade,''
Burke said. ``Long after we had the `Gay '90s' and the `Roaring
'20s', along came another period that seemed to tell a story. Since
then, we've become eager to identify our decades before they're
over.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. In Wilmington, Del., they've already dubbed the '90s
the ``.com Decade,'' courtesy of a contest conducted by the local
newspaper, the News Journal. Nationwide, time capsules are enjoying
a resurgence in popularity, said Oglethorpe University's Paul
Hudson, who says the approaching millennium has ``everyone trying
to write themselves into history'' by essentially predetermining
the collectibles or nostalgia of this decade. As head of the
International Time Capsule Society, Hudson hears from people who
are placing Tiger Woods memorabilia, e-mail artifacts and condoms
into their distinctively '90s containers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service is trying to figure out what
made the '90s so memorable. The ``Celebrate the Century'' program
asks the public to vote on ``cultural icons'' from each decade to
be commemorated on stamps. Previous decades' winners have included
such instantly recognizable items as the '60s peace symbol and the
'70s smiley face.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it may be a whole other story when '90s voting begins in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subjects for the '90s aren't quite as exciting as those
for the rest of the decades,'' conceded the manager of stamp and
product marketing, Valoree Vargo, who cited the Persian Gulf War,
the Internet explosion and baseball's re-emerging popularity as
possibilities for inclusion on this decade's ballot. ``I don't
know, what is the smiley face of the '90s?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on what you're looking for. It's easy to figure
out why we eventually fixate on or become nostalgic for objects or
ideas from a certain time period, said Swarthmore's Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want things that exemplify a past lost to you,'' Burke
explained. ``Sometimes it's the earliest form of something. And the
most complicated thing is that which reminds you of where you were
personally at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   What's extraordinarily difficult, everyone agrees, is figuring
all this out ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could tell that in advance, we would all be rich,'' said
Tony Kirschner, a Western Maryland University assistant professor
of communications and expert on rock and popular music. ``The
things that become collectible later, or somehow `defining,' are
always from left field.''
</P>
<P>
   And while that might seem a fitting way to end the Instant
Speculation Decade (Remember the O.J. trial? Lewinskygate?), alas,
there's just no time.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1999, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Time to start summing up the next decade.

 &HT;    Dinosaurs rage, story fades in IMAX's `T-Rex'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty minutes is a strange running time for a movie. Long enough
to sketch in characters and a story, but not to develop them. Forty
minutes is more suited to a television ``Afterschool Special.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how the new IMAX film ``T-Rex: Back to the
Cretaceous'' plays _ like an ``Afterschool Special'' with really,
really awesome special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Previous IMAX movies such as this summer's hit ``Everest'' and
other documentaries have been better suited to the shorter running
time. But ``T-Rex,'' which is fictional, takes too long revving up
its story and then isn't even sure what that story is. Then _ bang!
_ it's over.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the dinosaur lover(s) in your family will have
gotten what they came for, namely computer-generated thunder
lizards thrashing and stomping across an eight-story-tall movie
screen with a nearly 3-D intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber of ``Can't Hardly Wait'') is a budding
teenage paleontologist who wants nothing more than to go on a dig
with her dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton of Fox's
hanging-by-a-thread series ``Brimstone''). But he's too distracted,
so Ally hangs out back at the museum and mopes.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dad brings back what could be a dinosaur egg, which Ally
manages to crack accidentally the first time she's left alone with
it. Before you can reference ``Through the Looking Glass,'' she's
whirled back 65 million years and coming face to face with the big
beasts. What once were fossils are now living, breathing and
occasionally fighting dinosaurs, and pretty intense ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   Ally also time-travels back to the turn of the century for
run-ins with her real-life heroes, Barnum Brown, a famous dinosaur
digger, and Charles Knight, the scientist-artist most responsible
for our present view of how dinosaurs looked.
</P>
<P>
   And how is this multiple era-jumping accomplished? Don't ask.
``T-Rex'' is a little coy about it, but it appears to all just be
taking place in Ally's mind as a fantasy rather than really
happening.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't what kids want. We want a fantasy that purports to be
real, not a fantasy that appears to be just a hallucination. Even
an 80-foot-tall hallucination with discolored fangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Big, but it could have been better.

JUSTICE REPORT SAYS MURDER RATE LOWEST IN THREE DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For newspaper release Sunday Jan. 3 ; broadcast release, Saturday,

 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's murder rate fell in 1997 to its lowest
level in three decades, with the bulk of the decline occurring in
recent years in large cities with populations exceeding one million
people, the Justice Department announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 the national murder rate was 6.9 per 100,000 people, and
in 1997 the figure was 6.8 percent, the department said in a new
report, ``Homicide Trends in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s the murder rate dropped in big cities.
There, it fell from 35.5 homicides per 100,000 people in 1991 to
20.3 per 100,000 people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the decline was attributable to a drop in gun-related
violence among juveniles and young adults in those years, the study
said. It added that the murder rate among adults over age 25
declined from what it was three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The study followed an FBI report last month that said major
crime generally had declined for six successive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is remarkable progress, and it shows that our strategy of
more police, tougher gun laws, and better crime prevention is
making a difference,'' President Clinton said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, which did not provide data for
individual cities, showed that the murder rate in 1997 was higher
in the South and the West Coast than it was in New England, the
Rocky Mountain states and the central region of the country.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JANUARY 2
 &HT;    Growers pick top new garden plants for 1999
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when you thought you'd made your last list of the
season, it's time to go shopping again.
</P>
<P>
   But forget the toys, clothing and electronics. It's time to
redirect your energy at the garden _ yes, in January, while you can
see the barren spots and make plans for dealing with them by
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Seed and plant catalogs are arriving daily, and if you're ready
to try something new but reliable among the array of spring- and
summer-blooming annuals and perennials, the All-America Selections
_ the Academy Awards for new plants _ are a good starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a very strong reaction to this year's winners,''
said Nona Koivula, executive director of the nonprofit organization
that annually tests never-marketed plants and selects a handful it
deems superior.
</P>
<P>
   This year's 12 winners, available now as seed by mail and in
spring as bedding plants at garden centers, include two Gold
Medals, the first the AAS has awarded in 10 years. And the winners
are . . . two zinnias, `Profusion Cherry' and `Profusion Orange'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reserve the gold for what we call a breeding
breakthrough,'' Koivula said of the entries, grown in trial gardens
around the country and evaluated by a panel of unpaid judges.
``This is very unusual to have two.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners include five annuals, three perennials and four
fruits and vegetables _ a round zucchini squash called 'Eight
Ball'; an 8-ounce pumpkin, 'Wee-B-Little'; an elongated cherry
tomato that grows like grapes, 'Juliet'; and a bright orange
gourmet watermelon, 'New Queen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the public is oblivious to these winners every year,
but they are unsurpassed for blooms, and disease and drought
resistance,'' said Becki Bowermeister of Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden
Center, who has worked at an AAS trial garden at the University of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Another resource for new plants is the National Garden Bureau, a
nonprofit organization that provides information on seeds and
bedding plants. (For information, call 630-963-0770.)
</P>
<P>
   But maybe ``new'' doesn't matter to you as much as reliability.
If so, the Perennial Plant Association, an international
professional organization of growers, retailers, landscapers,
educators and writers, has selected as its 1999 Plant of the Year
rudbeckia 'Goldsturm,' commonly known as black-eyed Susan. One of
the most popular perennials for the past 50 years, the
black-centered, golden-yellow flowers have become a staple in
commercial landscaping because of the plant's tolerance for drought
and clay soils, and resistance to insects and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The award can be presented to an old plant as well as a new one,
said the association's Steven Still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say why not pick something new,'' he said, ``while others
tell us to go for the tried-and-true.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts' advice? Shop for both. Go for what works _ but
experiment a little.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Read up for fundamentals of fitness
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Day Two of the Big Resolution, and you're determined to
keep it this time. So throw out the rest of the holiday sweets, put
on your sneakers and sweats, and . . . sit down and read a book.
</P>
<P>
   In all seriousness, you should educate yourself before you start
a diet and/or exercise program (preferably both, since they're more
effective in tandem). Reading books on the subject isn't an equal
substitute for consulting a nutritionist or a personal trainer, but
it's cheaper and will give you a head start on the fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips on what to look for when you're at the
bookstore:
</P>
<P>
   Fitness books
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the covers; they're almost all cheesy. Many also have
self-indulgent
</P>
<P>
   photos of the author/celebrity working out at various ages, as a
sort of pictorial exercise autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all forgivable if the author has included large, clear
photos of basic strength and flexibility exercises, plus a
realistic week-by-week plan for gradually building up a workout
program that includes cardiovascular exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Some good books are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fitness for Dummies'' by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent
(IDG Books Worldwide, $19.99). This member of the ``Dummies''
family provides a comprehensive overview of different fitness
programs and types of equipment, without the jargon many
workoutaholics throw around. It includes diagrams and explanations
of the major muscles of the body.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Let's Get Real!'' by Donna Richardson with Lauren David
Peden (Pocket Books, $16). Richardson, who stars in several fitness
videos, demonstrates plenty of exercises in her friendly, realistic
approach to getting physical. Like many fitness experts, she
presents a handful of her favorite recipes. Recognizing that most
of her readers aren't going to give up dining out, however, she
also includes a list of unhealthy and relatively healthy restaurant
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Firm for Life'' by Anna and Cynthia Benson (Broadway Books,
$23). The founders of the Firm, a hit video series that integrates
weight training and aerobics, include ``dos'' and ``don'ts'' for
proper form alongside each illustrated exercise.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Ultimate Workout Log'' by Suzanne Schlosberg (Houghton
Mifflin, $12). This 24-week exercise journal inspires and reminds.
Under each day heading there are spaces for noting cardiovascular
exercise, stretching and strength training. There's a chart showing
how many calories are burned per hour by various activities, and a
page for listing your personal exercise records.
</P>
<P>
   Diet books
</P>
<P>
   Finding a good diet or nutrition book can require a fair amount
of browsing, since diet philosophies vary widely. But a basic
reference is a calorie counter that breaks down foods by
nutritional content.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One of the best is ``The Complete Book of Food Counts'' by
Corinne T. Netzer (Dell, $7.50). This book is alphabetically
arranged and includes brand-name foods. In addition to calories,
the guide lists protein, carbohydrates, fat, cholesterol, sodium
and fiber.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Ultimate Consumer's Guide to Diets and Nutrition'' by
James E. Marti with Dr. George L. Blackburn (Mariner Books, $16) is
a good introduction to dieting.
</P>
<P>
   The authors analyze more than 200 commercial weight-loss
programs, books and diet supplements, from Optifast to Weight
Watchers. The diets are categorized by their target audience, i.e.
women, children, diabetics, people with food allergies, people with
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As with exercise, recording your daily eating habits is an
excellent weight-control tool. Research has shown that people who
monitor their eating or exercise tend to be better at maintaining
their weight loss than people who don't record their habits.
Several fitness and diet books contain sample food diary pages, or
you can make up your own in a regular notebook or blank journal.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Helmold of Sandy Springs says her journal helped her lose
25 pounds last year. In addition to tracking her eating and
exercise habits, she records other issues in her life, such as
work-related stress, that might affect her motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's a good analytical tool,'' said Helmold, who
started keeping a journal as part of Weight Watchers. ``Did I
exercise each day as I intended? If not, what got me off track?''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much time, Helmold assures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you might have a sentence or two, sometimes half a
page,'' she said. ``Try it. You'll like it.''

 &HT;    A project in a peaceful valley of Habersham County is restoring
part of the Soque River
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HABERSHAM COUNTY, Ga. _ For years, Justin Savage watched as the
tiny Soque River was literally gobbling up his farm in Habersham
County in northeast Georgia's mountains. ``I figured I was losing
60-100 tons of soil a year from erosion,'' says Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, free-ranging cattle, poor plowing methods and
other harmful practices had stripped away trees and other
vegetation along the river's banks, making them highly vulnerable
to erosion. Channelization and dredging also had straightened out
curves in the river through his farm, causing water to rush at
greater force down the stream and scour away Savage's pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Savage in 1997 went to his regional Natural
Resources Conservation Service office for help. His timing was
fortunate, because the conservation service had just been contacted
by workers with the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency and others looking for a landowner
with an impaired stream on his property who would be willing to
participate in an ambitious project to restore the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite willing to participate; it was more than I hoped
for,'' says Savage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than a year after the restoration project began in the
peaceful Soque Valley of Habersham County, 1,500 feet of the
25-foot-wide Soque once again is a meandering waterway that runs
through _ instead of over _ Savage's farmland. Boulders and rocks
and tree stumps have been placed in and along the stream at
strategic spots to reduce the energy of the flowing water. The
stream banks have been stabilized by grass and thick mats made of a
biodegradable material. Native trees and other plants common to
stream banks in North Georgia are being planted to restore a
vegetative buffer.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion has been reduced. The stream is running clearer, and
trout, which require exceptionally clean water, are returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to bring this stream back to its natural condition
as much as possible,'' says Katherine Baer, who is helping conduct
the project for the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper. The Soque
(pronounced So-KEE) is a tributary of the Chattahoochee(GA.).
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reduce erosion by reconfiguring the channel to a
natural shape and pattern, revegetating the banks and fencing
cattle away from the river,'' says Baer, noting the project is
being viewed as a model for easing erosion and preserving water
quality in headwater streams of North Georgia's mountains. ``In so
doing, we want to show people that severely degraded streams can be
restored and the water quality can be greatly improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer was hired by the Riverkeeper to help protect the many
headwater tributaries to the Chattahoochee in White, Habersham,
Lumpkin, Dawson, Forsyth and Hall counties. The work has direct
impact on metro Atlanta residents, whose drinking water originates
mostly in those counties.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does stream protection preserve a waterway's scenic
beauty and keep the water clean for fish and other aquatic life, it
can reduce metro Atlanta's costs of purifying the water for
drinking and industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
   The Soque project is one of about 90 EPA-sponsored river and
wetland restoration projects around the nation. So far, the Soque
restoration has cost about $80,000, most of which came from the
EPA. Those funds do not include free labor from community
volunteers and other support.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the restoration projects is different, because each
stream or wetland (including swamps and marshes) is not the same.
However, the aim of all the projects is to emulate a natural,
self-regulating river or wetland.
</P>
<P>
   The Soque winds and tumbles for more than 30 miles in Habersham
County before it joins the Chattahoochee. For most of its length,
the river is a scenic, fast-flowing mountain stream parallel to
Ga.197. Many Georgians and tourists have seen the Soque's beauty
from a balcony at the Mark of the Potter, a popular craft shop that
was once an old grist mill along Ga. 197. The Brigadoon lodge along
the river also is one of the most popular destinations in the South
for trout fly fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Savage's farm is upstream, just below the Soque's headwaters.
The eroded soil that washes off his farm is transported downstream
along with other agricultural runoff. Restoring the 1,500-foot
corridor that runs through his property would also protect the
river downstream.
</P>
<P>
   But before the restoration could begin, the workers had to have
a concept of how the stretch of river should look and function
after the work was completed _ like a plastic surgeon who must have
a good idea of how his patient's nose will look and function after
a ``nose job.''

</P>
<P>
   HABERSHAM COUNTY, Ga.: ``nose job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous amount of background work was required,'' says
Jennifer Derby, a scientist in the Wetlands and Restoration
Planning Division of EPA's regional office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She and Baer studied several relatively undisturbed streams to
conceive an idea of what they should aim for on the Soque. In
particular, they scrutinized the crystal clear Duke's Creek as it
rushes and cascades through the state's Smithgall Woods preserve in
White County. Over the decades, Duke's Creek itself was the
beneficiary of a private, $20 million restoration effort by media
magnate Charles Smithgall, who later donated the property to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Baer and Derby examined the widths and depths of Duke's Creek,
its meandering curves, and the sloping of its stream banks and
flood plains to determine how a stream establishes a natural
course. They examined what native vegetation grows along the stream
banks, and they scrutinized rocks and pebbles to see the natural
makeup of the stream bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rivers, like energy, will follow the path of least resistance,
and thus a river is greatly influenced by the shape and texture
(width, depth, substrate) of its path,'' says Baer. She and Derby
took the knowledge gleaned from the other streams back to the
degraded stretch of the Soque on Savage's farm. With the help of
other stream experts and community volunteers, Baer and Derby
adjusted the width of the Soque from about 40 feet to 25 feet by
installing logs and rocks at key points in the river's path to help
dissipate its energy. They stabilized the stream banks with grass
and mats of a biodegradable material. Rocks and pebbles that would
be part of a natural stream were put on the bottom of the river
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most ambitious effort was to change the course
of the river as it ran through Savage's farm: Earth-moving
equipment was brought in to establish curves in the river and
eliminate its unnatural straight path. In so doing, the river's
energy was further dissipated, thereby lessening its capacity to
erode the stream banks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are trout once again inhabiting the stretch of river,
but it is regaining its natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is the planting of several native species of trees
and plants to establish vegetative buffers on either side of the
river. Such buffers help control storm runoff, help prevent erosion
and filter out pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the restoration is not complete, important lessons
have been learned, says Derby. ``One lesson is that stream bank
restoration is costly,'' she says. Another lesson is that it takes
very little disturbance to upset a river system.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important lesson of all, say the project's
leaders, is that prevention is the best medicine: Prevention of
pollution and degradation of rivers and streams in the first place
is far superior and cheaper than having to restore them.

 &HT;    Yes, Jesus was Jewish
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Over 2,000 years of spread and change, Christianity has
lost many of its ties to the Judaism of Jesus, says John D. Garr of
Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   Garr is founder and executive director of the Atlanta-based
Restoration Foundation, an organization founded to bring the church
back to its Jewish roots. It is one of several small pro-Israel
groups founded over the past 20 years that function on a
grass-roots level while big name religious leaders such as
broadcaster Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell make
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is simply to bring back to Christian consciousness
the fact that Jesus was a Jew,'' said Garr, 54. He laughed. ``A lot
of people seem to think he was a Baptist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he born Jewish, but Jesus practiced Judaism
throughout his life, Garr maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jesus' heritage, Christians have an obligation to
support Israel and the Jewish people, he said. Garr says he
recognizes that land in Israel is specified in God's covenant with
Abraham and plays a role in prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely real estate involved in God's promises,''
he said, ``but how and when that works out is best left in God's
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While Christians are obligated by their beliefs to witness their
faith to the Jews, Garr said, ``I find some people who love the
Jews but have a trophy mentality. It's like the moose head on the
wall if they convert one Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focus on conversion, Garr said, he emphasizes
dialogue and interaction between Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than support the Israeli government at all costs, he
says American Christians have an obligation to support both Jews
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our position should be one of tolerance and support
for various people involved in the ongoing conflict,'' Garr said.
``When the Bible tells us to pray for peace in Jerusalem, that
means for everyone who's there.''

IN QUIET CORNERS, A RHAPSODY FOR EYES AND SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In terms of material things, there's no place like
New York and no time like the Christmas holidays. The rituals of
buying, giving and getting are pronounced here, and phase two _
returning, exchanging and sale-hopping _ can be even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the ground movement of people heading for the city's
major blockbuster art exhibitions in their final days, and you've
got object-oriented human gridlock of unparalleled proportions.
Right now it feels as if the whole world is here on a class trip.
</P>
<P>
   If your eyes need respite from looking at things with price tags
or you simply want an aesthetic experience that doesn't threaten
life and limb, there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this time of year, the city is rife with relatively
quiet, empty places to contemplate outstanding works of art and
related visual phenomena, places slightly or way off the beaten
path _ be they the less popular galleries of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art or the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the city's only indoor
Earthwork (Walter De Maria's ``New York Earth Room'' in SoHo) or
the great scale model of New York City at the Queens Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a series of mini-pilgrimages to overlooked or
out-of-the-way places or objects, a kind of spa tour for the eyes
and soul.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sights are worlds unto themselves, little universes
that the viewer can inhabit physically or mentally. Several are
small enclosed spaces dense with some form of artistry that envelop
the visitor like a mud bath or a sauna. Others are single objects,
usually exquisite and small, that encourage fantasy and projection
and whose benefits resemble those of a skilled scalp massage.
</P>
<P>
   The tour moves through space and time, and so through quite a
bit of New York history. Not every stop offers a pedigreed
masterpiece or even an artwork, although many do. Others contain
glimpses of material culture, anonymously made functional objects
with fascinating histories of their own. And this is merely a
sampling; there are hundreds of candidates for this tour. When it
comes to viewing opportunities that cost next to nothing, New York
truly is the city that never stops giving.
</P>
<P>
   The Cloisters
</P>
<P>
   Start with a topographical and cultural high point: the
Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan dedicated to the art and
architecture of Europe of the Middle Ages that is in Fort Tryon
Park, near Manhattan's northern tip.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to get to than anyone remembers. Take the A subway
to 190th Street and go upstairs to Fort Washington Avenue, on an
elevator that is something of an environmental artwork itself
because the man who operates it regularly has lined it with images
of kittens. From there either take the M-4 bus to its last stop,
the Cloisters' front door, or enjoy the 10- to 15-minute walk
through the park.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbled together from the ruins of several French Romanesque and
Gothic churches, the Cloisters may be New York City's premier world
removed. Its very structure is an architectural history lesson. Its
contents survey medieval art forms from stone-carving all the way
up the chart of refinement. (Note the columns in the 11th-century
Cloister of St.-Guilhem-le-Desert, carved to resemble flowing
water.)
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit off the chart is the Reliquary Gallery on the
building's lower level: a glowing treasure box of illuminated
manuscripts, silver and gold liturgical vessels and, perhaps best
of all, a rotating selection of nearly two dozen ivories dating
from the 9th to the 14th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny carvings bristle with religious fervor, elaborate
narratives and formal inventiveness. Several of the earliest and
most striking small Carolingian plaques that were the chief form of
sculptural expression during the time of Charlemagne reflect the
classical revival that he initiated after 800.
</P>
<P>
   The classical concerns for creating a strong spatial reality and
using flowing drapery to achieve a naturalistic sense of the body
are especially evident in the figures and castle in ``Plaque With
Emmaus Scenes.'' The plaque's outer border of flattened flower and
bird forms reflects the persistence of barbaric anti-classical
tendencies that Charlemagne sought to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and most famous of the ivories is, of course, the
12th-century altar cross that may have come from the Abbey of Bury
St. Edmunds in eastern England.
</P>
<P>
   Its medallions and terminals represent scenes from the sacrifice
of Christ with breathtaking delicacy, but the most memorable form
to contemporary eyes may be the cross itself. Marked with the nail
holes of Jesus' missing body, it doubles as a tree of life. Its
rounded trunk is regularly punctuated with bilateral buds ready to
send branches (and Christianity) out in every direction. The back
of the cross portrays one means of dissemination: carvings of 18
prophets holding texts form a sinuous spiral, suggestive of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy among the other wonders here is the ``Monkey Cup,''
an enamel vessel from 15th-century Burgundy. Its lush blue exterior
is an orderly riot of mischievous monkeys, their sleeping human
prey and curling vines; its interior, a surrealistic hunting scene
dominated by clumps of golden trees on mesalike hills. The label
spells out an illustrious provenance: Piero de Medici, the Earls of
Arundel and J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Museum of the City of New York
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate to follow the sweeping, historically rich
other-worldliness of the Cloisters with the diminutive, personal
escapism of Carrie Stettheimer's doll house in the Toys Gallery of
the Museum of the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1920s to the early 1940s, the three Stettheimer
sisters presided over one of New York's most sparkling cultural
salons, playing hostess to everyone who was anyone, especially
where art was concerned. While Florine made fanciful group
portraits of their circle and Ettie sometimes wrote about them,
Carrie worked most of her life creating a doll-house homage to the
Stettheimer residence, which overlooked Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   The result, a lavish little mansion shown on the verge of a
Christmas soiree, is an early example of assemblage art rich with
wry commentary. It employs such modern art techniques as photo
collage (the foyer) and cut-paper collage (the child's bedroom).
</P>
<P>
   It contrasts decorating and artistic styles: the formal Louis
XIV salon against the red-trimmed, proto-Vreeland sitting room; the
traditional chintz guest bedroom (inhabited in this instance by
dolls of Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein) against the
high-ceilinged central gallery with miniature modern artworks by
such Stettheimer regulars as Marcel Duchamp and Gaston Lachaise.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Edward Steichen, Pavel Tchelitchew, Baroness de
Meyer, Virgil Thomson and Henry McBride, these artists are
represented by dolls made in the 1970s by a curator at the museum
who was completely in sync with the Stettheimers' sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Museum may be breaking attendance records at
the moment, but it's still the league leader when it comes to
reasonably deserted corners. Outstanding among these in terms of
aesthetic intimacy and visual-pounds-per-inch may be the tiny,
piercingly exquisite ``Gubbio Studiolo,'' the 12-by-17-foot
15th-century Italian wood intarsia room that was originally
commissioned by Duke Federico de Montefeltro.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired by the Met in 1939 and displayed until 1967, it
underwent a meticulous 10-year restoration and was finally
reinstalled in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A fusion of the arts of painting and cabinet-making executed in
a palette of contrasting woods, this extraordinary chamber is in
many ways a portrait of the duke. Here he could contemplate
pictorial symbols of his military prowess (armor, helmet and
dagger), his intellectual interests (musical instruments, books by
Euclid, drafting tools) and his responsibilities (writing box and
quill).
</P>
<P>
   These objects sometimes overflow their niches, spilling onto the
benches lining the paneled and coffered room. As interesting as
their elaborate iconography is the sheer bravura. Every form in
sight is a triumph of trompe l'oeil illusion that is continually
contradicted by the declarative artifice and flatness of the means
of illusion, which is wood and only wood.
</P>
<P>
   For aesthetic intimacy on a grand scale at the Met, there's the
17,000-square-foot Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American
Art, which celebrated it 10th anniversary last month.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with row upon row of tall glass vitrines, the center is a
library of Americana from Colonial times to the present. Its
shelves are dense with displays of silver, glass, pewter, china,
Redware pottery, stoneware, second-tier paintings in the museum's
collection and, most of all, furniture.
</P>
<P>
   These objects speak volumes. If you doubt that each era has a
period look that reflects something of its soul, browse here. The
course of American history, power and taste will not just flash
before your eyes; it will be reiterated again and again, in medium
after medium.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Museum of American Art
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney might seem too small to have much that is untraveled
or overlooked. Still, one can usually snatch a few moments of peace
communing with Charles Simonds' 1981 ``Dwelling'' in the museum's
stairwell. This unobtrusive permanent installation is a tiny adobe
ruin nestled in swelling hills of red clay not unlike those that
Georgia O'Keeffe liked to paint in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who know this sweet little sculpture, which evokes
the American continent's first settlers, may not realize that it
has two other parts. From the window on the landing just below
``Dwelling,'' a similar ruin can be seen, nestled on the window
ledge of a building across the street. Above, on the corner of the
roof, a terra cotta bird keeps watch over the two tiny sites.
</P>
<P>
   A second hideaway here is the small gallery devoted to the art
of Alexander Calder, tucked beneath the museum's new fifth-floor
permanent collection galleries.
</P>
<P>
   This room surveys the several sides of brilliant, playful
genius. His early wire masterpieces are here, ``The Brass Family''
of seven balancing acrobats and the ``Circus'' with its assembled
acts. Sounds of the artist animating the ``Circus'' (on film)
regularly fill the space. And there are several examples of the
stabiles, mobiles and constellations of his maturity, their
loyalties strictly divided between the forms of the real world and
the pure abstractions of art and engineering.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Catherine Campbell Hearst, a longtime member of
the University of California Board of Regents and mother of
celebrated kidnap victim Patricia Hearst, died late Wednesday at
the UCLA Medical Center following a stroke. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst made her mark as a regent, standing firmly with
former Gov. Ronald Reagan at a time when the free-speech and
anti-war movements rocked the foundations of the university system
and the nation as well.
</P>
<P>
   But her day-to-day life was shattered Feb. 4, 1974, when her
daughter Patricia was kidnapped by an obscure revolutionary group
called the Symbionese Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hearst was later tried for joining her captors in a bank
robbery. She received a seven-year sentence, which was commuted by
President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst and her former husband, Randolph Apperson Hearst,
had four other daughters _ Catherine, Virginia, Anne and Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``She remained very involved with her daughters; she was a very
concerned mother,'' said Bernard Shaw, Mrs. Hearst's son-in-law and
Patricia Hearst's husband. ``I spoke to her once a week on the
phone. She was always interested in who was doing what. Even though
her girls had grown up, she was still a great parent. We will miss
her deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mehawk, who worked as secretary to Randolph Hearst for 25
years, said she always considered Mrs. Hearst ``a great and lovely
lady who had a marvelous sense of humor.'' Mehawk praised Mrs.
Hearst as ``a real Southern lady, very gracious, very kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Born July 5, 1917, Catherine Wood Campbell left her native

from the Washington Seminary, in the 1930s.

</P>
<P>
   Born July 5, 1917, Catherine Wood Campbell left her native
Atlanta, where she had attended Sacred Heart School and graduated
from the Washington Seminary, in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to San Francisco and, in 1938, married Randolph
Hearst, a son of William Randolph Hearst who later became president
of The San Francisco Examiner and chairman of the Hearst Corp.
Randolph Hearst is now a trustee of the Hearst Corporation and the
Hearst Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was a philanthropist and socialite, modeling in
benefit fashion shows and organizing events on behalf of several
charities.
</P>
<P>
   She drew praise as an amateur artist. One painting _ ``Venice in
the Rain'' _ won top prize in a private exhibition. In her later
years, she continued painting, often taking her paints and brushes
on trips.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst _ who lived in Hillsborough, a San Francisco suburb,
throughout her marriage _ was a member of the Junior League, a
director of the San Mateo Society for Crippled Children and Adults
and a trustee for Crystal Springs School for Girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, then-Gov. Goodwin J. Knight appointed Mrs. Hearst to a
two-year replacement term on the UC Regents' board. She remained a
regent for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1960s, Mrs. Hearst and the other regents were
thrust onto the front lines of an emerging battle over the limits
of free speech and the role of universities in military research.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst, a Republican, generally took a conservative
approach, and between 1963 and 1972, she supported restrictions on
allowing communists to speak on campus.
</P>
<P>
   She also supported the removal of radical activist Angela Davis
from a teaching position at UC-Berkeley. She opposed the use of
campus facilities for antiwar teach-ins and other protests.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Mrs. Hearst was proud of her involvement in
education and was an admirer of Phoebe Hearst, mother of William
Randolph Hearst, whose pioneering work in higher education is
reflected by the streets and buildings named for her at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hearst was a lifelong exponent of continuing education
for women in particular, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst was the target of a possible assassination attempt
in June 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet was fired into a car in which she was a passenger, en
route to a regents' meeting in Los Angeles. The slug missed Mrs.
Hearst and the driver, lodging behind the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   During the incarceration and trial of her daughter in 1975 and
1976, Mrs. Hearst was a vocal advocate for Patricia, whom she
perceived as a victim of her kidnappers and of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph and Mrs. Hearst separated in December 1978, and were
later divorced. She moved to Beverly Hills and she became even more
involved in support of the Catholic Church. She was also a member
of the Beverly Hills Garden Club.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hearst is survived by two brothers, Steven and Jack
Campbell of Los Angeles; the five daughters, Catherine M. Hill of
California, Patricia Hearst Shaw of Connecticut, Virginia Randt of
Idaho, Anne Randolph Hearst of New York, and Victoria Hearst of
Colorado; and four grandchildren, Amanda Hearst, King Randolph
Harris and Gillian and Lydia Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral service will be held Saturday at 10 a.m. PST at the
Good Shepherd Church in Beverly Hills.

 NEW YORK: and engineering.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New-York Historical Society
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get into the Museum of Natural History, which can
be like bedlam at this time of year, try the New-York Historical
Society just across the street. It has a wonderful hands-on
children's gallery that takes New York City's history and
architecture as its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Until Jan. 10, a corridor gallery on the ground floor is devoted
to the work _ primarily the large, ethereal, exquisitely detailed
drawings _ of George B. Post, a prominent 19th-century architect
whose existing designs include the New York Stock Exchange, City
College, the Williamsburg Savings Bank and the Brooklyn Historical
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But the permanent attractions here are two small galleries on
the society's second floor outfitted with molding, a fireplace and
a robustly Victorian carpet to approximate the painting gallery of
Luman Reed.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1830s, this New York businessman and picture lover
opened his collection, installed on the third floor of his house at
13 Greenwich St., to the public. Reed collected European paintings,
but his historical significance lies in his support of living
American painters, notably Thomas Cole, founder of the Hudson River
School.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Reed's holdings, a large chunk of which his
heirs gave to the society in the 1850s, is Cole's ``Course of
Empire,'' a five-painting allegory that the collector commissioned
in 1835. Here the panoramic images are grouped around the
fireplace, covering most of one wall.
</P>
<P>
   At once campy and impassioned, these paintings trace the rise
and fall of an eclectic ancient civilization (Rome, Athens,
Pergamum). It seems loosely based on Poussin and Claude with
turbulent weather reminiscent of Turner stirred in at the climax _
an invasion of bloodthirsty Viking-like barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pictorial fireworks and straining for universal
truths, Cole's passage from pastoral paradise to pastoral ruin may
tell a simpler, more personal tale: that his own art returned
inevitably to the natural landscape for its strength and
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of American Folk Art
</P>
<P>
   Even the tiny Museum of American Folk Art, whose temporary home
is little more than a glorified lobby, has a wonderful work of art
that is easily overlooked: a radiant mural tenderly extracted from
a New Hampshire house that is the backdrop in a vitrine for other
objects.
</P>
<P>
   Painted in the first quarter of the 19th century and attributed
to someone known only as the ``Bear and Pears artist,'' it deserves
a wall of its own. It depicts a tropical fantasy of coconut trees
and undulating hills against a yellow sky, detailed with elephants
and a row of red inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Modern Art
</P>
<P>
   The modern is not the quietest place at this time of year, but
grading on a curve, its design galleries qualify as relatively
underpopulated. One of the most absorbing works here is the scale
model of Frank Lloyd Wright's house ``Fallingwater,'' cantilevered
daringly over a burbling stream of textured plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you're grown up, there's an inexplicable thrill in
being larger than buildings. Models grant a degree of visual
possession that real buildings rarely permit, enabling us to see
their artistry in sharper outline.
</P>
<P>
   We appreciate instantly the dovetailing of ``Fallingwater'' with
its rocky site, the economy of its materials (concrete, stone,
metal, glass) and the sculptural brilliance of its structure. It
simply projects from the rocks like a series of attenuated bureau
drawers opening at right angles.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Library
</P>
<P>
   If the handsome exhibition of master drawings from the Pushkin
and Hermitage Museums, which closes on Sunday, is overcrowded, you
might head for J.P. Morgan's brocade-lined study, left pretty much
as it was in the days when the financier kept the global economy in
balance. The West Room, as it is called, is definitely another
world, a period room of the first order and as much a self-portrait
as Montefeltro's ``Studiolo.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are things to be seen here, the most interesting
works _ a scattering of medieval objects _ are hard to see. There's
also a lovely Perugino in one corner, and stern cameo portraits of
Martin Luther and his wife by Lucas Cranach on a table. But it is
the overall effect that remains most powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The need for focused, drop-dead beauty can be satisfied by
returning to the landing just outside the study's door to study the
imposing ``Stavelot Triptych'' from 12th-century Byzantium, glowing
with images in enamel on gold and encrusted jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Dia Center for the Arts
</P>
<P>
   Walter De Maria's ``New York Earth Room'' is also an enclosed
world, as muffled and insulated as Morgan's study, but by entirely
different means. De Maria's domesticated earthwork, made in 1977
and opened to the public in 1980, is simply this: a large SoHo loft
filled to the window sills with black earth, 140 tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   It is an outstanding example of the dematerialization of the art
object and the rise of installation or environmental works that
dominated the art of the late 1960s and early '70s. But its has
roots deeper in the past; its power lies in both its absurdity and
its familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   It is an instance of surrealist contrast and displacement taken
to extremes, Meret Oppenheim's fur-lined teacup multiplied to the
nth power: The shock of the dark rough soil surrounded by smooth
white walls in the middle of Manhattan is still delicious, after
all these years. Yet it is also a piece of land, silent, solid,
indifferent to the human presence, even if man-made, and profoundly
comforting.

 NEW YORK: profoundly comforting.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooklyn Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   One of the quietest galleries in the Brooklyn Museum of Art is
hiding in plain sight: It's the Great Hall devoted to American
Indian and pre-Columbian art and art of the Pacific islands, which
nearly every visitor to the museum passes through on the way to the
back elevators, the cafe, the cafeteria or the spiffy new galleries
of African art.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery, refurbished in 1965, is dim and dusty in spots, but
it contains some of the museum's greatest works, including a
powerful little Olmec figure in deep green jade who holds a small
scowling version of himself in his stiffly outstretched hands, and
the cotton and wool mantle known as the ``Paracas Textile,'' a
masterpiece of the Paracas/Nasca civilization of southern Peru (300
B.C.-A.D. 200), whose needle-knit borders are populated by a
pantheon of extravagantly costumed and masked figures.
</P>
<P>
   The displays contain clusters of wonderful things: Pomo baskets,
fierce New Ireland masks, feathered headdresses from the Amazon and
Ecuador. And there are isolated objects of supreme beauty: a white
and black Zuni ceremonial bowl with a pair of kissing serpents
circling its belly and a stepped lip that echoes the profile; and a
Northwest Indian clapper shaped like a halibut but animated by a
haunting human face.
</P>
<P>
   Queens Museum of Art
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to end a condensed tour of some of New York's
less obvious treasures with a compressed vision of the city itself.
The only place for this is the ``New York City Panorama,'' a scale
model in an enormous gallery at the Queens Museum of Art in
Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Refurbished and updated four years
ago, it accounts for every structure in New York City as of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This Lilliputian metropolis can be circumnavigated on a sleek
unobtrusive balcony that is floored in glass when necessary, over
the outer reaches of the outer boroughs. Every few minutes the
overhead lights go down and day changes to night.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the model pales next to the real thing. Its night view
is particularly dim compared with the blazing holiday radiance that
stretches before the eye during a night landing at La Guardia
Airport. But one of the great privileges of living in New York City
is the exhilaration of flying over it to come home. The panorama
allows you to relive that experience at your own pace, with all
kinds of unscheduled stops and pauses.
</P>
<P>
   You can even retrace the points on this tour, starting with the
Cloisters, a small, cruciform structure surrounded by green perched
over Manhattan's northern gate.

EUROPEAN UNION INTRODUCES SINGLE CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The most ambitious effort yet to create a united states
of Europe began at midnight Thursday when the euro, the continent's
new single currency, was born in 11 of the European Union's 15
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially launched Friday, the euro will begin its
maiden voyage through the computers of European banks and
corporations on Monday, when all businesses start trading in it and
bank and credit card transactions can be recorded in it.
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and bills will not begin to circulate until Jan. 1,
2002. Six months later, national currencies become void.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the euro was celebrated Thursday at the European
Union's headquarters in Brussels in a display that mixed the
solemnity of a corporate board meeting with the festiveness of a
Super Bowl halftime show. After the finance ministers from the 11
countries formally locked their currencies together and made
speeches about the historic nature of the day, schoolchildren
released thousands of blue balloons with the ``e'' symbol that will
represent the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, some 50,000 financial service specialists
across Europe will work around the clock to ready computer systems
for the changeover before the markets open Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The raison d'etre for monetary union is strength in numbers by
consolidating separate economies into a huge, competitive market.
Exchange rate fluctuations disappear. Manufacturers and retailers
are forced to simplify byzantine pricing, where the amount paid for
the same product can vary wildly from country to country. Trading
across national borders becomes easier. Mergers, once uncommon in
Europe, increase as former rivals seek to cut overhead and
capitalize on the new market.
</P>
<P>
   From Ireland to Italy, the euro has suddenly become a reality.
Monetary union is now the ultimate challenge for some 290 million
Europeans who must put aside language and cultural differences to
form one cohesive economic and political bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ireland and Italy, the euro became the official currency
today in Austria, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Finland,
Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Greece wanted to be among
those launching the euro but was unable to reduce its debt and
interest rates enough to qualify for membership. Three other
countries _ Britain, Sweden, and Denmark _ chose not to participate
largely because of concerns about loss of monetary control.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of Europe, the euro is already part of the
landscape. In Paris, open-air markets post prices of produce in
euros and francs. Fashionable restaurants from Barcelona to Vienna
have included euro prices on their menu for months.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyons is one of those whose life changed irrevocably at
midnight. On Monday, when he arrives at his Allied Irish Bank
office in Dublin, he will turn on his computer terminal and begin a
new career as a euro banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world,'' said Lyons, who seems more excited
than intimidated by the most sweeping change in European daily life
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else who works in the financial services industry
in Europe, Lyons has trained to handle the new currency. But he
believes that the change is more historic than commercial. ``We're
all champing at the bit to get going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro will consume Lyons's professional life, his wife,
Denise, will barely notice its integration into daily life over the
next three years, except when she is handed a receipt at their
local supermarket listing what she spends in both Irish punts and
euros.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the euro is meant to cement European
integration, which has solidified incrementally over the last 40
years. But it also has unwittingly illustrated national differences
that cannot simply be wished away.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese, for example, complained bitterly when the
initial image of the continent minted on the euro coin didn't show
their border with Spain. While the European Central Bank relented
and minted a new coin, the euro is meant nonetheless to blur
economic, political, and, perhaps most importantly, psychological
borders within Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The integration process began in 1958, when the visionary French
diplomat Jean Monnet dreamed up the European Economic Community,
later to become the European Union, to create a single economic
bloc to rival the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But Monnet's plan was not just about money. It was also about
ending war among Europeans. Monnet's plan was to replace the narrow
and often belligerent nationalism that had pervaded the continent
with a more enlightened form of regionalism based on mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatism of Monnet and the other founders of a united
Europe was born in part from the suffering endured on a continent
that has crumbled twice this century from world wars. ``You can't
eat a flag,'' said John Hume, the Nobel Peace laureate from
Northern Ireland who is among the most enthusiastic of Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for membership in this new economic bloc, the 11
countries have ceded one of the core powers of the modern nation:
the ability to set interest rates and monetary policy. Those
decisions are now the domain of the European Central Bank based in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that the single currency will further balkanize rich
and poor parts of Europe rather than spread the wealth around. As
in the United States, recession here is regional. Northern Europe
is faring better than the south.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries on the peripheries of Euroland, Ireland and
Italy, offer an illustration. Despite having just 3.5 million
people, the Republic of Ireland is second only to the United States
in its exports of software, and it has been Europe's most vibrant
economy for several years. Italy barely qualified for monetary
union because of a lagging economy that suffers from 12 percent
unemployment and an undereducated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts also worry about Italy's ability to maintain
the discipline necessary to survive in the new euro club. Budget
deficits, for example, are to run no higher than 3 percent of a
country's gross domestic product. Less than three months before the
single currency was launched, Massimo D'Alema became Italy's prime
minister _ the first former communist to lead a Western European
government. At issue is whether he has the political will to keep
public spending such as social welfare programs in line with the
strictures of monetary union.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also surround the two engines that have traditionally
driven European integration: Germany and France. Both countries are
now led by leftist governments that have not moved to slash the
generous benefits from their workers. In Germany, for example, many
workers receive six weeks of vacation each year. And their French
counterparts are notorious for striking at the slightest
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts within both countries and elsewhere emphasize that
Germany and France, like Italy, must wring concessions from the
public sector to foster the necessary austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers warn that Germany's record 11 percent unemployment
rate could get worse if the new government doesn't win concessions
from workers. They fear a strike to end all strikes if France is
forced to tighten its belt to conform with the requirements of
monetary union. Such concerns explain, in part, the wariness of
Britain about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the future path of Britain, Europe's second most
populous country after Germany, is only beginning. The incipient
public relations battle between those who want to join, such as
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and those who don't, like former prime
minister Margaret Thatcher, is expected to cost more than any
political campaign in British history. Thatcher, a ``Euroskeptic,''
speaks for many when she equates integration with surrender of
British sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The ceding of their national currencies is indeed the most
visceral gesture to date that Europeans have made toward closer
integration. Like the language one speaks, the money one carries
has always separated one European from another. Germans, for
example, feel nostalgic about the deutschemark, which has long been
the strongest currency in Europe. It remains the currency of choice
in areas such as the former Yugoslavia where local currencies are
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a silver mark aloft and admiring it like a glass of
wine, Franz Brandt, a waiter in a restaurant in Berlin's Europa
Center, said wistfully, ``I will miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure of the single currency would be disastrous. There are no
escape mechanisms should a country decide to bolt. Any failure
would probably turn Europeans against one another and destroy
monetary union as well as threaten the existing political comity.
But few business people expect such an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,700 years ago, the Roman emperor Diocletian established a
single currency in an attempt to unite his disparate subjects, only
to see it fall in one of Europe's many bouts of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans are cautiously optimistic that they can avoid the
fate of Diocletian's noble effort. At the very least, they hope
that the lifespan of the euro will be considerably longer than the
16 years that the emperor's single currency lasted in the third
century.

MEDINA APPOINTED HEAD OF CALIF. STATE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ San Francisco Supervisor Jose Medina has
been appointed by Gov.-elect Gray Davis to head the California
State Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, 57, would take over the $6.4 billion-a-year agency at a
time when his political ally, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, is
fighting with the state over plans to place the new eastern section
of the Bay Bridge north of the current span.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wants the new bridge built to the south, so it won't
disrupt Treasure Island development, but Caltrans approved the
northern route Monday. Caltrans makes its formal decision in June,
which most likely will be followed by many lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion Bay Bridge project is Caltrans' biggest
endeavor, but Medina will soon have other responsibilities. At a
salary of $105,000 a year, he will supervise about 17,500 employees
and manage California's intricate and clogged transportation
system.
</P>
<P>
   Medina said he was honored to be working in the Davis
administration and would re-evaluate many of the projects on his
plate to fit with the new governor's visions. Medina said he had
not taken positions so far on many of the Bay Area's high-profile
and sometimes controversial transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that I can be part of his administration,'' Medina
said Wednesday night. ``My first priority is to sit down with Gray
Davis and go over his policies that he wants to implement. He wants
to take a common-sense approach to addressing transportation
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis hailed Medina's experience in San Francisco politics and
transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a San Francisco supervisor, he is no stranger to managing
infrastructure issues, and he understands the nexus between
transportation and the economy,'' Davis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some names were already surfacing as possible replacements for
Medina, including Police Commissioner Dennis Herrera and former
school board member Carlota del Portillo.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the mayor's press secretary, said Brown was
happy for Medina but said he was unavailable for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, who was elected to the board in 1996 on his third try,
said he would meet with Brown Thursday to discuss his new job and
talk about a replacement. He also said he would strongly urge the
mayor to appoint a Latino to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would want someone from the Latino community to fill my spot
because we certainly merit representation,'' he said, adding that
he was confident Brown would make such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Medina was quick to caution that just because he was a Brown
ally, that didn't mean the mayor would be calling the shots at
Caltrans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be working for Gov. Gray Davis and implementing his
policies,'' Medina said. ``I'll be taking my direction from him.
But I will be sensitive to the needs of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his new job in Sacramento would be an exciting challenge
but he was saddened to have to leave the city he had known for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get kind of mixed emotions,'' Medina said. ``I've raised a
family here, and my wife and I are very involved in city
government. We love this city. It's going to be hard to leave.''

   Markets for the euro will open Monday for the first time. Eleven
currencies now locked into fixed exchange rates, trading as one,
against the dollar mainly. How these two currencies will fare
against one another is, for the moment, anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think the new European Central Bank will keep
interest rates high to fight inflation and attract funds while
European finance ministries ease taxes to promote growth. Does that
sound familiar? It's the same recipe of tight money and easy fiscal
policy that sent the dollar soaring during Ronald Reagan's first
term.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Starting Monday morning, markets will do the
reconciling. It is all bookkeeping for now; new coins and banknotes
are still three years away. Meanwhile, comic books are promoting
the new currency to European consumers under the slogan ``C'est
facile'' _ it's easy.

   Fourteen new Internet companies have registered offerings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Securities
Data Co. These initial public offerings are likely to go forward
during January and February, so long as listed shares like
Amazon.com, America Online, and Yahoo! stay high.
</P>
<P>
   What's keeping the Internet stocks at their stratospheric
levels? Perhaps you noticed that Charles Schwab's market value last
week surpassed that of Merrill Lynch. At around $25 billion, the
biggest on-line brokerage firm was worth slightly more than the
biggest brokerage on Wall Street _ at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the customers in this new be-your-own-broker world? My
newsroom friend Frank Hertz offers the following anecdote: ``I was
listening to the radio and scanning the wires when the business
report came on the radio:
</P>
<P>
   ``Skymail stock going berserk. . .opened up 10 points. . .now up
to 14 and rising (Buy it, Frank!). . .up now 18 points (It's only
9:45 _ BUY IT, FRANK!!!). . . it was rock-bottom at 2 in October. .
. (Okay I'll log on to Schwab and buy it). . .now it's at 32. .
.Ahhhhh
</P>
<P>
   ``So I log on. It's at 28. I put in an order at 29. By the time
I click my mouse, it's at 31. I say screw it, put in a market order
instead. By the time I click my mouse again, I've bought it at
$34.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock rose almost 25 percent in three minutes, but here's
the clincher -- I was still glad I bought it at that price! The
rush of it all. I felt like I was doubling-down in Vegas _ nothing
was going to stop me. I wanted it to go up to $50 and then I'd
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The price reached $48, Hertz reported. Two days later Skymail
had dropped to $20. Next week? He may yet be rich.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Those following the breathless press coverage of how Hughes
Electronics and Loral Corp. aided China's satellite launching
agency after it blew to bits one of Loral's expensive satellites _
and several dozen people _ rejoiced last week when The Washington
Post put the story of Vector Microwave Research on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible story of the black-budget firm _ founded in 1984
by Donald Mayes _ may not resolve the issue of whether Loral
committed treason when it gave the Chinese guidance technology that
could just as easily enable them to take out New Delhi with a
ballistic missile as hoist another communication satellite into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the story illuminated just how bizarre, complex,
and widespread is the international market for advanced weapons
technology. Vector is one of a few specialists in ``foreign
materiel acquisition'' _ meaning the delivery to the Pentagon by
hook or by crook of the latest Russian, Chinese, and North Korean
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that technology often flows both ways, and Vector
has been under investigation since last year for a variety of
practices, including the possibility that it traded to the Chinese
the technical specifications for US Stinger missiles for some
Chinese missiles it wanted. Stingers are hand-held rockets very
useful for bringing down planes _ including, potentially,
commercial jet-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The theft of US high-tech military secrets over a 20-year period
also was the subject of a mostly secret report last week by a
select committee of the House of Representatives. Another flourish
of anti-Clinton rhetoric designed to pave the way to try the
president for treason? Or a dispassionate survey of security
problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some harm in some of the (Loral) transfers of
technology that occurred,'' Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the
ranking Democrat on the committee, told a press conference, ``But
it's also fair to say that this is not the only problem we
uncovered.'' His counterpart Christopher Cox (R-Calif) concurred:
``We were rapidly led to considerably more serious national
security problems than the Hughes-Loral cases.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Y2K problem turns out to be no problem at all for the
world's biggest corporations, you can thank the Germans. The giant
software firm SAP AG has skyrocketed to global prominence by
selling complicated software programs to corporations designed to
link their manufacturing, purchasing, finance, and payroll
functions. Now SAP is even advertising on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Its vast system known as R/3 amounts to a whole new layer of
extremely robust code on top of whatever older bug-prone systems
these companies still have in place. As one hard-working
bug-spotter put it, for much of the manufacturing world, SAP is the
solution to the millennium bomb _ and the chief beneficiary of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   So 1999 dawns rich in possibilities. Even the impeachment crisis
seems headed for a swift resolution. There are many theories about
what caused it _ a great religious re-awakening; the reversion to a
form of Dixie; neo-conservatives of whom it has been said they
``wouldn't take yes for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   However much they might disagree on the means to achieve it,
however, there was one goal for 1999 upon which all Americans could
agree: that there should be better men and better women. Happy new
year!

MOVIE-YEAR (Los Angeles) _ As national institutions go, Major

sure looked a lot better than, say, the national government in
1998, and that came as something of an unexpected surprise. (With
Top Ten picks of the year) By Bob Strauss. 
. 
FILM-YEAR (Los Angeles) _ During the gettin'-jiggy-with-it days of
1998, moviegoers kept trying to one-up themselves, and, in large
part, they succeeded. Blood and guts on Omaha Beach? Sign us up!
Private parts caught in a zipper? It hurts so good! A three-hour,
horrific tale of slavery starring our favorite television
personality? Um ... anyone want to see ``There's Something About
Mary'' again? (With Top Ten picks of the year.) By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
MUSIC-YEAR (Los Angeles) _ It was the year teen-age girls raised
the Titantic. Not only did the film break all box-office records,
the ``Titantic'' soundtrack _ spearheaded by the Celine Dion-sung
love theme ``My Heart Will Go On'' _ was the year's biggest seller.
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
TV-YEAR (Los Angeles) _ 1998 was the worst season in the history of
television. No, wait, 1997 was. Or next year will be. Every year,
naysayers complain about the quality of television. But, like
everything else there was good and bad in television. By Keith
Marder.

THE TINKERERS NEVER REST  
 `FABULOUS' IS MOVING  
 A DATE WITH DESTINY  
 ALONG THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take two long weekends, add a couple of libational
holidays and stir in a little icy weather, and you've got a recipe
for the near hibernation evidenced in Broadway's corridors of power
this week.
</P>
<P>
   All across town, agents' offices were closed, producers were
away and the masters of spin were finding exciting new ways to fill
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office is the cleanest it has ever been,'' said Chris
Boneau of Boneau/Bryan-Brown, the theatrical publicity agency.
``And it's usually pretty clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Even actors were getting time off. At the Cort Theater, the cast
and crew of ``The Blue Room'' had scheduled four whole days off
last week, apparently in line with the desire of the cast (read
Nicole Kidman) to spend Christmas with family (read Tom Cruise and
their children).
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a sense of ennui was creeping in at home, in the
hinterlands, some intense tinkering was under way on a couple of
Broadway-bound revivals.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, at the 4,500-seat Fox Theater, the cast of
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' began its final tryout run on
Wednesday before beginning performances at the Ambassador Theater
on Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The musical's book, based on the ``Peanuts'' comic strips by
Charles Schulz, has been substantially rewritten since the first
tryout in late November in Skokie, Ill., with dated dialogue giving
way to new material culled from the cartoons by Michael Mayer, the
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being more cautious early on to try to preserve a larger
percentage of the original,'' Mayer said. ``But I've found more
encouragement from the audience to rethink the material.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said he'd also minded some of the advice of critics, whose
reviews have been generally positive but who have quibbled over the
show's structure. To counter this, Mayer has added two new songs,
revamped arrangements and provided a new ending to Act 1 _ all
during the out-of-town run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've aged a little,'' Mayer, 38, said with a laugh.
``This cute little six-character musical has been a monster.'' He
added, ``In the best way, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   (The show's producing team has also changed. Columbia Artists
Management, a producer on the recent off-Broadway flop
``Trainspotting,'' has scaled back its financial stake in the $3
million production, leaving Michael Leavitt, executive producer of
Fox Theatricals, Fox itself and the clothing magnate Jerry Frankel
as majority partners. Jim Byk, a spokesman for the show, said the
full $3 million remained in place.)
</P>
<P>
   At the Kennedy Center in Washington, meanwhile, another revival
with a revamped script, ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' started its tryout
on Tuesday night. Gone are many of the embarrassingly off-color
references to ``Injuns,'' with new lines written by the Broadway
veteran Peter Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went well,'' Stone said on Wednesday, sounding a bit
amazed. `'Surprisingly well.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everything's perfect. ``There are jokes that don't work
yet,'' he said. ``Or will never work.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the show _ now two hours and 45 minutes _ needed some
trimming. Lloyd Rose, the chief theater critic of The Washington
Post, is scheduled to evaluate the production this week.
</P>
<P>
   As rocky as the road to Broadway might sometimes be, Stone said
he'd been schooled by his experiences with the rough early days of
``Titanic,'' which had no regional run. ``You're always in trouble
out of town, and we've had our share,'' he said. ``But the trouble
of not going out of town is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   `Fabulous' Is Moving
</P>
<P>
   One Off-Broadway cast received good (OK, fabulous) news this
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, Paul Rudnick's comedy ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever
Told'' will transfer from the New York Theater Workshop to the
Minetta Lane Theater for an open-ended commercial run. Scott Rudin
will lead a consortium of six producers.
</P>
<P>
   The Minetta Lane was the home of Rudnick's last commercial run,
with ``Jeffrey,'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lifetime fan of the Minetta Lane,'' Rudnick said. ``I
know where everything is. I know how to sneak backstage. I know
where the bathrooms are.''
</P>
<P>
   The production, which tells the story of two gay couples from
the Creation to modern-day Chelsea, will likely have the same cast
as at the Workshop, where it finishes Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The script, however, may be ever-so-slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still tinkering a little bit,'' Rudnick said. ``I have a
deeply neurotic theory of comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Date With Destiny
</P>
<P>
   When ``Wit'' formally reopens at the Union Square Theater on
Thursday, Derek Anson Jones, the show's director, will have a date
with Margaret Edson, who wrote the play.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the first time. Indeed, this creative friendship is
one that dates back all the way to ... the prom! And beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met in seventh grade,'' Jones said. ``She was like this
major junior high impresario and I was this lowly actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson remembers it differently. ``He had this little tiny
part in `The Miracle Worker,''' she said. ``But I was doing props.
I didn't even have a part.''
</P>
<P>
   The time was 1974 and the place was the Sidwell Friends School
in Washington, the private school that was the recent scholastic
home of Chelsea Clinton. Ms. Edson and Jones bonded, and soon
became close friends. ``Both of us were very into individual
expression,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So when prom time rolled around in 1979, the two decided to go
together. ``It's not like anybody else asked us,'' Ms. Edson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other important evening, there were snags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie was _ and continues to be _ a head taller than me,''
Jones said. So in the requisite pictures, she went barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, the two remained close and in 1991 did a
reading of ``Wit'' at Ms. Edson's mother's house in Washington,
with Jones playing the role of the sick professor now portrayed by
Kathleen Chalfant. It was that reading that eventually led to the
Union Square Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends stay in close touch, though Ms. Edson has moved
to Atlanta (where she lives with her partner ) while Jones now
lives in Brooklyn (with his).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was heartbroken when she moved down there,'' Jones said.
``But she's still one of my constants.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ ``All Under Heaven,'' Valerie Harper's one-woman look at Pearl
Buck, will close on Jan. 11 at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Majority of One,'' a surprise hit on Broadway in 1959,
will be the second production of the season for the Jewish
Repertory Theater. Performances begin on Jan. 16.

TIME TO KEEP `OUT OF SIGHT' IN MIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unfortunately, ``Out of Sight'' was just that to
most filmgoers when it was in theaters. The Steven Soderbergh film
was released during the summer blockbuster season and found itself
overshadowed by the likes of ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the meteor disaster flicks, the film noir/romantic
comedy/crime caper is now landing on many critics top-10 lists for
the year and was named best film of 1998 by the Boston Film Critics
Society. But if you missed ``Out of Sight'' (Universal) in the
theater, you'll have a chance to catch it on video starting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Elmore Leonard book, ``Out of Sight'' is more about
its characters than about the shoot-'em-up stuff. Nevertheless,
screenwriter Scott Frank, who already adapted another Leonard novel
(``Get Shorty''), and Soderbergh keep the story of bank robber Jack
Foley (George Clooney) flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, after a misstep, finds himself in prison. There he
engineers a prison break that goes awry, and he finds himself in
the trunk of a getaway car with a sexy federal marshal, Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez), he has taken hostage. Despite being on opposite
sides of the law, the attraction is immediate. It's an erotically
charged scene as Clooney snuggles up against Lopez within the
confines of the trunk, his fingers lingering on her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the meet up at a hotel, a little boyish wave from
Jack is all it takes to trigger their eventual, well, you know. The
fun, however, is getting there.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney and Lopez have a sexy screen chemistry _ in an adult way
_ that is hard to create. ``Out of Sight'' also benefits from a
terrific supporting cast who bring to life Leonard's bizarre
characters, including Ving Rhames as Jack's partner, a man with a
conscience; Don Cheadle as a vicious ex-prizefighter named Snoopy;
Albert Brooks as a Michael Milken-ish financier; Dennis Farina as
Karen's dad, a retired cop who gives his daughter a gun for her
birthday; and Nancy Allen as Brooks' mistress/housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   So even if you missed ``Out of Sight'' at the theaters, it will
probably be on your list of top videos in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE ENDS: It seems like 1998 was just yesterday. So before we
forget and move on, here are a few noted releases that came out at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the DVD front, Warner Bros. has delved into its vaults and
released two classics, ``My Fair Lady'' and ``Mister Roberts.''
Lovers of musicals will delight in the colorful ``Lady,'' which
sparkles in the digital format. Directed by the legendary George
Cukor, ``My Fair Lady'' took home eight Oscars and boasted a lovely
cast of Audrey Hepburn, Rex Harrison, Stanley Holloway and Wilfrid
Hyde-White. The DVD version includes a feature-length audio
commentary from those who worked on the 1964 film, notably Marni
Nixon, who was the singing voice for Hepburn; a behind-the-scenes
documentary; and two takes of Hepburn singing the songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister Roberts'' netted a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Jack
Lemmon, but the World War II tale of the cargo ship USS Reluctant
had a high-powered cast. Henry Fonda, reprising his Tony
Award-winning performance on Broadway, played Lt. Doug Roberts, who
was dying to leave the backwaters of the war for the front lines.
James Cagney was his stodgy, by-the-book captain, and William
Powell played his last role as world-weary Doc.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD includes an audio commentary by Lemmon, who played
Ensign Pulver, and excerpts from a documentary on Fonda about his
involvement with the film. Directed by two Hollywood heavyweights,
John Ford and Mervyn Leroy, ``Roberts'' is stagey and cramped, but
it's meant to be a crowd pleaser and often is. &QL;

HERBIE`S CLASSIC SIXTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERBIE HANCOCK/``The Complete Blue Note Sixties Sessions'' (Blue
Note)
</P>
<P>
   For his most recent record for Verve, Hancock explored Gershwin,
a project that called upon the lyrical pianist's classical and
interpretive skills. This thorough six-CD archive finds Hancock in
the first flush of his solo career in the '60s, when he cut such
sophisticated and highly rated hard-bop tunes as ``Maiden Voyage,''
``Dolphin Dance,'' ``Cantaloupe Island'' and ``Watermelon Man,''
all standards today. Albums included here _ among them ``My Point
of View,'' ``Empyrean Isles,'' ``Speak Like a Child'' and ``Maiden
Voyage'' _ helped establish Blue Note's reputation for distinctive
music that was also accessible. Top-flight players helping out on
these sessions include Dexter Gordon, Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter,
Tony Williams, Freddie Hubbard and George Coleman. A must for jazz
fans. 4 Stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAUL WELLER/``Modern Classics'' (Island)
</P>
<P>
   This 16-track best-of collects selections from each of the
studio albums ex-Jam leader and Britpop hero Weller has released
over the past six years, adding one new tune. Since launching his
solo career at the beginning of the '90s, Weller has continually
refined his soulful, '60s-steeped style. On such standouts as
``Sunflower'' and ``The Weaver,'' both from the excellent ``Wild
Wood'' album, Weller's potent voice puts him in the ranks of such
seminal influences as Steve Marriott and Steve Winwood. Other
sure-fire winners here include the gentle ballad ``You Do Something
to Me'' and the soulful swoon of ``Broken Stones.'' A good
introduction to one of the greats. 3{ Stars &QL;

VARIOUS/``926 East McLemore Vol. 1'' (High Stacks)
</P>
<P>
   This address should be familiar to soul fans everywhere _ it was
home to the once mighty Stax label. ``926 East McLemore,'' a newly
recorded tribute to that Memphis r&AMP;b legacy, brings together such
Stax figures as Rufus Thomas, the BarKays, J. Blackfoot and the
Temprees, backed by dependable studio hands such as
guitarist-producer Bobby Manuel and drummer Steve Potts. There are
plenty of affecting moments among these 11 tracks. Best of all are
Rance Allen's ``Front-Line,'' Blackfoot's ``Uptown Lady'' and the
rhythm section's ``Drum Island,'' a tribute to late Stax architect
and Booker T. &AMP; the MG's drummer Al Jackson Jr. 3 Stars &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since Franco Zeffirelli's elephantine new staging of
``La Traviata'' opened at the Metropolitan Opera at the end of
November, new singers have taken over all the principal roles.
Normally, the assumption is that the original singers have moved on
to other projects, but in this case it seems likely that some of
them were simply lost in the scenery and may not be heard from
again. A singer who wanted to hide out for a while, in fact, could
hardly do better than to get a role in this staging.
</P>
<P>
   The first opportunity to slip out of sight occurs during the
opening party scene, which is so busy and overpopulated that one
has to expend considerable effort to keep Violetta and Alfredo in
view. This is clearly a brilliant if belated popular culture
reference, a kind of double, operatic ``Where's Waldo?'' And it
does no good to find Violetta and assume that Alfredo is nearby,
since Zeffirelli sometimes has them exchange their intimacies from
opposite sides of a crowded drawing room.
</P>
<P>
   For someone unable to avoid the limelight at the first party,
the one in the second act is foolproof. Scarlet, lacey drops,
decorated with flower patterns, hang from the ceiling but are soon
withdrawn to show balloons, streamers and other baroquery, not to
mention the streams of glitter that rain down on the revelers. If
circuses had bordello tents, they would probably look like this.
Granted, setting this on a huge staircase might seem peculiar, but
perhaps Zeffirelli was paying homage to the Met's about to be
retired ``Il Trovatore'' production, in which the gypsy camp is set
on a similar staircase, except in high-gloss ebony rather than the
wood hues of this production.
</P>
<P>
   Within that homage, naturally, is a touch of Zeffirellian
one-upsmanship: If gyspies can dance on steps, he may have
reasoned, so can toreadors, cows and bulls. And so they do. At any
rate, one could field a football team, convene a Beatles reunion or
even stage an opera amid all this imagery and activity, and no one
would be the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Zeffirelli did clear the decks for the most
emotionally charged scenes, and the new principals bring
interesting and mostly satisfying voices, as well as some
thoughtful interpretive turns, to the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ainhoa Arteta, a soprano from the Basque region of Spain, is a
captivating, complex Violetta, and would undoubtedly be even more
affecting in an intimate theater. The salient feature of her
portrayal is her use of a sweet, velvety pianissimo that conveys
Violetta's doubts and fears in the first act, the pain that
underlies her resolution in the scene with the elder Germont and
her fragility at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arteta has the high notes and agility for the role as well,
and although it took her a few moments to find a comfortable level
_ understandably, given the ruckus around her _ she has the power
to project into the hall. Her one weakness was diction: Her words
were often too soft-edged to be comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   Marcello Giordani, a tenor who has grown considerably since he
made his Met debut a few years ago, has become a superb Alfredo.
His timbre is fresh and bright, and his phrasing and coloration
have an appealing flexibility and musicality. There were moments on
Wednesday evening when his way with the musical line called to mind
a young Placido Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Chernov, having recovered from the illness that kept
him out of the first cast, joins the production as Germont. Oddly,
his baritone seemed more lightweight than is usual for him, or
typical for Germont. But he brought a calm dignity to the role that
served it well, and like Ms. Arteta and Giordani, he shaped his
lines with a persuasive subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bergeson, a conductor heard regularly at the New York City
Opera, made his house debut. He paced the work comfortably, made
the string lines in the first- and third-act preludes as haunting
as they can be, and accompanied Violetta's more introspective arias
with considerable warmth. The orchestra played beautifully for him.

LACMA FOCUSES ON VAN GOGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's only human to feel like a failure now and
then, but Vincent van Gogh's losing streak was herculean by all
standards.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered mental illness, poverty, the infamous loss of his
ear and ultimately suicide. While his genius is recognized today
more than 100 years after his death, van Gogh sold just one
painting in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Various filmmakers have looked at van Gogh from different
angles, either directly examining the artist's struggle to be
understood, his devoted brother, his friendship with fellow artist
Paul Gaugin or in purely fictional terms as an intriguing figure
whose meaning eludes us.
</P>
<P>
   As a preview to this month's opening of the ``Van Gogh's Van
Goghs'' exhibit, Los Angeles County Museum of Art's film department
is hosting a three-night Van Gogh series starting Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   French director Maurice Pialat's ``Van Gogh'' from 1992, with
subtitles, will screen at 7:30 p.m. Woven into this account of the
productive final months of the artist's life are his patron, Dr.
Gachet; the doctor's flirtatious daughter; the French painter Henri
Toulouse-Lautrec; and van Gogh's brother, Theo.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Altman's treatment of the bond between brothers,
``Vincent &AMP; Theo,'' will screen Friday. Tim Roth stars as Vincent,
with Paul Rhys as his art-dealer brother in a first-rate biography
that sheds light on Theo through the letters they shared. A short
excerpt from the late Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's ``Dreams''
about a young painter who walks into a van Gogh painting for a talk
with its creator also is being shown.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Douglas gives a riveting performance as the tormented
artist in director Vincent Minnelli's ``Lust for Life'' from 1956,
being shown Saturday night. Anthony Quinn co-stars as Paul Gaugin,
with whom van Gogh shared a testy friendship, a performance that
won Quinn an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. A second film about
Gaugin, ``Wolf at the Door'' from 1987, will follow. This
overlooked film by Christopher Hampton (``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses'') concentrates on Gaugin's attempt to break into the
Parisian art scene, and stars Donald Sutherland and Max von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSER ENCOUNTER: Steven Spielberg's director's cut of ``Close
Encounters of the Third Kind'' will be shown in its entirety at 8
p.m. Jan. 12 at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures' film restoration department has created this new
version that combines digitally remastered sound with sequences
from the first and special editions of the 1977 production about
UFOs and the shrouded arrival of extraterrestrials. ``Close
Encounters'' won Oscars for cinematography and a special
achievement award for sound-effects editing, and was nominated in
seven other categories, including Best Director and Best Supporting
Actress (Melinda Dillon).
</P>
<P>
   The cast and technical crew will convene on stage afterward for
a panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg wrote the screenplay, and Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr
and Francois Truffaut co-star. Tickets cost $3 for academy members
and $5 for the public, and may be purchased during regular business
hours or on the night of the screening. The academy is at 8949
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Call (310) 247-3600 for information.
</P>
<P>
   TOP DOCUMENTARY: The Contemporary Documentary Series resumes
Tuesday at UCLA's James Bridges Theater with ``Frank Capra's
American Dream'' and ``Riding the Rails'' being screened.
</P>
<P>
   Now through March 16, exemplary documentaries will be shown as
part of the 17th annual documentary series, co-sponsored by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Academy Foundation
and the UCLA Film and Television Archive. ``A Story of Healing'' _
the 1997 Oscar winner for short documentary from 1997 _ and three
other nominated productions are on the slate.
</P>
<P>
   Seating is free, and the program begins at 7:30 p.m. Whenever
possible, the filmmakers will attend. The theater is near Sunset
Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue on the northwest corner of the
Westwood campus. Parking in Lot 3, next to the theater, costs $5.
Call (310) 205-345 for information.
</P>
<P>
   WRITERS NETWORK: Guest speaker Scott Frank, whose writing
credits include ``Out of Sight'' and ``Get Shorty,'' will talk
about the art of adaptation to the Scriptwriters Network on Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting begins at 1:30 p.m. at Universal Studios in Building
476, Rehearsal Hall B. Frank is a repeat guest speaker. Seating is
limited, and reservations must be made by calling (323) 848-9477.
Nonmembers are invited and pay $15.

   The Scriptwriters Network is a nonprofit group of film and
television writers that hosts monthly speakers and holds an annual
script competition. For going online:

FEAR HAS REPLACED TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Assuming Bill Clinton finishes out his term, the
next presidential election promises to be the best _ by that I mean
closest _ since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are contained in a new poll conducted by the Kaiser
Foundation and Harvard University for the Washington Post. It shows
a country caught in an electoral crossfire, between the assault of
religious and cultural conservatives from the right and the
continued fear of tax-and-spend liberals from the left.
</P>
<P>
   How voters react to this dangerous predicament will decide the
presidential election in 2000 and the direction of American
politics in the early 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Clinton supporters in the survey is that more
voters care about ``a candidate's stands on the issues'' _ 37
percent _ than on his or her ``personal morals and ethics'' _ 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also benefit from a growing public tolerance on
matters of personal morality in government officials. While only 24
percent said ``yes'' when asked if the president has ``high
personal moral and ethical standards,'' six out of 10 said
Clinton's behavior is no better or worse than others of his
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Clinton Democrats face trouble is from an equally
pronounced decrease in public respect for government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in 1968, that most explosive of anti-establishment years,
if they ``trust the government in Washington to do the right
thing,'' 61 percent checked ``just about always'' or ``most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 33 percent checked those responses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This is a devastating 30-year trend for the Democrats, a
political party that has placed its faith in positive public
solutions to national problems such as poverty, poor health care
and inadequate education.
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy toward Washington shows up in another question put
to voters in the new poll. Asked in 1965 what institution _ ``Big
Government,'' ``Big Labor'' or ``Big Business'' _ they fear poses
the largest threat down the road, 35 percent said ``Big
Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the same multiple-choice in 1998, ``Big Business'' scored
somewhat higher as a national pariah, ``Big Labor'' pathetically
lower. ``Big Government'' zoomed to 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What does this tell us about the 2000 presidential campaign?
First, that Democrats will do everything they can to peg
Republicans as the party of the ``religious right,'' a faction
driven to a frenzy by its ideological zeal, its social and sexual
intolerance. Meanwhile, the Democrats will seek to de-emphasize
their old reputation for ``Big Government'' solutions to national
problems, including health care.
</P>
<P>
   Second, that Republicans will do everything they can to peg
Democrats as the party of ``Big Government,'' the faction that
tried to create a giant health care bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the GOP
will try to lose its label as the party of intolerance with a
dramatic overture to minorities, especially Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties, seeing the same polls, know that the one sure way
to lose the 2000 election is to appear to voters as ``Big
Brother,'' a specter feared as much in the bedroom as in the
pocketbook.

ANOTHER SEASON FOR BETTER OR WORSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; 1998 was the worst season in the history of
television. No, wait, 1997 was. Or next year will be.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, naysayers complain about the quality of television.
But, like everything else there was good and bad in television.
</P>
<P>
   Sure television had its share of flops. It didn't take long for
shows such as Fox's ``Holding the Baby,'' NBC's ``Wind on Water''
and CBS' ``The Brian Benben Show'' to unveil their premature series
finale.
</P>
<P>
   Some new shows will stick and probably be around for the year
2000. Among the winners are ``That '70s Show,'' ``Charmed,''
``Felicity,'' ``Martial Law'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   We have seen Jimmy Smits (Det. Bobby Simone) leave ``NYPD
Blue,'' making room for Rick Schroder (Det. Danny Sorenson), who
is, surprisingly, a better fit for the show. Luke Perry (Dylan
McKay) came back to ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' just in time to fill
the void left by Jason Priestley (Brandon Walsh), and Shannen
Doherty and Aaron Spelling are back together again in ``Charmed.''
But, above all, television continued to do what it does best. Shows
such as ``The Practice,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Law &AMP;
Order'' and ``Chicago Hope'' often surpass the big screen week in
and week out for quality storytelling and character development.
</P>
<P>
   The following (in no particular order) is a look at the 10 best
and worst things about America's most pervasive medium, as it
played out in the past 365 days. &QL; 
BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Big Four no more: With each sweeps period come more reports of
doom for network television. But the loss of audience share is the
result of increased competition, which leads to better television.
As cable channels continue to grow and offer more and distinctive
programming, viewing choices become more abundant.
</P>
<P>
   Is that clear?: HDTV sets cost about $7,000 _ out of the range
of even many wealthy families _ so this is not something most
people will enjoy for a decade or so. But when the prices drop,
millions of viewers will see sharper pictures, hear crisper audio
and see movies the way they were intended to be seen _ in letterbox
format.
</P>
<P>
   Freeway suicide: Overzealous news-gathering operations learned a
valuable lesson in April when thousands watched what has become a
routine occurrence in Los Angeles: police chasing a car on a
freeway while news helicopters captured the drama. Daniel V. Jones,
40, of Long Beach, stopped his truck on a freeway, and with police
keeping their distance, he spread out a banner criticizing HMO
medical plans before shooting himself to death. After the graphic
scene played out live at 3 p.m., local news directors took a step
back and realized they had to be more cautious when covering an
unpredictable event. So far, they have kept their word.
</P>
<P>
   The real McBeal: David E. Kelley is a workaholic, and television
is better for it. His series ``The Practice'' won an Emmy for
Outstanding Drama, while ``Ally McBeal'' was nominated for Best
Comedy. The double nomination proved the agile mind of Kelley. He
writes almost all of the episodes of the two series and makes
nothing but great television.
</P>
<P>
   Bakewell broiled `Pfeiffer': Although the reasons for disliking
``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' were debatable _ Danny
Bakewell and the Brotherhood Crusade and the Rev. Jesse Jackson
said the fictional show about Abraham Lincoln and his black
butler/confidant was racist and made light of slavery _ the bottom
line is their efforts most definitely helped get this hideous
program off television.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne and caviar boy: Adam Sandler's surprising
box-office prowess has landed him $35 million studio deal for two
movies. We're better off with him in two films a year than in a
weekly sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Public Ryan: Tom Hanks' successful movie career is also one of
the best things to happen to television. Hanks used his clout to
create an unparalleled miniseries for HBO _ the 12-part ``From the
Earth to the Moon.'' Next up for the space cowboy will be a similar
treatment of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last laugh: Mike Darnell is a Valley native and the Fox
executive who brought us such Fox specials as ``When Animals
Attack.'' NBC honcho Don Ohlmeyer called Darnell's specials snuff
films, but then put some on the Peacock network when he saw what a
financial windfall they were. Anyone who can make Ohlmeyer look bad
(he doesn't need much help) is OK.
</P>
<P>
   So Sue me: Sue Costello, star of the dismal sitcom ``Costello,''
wouldn't know humble if it hit her in the head. She came in
thinking she would change television. It was Costello who needed to
change. After a few weeks, it didn't matter _ because her show was
gone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WORST &QC; 
The Phil Hartman tragedy: Phil Hartman was not only one of the most
talented people on television, he enjoyed entertaining people and
was just a nice guy. His life and career were cut short by a
murder-suicide at his Encino home, and every rerun of ``NewsRadio''
reminds us of what we're missing.
</P>
<P>
   Larry leaves: ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was a rare television
example of a show leaving the air while still standing on strong
legs. The three main characters _ Garry Shandling (Larry Sanders),
Rip Torn (Artie) and Jeffrey Tambor (Hank ``Hey Now'' Kingsley) _
were all phenomenal. Watching real-life stars such as David
Duchovny, Jim Carrey and Ellen DeGeneres lampoon themselves was
always welcome, and the series finale was the finest episode in
television history.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld goes to jail: The best broadcast series also picked
last season to call it quits. Cast members turned down $13.2
million for another year, and Jerry Seinfeld said no to $5 million
an episode. However, it was the right time for the series to leave
us. The only problem: The final episode was flat and too long.
</P>
<P>
   Monica-gate: Just when news crews thought that the big news last
January was in Cuba, word of Bill Clinton having sexual relations
with a White House intern began to circulate. That set off a year
to rival any soap opera with sex, intrigue and overkill. The story
became so repetitive and boring that it played out like a bad
``Twilight Zone'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of medicine: Doctors in real life struggle as HMOs
cut their earning power. Not so on television. Afraid to lose its
top two shows in one year (see ``Seinfeld''), NBC ponied up $13
million an episode for ``ER's'' fictional doctors, who seem to lose
a lot of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling geniuses: What would you do with a show that millions
of people tuned into? Well, if you were a network programmer, you
just might move it. Sometimes it works and audiences follow, as
happened last year with ``The X-Files.'' But more often than not,
it's a disaster. Take ``King of the Hill.'' Moving this smart
sitcom from Sundays to Tuesdays has shrunk its audience. With so
few quality shows, you'd think programmers could spread them out.
Instead, we get nights like Tuesday when ``JAG,'' ``3rd Rock From
the Sun,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Home Improvement'' and
``King of the Hill'' all cannibalize each other for eyeballs. On
Monday, viewers are forced to choose between ``Everybody Loves
Raymond,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsmagazine mania: Three developments should indicate that as
the next millennium approaches, television newsmagazines are about
to take over the world. ``Dateline'' is on as often as a soap
opera; Fox has a news mag, and ``60 Minutes'' felt it necessary to
show Jack Kevorkian kill a patient to grab ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Of sweeping and trash: We can blame sweeps for the following: a
steady diet of reruns between sweeps, all of the good specials
being lumped into a month, overhype, and sensationalism over
substance on local newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Erin go bye: A major theme of the season was Irish families, but
alas, the green turned out to be moldy. Among the shows that
inundated the tube were ``Costello,'' ``Wind on Water,''
``Trinity'' and ``To Have and to Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Meddling executives: Ever wonder why so many shows, specifically
sitcoms, are cookie cutter (``Call central casting. I need a wacky
neighbor and a red-headed best-friend type.'')? That's because a
small group of executives take your favorite shows and put them
through what one producer calls ``The network deflavorizing
machine.'' Meddling execs lead to the sameness that sends audiences
running for cable when they're looking for something unique. &QL;

KEVIN SPACEY, DESTINY SHAPER  
 FINDING JOY IN DIRECTING  
 RAVES FOR COMFY SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Kevin Spacey describes his career strategy
straightforwardly: ``In life, you have to make your own fate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however, a deceptively simple formula considering that
Spacey is producing one of the most complex, respected and frenetic
bodies of acting work, with a whole new chapter about to open.
</P>
<P>
   He has an Oscar and a Tony, a critically acclaimed revival of
``The Iceman Cometh'' coming to Broadway in the spring after a run
in London, two movies in progress and one in the theaters _ well,
two if you count his part as the voice of the demonic Hopper in the
animated ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   And now his year-old production company, Trigger Street
Productions, has cut a deal with the studio Fine Line Features.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't worry about him taking his time mulling over
script ideas. He said that the company was already planning to
shoot a movie version of the play ``Hospitality Suite,'' and that
he expected to direct what he called ``a bigger, more personal
story, maybe in a year or so.'' Some movies he may just produce,
without appearing in front of or behind the camera, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal,'' said
Spacey, referring to the fact that many studios offer successful
actors production arrangements that actually generate few if any
movies. ``There's a real opportunity for my company to become a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's deal with Fine Line Cinema, a unit of Time
Warner's New Line, allows him to retain foreign distribution rights
on some of his films and to create over time a library of movies in
which he will own a substantial interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked down
before,'' Spacey said.
</P>
<P>
   At this busy time in his career it is striking, though, that he
is currently appearing in ``Hurlyburly,'' a movie that represents
an unusually well-trodden road. As Spacey noted, when he made the
leap from regional theater to the New York stage some years ago, it
was by acting in ``Hurlyburly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, he played almost every part in the dark drama
before the run was through and his career had begun. In the film,
he plays the smooth, reptilian Mickey.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey spoke by telephone from the set of ``American Beauty,'' a
movie being directed by Sam Mendes, who also directed the revival
of ``Cabaret'' and ``The Blue Room,'' both on Broadway now.
``American Beauty,'' an examination of a marriage, is expected in
theaters perhaps late next summer or fall.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey has finished filming ``Ordinary Decent Criminal,'' set in
Ireland, which may come out in the spring. That is when he will
appear on Broadway as Hickey in ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey said he expected his company to make both low-budget,
independent movies as well as costly studio productions but, he
stressed, not because one is easier than the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try just as hard,'' Spacey said. ``That camera has no idea
what the budget is.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding Joy in Directing
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Michael Cristofer seemed to have it all as
a writer.
</P>
<P>
   After winning both a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony for his Broadway
play, ``The Shadow Box,'' in 1978, Cristofer ventured into movies
and had quick successes writing the screenplays for ``Falling in
Love'' and ``The Witches of Eastwick.'' But then came disaster,
when he wrote the script for ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' the
disappointing film version of Tom Wolfe's novel. That was followed
by well-paying but little-noticed work on movies like ``Boys on the
Side.''
</P>
<P>
   So, cynical and somewhat stale, by his own admission, Cristofer
did what all his friends warned him against: He became a director.
The result, he said, is something close to bliss as he moves to
complete his first feature film, ``Jello Shots,'' an ensemble piece
about young-adult angst.
</P>
<P>
   Cristofer's first directorial job was on the highly regarded
``Gia,'' the tragic tale of the real-life model's rise and fall,
which he made for HBO. That led to ``Jello Shots,'' a roughly $15
million film for New Line Cinema. Shooting wrapped on Dec. 19, with
release scheduled for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in pig heaven,'' said Cristofer of his new career as a
director. ``Everyone said: `You'll hate this. Don't make this
mistake.' But the opposite was true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt I couldn't do the writing anymore,'' he added. ``I
told myself that if I'm going to make movies, I have to make the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristofer hasn't completely given up writing; in fact, he did
extensive rewriting on ``Jello Shots,'' whose original screenplay
was written by David McKenna. But he said he was happy to be
focusing on the visual aspects of filmmaking, particularly in his
new movie, a complex exploration of young people discovering how
explosive and unsettling sex can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jello Shots'' is vaguely reminiscent of ``200 Cigarettes,''
another coming-of-age movie scheduled for release in 1999. Like
that film, ``Jello Shots'' involves a group of young people _ four
couples, in this case _ getting drunk and spending an evening
together.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jello Shots,'' the couples struggle through sexual
encounters that leave them baffled or, in one instance, hurt, with
the woman claiming she'd been raped, and the man denying it.
</P>
<P>
   The couples wrestle with the question of whether she can be
believed, but the real point, Cristofer said, is how these people
discover that sex can push them farther apart rather than pull them
closer together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue isn't whether there was date rape, but for these
people, on the brink of adulthood, how do you accomplish intimacy
with another person,'' Cristofer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, he has not given up on the theater; he wrote
``Amazing Grace,'' which ran in New York last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bad habit you keep trying to kill but can't,'' he
said. ``It's like charity work.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's a good thing the directing thing is really
taking off.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was the year teen-age girls raised the
Titantic.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the film break all box-office records, the
``Titantic'' soundtrack _ spearheaded by the Celine Dion-sung love
theme ``My Heart Will Go On'' _ was the year's biggest seller.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also showed their clout by making the Backstreet
Boys' debut a massive hit along with multimillion-selling offerings
from fellow teen idols 'N Sync, Spice Girls, Brandy, Monica and
Savage Garden. Meanwhile, teen and pre-teen consumers put
Cleopatra, All Saints, Natalie Imbruglia and Tatyana Ali on the
map.
</P>
<P>
   When that all-important demographic of 7-year-olds wasn't making
and breaking new stars, it was flipping the dial to Radio Disney,
which played many of their favorite records.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop continued to dominate the charts, proving that rap is
now the mainstream while rock is a niche genre, with major hits
from DMX, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri and Wyclef
Jean. Fugees member Lauryn Hill's solo debut, ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn ``Hill'' was not only a top seller but one of the most
lauded discs of 1998, despite recent rumblings that perhaps Hill
received a bit too much credit for its production.
</P>
<P>
   The swing revival hit its juke-jivin' stride in '98, fueled by
Brian Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue and a popular
Gap ad featuring the original 1958 version of Louie Prima's ``Jump
Jive an' Wail.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-grunge era, the once mighty alt-rock genre was
reduced to a series of radio hits from such forgettable one-hit
acts as Harvey Danger, Eve 6 and Marcy Playground. Lollapalooza,
the format's summer caravan tour, didn't even get off the ground,
its thunder quickly stolen by Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Other tours that broke records included OzzFest and the
money-minting Rolling Stones trek, where ticket prices reached
$300.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite concerts of '98 included the Carnegie Hall date of the
delightful Buena Vista Social Club, a group of elderly Cuban jazz
musicians plus guitarist Ry Cooder.
</P>
<P>
   Also last summer, after a three-year absence, the Beastie Boys
reconquered the world. The old-school trio broke new-school ground
with its ``Hello Nasty'' disc, and the subsequent tour was a
coast-to-coast sellout.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, heavy metal enjoyed a revival of sorts with
the grass-roots success of Bakersfield noise merchants Korn,
proving a band can build a large, loyal following without radio's
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The year's biggest losers included Rod Stewart, Van Halen and
Ace of Base, whose new albums all stiffed. Smashing Pumpkins saw
their slow and sappy ``Adore'' barely break 1 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Brooks had another spectacular winter, hitting the million
mark in one-week sales of his double live album, one of just 18
records to spend time atop the albums chart in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Other country acts had good years. Shania Twain launched her
first tour, showing cynics she really could sing in concert. LeAnn
Rimes, Vince Gill, George Strait and Alan Jackson enjoyed big hits,
and the Dixie Chicks were country's hottest breakthrough act.
</P>
<P>
   The much-predicted '80s revival was personified by the Bauhaus
reunion, which began by testing the waters with a couple of local
dates and immediately turned into a national tour when ticket sales
went through the roof. Depeche Mode, Culture Club and Berlin also
hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   In the dance world, Madonna and Gloria Estefan returned to their
club roots, while local dance radio Groove 103 flipped formats to
adult alternative Channel 103.1, offering Los Angeles boomers an
unexpected sequel to much-missed FM 101.9.
</P>
<P>
   In jazz, there were some inspired entries, including Geri
Allen's ``The Gathering,'' the Dave Holland Quintet's ``Points of
View'' and Joe Lovano's ``Trio Fascination.'' It was also a strong
year for reissues of classic material, such as the Miles Davis
``Bitches Brew'' box and John Coltrane's ``The Classic Quartet _
Complete Impulse! Studio Recordings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grim Reaper certainly didn't rest. Those missing in action
include Love guitarist-singer Bryan MacLean, New Orleans r&AMP;b
vocalist Johnny Adams, singer-actor Gene Autry, U.S. congressman
and onetime singer Sonny Bono, country founding father Owen
Bradley, blues harpist Lester Butler, jazz vocalist Betty Carter,
Nashville pianist Floyd Cramer, singer Falco, jazz guitarist Tal
Farlow, singer-dancer Alice Faye, rockabilly vet Charlie Feathers,
songwriter Charlie Foxx, bluesman Junior Kimbrough, jazz pianist
Kenny Kirkland, Chicago blues drummer S.P. Leary, bluegrass legend
Rose Maddox, musician-photographer-activist Linda McCartney, ska
musician-bandleader Tommy McCook, r&AMP;b arranger Gene Page,
rockabilly guitarist Carl Perkins, cowboy king Roy Rogers, Bob
Wills guitarist Eldon Shamblin, Frank Sinatra, musician Cliffie
Stone, James Taylor drummer Carlos Vega, bluesman Junior Wells,
Beach Boys guitarist Carl Wilson, country great Tammy Wynette and
ska saxophonist Roland Alphonso.
</P>
<P>
   Events to look forward to in '99 include a new album and tour
from Jeff Beck, the first solo dates from Beach Boys co-founder
Brian Wilson, and a Blondie reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consolidation was the industry buzzword for '98, which
will be remembered as the year the Big Six music conglomerates
became the Big Five as a result of Universal's $10.4 billion
takeover of PolyGram. Jobs will be shed within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the best albums of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' Lucinda Williams: Six years
in the making _ and worth the wait, this collection of soulful
snapshots of Southern life removes the talented Williams from the
cult category once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' Lauryn Hill: No matter
who was ultimately responsible for arranging this imaginative slice
of hip-hop heaven, the songs, melodies and rhythms found on such
cuts as ``Doo Wop (That Thing)'' far outshine the genre's
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Bring It On,'' Gomez: From the Deep South by way of the UK,
the award-winning Gomez turns in a rootsy, down-home set that
introduces J.J. Cale to Portishead. Amazingly, they get along fine.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Mezzanine,'' Massive Attack: The haunting Bristol trip-hop
trio excavates the sinister side of dub, adding forceful guitars to
suggest hope where there isn't any. Psycho-diva role filled by
Cocteau Twin Liz Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Deserter's Songs,'' Mercury Rev: What a concept _
enchanting orchestral indie rock from the Catskills. Guests Levon
Helm and Garth Hudson of the Band add a dusty veneer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Tie: ``Live 1966: The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert,'' Bob
Dylan; ``The Quintet 1965-68,'' Miles Davis; ``Tracks,'' Bruce
Springsteen: Three decades on, this infamous Dylan concert still
holds the power to surprise and delight. Same goes for the
near-telepathic Davis sessions compiled here. As for Springsteen,
any of the four CDs on ``Tracks'' could stand on its own as a very
satisfying album.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Hell Among the Yearlings,'' Gillian Welch:
Appalachian-style country-folk complete with banjo and gripping
tunes dealing with murder, morphine and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969-74,'' Bill
Laswell: New York producer-musician Laswell was allowed to
manipulate the original session tapes of Davis' gorgeous ``In a
Silent Way'' with fascinating results Miles himself might've dug.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Girl Bros.,'' Girl Bros.: Wendy and Lisa from Prince's
Revolution band fashioned a near-gothic semi-acoustic masterpiece
of depressed mood and melody.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too,'' New Radicals: Owing a
debt to Prefab Sprout and his dad's record collection, Radicals
mastermind Gregg Alexander created the year's most refreshing,
uplifting and hook-filled rock. &QL;

   Raves for Comfy Seats
</P>
<P>
   The movie studios have enjoyed an excellent holiday season, as a
sort of a cherry on top of the banana-split of a year they have had
at the box office, and film executives attribute at least part of
the success to an unexpected source: good seats.
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the entertainment industry has grown enormously,
shaking up the television and music businesses, but the movie
business has had a record year. According to Exhibitor Relations,
which tracks box-office results, theaters sold $6.94 billion worth
of tickets this year, a 9 percent increase from $6.36 billion in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over the three-day Christmas weekend, box-office receipts set a
record, rising 2 percent from last year to $147.2 million. And this
came in spite of the fact that there were no blockbusters, just
lots of solid singles and doubles, plus a triple. Seven of the
movies in release earned more than $10 million over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are mind-shattering figures,'' said Phil Barlow,
president of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, the distribution
arm of Walt Disney Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest surprise may have been the triple, ``Patch Adams,''
the Robin Williams comedy from the beleaguered Universal Studios,
which took in $25.3 million in spite of generally poor reviews. But
lots of other films performed well, including Disney's ``Mighty Joe
Young,'' about an oversized gorilla, which took in $10.6 million in
spite of strong competition from other children's movies, like ``A
Bug's Life'' and ``The Rugrats Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Many studio executives attributed the strong results, as might
be expected, to the quality of their products. But they also
generally agreed that the proliferation of multiplex theaters with
far more comfortable seats, often in a stadium configuration, and
better sound systems has helped bring in the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the multiplexes are having a big impact,''
Barlow said. ``They're the shopping mall of theaters. Everything is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Rocco, president of distribution at Universal, added: ``I
give a lot of the credit to the new theaters. The stadium seating
is so much more comfortable and you don't have to worry about
looking at the back of someone's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabebian, president of Exhibitor Relations, also said
that while many factors made this a big year, the new theaters were
increasingly important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound quality is so good,'' he said. ``The seats are
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Another happy surprise over the holiday weekend was that the
three top-grossing films were all aimed at adults rather than young
men, the group that has sent ticket sales soaring on a number of
pictures this year. ``Patch Adams,'' the first solid hit for
Universal this year; ``Stepmom,'' a tear-jerker, and ``You've Got
Mail,'' the nonsequel sequel to ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' were all
regarded as adult films that appealed particularly to women.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this, Ms. Rocco of Universal said, ``I'm just happy
to have a hit.''

ANOTHER TEN BEST HEARD FROM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ 1. Saving Private Ryan: Steven Spielberg combines
visceral, gut-wrenching imagery with economic storytelling in a
powerful reminder of a generation's honor and bravery. Proof
positive that war, even a ``good'' one, is pure hell and that
sacrifice is a principle that should never go out of style.
</P>
<P>
   2. Life Is Beautiful: Roberto Benigni walks a mile-high
tightrope in this masterpiece about a father's all-encompassing
love for his child. A powerful fable of exquisite grace and beauty
in horrific conditions, ``Life Is Beautiful'' equates comedy with
genius in a completely unforgettable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   3. Shakespeare in Love: The year's most dazzling romance would
please the Bard to no end in that it contains all the elements _
wit, wordplay, passion, adventure _ found in his great work. In
that respect, this wonderful movie is a superb continuation of four
centuries of sublime, joyous creativity.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Truman Show: This subversive treasure deftly amuses us
while quietly indicting our growing desire for mind-numbing
entertainment. Director Peter Weir brilliantly constructs Truman's
real/imaginary world, showing how the lines between reality and
make-believe have become hopelessly blurred. And then he implies
we're all to blame for this mess. Mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bulworth: Warren Beatty pulls off a cinematic rarity, giving
us a political movie that's actually about politics. As the
despairing senator on a truth-telling, death-wish jag, Beatty (who
co-wrote the script) shreds the American landscape _ political,
social and otherwise _ in a movie that's as sobering as it is
funny.
</P>
<P>
   6. Gods and Monsters: The fictionalized look at the last days of
``Frankenstein'' director James Whale weaves the themes of his
monster movies into a poignant look at desire, devotion and
mortality. Ian McKellan delivers a heartbreaking performance
playing the haunted, gay director, while Brendan Fraser provides
superb support as the confused object of his affection.
</P>
<P>
   7. Out of Sight: Steven Soderbergh's crackling caper movie
contains some of the year's most memorable character actors (Don
Cheadle, Steve Zahn) and some sizzling screen chemistry between
George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Filled with vibrant language and
inventive filmmaking, this was the little summer movie that
couldn't but that should have scored big with audiences.
</P>
<P>
   8. There's Something About Mary: The year's most influential
film and its grossed-out greatness will reverberate (for good and,
mostly, bad) for years to come. Gleefully trampling the constraints
of political correctness, Peter and Bobby Farrelly created a movie
every bit as brave as ``Private Ryan,'' spilling bodily fluids
instead of blood.
</P>
<P>
   9. Pleasantville: When two modern-day teens are zapped back into
a 1950s TV sitcom, glorious technicolor erupts in this inventive
look at whether Father really did know best. Joan Allen and William
H. Macy deliver wonderfully layered performances as the emotionally
repressed parental archetypes whose wholesome lives begin to crack.
</P>
<P>
   10. Mulan: In a year that gave us a lot of good animated movies
(``Antz,'' ``Prince of Egypt'' and ``A Bug's Life), the folks over
at Disney again demonstrated why everyone aspires to be like
Mickey. ``Mulan'' boasts gorgeous animation, heartfelt storytelling
and catchy songs, making its Chinese legend a story for the ages.
Plus, it contains the only Eddie Murphy turn this year suitable for
those over the age of 3. &QL;

ANOTHER YEAR AT THE MOVIES

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the gettin'-jiggy-with-it days of 1998,
moviegoers kept trying to one-up themselves, and, in large part,
they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Blood and guts on Omaha Beach? Sign us up! Private parts caught
in a zipper? It hurts so good! A three-hour, horrific tale of
slavery starring our favorite television personality? Um ... anyone
want to see ``There's Something About Mary'' again?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we didn't embrace every very bad thing that came our way.
Still, 1998 was a richly diverse year for movies where the dull
(anything with an asteroid) and the disturbing (anything with
bodily fluids) played side by side, often with equally good
results.
</P>
<P>
   And if you didn't want to see anything challenging or new, you
could always count on sequels with stupid titles (``I Still Know
What You Did Last Summer''), remakes (Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot
``Psycho'' paste job) or the comforting reality that ``Titanic''
was still playing at a theater near you.

</P>
<P>
   2. Let's not edit out those naughty bits in ``Titanic'' and sell
the ``family'' version of the video. Instead, let's keep the
naughty bits and lose the rest of the movie. That way, it won't
waste so much of our time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Let's put Brad Pitt in a romantic movie. And to please all
his fans, we'll have him talk really s-l-o-w and have him move
through every scene at a snail's pace. And since Brad doesn't do
this type of movie very often, we'll make it three hours long to
tide people over until the next one. We'll call it ``Meet Joe
Black.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Let's make a monster movie. And to tease audiences, we'll
make a really good 30-second trailer and follow it with a clever
advertising campaign. That way, we'll manage to suck in a few
people before everyone realizes that we've made a monster movie
completely devoid of fear, fun or thrills. We'll call it
``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Let's make an Eddie Murphy movie starring Jeff Goldblum.
We'll call it ``Holy Man.'' &QL; 
BEST EXERCIES IN SELF-DISCOVERY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   1. ``There's Something About Mary''

<P>
   2. ``Pleasantville''

<P>
   3. ``Happiness'' &QL; 
WORST ... &QC;
</P>
<P>

THE BEST OF '98
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR;  1. Saving Private Ryan: Don't believe the
simplistic critique that Steven Spielberg's greatest film is merely
a technical marvel. There has never been a better movie about men
sacrificing not just their lives in the most necessary of wars but,
almost as precious, risking the very essence of what makes them
good.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gods and Monsters: Symbolism and psychology are deftly
blended in this fictionalized study of James Whale's final days. As
the director of ``Frankenstein'' _ unapologetically gay,
insufferably English, brilliant but poignantly enfeebled by the
aftereffects of a stroke _ Ian McKellen is nothing short of
majestic. And the way director Bill Condon weaves horror movie
themes into the character study is ingenious.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Truman Show: Our easy, even eager acceptance of
television's bogus communal values is gently but viciously indicted
in Peter Weir's exquisitely crafted, cautionary allegory. And Jim
Carrey could not be better cast as the man whose every waking
moment is a put-on.
</P>
<P>
   4. The General: An absolute kick. Brendan Gleeson's portrayal of
an Irish criminal mastermind is as multilayered as you could hope
for, and no less exuberant for it. Another brilliant slap in the
face of civilized authority from ``Hope and Glory'' director John
Boorman.
</P>
<P>
   5. Taste of Cherry: As a suicidal man drives around the dusty,
depressing suburbs of Tehran, Abbas Kiarostami's minimalist
masterpiece asks if it's possible to have an existential crisis in
a theocracy. The answer, of course, is yes, but the Iranian
filmmaker frames the question with such resonant humanism, the
movie becomes genuinely, if ironically, life-affirming.
</P>
<P>
   6. Fallen Angels: Director Wong Kar-Wei and cinematographer
Christopher Doyle put on the best light show of the year with this
hallucinogenic study of Hong Kong's underworld at night. That they
got a touching, often wacky story of urban alienation in between
the color bursts is even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   7. Shakespeare in Love: As smart and clever as it needs to be,
considering what it is: a backstage farce about the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet.'' The literary references _ and modern show-biz
lampoons _ fly thick and fast in this impudent satire of the
Elizabethan theater scene. Meanwhile, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph
Fiennes create the most romantic movie couple of the year.
</P>
<P>
   8. Fireworks: and Sonatine: Two weirdly moving Japanese crime
movies by stone-faced Renaissance guy Takeshi ``Beat'' Kitano. The
writer-director-star-editor-painter has a storytelling rhythm all
his own, a unique approach to violence that truly jolts and a fine
feel for the toughest customers' tenderer tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   9. Life Is Beautiful: Many find it uplifting, but watching
Roberto Benigni's Holocaust comedy is a much more distinctive
experience than that. For most of its length, you have to be asking
yourself whether the Italian funnyman's light, goofy tone is at all
appropriate for the subject matter. Fortunately, he strikes the
right note of gravity just in time.
</P>
<P>
   10. There's Something About Mary: Because, well, there just is. &QL;

DARING DIRECTORS, EDGY THEMES MARK A GOOD MOVIE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; As national institutions go, Major League
Baseball and John Glenn were more impressive. But the movies sure
looked a lot better than, say, the national government in 1998, and
that came as something of an unexpected surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected because, for the three previous years, every sector
of the film culture had essentially fallen down on the job.
Hollywood entertainments were uniformly juiceless, mostly
miscalculated commercial calculations; independents became precious
and derivative; foreign imports were wan when they got here at all.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 saw those trends reversed. Many studio films took
artistic risks, often with remarkable creative or popular success
(``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Truman Show,'' ``There's Something
About Mary,'' ``The Mask of Zorro,'' ``Enemy of the State,''
``Pleasantville,'' ``Antz,'' ``Bulworth''), though sometimes with
wayward individualism (``Beloved,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' ``Babe:
Pig in the City'').
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both the American indie scene and the rest of the
world showered us with distinctive visions. Sure, there was the
usual run of talkative criminals and sad-eyed but plucky Third
World orphans. But these were more than made up for by some of the
best work ever from world-class filmmakers John Boorman, Neil
Jordan, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Bigas Luna, Paul Schrader
and Wong Kar-Wei.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as pleasing were the introductions of talented new
directors like Vincent Gallo (``Buffalo 66''), Thomas Vinterberg
(``The Celebration''), Takeshi Kitano (``Fireworks'' and
``Sonatine''), Don Roos (``The Opposite of Sex''), Lisa Cholodenko
(``High Art''), Peter Howitt (``Sliding Doors''), Richard
Kwietniowski (``Love &AMP; Death on Long Island''), Darren Aronofksy
(``Pi'') and Kirk Jones (``Waking Ned Devine'').
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the filmmakers who made the leap from good
to great this year, such as Bill Condon with ``Gods and Monsters,''
``Elizabeth's'' Shekhar Kapur, ``Shakespeare In Love's'' John
Madden, ``A Simple Plan's'' Sam Raimi, ``Happiness''' Todd Solondz
and ``Life is Beautiful's'' Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even some of those motor-mouthed gangster and foreign
urchin movies were pretty good last year.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the two dumb meteor/comet movies and the ascendancy
of intellectual antichrist Adam Sandler, 1998 was not a bad movie
year. Not one, though, to inspire Pollyanna predictions of an
art-form renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, the year of ``Godzilla,'' a movie it was
universally agreed was awful but that managed to make the top 10
box-office list anyway. It was a year when Eddie Murphy and Robin
Williams, two of the most anarchic comic talents of their
generation, traded their genius for bland likability in
aggressively mushy feel-good product. It was a year when the
commercial bottom fell out of the stupid teen-age horror movie
market, but the things were so cheap to make they kept putting them
out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the year that Jerry Springer made a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' was remade, and Akira Kurosawa died.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to sum up the negatives in a single title, the year of
``Orgazmo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad as that movie was, though, it was part of 1998's best film
trend: shattering taste barriers. From ``Private Ryan's'' graphic
D-Day footage to the spewing sophomorics of ``Something About
Mary'' to the runaway misanthropy of ``Happiness,'' ``Your Friends
and Neighbors,'' ``Very Bad Things,'' ``Apt Pupil'' and a dozen
others, filmmakers made the extra effort to sustain the movies'
traditional role of threat to the nation's morals.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the competition from the White House, Congress and
Ken Starr, it was not an easy mission.
</P>
<P>
   While some of these transgressive films were embraced by critics
and public alike, most of them were denounced and shunned. Which,
in its odd way, was a very good thing (``Orgazmo,'' of course,
excepted). It's proof positive that the unimaginative timidity that
pervades the industry still hasn't wiped out the will to make
dangerous, exciting movies.
</P>
<P>
   While cinema's power to still shock and provoke was something to
celebrate throughout the Year of Monica, we should not overlook the
wonderfully tender comforts the movies brought us as well.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the compassion exchanged between Joan Allen's TV mom
and both her real-life son (Tobey Maguire) and gentle new lover
(Jeff Daniels) as her emotional color is covered up, then
gloriously exposed in ``Pleasantville.'' In a much more realistic
mode, the central father-child relationship in ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries'' was a remarkable display of both sensitivity
and good sense.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser in ``Gods and
Monsters,'' an ode to impossible, enriching friendship if there
ever was one. And say what you will about Oprah Winfrey's
``Beloved,'' but the passion her ex-slave shared with Danny
Glover's character in that movie was almost tactile in its
spirit-salving mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Tenderness and terrorism: These may be the qualities we'll
remember best about the films of 1998. But as those two widely
divergent themes suggest, the real glory of the year just past was
its variety. For all the doubling we were subjected to _ computer
bugs, World War II combat, television satires, those
Earth-threatening space rocks _ there was more than enough
diversity to satisfy every taste.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you liked eye-popping computer design (``What Dreams May
Come,'' ``Dark City'') or classic black-and-white (the faithful
recut of Orson Welles' ``Touch of Evil''), respectful piety (``The
Prince of Egypt'') or satisfying sleaze (``Wild Things''),
political prescience (``Primary Colors'') or pure escapism (that
``Star Wars'' trailer), the films of 1998 gave it to you.
</P>
<P>
   And they gave you your choice of a whole lot more. As the wider,
dumber national melodrama wound down to the strictured options of
impeachment or censure, it's no wonder movies enjoyed their best
box-office year ever. They remembered the nearly lost art of
engaging us, amusing us, moving us and occasionally even
enlightening us.
</P>
<P>
   And just when we needed it most. &QL;

BORDERS EXPANDS TO THE ENGLISH-READING WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Borders bookstore here stands four stories tall,
with such vast space devoted to words, chilled chardonnay and house
blend coffee that at least one British author felt the acute need
to retreat to the new gleaming rest rooms for refuge from a panic
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The superstore, in London's busiest shopping district on Oxford
Street, is part of the grand strategy of Borders Group to expand
its reach outside of the United States, a feat no other major
bookseller in the world has tried.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Borders, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., has
opened a total of five stores in Britain, Australia and Singapore
to headlines declaring a ``U.S. Invasion'' and a ``War of Words.''
In the coming year, the bookstore chain, the second-biggest in the
United States, has plans to open as many as 10 more stores in
English-speaking countries. It also appears to be nearing a deal to
buy a stake of nearly 20 percent in Paper Chase, a chain of14
stationery stores in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   While its fierce American rivals, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com,
battle over the so-far unprofitable spoils of the Internet, Borders
is investing in terra firma. But the expansion has raised questions
over whether the chain has moved too slowly to invest in the
electronic commerce of books, which with software, are the most
popular products sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Borders shares, which hit a 52-week high of $41.75 in July, have
fallen since in part because of a perception that it was not
enthusiastic enough about Internet commerce. (On Thursday, the
stock closed at $24.9375, down 20.36 percent for the year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Border's stock is doing all that poorly, it's
just that the company is not enjoying the Internet lift that goes
to the first mover and then to a prominent second competitor, but
after that trails off conspicuously,'' said Mary A. Tolan, global
managing partner for the retail operating unit of Andersen
Consulting. ``However, Borders is pursuing international expansion
more aggressively than its competitors. Once investors get as
excited about global expansion as they are about the internet
Borders will be much better positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival in November, the new chief executive, Philip
M. Pfeffer has said that the company should probably do more to
promote its current Internet activities, noting that Borders
upgraded its Web site in December and plans further improvements in
January. But
</P>
<P>
   Pfeffer said that the company was committed to adding 40 more
superstores in the United States next year and expects to speed up
its international growth because sales at ``some of these stores
have been remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he declined to reveal the revenues of the new
international stores, Pfeffer said that three of the international
stores rank among the top five performers of all its nearly 250
superstores. That is not unexpected given that Borders has started
its new stores in heavily trafficked areas. &UR; (Its other British
stores are in Glasgow and in Brighton &LR; . &UR; ) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Its cafe is open for business at 8 a.m. and serves a menu of
sandwiches to lunchtime clientele. At night, a pianist plays a baby
grand for cafe drinkers mixing latte and literature.
</P>
<P>
   For the store's opening in August, Stephen King made his first
personal appearance in England in 17 years to promote his novel
``Bag of Bones,'' an event so crowded that autograph seekers were
limited to 1,000 ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rice paid a visit, and so did the Scottish author of
``Trainspotting,'' Irvine Welsh, who read from his latest novel,
``Filth.'' A British rock singer, Julian Cope, came to the store,
signing three autographs to promote his new book, ``The Modern
Antiquarian,'' before locking himself in the men's rest room, with
an attack of agoraphobia, a fear of public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accessible sophistication,'' is the image that Borders is
trying to promote in Britain, said Philip Downer, the chief of
operations for Borders Ltd., the British subsidiary, who added that
style means that in the children's section, ``we actively encourage
children to trash the place.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that style, the British and American managers of the
international stores have strived to mesh two cultures and
corporate styles. In the fall of 1997, Borders spent an estimated
$65 million to acquire Books Etc., a chain of more than 20 London
bookstores started by Richard Joseph, who is now chief executive of
the Borders bookstores in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of the British employees, Borders brightened the
lighting, created larger signs to direct customers, and painted the
walls in bolder colors of yellow and red. British employees adopted
the more relaxed dress of the American managers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Borders' goal to acquire a company that could give it the
cultural knowledge to enter into a foreign market where its buyers
could recognize, for instance, the appeal of ``Bluff Your Way at
Cricket.''
</P>
<P>
   Such knowledge is vital in a market with such keen competitors
as W.H. Smith and Waterstone's, which earlier this year merged with
another rival, Dillons, to form the HMV Media Group and the
country's largest bookstore chain. Shortly before Borders' grand
opening in London, Waterstone's announced that it would open a
bigger store a few doors away that features 165,000 titles. Since
then the battle has intensified with Waterstone declaration that it
planned to open a seven-story bookstore in a former department
store in London.
</P>
<P>
   The British market became attractive in part to price-conscious
American booksellers in part in 1995, when an industry agreement
that barred retailers from selling books at discounts was
eliminated. Borders also entered Singapore because of liberal
copyright laws, which allowed it to ship in book inventory from the
United States, eliminating the major costs of setting up local
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next phase would be to go into non-English speaking
countries _ a large cosmopolitan country with a large population of
English speakers,'' said Vincent Altruda, the president of Borders'
international stores division. Started as a used bookstore in
Michigan in 1971, the Borders chain is feeling the limits of its
domestic borders in the United States, where analysts have been
predicting for some time that the expanding market of superstores
could reach saturation after 2000. The chain started its own
electronic Web site this spring in third place after Amazon.com and
Barnes &AMP; Noble, making it an expensive prospect to catch up with
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they succeed internationally, they can say we generated
higher returns than Barnes &AMP; Noble generated on line, but it's so
early that you can't say with any certainty that they can be
successful overseas,'' said Craig Bibb, managing partner at Jasper
Funds in New York. ``Maybe if they pull it off, they'll have the
last laugh. I think you can see from the stock price that it's hurt
them. They placed their bet and they said it's going to be
international.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Turnof Fox, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities,
said the company could still prove its mettle. ``Because of
Border's strong track record the company has a lot of residual good
will on Wall Street,'' she said. ``If the company has strong
holiday sales, is able to reassure investors that its growth rate
is sustainable at around 20 percent and takes a more aggressive
stance on the Internet, I think we could see the stock recover
further.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Britain there has been speculation that Borders' pioneering
trail will be followed by the leading American bookseller, Barnes &AMP;
Noble. One publisher said that Barnes &AMP; Noble's representatives had
approached some of the major British publishers for advice and also
had called Books Etc., which ultimately was acquired by Borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many stores to open here in the United States, we
just can't seem to make sense enough of a market for us to want to
jump out,'' said Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes &AMP;
Noble. ``We look at it from time to time and we may jump in, but I
don't think there's going to be any global push for typical
bookstores. But you can never say never. Wouldn't it be nice to
have a great American bookstore in Paris?''

`OUR MUTUAL FRIEND': VINTAGE DICKENS, DARK AND SUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June 1865, Charles Dickens was traveling to London when his
train derailed, leaving his car dangling off a bridge 10 feet above
a riverbed. Dickens helped rescue the two women with whom he had
been vacationing and whose connection to him he did not want
revealed: his lover, the young actress Ellen Ternan, and her
accommodating mother.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of helping attend to the wreck's victims, some
seriously hurt and others dead, he climbed back into his
compartment to rescue the manuscript he carried with him, a chapter
of his novel in progress, ``Our Mutual Friend.'' As he wrote in a
postscript to the book, his characters ``were much soiled, but
otherwise unhurt'' by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   For Dickens, the aftershocks were more lingering. Several years
later, he still experienced ``sudden vague rushes of terror,'' as
he put it. Add to that the deaths of friends and his sometimes
precarious health in middle age, and you have a picture of the
distressed state of mind in which he wrote that novel, among his
darkest, least sentimental and most difficult to bring to the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Around 800 pages long, it includes dozens of characters and two
major entangled plots concerning unsuitable romances, savage social
hypocrisy and the effect of money on human nature. Yet this
unlikely candidate has become a vividly populated, visually
beautiful, altogether engaging series on Masterpiece Theater. (The
three-part series on PBS begins Sunday and continues Monday and
Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   In six leisurely hours, the series pares the novel down
significantly yet intelligently, and creates an upstairs-downstairs
world so thoroughly realized that viewers may be reluctant to let
it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Mutual Friend'' was the last novel Dickens completed (he
left ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood'' half-finished when he died in
1870, at 57), and the series captures its mature vision. In this
shadowy story, the redemption of misguided characters must
literally break through a cloud of dust. Dust and the river are the
novel's overwhelming images, and episode one begins with a stunning
vision of the Thames, a fantasy of moonlight shimmering on midnight
blue that evokes Turner and Whistler. In this romantic setting, a
man named Gaffer Hexam (David Schofield) trolls for drowned bodies
whose pockets he can pick. The scene instantly sets up the
discordance of Dickens' world, in which the visible trappings never
provide reliable clues to behavior.
</P>
<P>
   With Hexam is his daughter, Lizzie (Keeley Hawes), a young woman
repulsed by his actions yet kind to him as only a Dickens heroine
can be. She is naturally good-hearted and clear-sighted, yet in
this unflinching story, even she is not a piece of spun sugar. Ms.
Hawes (seen recently as the well-bred Victorian heroine in ``The
Cater Street Hangman'') conveys all of Lizzie's confusion as she
makes moral and social choices about her future.
</P>
<P>
   Though it takes a while for the plot to unfold, in true Dickens
fashion each scene is intriguing in itself. From the river, the
setting moves to a party given by the social climbing Veneerings,
and the palette bursts into bright colors. Throughout, Lizzie and
the lower classes are shot in dingy brown; the middle and upper
classes wear colorful costumes, in crystalline sunshine or by
golden candlelight.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Lightwood, a lawyer, is entertaining the Veneering
party with the tale of an old gent named Harmon, who ``made his
money in dust.'' The garbage mounds, or ``dust heaps,'' of Dickens'
day were in fact lucrative recycling businesses. From mountains of
trash, material was retrieved to make soap and bricks; among the
refuse, jewels and other valuables could be scavenged. On screen,
the Harmon dust heaps resemble a mining town, with shacks in the
shadows of black mounds and workers in rags sifting through dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The mean-spirited Harmon has willed his fortune to his son,
John, on the condition that he marry Bella Wilfer (Anna Friel), a
clerk's daughter John has never met. Just as Mortimer concludes
this story, he receives word that Gaffer Hexam has fished John
Harmon's body from the Thames. From then on, the Hexam and Harmon
plots, as well as the upper and lower classes, become hopelessly,
wonderfully tangled.
</P>
<P>
   In the most compelling part of the story, Mortimer's friend
Eugene Wrayburn falls in love with Lizzie. Paul McGann (``Withnail
&AMP; I'') brings immense appeal to Eugene, a handsome man possessed of
languorous charm, a drooping mustache and the credo ``so easily
bored.'' He is indolent and self-dramatizing yet has inner
resources we somehow believe in.
</P>
<P>
   The Harmon fortune passes to his loyal servants, and Mrs.
Boffin. As the Boffins, Peter Vaughan and Pam Ferris make it clear
why the plump, good-natured couple are among Dickens' most
delightful creations, keeping their common sense as they become
accustomed to their fancy clothes. The Boffins generously take
Bella into their grand new home. Pretty and strong-minded, she is
ingenuously honest in admitting, ``I love money.''
</P>
<P>
   When a man called John Rokesmith (Steven Mackintosh) decides to
lodge at the Wilfers and work as Boffin's secretary, Boffin tells
Bella: ``We seem to have a mutual friend. Bit of a mystery man, my
dear.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is cleared up for us, though not for the characters,
at the end of Part I. John's voice-over and flashback are similar
to the novel's interior monologue; as in the book, this is
compelling information that comes in the story's one structurally
awkward episode.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   By eliminating much of Dickens' satirical asides about bourgeois
society, the series puts the emphasis on the absorbing, subtly
acted romances of Eugene and Lizzie, John and Bella. Yet the screen
version preserves the core of Dickens' social commentary, for these
loves are always set in the context of the caste system that
forbids them.
</P>
<P>
   Misguided love leads to some of the most dazzling set pieces.
Bradley Headstone (David Morrissey) is a schoolmaster who teaches
Lizzie's younger brother; we begin to see just how tightly wound
Headstone is when he proposes to Lizzie in a cemetery, explosively
blaming her for his obsession with her.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene is equally, though more gently, obsessed. He helps
educate Lizzie yet recognizes the unbridgeable social distance
between them. They meet in a meadow and later he walks alone,
expressing out loud a dilemma any gentleman of his era would find
heart wrenching: ``Out of the question to leave her, out of the
question to marry her.'' And John, a mere secretary, is rebuked by
Bella for constantly watching her.
</P>
<P>
   Love or money? A good heart or social status? The characters in
``Our Mutual Friend'' fluctuate wildly between these poles. In this
tale, trash becomes money, and money becomes prestige, as the foul
dust heap that created the Harmon fortune is turned into the coin
of admittance to society. But in Dickens' complex world, poverty
does not automatically equal goodness; goodness is a matter of what
one does, and how one reacts, to wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of eccentric Dickens characters in this series,
including Silas Wegg, a one-legged blackmailer, and Jenny Wren, who
sews dresses for dolls. There are the deliciously vile Lammles,
each marrying the other for money only to find on their wedding day
that they are both penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Riah, a good Jew written to compensate for the stereotype of
Fagin in ``Oliver Twist,'' has so small a role that his presence
here is confusing (he befriends Lizzie). And Dickens' fans may be
startled at the absence of Podsnap, the embodiment of small-minded,
bourgeois selfishness to whom Dickens gave a chapter and a term,
``Podsnappery.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, a dramatic attack leaves Eugene for dead. And
though it wouldn't be Dickens without a sunny ending of some sort,
there is not a touch of false sentiment in this hugely
entertaining, tough-minded tale. After a dismal television season,
``Our Mutual Friend'' starts the new year on a high note that will
be hard to match.

WALKER HANCOCK, SCULPTED PRESIDENTS, HEROES; AT 97 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walker Hancock, a sculptor who spent his long career ``ennobling
the human figure,'' died Wednesday in his Gloucester, Mass. home.
He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hancock's work included statues of Douglas MacArthur at the
US Military Academy at West Point, John Paul Jones in Fairmount
Park in Philadelphia, and James Madison in the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the bust of President Bush in the US Capitol
rotunda, inaugural medals for President Eisenhower, and was one of
several sculptors who worked on the memorial to Confederate war
heroes in Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock has spent his life ennobling the human figure,'' Globe
art critic Christine Temin wrote in a story published on Aug. 16
last year. ``He has sculpted the great and the good, Robert Frost
to Thomas Jefferson, along with the kids in his neighborhood and
the gods of ancient myth. He gave equal dignity to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hancock was born in St. Louis. He got his first commission
for a World War I memorial at a local high school when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, at the age of 19, he made a pilgrimage to Gloucester to
meet his idol, portrait sculptor Charles Grafly. He lost his nerve
at Grafly's doorstep, but enrolled in Grafly's class at the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Grafly invited to him to live and work with him in Gloucester in
1930. Mr. Hancock for the most part resided in Gloucester for the
next 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Army as a member of a unit
that retrieved artwork the Nazis had looted and hidden.
</P>
<P>
   For several years in the 1960s, he was lead sculptor on the
gigantic Stone Mountain Memorial, a 69-foot-high granite bas relief
depicting Confederate heroes on a rocky hill outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Though known throughout the world as an artist, in the
Lanesville neighborhood of Gloucester he was known as an unassuming
neighbor and friend who allowed generations of youngsters to swim
in his quarry while he worked. ``He was a very sweet man who will
be missed by many people,'' his longtime cook, Gloria Parsons, said
in a story published in the Gloucester Times.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a daughter, Deane Hancock French of Buckland, Mass.;
and two grandchildren.

HOLIDAY MOVIES: 10 WORTH A LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a movie critic, the holiday season now ending might be summed
up in a single Shakespearean phrase: ``the winter of our
discontent.'' Two of the season's finest films, ``Affliction'' and
``A Simple Plan,'' both set in rural small-town America, are draped
in snow. Both are bleak, devastating meditations on human frailty,
and yes, discontent. The treacherous landscapes in which they are
set make their desperate characters seem all the more weak and
fallible.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of discontent, Hollywood has come up sadly short this
season in releasing movies that combine mass appeal with high
artistic merit. End-of-the-year crowd-pleasers like ``Stepmom,''
``Patch Adams,'' and ``You've Got Mail'' are no match against
``Titanic,'' ``Good Will Hunting'' and ``As Good as It Gets,'' the
previous holiday season's prestige blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, American films aspiring to any kind of seriousness
seemed to fall into two polarized categories: mushy mainstream fare
that soft-pedaled the darker side of life, and bitterly caustic
independent films that broke new ground in exploring that darker
side. Even Hollywood's more high-minded movies tended to come
sugarcoated with phony uplift. The most aggressively mystical of
these films _ ``What Dreams May Come,'' ``Simon Birch'' and the
dismal three-hour funeral known as ``Meet Joe Black'' _ were
hopelessly mired in pretentious New Age hooey.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with a little
mystical uplift in movies. It just has to be convincing. But the
kind of hope these movies offered _ for eternal life; eternal love;
cut-rate, all-purpose redemption _ was contaminated by a cynical
Hollywood marketing mentality that left you feeling queasy.
</P>
<P>
   On the independent side, films like ``Happiness,'' ``Your
Friends and Neighbors'' and ``Affliction'' went out of their way to
keep the sugar bowl at arm's length. If the commercial impact of
these movies proved negligible, artistically they had the status of
tiny poisoned arrows aimed at the Goliath of mainstream schmaltz.
As dark as they may be, such movies seemed to be the only hope in
1998 for the future of an American cinema propped up on the four
pillars of feel-good sentimentality, teen-age gross-out comedies,
children's animation and violent action-adventure.
</P>
<P>
   For audiences in search of holiday movies that refuse to climb
those pillars, here are 10 films currently playing that are worth a
look. They are listed in order of preference, with special
attention given to worthy, underrated acting performances.
</P>
<P>
   `Affliction'
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schrader's adaptation of Russell Banks' novel about a
policeman losing his emotional grip in a small New Hampshire town
is remarkably faithful to the book. And Nick Nolte, giving the
screen performance of his career, registers every harrowing jolt as
his character becomes increasingly fixated on the notion that a
hunting accident was actually a murder. James Coburn is a scary
revelation as Nolte's drunken, violently abusive father whose
lifelong fury hasn't been dampened by age. We carry our demons with
us all our lives, the movie suggests. Worse, if we foist those
demons on our children, sooner or later there will be hell to pay.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Nolte's and Coburn's remarkable performances make you
feel the murderous, blood-surging anger passed down from a violent
father to a son. The shimmering dark-blue scenes of cars on
snow-covered roads create a chilly mood of profound, almost
majestic loneliness and gloom that is subtly underlined by Michael
Brook's music. Mary Beth Hurt, as Nolte's battle-weary ex-wife, and
Sissy Spacek, as his loyal girlfriend, are memorable as careworn,
everyday women gamely trying to make do.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: There is no sugarcoating on this sadly truthful vision
of troubled ordinary New Englanders. The film is starkly tragic.
The one grating element is a stiff voice-over narration by Willem
Dafoe, who plays Nolte's younger brother. The bond between these
two is never made entirely credible.
</P>
<P>
   `Hilary and Jackie'
</P>
<P>
   The true story of the relationship between the renowned cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, who died of multiple sclerosis, and her slightly
older sister, Hilary, a flute prodigy who never made it in the
classical music world, explores sibling rivalry, love and family
loyalty with remarkable subtlety and insight.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Emily Watson is incandescent and a little scary as
Jacqueline, a needy, willful genius and star who grows up
love-starved and having no sense of boundaries. Jacqueline takes
what she needs (if she doesn't get it, she throws a tantrum), and
if that includes borrowing her sister's husband, so be it. Such
monstrous demands seem entirely believable within the context of a
relationship that is so close the sisters can read each other's
minds. The movie is beautifully structured and edited, and its
delicate use of Jacqueline's signature piece, Elgar's Cello
Concerto in E minor, suffuses the film with a quiet melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: The film is a little too patly framed around
sentimental opening and closing sequences of the sisters as
children playing games on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `Shakespeare in Love'
</P>
<P>
   A genuinely witty, grown-up comedy with crowd-pleasing potential
is almost unheard of these days. That's why ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' which playfully imagines a passionate love affair that
prompted William Shakespeare to write ``Romeo and Juliet,'' is so
welcome. The movie is directed by John Madden like a raucous
Shakespearean comedy. And the screenplay by Marc Norman and Tom
Stoppard finds a seamless balance between Elizabethan and
contemporary locutions.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Literary wit (some of it concerning Shakespeare's
relationship with Christopher Marlowe) abounds. Joseph Fiennes and
Gwyneth Paltrow, as Young Will Shakespeare and his inamorata, Viola
de Lesseps (who is betrothed to another), have a frisky romantic
chemistry. The screenplay neatly folds elements of ``Twelfth
Night'' and other Shakespeare comedies into its farcical plot. Judi
Dench, so memorable as Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown,'' outdoes
herself as a different queen, Elizabeth, who is portrayed as the ne
plus ultra of imperious gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: For all its cleverness, ``Shakespeare in Love'' isn't
wildly funny. It's a movie to make you smile more than laugh out
loud. And Fiennes' Shakespeare, although charming, seems awfully
lightweight for the Bard of Avon.
</P>
<P>
   `A Simple Plan'
</P>
<P>
   Sam Raimi directed this relentlessly taut thriller about three
men from the same small town who discover a bag containing $4
million in cash in a crashed airplane in the woods and decide to
tell no one and divide the money. Almost immediately, simmering
tensions among them erupt, revealing class differences and a
painful sibling rivalry. As their greed and paranoia escalate, so
does their capacity for violence.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Scott B. Smith's screenplay, based on his novel, has the
force of a very contemporary and very savage moral fable. Faced
with the prospect of instant wealth, Bill Paxton, a middle-class,
college-educated Nice Guy, and his wife (a wonderful Bridget Fonda)
quickly turn into scheming monsters. Billy Bob Thornton, as
Paxton's jittery, uneducated, barely socialized older brother,
steals the movie in a performance that is alternately creepy and
heart-rending. Ms. Fonda makes the metamorphosis of her character
from cuddlesome homebody to scheming small-town Lady Macbeth
chillingly convincing. The movie reminds you of the awful things
that can happen when ordinary people catch the scent of money.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: Beneath its immaculately snowy surface, the movie is
really just a thriller. When you consider it afterward, several
major plot developments stretch credibility to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   `A Civil Action'
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' is proof that yes, Hollywood can on occasion
turn out a star vehicle that defies easy formula and that doesn't
revolve around a cardboard hero. John Travolta dares to be
unsympathetic in this true story of an arrogant, greedy Boston
lawyer who loses everything (and bankrupts his law partners) in his
fanatical quest to win a lawsuit against two corporations whose
dumping of toxic wastes may be responsible for a cluster of
leukemia deaths.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: If it was Nick Nolte'syear, it was also John Travolta's.
Coming on top of his bravura impersonation of a Bill Clinton-like
president in ``Primary Colors,'' Travolta's portrayal of a smug,
strutting legal eagle in ``A Civil Action'' is a reminder that
Travolta is one megastar who can really act. Robert Duvall, as his
insidiously canny legal opponent, delivered yet another performance
worthy of Oscar consideration. Steven Zaillian's screenplay and
direction succeed admirably in clarifying complex issues and legal
strategies without becoming simple-minded.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: If the movie is impressively workmanlike, it has no
poetry or inner light. We don't get a deeper sense of any of the
characters beyond their corporate and boardroom stratagems.
</P>
<P>
   `Hurlyburly'
</P>
<P>
   David Rabe's powerful screen adaptation of his '80s play about
drug-taking bachelor swingers in the middle echelons of Hollywood
is as corrosive a study of male bonding and one-upsmanship as you
could hope to find. Sean Penn is a self-destructive casting
director raging at the void and Kevin Spacey is his cold smoothie
housemate in their chilly Hollywood Hills bachelor pad. Chazz
Palminteri and Garry Shandling are their scuzzy friends, and Meg
Ryan, Robin Wright Penn and Anna Paquin are the women they use as
pawns.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: ``Hurlyburly'' has the most brilliant ensemble acting of
any 1998 film. Penn eviscerates his soul in a stunning performance
filled with tears, vomit and mucous (from all the coke-snorting).
Palminteri is wonderful as a stupid, violent lug with delusions of
talent, and Shandling is bloodcurdling as a sleazeball who gives
away women as presents.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: The coked-up world portrayed in the movie feels a
little dated. And after a while, the close-up spectacle of people
almost continuously drunk and stoned becomes wearisome. Rabe's
dialogue is bitterly funny, but you never forget that it is stage
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   `The General'
</P>
<P>
   The title character of John Boorman's black-and-white film, the
notorious Irish gangster Martin Cahill (nicknamed ``the General'')
who was shot by the Provisional IRA in 1994, is so robust he almost
bursts out of the screen. Beautifully photographed, the movie is a
full-scale, remarkably evenhanded portrait of a complicated,
charismatic bully and thief whose criminal career was a lifelong
cat-and-mouse game with the police.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Brendan Gleeson's rollicking depiction of canny-eyed,
doughy-faced Cahill, who was always shielding his face with his
hands in public, is one of the most brilliantly acted portraits of
a compulsive hell raiser ever filmed. The performance reminds you
that some people are constitutionally born to be rebels. Jon Voight
is equally fine as the policeman who makes catching Cahill a
careerlong quest. The heist sequences are expertly choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: This detailed biography is what it is: a close-up
portrait of an Irish celebrity criminal. Its resonance doesn't
extend any further. The actors' thick Irish accents make some of
the dialogue unintelligible to American ears.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `The Thin Red Line'
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Malick's return to moviemaking is a visually gorgeous,
nearly three-hour cinematic poem, loosely based on James Jones'
novel about the battle of Guadalcanal. Delivered by an all-star
cast, the characterizations, such as they are, accumulate into a
collage of voices meditating on how fighting in a war inevitably
changes and darkens a soldier's view of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: The ravishing cinematography portrays a Melanesian
island as a latter-day Eden despoiled by marauding armies.
Individual set pieces stand out, especially a scene of anguished,
weeping Japanese prisoners of war, and Nick Nolte's brief but
incendiary turn as the ferocious battalion commander. Sean Penn,
Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, John Savage and John Travolta make
the most of their very brief appearances, while James Caviezel's
philosophical Pvt. Witt conjures up memories of Montgomery Clift in
``From Here to Eternity.'' Hans Zimmer's beautiful minimalist
romantic music underscores the film's overall mood of abstracted
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: In nearly three hours, no fully rounded characters
emerge. After a devastating, brilliantly staged battle sequence at
the center of the film, the movie loses momentum and turns into a
meandering fragmentary series of poetic afterthoughts as the
soldiers, each lost in his private world, wandering the island. At
a certain point, the dreaminess gives way to tedium.
</P>
<P>
   `The Hi-Lo Country'
</P>
<P>
   The British director Stephen Frears' ambitious stab at a classic
western suggests an uneasy hybrid of ``Red River,'' ``The Last
Picture Show'' and ``Giant.'' Based on a novel by Max Evans and set
in the late 1940s, the film tells the story of a rootin'-tootin'
cowboy (Woody Harrelson) and his shy best friend (Billy Crudup) who
both love the same unworthy woman (Patricia Arquette).
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Harrelson as Big Boy, one of the last of the
free-spirited cowboys as big business begins to ruthlessly
assimilate small cattle ranches, is a dangerous live wire. The
movie's period color (it's set in northeastern New Mexico) is
accentuated by an evocative late-'40s country-and-western
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: The film devotes far too much time to a romantic
triangle and not enough to the social climate and ranching culture,
which it begins to explore but then drops. As the married local
siren who drives men crazy, Ms. Arquette looks terrific but has no
animal magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   `Down in the Delta'
</P>
<P>
   The directorial debut of the poet Maya Angelou is the story of
an inner-city Chicago family that is saved from disintegration when
its stern but loving matriarch (Mary Alice) sends her daughter
(Alfre Woodard) and two grandchildren to her brother's spacious
rural homestead in the Mississippi delta.
</P>
<P>
   PLUSES: Mary Alice and Al Freeman Jr., who play the wise old
grandmother and her equally strong and wise brother, give
penetrating performances full of sorrow and wisdom. And Esther
Rolle, who died in November, is touching as the brother's wife
afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   MINUSES: The story is unabashedly sentimental, and the
characters' troubles are softened. Their profound healing once they
leave the city comes too quickly and easily for much dramatic
tension to build.

MILLENNIUM FANATICS ALREADY MAKING EVE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before you forget this New Year's Eve _ or try to remember it,
for that matter _ put your party hat back on and start cogitating.
The turn of the cosmic odometer to the year 2000 has already
spurred a mind-jarring panoply of plans for global one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the third millennium does not officially
begin until Jan. 1, 2001, the serious groundwork is being laid for
next Dec. 31 _ when once-in-a-lifetime celebrations from the Fiji
Islands to Faneuil Hall will welcome in the next thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   So dust off those cobwebs and get to it. Travel agents say the
time to start planning is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are thinking about going anywhere, they should call
us soon, even Monday,'' said Michael Sprague, director of leisure
sales for Garber Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the urgency, Sprague said, is that once airlines begin
booking for New Year's Eve destinations, the seats are expected to
sell quickly. And even though many of those reservations cannot be
made until February, Sprague added, hotel and land packages can and
should be explored before then.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limited only by the size of one's budget.
The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston has tentatively booked a
four-night stay in its presidential suite for $100,000, an Air
France Concorde will take revelers around the world for $42,900,
and an Australian resort near the Great Barrier Reef will give the
well-heeled a bed for $4,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   And if you know Mike Gauthier of Libertyville, Ill. _ and even
if you don't _ an Internet invitation beckons one and all to drop
by his home starting at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone believes that the millennium will trigger the end
of the world, next New Year's Eve should stride toward midnight
much like any other. But don't tell that to the 3 million people
who are expected in Boston to celebrate a weekend-long First Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round numbers are very poetic numbers,'' said David Kessler,
executive administrator for the Center for Millennial Studies at
Boston University. ``A poet does not speak about 573 years. A poet
speaks about 1,000 years, a millennium _ and people listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round numbers have power over our imaginations. They're very
pregnant, and they're also very vague. You can attach just about
anything to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What most hoteliers and restaurateurs will attach to 2000 is big
dollar signs. Many of Boston's upscale destinations have yet to
decide what their millennium experience will cost, preferring
instead for competitors to ``set the bar'' for price and amenities,
according to Pat Moscaritolo, executive director of the Greater
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   One premier Boston setting that has taken a wait-and-see stance
is the Top of the Hub, where general manager Raphael Oliver already
is stockpiling champagne that he expects to become scarcer and more
expensive as 1999 rolls along.
</P>
<P>
   Even the band he booked for Thursday night wants five times as
much for next New Year's Eve, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can work something out in conjunction with a city
event,'' Oliver said. ``I've called the Bay Tower Room, Boston
Harbor Hotel and the Meridien about their plans. They had no idea
yet, but they knew it would be breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the snags in making early plans is airline availability.
Sprague, of Garber Travel, said that airlines generally will not
take reservations for next New Year's Eve until mid-February. So,
unless one is willing to roll the dice and guarantee a land package
without an airline reservation, the booking crunch will not occur
for about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But when it does, tourism officials expect airline seats to go
fast. The crush ``may be like when the rock stars come in and
tickets go on sale,'' Moscaritolo predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague advised travelers to call their agents next week, chat
about possibilities, and add their names to waiting lists for
airline reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The options are boundless. The Sheraton in Fiji, for example, is
touting a chance to be among the first human beings to usher in the
millennium. Limited to 100 people, the experience begins at the
resort with a lunch brunch on Dec. 31, a special charter flight to
the island of Rambi, and a cruise aboard a ``circus boat'' that
will cross the international date line, or 180th meridian, exactly
at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyramids in Egypt also will be host to a party, as will
Times Square in New York, of course, where 1 million people are
expected to watch the famous ball drop in a celebration broadcast
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest festival may unfold in the low desert in the extreme
southeastern corner of California. There, according to Party 2000
co-founder Michael Johnson, 2.5 million people from around the
globe are predicted to turn 5 square miles ``in the middle of
nowhere'' into one of the American West's largest cities for five
days.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40 of the world's top bands have been invited,
Johnson said, to provide 18-hours-a-day entertainment on five of
the largest stages ever built for a single event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we are putting this together so that when
people leave Party 2000 on Jan. 1, they'll know that they have been
at the party of the world,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The options are also human-scale. On a list of millennium
parties compiled on the Internet, a group of South Africans is
inviting people to join a desert camping trip. ``Detail of the
exact longitude and latitude will follow shortly,'' the listing
reads. ``Bring lots of water. It's going to be VERY HOT.''
</P>
<P>
   Most millennium planning is geared toward the festive, but 4
million tourists and pilgrims are expected in the Holy Land next
year. And 13 million travelers are predicted to visit Rome in what
Pope John Paul II has declared to be a Jubilee Year.
</P>
<P>
   One thousand years ago, many Christians in Western Europe are
believed to have watched the approach of the millennium with dread.
The Apocalypse is associated with the millennium for many, and the
end of the world was considered a real possibility for them in the
year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered predictions of global catastrophe also have surfaced
for the year 2000. But the ancient images of the Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse have been replaced for many people by the
possibility of a Y2K computer meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Raucous or religious, the next New Year's Eve promises to be
indelibly memorable. And to some thinking, it could carry some
weight for the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Millennial Center director Richard Landes
interviewed a man who has claimed space on Jerusalem's Mount of
Olives in preparation for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   If the world is about to end, the man was asked, why do you need
to be in Jerusalem instead of anywhere else on the globe? The
response: ``If I want to get up to the top floor of a building, I'm
going to stand in front of the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, cancel those tickets to Fiji.

LAST-MINUTE PHILANTHROPY HAS TAX-PLANNING MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US stock market's strong recovery in the last months of 1998
prompted a flurry of charitable giving in December, as ordinary
investors rushed to blend warm-hearted philanthropic motivations
with the cold calculus of year-end tax planning.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence from national charities and gift-making
organizations Thursday suggested moderate to major increases in
donations before the New Year, when investors who feel financially
flush traditionally make contributions that can lead to a
wallet-fattening tax write-off come April.
</P>
<P>
   At The Jimmy Fund in Boston, staffers manned the phones from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m this week, fielding calls from people seeking to help
cancer research as well as secure a lesser tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very busy,'' said Fund spokeswoman Karen Cummings.
``It's more than last year. People are giving bigger gifts. And
there are more tribute gifts in the names of people who have
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services professionals said Wall Street's year-end
upswing after months of volatility was partly to credit for the
increase in giving. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, the broadest
measure of the stock market, closed Thursday up 27 percent for 1998
_ an unprecedented fourth year in a row of 20 percent-plus gains.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts are as much about the giver as the recipient, and
charitable donations are no exception. The market's robust returns
left Americans more flush with wealth _ and more anxious about the
tax consequences of all that cash and equity. While the two
feelings traditionally merge and grow in December, when charity
coffers swell on last-minute gifts before the new tax year sets,
donations _ and tax angst _ seemed a bit greater in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer at CARE's toll-free number said that 20 percent to
30 percent of year-end contributions were motivated by tax
planning, slightly more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Way of Massachusetts Bay, communications director
Carmen Fields said last year was a banner year, with the agency set
to meet its target of nearly $48 million, an annual increase of 10
percent. ``We don't ask people why they're giving, but this is the
time of year when taxes are on the fore of people's minds,'' Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners said clients whose stock portfolios swelled
in recent months were using increasingly complex methods to benefit
both charities and themselves. J. Michael Martin, a financial
adviser in Ellicott City, Md., said he had one husband and wife
team each withdraw $100,000 from their Individual Retirement
Accounts, a taxable action. They each then awarded various
charities $100,000 in appreciated stock from another account _ a
tax-free move that saved them each about $40,000 that helped offset
the taxable IRA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors seek to dump underperforming shares by giving
them to charity and taking the loss but offsetting the taxable gain
_ an often unwanted gift. Martin said one client rebalanced his
portfolio and won a tax break by donating a large portion of his
shares in railway concern Norfolk &AMP; Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, where an Internal Revenue Service study
showed residents to be among the stingiest givers in the nation,
donations swelled in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments' Charitable Gift Fund, one of the
largest gift-making organizations in the nation, president Cynthia
L. Egan said 40 percent of last year's $530 million in donations
came in December alone, an increase of 16 percent on 1997's level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax planning is an important part of fueling charitable giving
at the year-end, but we also see surges in grant-making requests
when certain events, like Hurricane Mitch and Georges, happen,''
Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay, chief executive
Patricia Deacon said the past 90 days had been quite busy. ``It is
the season for many reasons,'' she said. `And we have had more
gifts of stock this year than ever before.'' Contributions through
stock gifts had nearly doubled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some investors, heady on expectations of gains both in
the market and before the taxman, apparently forget that charitable
donations actually cost money. ``The tax savings is always less
than what you give,'' said Martin, the financial planner. ``People
always forget this.''

 &HT;    Veteran's push to smoke indoors draws fire
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Palm Beach County planner who is
demanding permission to smoke in his workplace has health
professionals fuming over what they regard as a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Holloway can find better ways to relieve the post-traumatic
stress he has suffered since the Vietnam War, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent among the opposition is the psychiatrist who treated
Holloway at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I have been quoted as saying in any way condones or
supports smoking on the job,'' Dr. Frederick Leppien, of the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, 54, has offered county officials a letter written by
Leppien as evidence that because of his stress, his fear of
harassment and his tendency to startle easily, he should be
permitted to light up inside his office building. But the letter
makes no mention of smoking and argues only that Holloway be given
an ``area to work in relative privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to discuss the Holloway case specifically because
of patient-physician confidentiality, Leppien says it is his
practice to encourage smokers to quit _ not to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refer patients to the smoking cessation program we have here
(at the VA hospital),'' Leppien said. ``We have group therapy. We
have medications. We have alternative methods of stress control. We
have many weapons _ many tricks up our sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   None of them, Leppien says, involves telling people to smoke to
treat their psychiatric ills.
</P>
<P>
   A health policy planner for nine years, Holloway suffers from
skin and prostate cancer besides the post-traumatic stress. He
wants the county to make an exception to its 1993 rule that follows
the Florida Clean Indoor Air Act and seeks to move all smoking at
government buildings outside.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway says he will be subjected to the harassment of
nonsmokers if he is required to smoke outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Medical professionals aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to respond to this without expletives,'' said Dr.
John Hildreth, former president of the American Heart Association
in Florida. ``He needs to take his smoking out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Vallo, director of disease prevention programs for the
American Lung Society in Palm Beach County, believes too much
progress has been made in cleaning the air to take a step backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep getting more and more information about the problems
that second-hand smoke causes,'' Vallo said. ``Smoke doesn't know
to stay in one particular part of a building. There's no reason to
expose other people to his health hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Holly Hadley, a primary care physician in Jupiter, believes
Holloway's arguments are ``unsupportable and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make special exceptions for people to
smoke inside just because they don't like the glances they get
outside,'' Hadley said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Kosten, president of the American Academy of
Addiction Psychiatry in Prairie Village, Kan., said it is possible
to treat post-traumatic stress and nicotine addiction
simultaneously with medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zyban, for example, is an antidepressant that can be used to
help people quit smoking,'' Kosten said. ``Smoking and
post-traumatic stress are difficult problems that often go
hand-in-hand. But you can work on them at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leppien, himself a Vietnam veteran who served in the Army for 10
years, says he has treated hundreds of post-traumatic stress
patients in the last decade. He believes in treating addictions and
anxieties together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I take the total package approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway has one supporter in a high place _ the 12th floor to
be exact, county Commissioner Carol Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   An unrepentant smoker, Roberts is known to enjoy her cigarettes
in her office and has expressed empathy for Holloway's position.
What to do about Roberts' transgression of county rules is
something no one is eager or fully prepared to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking in the building is a violation of policy and that
would be something the county administration would deal with,''
said Howard J. Falcon III, an assistant county attorney. ``We
wouldn't be involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner, Roberts is a ranking and elected part of that
county administration. Perhaps she would have to order herself to
stop.

 &HT;    Big stocks post big gains
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market ended a year of volatile trading on
Thursday, having rebounded from its worst sell-off in eight years
to post record-setting gains.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned, however, an historic fourth straight year of
high, double-digit growth for two major stock indexes failed to
reflect the weakness of a market deeply divided between big winners
and smaller losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. stock market was nowhere near as strong as the gains
of the big-cap averages and Internet stocks indicate,'' said
analyst Michael Flament of Wright Investors' Service.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, two of the indexes by which markets are commonly
measured recorded their fourth straight year of 20 percent-plus
annual growth: 39.6 percent for the technology-loaded Nasdaq
composite and 26.7 percent for the diversified Standard &AMP; Poor's
500.
</P>
<P>
   And while the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average failed to
match that record, its gain of 16.1 percent would be regarded as
impressive any other time in market history.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalized stocks
declined 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Big stocks, with their proven track record, were attractive to
safety-conscious domestic and foreign investors in a nervous market
last year, explained A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons strategist Anthony
O'Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the year's dichotomy in stock performance, O'Bryan said
1998 was ``certainly not a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is complaining, since so few expected the market to go
up this much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, 1998 was an historic year, an amalgam of
foreign economic weakness and domestic strength, minimal inflation,
falling interest rates, declining bond yields, robust consumer
spending and the biggest corporate mergers on record.
</P>
<P>
   The downside was marked by the first decline in corporate
profits since 1991, during the third quarter. This was followed by
a host of warnings by companies of continued profit weakness in the
final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones industrials have
pre-announced a shortfall in fourth-quarter 1998 expectations,''
said Charles L. Hill, research director of Boston-based First Call,
which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most surprising events were the impeachment of
President Clinton and the related shrinking of Republican power in
Congress. So far, neither event has hurt the market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the resumption of air strikes against Iraq for
failing to cooperate with U.N.-mandated arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign events generally dominated Wall Street's attention
this year, and it was Russia's debt default and currency
devaluation that triggered the biggest stock market correction
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Small in and of itself, that event came on top of accumulated
global distress. And in the presence of a frothy stock market, it
accelerated the decline of an already falling market. On its worst
day, Aug. 31, the Dow lost 513 points.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow declined just short of 20 percent during the
correction, the Nasdaq composite dropped 30 percent and a majority
of all stocks dropped more than 20 percent _ prompting some
analysts to call it a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, concerned about the turn of events, ended
the correction by cutting interest rates on Sept. 29. That restored
investor confidence that the economy would not suffer a recession
and renewed hopes of future profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the market posted a spectacular rally that
gained momentum when the Fed cut interest rates again in October
and in November.
</P>
<P>
   The late rally left Wall Street gurus with a dilemma, however.
It restored the high stock market valuations they had feared so
much prior to the correction.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think the high prices in relation to earnings
makes the market vulnerable to a sell-off in 1999, although few
anticipate one as steep as last summer's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins assigns only a
50-50 chance the Dow will suffer a correction of as much as 9
percent to 11 percent in the year ahead. He and most analysts are
confident the bull market will continue in the year ahead against
the backdrop of a slowing, but recession-free economy.

paper wealth. It was a time when the stock market staged as abrupt
and stunning a turnaround as any in recent memory. It was the final
three months of 1998, a three-month period that left many
professionals rubbing their eyes in disbelief. By Kenneth N.
Gilpin.

LAST-MINUTE PHILANTHROPY HAS TAX-PLANNING MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The US stock market's strong recovery in the last months of 1998
prompted a flurry of charitable giving in December, as ordinary
investors rushed to blend warm-hearted philanthropic motivations
with the cold calculus of year-end tax planning.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence from national charities and gift-making
organizations Thursday suggested moderate to major increases in
donations before the New Year, when investors who feel financially
flush traditionally make contributions that can lead to a
wallet-fattening tax write-off come April.
</P>
<P>
   At The Jimmy Fund in Boston, staffers manned the phones from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m this week, fielding calls from people seeking to help
cancer research as well as secure a lesser tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very busy,'' said Fund spokeswoman Karen Cummings.
``It's more than last year. People are giving bigger gifts. And
there are more tribute gifts in the names of people who have
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services professionals said Wall Street's year-end
upswing after months of volatility was partly to credit for the
increase in giving. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, the broadest
measure of the stock market, closed Thursday up 27 percent for 1998
_ an unprecedented fourth year in a row of 20 percent-plus gains.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts are as much about the giver as the recipient, and
charitable donations are no exception. The market's robust returns
left Americans more flush with wealth _ and more anxious about the
tax consequences of all that cash and equity. While the two
feelings traditionally merge and grow in December, when charity
coffers swell on last-minute gifts before the new tax year sets,
donations _ and tax angst _ seemed a bit greater in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer at CARE's toll-free number said that 20 percent to
30 percent of year-end contributions were motivated by tax
planning, slightly more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Way of Massachusetts Bay, communications director
Carmen Fields said last year was a banner year, with the agency set
to meet its target of nearly $48 million, an annual increase of 10
percent. ``We don't ask people why they're giving, but this is the
time of year when taxes are on the fore of people's minds,'' Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners said clients whose stock portfolios swelled
in recent months were using increasingly complex methods to benefit
both charities and themselves. J. Michael Martin, a financial
adviser in Ellicott City, Md., said he had one husband and wife
team each withdraw $100,000 from their Individual Retirement
Accounts, a taxable action. They each then awarded various
charities $100,000 in appreciated stock from another account _ a
tax-free move that saved them each about $40,000 that helped offset
the taxable IRA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors seek to dump underperforming shares by giving
them to charity and taking the loss but offsetting the taxable gain
_ an often unwanted gift. Martin said one client rebalanced his
portfolio and won a tax break by donating a large portion of his
shares in railway concern Norfolk &AMP; Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, where an Internal Revenue Service study
showed residents to be among the stingiest givers in the nation,
donations swelled in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments' Charitable Gift Fund, one of the
largest gift-making organizations in the nation, president Cynthia
L. Egan said 40 percent of last year's $530 million in donations
came in December alone, an increase of 16 percent on 1997's level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax planning is an important part of fueling charitable giving
at the year-end, but we also see surges in grant-making requests
when certain events, like Hurricane Mitch and Georges, happen,''
Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay, chief executive
Patricia Deacon said the past 90 days had been quite busy. ``It is
the season for many reasons,'' she said. `And we have had more
gifts of stock this year than ever before.'' Contributions through
stock gifts had nearly doubled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some investors, heady on expectations of gains both in
the market and before the taxman, apparently forget that charitable
donations actually cost money. ``The tax savings is always less
than what you give,'' said Martin, the financial planner. ``People
always forget this.''

<P>
   A wintry mixture will plague the Plains on Friday as two centers
of low pressure emerge from the Rocky Mountains. A swath of snow
will occur from the Dakotas southeastward to northern Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The snow will become heavy in some areas during the afternoon as
strengthening breezes from the south overrun a deep cold layer near
the ground. To the south, a treacherous combination of sleet and
freezing rain will affect areas from northeastern Oklahoma to
western Kentucky, with significant ice accumulations possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and thunderstorms will develop in the southern Mississippi
Valley. An organized squall line of strong thunderstorms will
develop late in the day near Louisiana as a jet-stream disturbance
passes over the area.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly weather will continue over the Great Lakes and Northeast.
A reinforcing blast of arctic air will enter interior New England
on Friday afternoon, accompanied by snow showers which will coat
the ground in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine will occur in the coastal areas of southern New
England and the Middle Atlantic, though temperatures will remain 5
to 10 degrees below average. The southern Atlantic seaboard,
including Florida, will be mainly sunny and seasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Some snow will fall in the central and southern Rockies while
much of the Intermountain region experiences breaking clouds and
seasonal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest will be dry as an upper-level ridge of
high pressure develops over the area. California will be mainly
sunny and dry with mild temperatures in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warm Memories
</P>
<P>
   The calendar year 1998 was a year of warm memories. The average
temperature across the earth's surface was the highest measured
since records began in the mid-19th century. Each of the first 10
months of the year was warmer than any previous such month on
record. An important contribution to the record-setting
temperatures was El Nino, an anomalous warming of the equatorial
eastern Pacific Ocean which reached its peak in March. Although El
Nino faded by early summer, the warmth it had transferred to the
atmosphere lingered for much of the year.

WALKER HANCOCK, SCULPTED PRESIDENTS, HEROES; AT 97 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes copyright line)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walker Hancock, a sculptor who spent his long career ``ennobling
the human figure,'' died Wednesday in his Gloucester, Mass. home.
He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hancock's work included statues of Douglas MacArthur at the
US Military Academy at West Point, John Paul Jones in Fairmount
Park in Philadelphia, and James Madison in the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He also created the bust of President Bush in the US Capitol
rotunda, inaugural medals for President Eisenhower, and was one of
several sculptors who worked on the memorial to Confederate war
heroes in Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock has spent his life ennobling the human figure,'' Globe
art critic Christine Temin wrote in a story published on Aug. 16
last year. ``He has sculpted the great and the good, Robert Frost
to Thomas Jefferson, along with the kids in his neighborhood and
the gods of ancient myth. He gave equal dignity to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hancock was born in St. Louis. He got his first commission
for a World War I memorial at a local high school when he was 18.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, at the age of 19, he made a pilgrimage to Gloucester to
meet his idol, portrait sculptor Charles Grafly. He lost his nerve
at Grafly's doorstep, but enrolled in Grafly's class at the
Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Grafly invited to him to live and work with him in Gloucester in
1930. Mr. Hancock for the most part resided in Gloucester for the
next 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in the Army as a member of a unit
that retrieved artwork the Nazis had looted and hidden.
</P>
<P>
   For several years in the 1960s, he was lead sculptor on the
gigantic Stone Mountain Memorial, a 69-foot-high granite bas relief
depicting Confederate heroes on a rocky hill outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Though known throughout the world as an artist, in the
Lanesville neighborhood of Gloucester he was known as an unassuming
neighbor and friend who allowed generations of youngsters to swim
in his quarry while he worked. ``He was a very sweet man who will
be missed by many people,'' his longtime cook, Gloria Parsons, said
in a story published in the Gloucester Times.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a daughter, Deane Hancock French of Buckland, Mass.;
and two grandchildren.

MILLENNIUM FANATICS ALREADY MAKING EVE PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes copyright line)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before you forget this New Year's Eve _ or try to remember it,
for that matter _ put your party hat back on and start cogitating.
The turn of the cosmic odometer to the year 2000 has already
spurred a mind-jarring panoply of plans for global one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the third millennium does not officially
begin until Jan. 1, 2001, the serious groundwork is being laid for
next Dec. 31 _ when once-in-a-lifetime celebrations from the Fiji
Islands to Faneuil Hall will welcome in the next thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   So dust off those cobwebs and get to it. Travel agents say the
time to start planning is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are thinking about going anywhere, they should call
us soon, even Monday,'' said Michael Sprague, director of leisure
sales for Garber Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the urgency, Sprague said, is that once airlines begin
booking for New Year's Eve destinations, the seats are expected to
sell quickly. And even though many of those reservations cannot be
made until February, Sprague added, hotel and land packages can and
should be explored before then.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are limited only by the size of one's budget.
The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Boston has tentatively booked a
four-night stay in its presidential suite for $100,000, an Air
France Concorde will take revelers around the world for $42,900,
and an Australian resort near the Great Barrier Reef will give the
well-heeled a bed for $4,000 per person.
</P>
<P>
   And if you know Mike Gauthier of Libertyville, Ill. _ and even
if you don't _ an Internet invitation beckons one and all to drop
by his home starting at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone believes that the millennium will trigger the end
of the world, next New Year's Eve should stride toward midnight
much like any other. But don't tell that to the 3 million people
who are expected in Boston to celebrate a weekend-long First Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round numbers are very poetic numbers,'' said David Kessler,
executive administrator for the Center for Millennial Studies at
Boston University. ``A poet does not speak about 573 years. A poet
speaks about 1,000 years, a millennium _ and people listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Round numbers have power over our imaginations. They're very
pregnant, and they're also very vague. You can attach just about
anything to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What most hoteliers and restaurateurs will attach to 2000 is big
dollar signs. Many of Boston's upscale destinations have yet to
decide what their millennium experience will cost, preferring
instead for competitors to ``set the bar'' for price and amenities,
according to Pat Moscaritolo, executive director of the Greater
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   One premier Boston setting that has taken a wait-and-see stance
is the Top of the Hub, where general manager Raphael Oliver already
is stockpiling champagne that he expects to become scarcer and more
expensive as 1999 rolls along.
</P>
<P>
   Even the band he booked for Thursday night wants five times as
much for next New Year's Eve, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can work something out in conjunction with a city
event,'' Oliver said. ``I've called the Bay Tower Room, Boston
Harbor Hotel and the Meridien about their plans. They had no idea
yet, but they knew it would be breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the snags in making early plans is airline availability.
Sprague, of Garber Travel, said that airlines generally will not
take reservations for next New Year's Eve until mid-February. So,
unless one is willing to roll the dice and guarantee a land package
without an airline reservation, the booking crunch will not occur
for about six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But when it does, tourism officials expect airline seats to go
fast. The crush ``may be like when the rock stars come in and
tickets go on sale,'' Moscaritolo predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague advised travelers to call their agents next week, chat
about possibilities, and add their names to waiting lists for
airline reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The options are boundless. The Sheraton in Fiji, for example, is
touting a chance to be among the first human beings to usher in the
millennium. Limited to 100 people, the experience begins at the
resort with a lunch brunch on Dec. 31, a special charter flight to
the island of Rambi, and a cruise aboard a ``circus boat'' that
will cross the international date line, or 180th meridian, exactly
at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyramids in Egypt also will be host to a party, as will
Times Square in New York, of course, where 1 million people are
expected to watch the famous ball drop in a celebration broadcast
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest festival may unfold in the low desert in the extreme
southeastern corner of California. There, according to Party 2000
co-founder Michael Johnson, 2.5 million people from around the
globe are predicted to turn 5 square miles ``in the middle of
nowhere'' into one of the American West's largest cities for five
days.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 40 of the world's top bands have been invited,
Johnson said, to provide 18-hours-a-day entertainment on five of
the largest stages ever built for a single event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we are putting this together so that when
people leave Party 2000 on Jan. 1, they'll know that they have been
at the party of the world,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The options are also human-scale. On a list of millennium
parties compiled on the Internet, a group of South Africans is
inviting people to join a desert camping trip. ``Detail of the
exact longitude and latitude will follow shortly,'' the listing
reads. ``Bring lots of water. It's going to be VERY HOT.''
</P>
<P>
   Most millennium planning is geared toward the festive, but 4
million tourists and pilgrims are expected in the Holy Land next
year. And 13 million travelers are predicted to visit Rome in what
Pope John Paul II has declared to be a Jubilee Year.
</P>
<P>
   One thousand years ago, many Christians in Western Europe are
believed to have watched the approach of the millennium with dread.
The Apocalypse is associated with the millennium for many, and the
end of the world was considered a real possibility for them in the
year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered predictions of global catastrophe also have surfaced
for the year 2000. But the ancient images of the Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse have been replaced for many people by the
possibility of a Y2K computer meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Raucous or religious, the next New Year's Eve promises to be
indelibly memorable. And to some thinking, it could carry some
weight for the hereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Millennial Center director Richard Landes
interviewed a man who has claimed space on Jerusalem's Mount of
Olives in preparation for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   If the world is about to end, the man was asked, why do you need
to be in Jerusalem instead of anywhere else on the globe? The
response: ``If I want to get up to the top floor of a building, I'm
going to stand in front of the elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, cancel those tickets to Fiji.

`PORT DJEMA': A GUNSHOT, A RIDDLE AND A HEART OF GOLD
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes at end of review.) (DW) 
 By ANITA GATES  
c.1999   N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eric Heumann has a way with violence. In his new
film, ``Port Djema,'' the sound of a single gunshot on the nearly
empty streets of an African town is absolutely horrifying. Heumann
conveys a suddenness and an immediacy to the gunfire that the
average Hollywood action thriller, with thousands of rounds of
ammunition, can't achieve. ``Port Djema'' has a great sense of the
sinister; too bad the rest of it is so shapeless.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), a French surgeon with better
things to do, travels to Port Djema, a fictional African nation,
because he made a promise to a dear friend, a doctor who was
recently killed there. The promise was to locate one particular
child and see that he was cared for. The film purports to have a
plot, but it's only a riddle (who is the mystery child?),
introduced briefly and almost immediately solved and tossed away.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierre does set out on the search, in the middle of the
country's ethnic civil war, with the child's photograph in hand. In
the process he meets a woman who photographs the shadows of palm
trees (Nathalie Boutefeu), deals with corruption and
life-threatening hostility and comes face to face with the
country's desperate need for medical care, particularly for the
children. Will Pierre stay and help or get out while the getting's
good? The suspense about this decision lasts two minutes at most.
</P>
<P>
   Heumann, a producer of films like ``Indochine'' and ``Ulysses'
Gaze,'' directed ``Port Djema'' and was one of its writers, along
with Jacques Lebas, a French doctor. From 1988 to 1991, Lebas ran a
humanitarian medical organization that did work in Lebanon,
Cambodia, Romania and what was then the Soviet Union. He has said
that one of the purposes of the film is to transmit ``something of
the questions raised by contacts with the world's wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Port Djema'' doesn't go nearly deep enough into its characters
or its situations for real insight, but it does have some lovely,
artful cinematography and a heart of gold.
</P>

EUROPEAN UNION INTRODUCES SINGLE CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The most ambitious effort yet to create a united states
of Europe began at midnight Thursday when the euro, the continent's
new single currency, was born in 11 of the European Union's 15
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially launched Friday, the euro will begin its
maiden voyage through the computers of European banks and
corporations on Monday, when all businesses start trading in it and
bank and credit card transactions can be recorded in it.
</P>
<P>
   Euro coins and bills will not begin to circulate until Jan. 1,
2002. Six months later, national currencies become void.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of the euro was celebrated Thursday at the European
Union's headquarters in Brussels in a display that mixed the
solemnity of a corporate board meeting with the festiveness of a
Super Bowl halftime show. After the finance ministers from the 11
countries formally locked their currencies together and made
speeches about the historic nature of the day, schoolchildren
released thousands of blue balloons with the ``e'' symbol that will
represent the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, some 50,000 financial service specialists
across Europe will work around the clock to ready computer systems
for the changeover before the markets open Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The raison d'etre for monetary union is strength in numbers by
consolidating separate economies into a huge, competitive market.
Exchange rate fluctuations disappear. Manufacturers and retailers
are forced to simplify byzantine pricing, where the amount paid for
the same product can vary wildly from country to country. Trading
across national borders becomes easier. Mergers, once uncommon in
Europe, increase as former rivals seek to cut overhead and
capitalize on the new market.
</P>
<P>
   From Ireland to Italy, the euro has suddenly become a reality.
Monetary union is now the ultimate challenge for some 290 million
Europeans who must put aside language and cultural differences to
form one cohesive economic and political bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ireland and Italy, the euro became the official currency
today in Austria, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Finland,
Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Greece wanted to be among
those launching the euro but was unable to reduce its debt and
interest rates enough to qualify for membership. Three other
countries _ Britain, Sweden, and Denmark _ chose not to participate
largely because of concerns about loss of monetary control.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of Europe, the euro is already part of the
landscape. In Paris, open-air markets post prices of produce in
euros and francs. Fashionable restaurants from Barcelona to Vienna
have included euro prices on their menu for months.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyons is one of those whose life changed irrevocably at
midnight. On Monday, when he arrives at his Allied Irish Bank
office in Dublin, he will turn on his computer terminal and begin a
new career as a euro banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world,'' said Lyons, who seems more excited
than intimidated by the most sweeping change in European daily life
since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else who works in the financial services industry
in Europe, Lyons has trained to handle the new currency. But he
believes that the change is more historic than commercial. ``We're
all champing at the bit to get going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro will consume Lyons's professional life, his wife,
Denise, will barely notice its integration into daily life over the
next three years, except when she is handed a receipt at their
local supermarket listing what she spends in both Irish punts and
euros.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the euro is meant to cement European
integration, which has solidified incrementally over the last 40
years. But it also has unwittingly illustrated national differences
that cannot simply be wished away.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese, for example, complained bitterly when the
initial image of the continent minted on the euro coin didn't show
their border with Spain. While the European Central Bank relented
and minted a new coin, the euro is meant nonetheless to blur
economic, political, and, perhaps most importantly, psychological
borders within Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The integration process began in 1958, when the visionary French
diplomat Jean Monnet dreamed up the European Economic Community,
later to become the European Union, to create a single economic
bloc to rival the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But Monnet's plan was not just about money. It was also about
ending war among Europeans. Monnet's plan was to replace the narrow
and often belligerent nationalism that had pervaded the continent
with a more enlightened form of regionalism based on mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatism of Monnet and the other founders of a united
Europe was born in part from the suffering endured on a continent
that has crumbled twice this century from world wars. ``You can't
eat a flag,'' said John Hume, the Nobel Peace laureate from
Northern Ireland who is among the most enthusiastic of Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for membership in this new economic bloc, the 11
countries have ceded one of the core powers of the modern nation:
the ability to set interest rates and monetary policy. Those
decisions are now the domain of the European Central Bank based in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that the single currency will further balkanize rich
and poor parts of Europe rather than spread the wealth around. As
in the United States, recession here is regional. Northern Europe
is faring better than the south.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries on the peripheries of Euroland, Ireland and
Italy, offer an illustration. Despite having just 3.5 million
people, the Republic of Ireland is second only to the United States
in its exports of software, and it has been Europe's most vibrant
economy for several years. Italy barely qualified for monetary
union because of a lagging economy that suffers from 12 percent
unemployment and an undereducated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts also worry about Italy's ability to maintain
the discipline necessary to survive in the new euro club. Budget
deficits, for example, are to run no higher than 3 percent of a
country's gross domestic product. Less than three months before the
single currency was launched, Massimo D'Alema became Italy's prime
minister _ the first former communist to lead a Western European
government. At issue is whether he has the political will to keep
public spending such as social welfare programs in line with the
strictures of monetary union.
</P>
<P>
   Questions also surround the two engines that have traditionally
driven European integration: Germany and France. Both countries are
now led by leftist governments that have not moved to slash the
generous benefits from their workers. In Germany, for example, many
workers receive six weeks of vacation each year. And their French
counterparts are notorious for striking at the slightest
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts within both countries and elsewhere emphasize that
Germany and France, like Italy, must wring concessions from the
public sector to foster the necessary austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers warn that Germany's record 11 percent unemployment
rate could get worse if the new government doesn't win concessions
from workers. They fear a strike to end all strikes if France is
forced to tighten its belt to conform with the requirements of
monetary union. Such concerns explain, in part, the wariness of
Britain about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the future path of Britain, Europe's second most
populous country after Germany, is only beginning. The incipient
public relations battle between those who want to join, such as
Prime Minister Tony Blair, and those who don't, like former prime
minister Margaret Thatcher, is expected to cost more than any
political campaign in British history. Thatcher, a ``Euroskeptic,''
speaks for many when she equates integration with surrender of
British sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The ceding of their national currencies is indeed the most
visceral gesture to date that Europeans have made toward closer
integration. Like the language one speaks, the money one carries
has always separated one European from another. Germans, for
example, feel nostalgic about the deutschemark, which has long been
the strongest currency in Europe. It remains the currency of choice
in areas such as the former Yugoslavia where local currencies are
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a silver mark aloft and admiring it like a glass of
wine, Franz Brandt, a waiter in a restaurant in Berlin's Europa
Center, said wistfully, ``I will miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure of the single currency would be disastrous. There are no
escape mechanisms should a country decide to bolt. Any failure
would probably turn Europeans against one another and destroy
monetary union as well as threaten the existing political comity.
But few business people expect such an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,700 years ago, the Roman emperor Diocletian established a
single currency in an attempt to unite his disparate subjects, only
to see it fall in one of Europe's many bouts of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans are cautiously optimistic that they can avoid the
fate of Diocletian's noble effort. At the very least, they hope
that the lifespan of the euro will be considerably longer than the
16 years that the emperor's single currency lasted in the third
century.

RUSH IS ON TO CONVERT SECURITIES TO EURO TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While American recover from their New Year's celebrations this
weekend computer programmers and finance specialists will be
engaged in a distinctly un-celebratory enterprise: Racing to
convert billions of dollars' worth of mutual fund holdings, trust
assets, and bank accounts from their original mark, franc, or lire
denominations into that of Europe's new currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Their deadline is Sunday evening. ``That's when the trading day
begins in the Far East,'' said Richard A. Heckinger, senior vice
president with Boston's State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the entire effort will make little difference to
the typical American, even if he or she owns financial securities
from the 11 countries involved in the giant currency conversion.
That is because most people have their holdings through mutual
funds, whose value is calculated in US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly means nothing is at stake in the conversion,
especially for a financial center like Boston. Any slip-up could
doom a company's _ and potentially even a city's _ reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get it right and you can't trade Jan. 4, you're
in big trouble,'' said an official with Putnam Investments in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the region's financial giants are pulling out all
the stops, commandeering thousands of computer programmers and
finance specialists to work around-the-clock to ensure the switch
goes off smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   State Street has 1,000 people scheduled to work at its primary
processing center in Quincy, Mass., as well as another 600 at
satellite facilities in Sydney, Hong Kong, Munich, Paris, and
London, according to Heckinger. As chief record-keeper for $4.5
trillion in assets, a substantial fraction of them from the
European countries involved, the company probably has more at stake
in the conversion than many other firm.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments, several hundred people will be working
to make sure assets like those in the $1.7 billion Fidelity Europe
fund are repriced in euros, according to senior vice president
Richard Spillane. A similar number have been called in by Putnam,
Fleet Financial Group, and BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spillane said one measure of the financial world's confidence
that the conversion will come off without a hitch is that European
and non-European investors have been making deals this week that
will not be settled until next week, something they would not do if
they thought the accounting system that keeps track of what they
bought or sold was about to break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty routine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the conversion to the euro does not seem that
complicated a task. ``Basically, you can just look at it as adding
another currency,'' said Charles M. Lewis, executive vice president
with Fleet Financial. But there are several complicating wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, while all stocks and government bonds from the 11
countries involved will be quoted and traded in euros starting
Monday, the same is not true of corporate bonds or deposit
accounts. European companies are not required to convert their
bonds to the new currency until 2002. Neither are individual
deposit holders.
</P>
<P>
   That means banks and financial firms that handle European
securities will have to operate a dual-currency system for the next
several years, one that records the value of assets using the old,
so-called legacy currencies and that also uses the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is the question of whether the new currency
will catch on sufficiently to supplant the German mark, French
franc, and Italian lire.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis at Fleet Financial predicts the new currency will get off
to a ``somewhat tenuous start'' but will eventually take hold,
adding that the bank will provide its clients with whatever
currency they choose to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to chart someone's destiny here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's up to the customer.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ They had to struggle a bit to open some
recalcitrant bottles of champagne, but finance ministers from 11
countries celebrated New Year's Eve Thursday by launching the euro
as the continent's new unified currency.
</P>
<P>
   In the last step after years of preparation, the countries
locked in the exchange rates of their individual currencies to the
euro, thereby setting the value at which the euro will begin
trading when financial markets open around the world on Monday.
Based on these rates, the euro will be worth about $1.17.
</P>
<P>
   In technical terms, the action taken Thursday was perfunctory
and anti-climactic _ nothing more than plugging in numbers
according to a formula. But in political and economic terms, it
represented the culmination of a effort first conceived in the
1950s as a means of unifying Europe and preventing another world
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand at the dawn of a new era in the integration of
Europe,'' said Rudolf Edlinger, Austria's finance minister and
chairman of the meeting here. ``Forty years of inexorable striving
toward integration has been crowned by the realization of economic
and monetary union.''
</P>
<P>
   The fixing of exchange rates also kicked off a frenzied scramble
by banks, stock exchanges and securities traders across Europe to
adapt their computer systems between now and Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the celebrations, there were clear signs of
continuing divisions over both economic policy and the levers of
power. German officials demanded that the European Central Bank,
which is now the equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, use
monetary policy to help boost employment and not focus simply on
fighting inflation _ a demand that has already created deep
animosity among other countries' central bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though euro notes and coins will not enter circulation
until Jan. 1, 2002, European banks and stock exchanges are now
required to carry out all non-cash transactions in euros.
</P>
<P>
   In London's financial center, more than 30,000 people will be
working through the weekend to reprogram computers and trading
systems on the basis of the currency values agreed upon Thursday.
Across Europe, banks are converting their systems to offer
euro-denominated bank accounts immediately for any customers who
want them.
</P>
<P>
   Though national currencies like the German mark and French franc
will remain in circulation until July 1, 2002, they will trade in
lockstep with the euro until they are phased out entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken Thursday was necessary to set the relative
values of participating countries' individual currencies before the
euro enters world financial markets. However, the values have been
more or less established for some time, because the monetary
policies of the countries have been yoked together since last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, exchange rates among European currencies
have varied little for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it turned out to be almost a formality, different
from what many of us expected just a year ago,'' remarked Wim
Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   To liven things up a bit, European officials capped off their
formal action Thursday by launching hundreds of balloons here with
blue and yellow euro markings. Finance ministers also posed for
pictures popping the ritual bottles of champagne, though some of
the bottles proved so balky that several finance ministers turned
red in the face as they wrestled with the corks.
</P>
<P>
   Champagne aside, most of those here Thursday focused their
attention on the great distance they had come and to predict that
Europe that would be bigger, stronger, more prosperous and more
peaceful as a result of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe will now have the wherewithal to direct its own
future,'' said Jacques Santer, president of the European
Commission. ``The euro is not an end in itself. It is an instrument
for economic development, social development. And now it is up to
us to use this instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's finance minister, said: ``Today
is clearly a historic day for the European enterprise. Europe will
be strong, stronger than in the past, because it will speak with a
single monetary voice.''

 BRUSSELS: monetary voice.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even on Thursday, there were signs of potential battles
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One hint came from Duisenberg, a former Dutch central banker who
was named president of the European Central Bank only after a
bitter political fight last May between France and Germany.
Duisenberg, a conservative on monetary policy, was favored by
Helmut Kohl, who was then chancellor of Germany. But President
Jacques Chirac of France insisted on the head of the Bank of
France, Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and France eventually cut a deal under which Duisenberg
would become president of the new Euroepan bank, but
``voluntarily'' agree to step down well ahead of the end of his
eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview published Wednesday in the French newspaper
Le Monde, Duisenberg indicated he might not quit after all. On
Thursday, he said he would not elaborate on that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg's seeming new stance comes as many political leaders
are pressuring the new central bank he heads to focus more on
stimulating growth and new jobs. Under the Maastricht Treaty that
set the ground rules for the euro, the bank is supposed to focus
exclusively on preserving stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg has been an outspoken defender of that mandate,
putting him on a collision course with Germany's new center-left
government under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine did not take part in the ceremonies Thursday,
pleading long-standing vacation plans. But his stand-in, Economics
Minister Werner Mueller, appealed for coordinated action among
European countries to increase job creation and for help from the
new central bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must now score tangible successes in the areas of
employment and growth,'' Mueller said. ``The European Central Bank
facilitates this not only by fulfilling its responsibilities for
stability. It can also, within the framework of its resources,
target itself toward the support of growth and employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller also called for ``coordinated'' wage policies between
countries that ``have a goal of greater employment success.'' That
echoed Lafontaine's calls for European countries to avoid
undercutting each other on labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Unity on economic policy will be difficult. In Britain, which is
staying outside the currency union for at least the next year or
two, some newspapers have demonized Lafontaine as a man who would
force Britain to abandon its comparatively laissez-faire policies.
</P>
<P>
   But France's Strauss-Kahn captured the thoughts of many here,
saying that European countries would gain self-determination by
having more strength in the face of global economic turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My profound conviction is that we will gain in sovereignty
rather than losing it by sharing it with others,'' he said.

   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia _ Liberated at last from a life of
revolution, two Khmer Rouge leaders came to this beach resort
Thursday with their families, their leisure wear and their
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   But their holiday was a drab one, spent mostly behind the dirty
brown curtains of their tiny hotel rooms, trapped inside by their
fear of a small group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, His Excellency wants to relax,'' an aide, Long
Norin, said, explaining the strange behavior of the former Khmer
Rouge head of state, Khieu Samphan, 67.
</P>
<P>
   Even the teen-age daughter and two teen-age granddaughters of
Nuon Chea, 71, the chief ideologue of the Khmer Rouge revolution,
spent the sunny afternoon in their darkened room watching a Thai
television station.
</P>
<P>
   After about six hours of this _ during which a waiter brought
seafood lunches to the two leaders' rooms _ and after reporters
assured an aide that they would be polite, the two men emerged,
said a few innocuous words and took a brief tour of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine; I just need to rest a little bit,'' Khieu Samphan
said as he walked past a plastic Santa Claus pasted to the hotel's
glass door. ``I have already said what I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rowdy news conference Tuesday, the two men had pleaded to
``let bygones be bygones'' but were overwhelmed by aggressive
questions about their roles as leaders of a brutal government that
caused more than 1 million deaths from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to start a riot!'' Nuon Chea exclaimed as
security men bundled him past reporters after the Tuesday news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was calmer Thursday at the three-story Seaside Hotel,
100 yards from the beach, where the hum of air conditioners was
almost the only sound in the empty courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun began to sink, sparkling off the sea, the old men
napped or watched television in their darkened rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The duty manager, Son Cha, said it was a little unusual but not
unheard-of that the group had spent the entire sunny afternoon
without going out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like to go out because they don't know how many
people like them and how many people don't like them,'' he said.
``But all the people don't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Son Cha noted that they had not tipped the bellboy when they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Dy Mary, 18, a receptionist, said she did not know too much
about her famous guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard their names in school, but I wasn't born yet when
those things happened,'' she said. ``I'm not angry at them because
they didn't do anything to me.'' She said her parents had told her
that the Khmer Rouge years had been difficult but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We welcome anyone to our hotel as long as they
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge tour of the city took a little more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In four vans escorted by two trucks of soldiers armed with
automatic weapons and rocket launchers, they drove past the beach,
through the pothole-riddled town center, into the port, out past
the beach again and back to their hotel and their $30 rooms adorned
with red plastic tulips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of changes,'' Khieu Samphan said of the
city. ``It makes me understand a lot of issues better, especially
visiting places I haven't seen in a long time.'' He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m. the holiday makers had eaten again, returned to their
rooms and turned on their tiny television sets in the silent and
half-empty hotel, awaiting the new year without celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A security man assigned by the government to accompany them said
they had had a better time on Wednesday when they toured the
capital, Phnom Penh, after being welcomed by Prime Minister Hun Sen
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their defections last Friday marked the collapse of the last
group of Khmer Rouge holdouts. But their official welcome and the
apparent decision by Hun Sen not to turn them over for trial has
raised questions about justice and impunity after one of history's
great atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the group drove past landmarks that had been
damaged by the Khmer Rouge, the wife of Nuon Chea, a talkative
woman, exclaimed, ``Oh, we shouldn't have done that,'' said the
security man, who insisted that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   He said Khieu Samphan replied, ``Oh, all that was done by
Comrade Son Sen,'' another top leader who was killed in June 1997
in a rift with the Khmer Rouge founder, Pol Pot, who himself died
in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The security man, who had become quite friendly with his
charges, said he then told the Khmer Rouge leaders, ``Cambodia
would have developed fast in 1975 if you had not killed so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ieng Sary, another high-ranking defector who was in the
car with them, replied, ``We made mistakes by going the Communist
route.''
</P>
<P>
   The guard said he himself then made a pun, playing on the word
``Communist,'' saying, ``Not all `kumunus' is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kumunus'' is the word in the Khmer language for ``revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He said everybody laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The guard said that like virtually all Cambodians of his
generation he had lost several family members in the years his new
friends had ruled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Did it not bother him to be joking with some of the top
architects of that bloodshed?
</P>
<P>
   The security man answered with another joke. ``Let bygones be
bygones,'' he said, and laughed.

   KISANGANI, Congo _ This city at a bend in the Congo River will
soon become the new rebel headquarters, in a move that concedes a
reality no one bothers to hide anymore: the rebellion may control
ever-growing chunks of Congo, but it remains deeply unpopular with
the people.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why. The other evening Sadiki Tabou, 33,
who washes cars for a living and does not make much anyway, was
reduced to planting a table-sized plot in an incongruous place:
next to Kisangani's port, which has been closed since the rebellion
began in August and is thus empty of the flour, dried fish, salt
and oil that normally float in huge barges up the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to get some work and eat two times a day,'' Tabou
said. ``But that's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' move to Kisangani _ closer to the center of Congo
than their current headquarters in Goma at the far eastern border _
is just one step they hope will help win the hearts and minds of
the Congolese people. Their failure to gain much support after
nearly five months, they increasingly acknowledge, has weighed down
their drive to oust President Laurent Kabila, who took office in
1997 after a similar war and is not very popular either.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba has been pushing
for a negotiated settlement to the war _ in part because he says he
is worried that certain elements of his own rebellion, particularly
soldiers, might forget their promises of democracy if they won by
military might alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be these limitations of the victors feeling like
they are the bosses, and nobody else should be around,'' Wamba dia
Wamba, president of the Congolese Rally for Democracy, said in an
interview. ``For us, the important thing, the crucial thing, is
political victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the rebels tried at first to minimize their popularity
problems, there has been no hiding it. They tried early on to reach
out to student groups and tribal leaders in the territory they now
hold _ perhaps a third of the country _ with minimal success.
</P>
<P>
   That failure, some experts say, has irritated Uganda, which
along with Rwanda is backing the rebels with troops and other
military support. There is much speculation that Uganda has become
friendly with a second rebel group, led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, a
businessman and son of one of Congo's richest men, looking to
broaden the appeal of the drive to overthrow Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, who has been hostile to the idea of a second
rebel force, said his group's plans included repairing the road
from Kisangani to Bunia, 350 miles northeast and across Lake Albert
from Uganda. That would provide work as well as create a route for
goods that have stopped coming upriver and now must arrive by air.
He said they were planning sanitation projects, mostly to provide
clean water.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have also been reaching out to other groups opposed
to Kabila. They appear to have forged a deal with a fierce but
fickle faction in eastern Congo: the Mayi-Mayi, a loose group of
perhaps thousands of warriors who have fought both for and against
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Mukendi, secretary-general for the Workers and Peasants
Movement of Congo, which purports to represent a large faction of
the Mayi-Mayi, said the rebellion needed to convince people that it
was a genuine force of Congolese people hungry for deep change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clean it _ dry and sunshine _ so it will smell good
again,'' said Mukendi, who _ oddly in the rain forests of Congo _
added that he had once worked as an organizer at Local 1199, the
hospital union in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He said that until now the rebellion had been too tightly
associated with its foreign backers, especially Rwanda. Rwandans
are strongly disliked in much of Congo, partly because of hostility
to the Tutsi ethnic group, which governs Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   More concretely, Mukendi said, many people hold Rwandan soldiers
responsible for much of the killing in the rebellion that brought
Kabila to power. In that fight the Rwandans and Ugandans backed
Kabila the same way they are backing his opponents now.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has bolstered his popularity by casting the rebellion as
an invasion by forces from Uganda and Rwanda. That widespread view
has helped draw in still more foreign soldiers _ from Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia and Chad _ to defend Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kisangani it is far from clear that the rebels' plans
are ambitious enough to win them much support. Timing is part of
the problem. The city, which residents say was looted when Kabila
took power, is not happy about another war. In addition, it was
easier for Kabila because he was fighting Mobutu Sese Seko, who had
ruled the country, then called Zaire, for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first war,'' Wamba dia Wamba said, ``all you have to do is
say, `Mobutu has to go.' Everybody says, `Hooray.' But the second
war you say, `Kabila has to go,' and they say, `Why didn't you give
him a chance?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, though, the war has brought tremendous
hardship to Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce has all but halted. Food prices have soared. Medicine
is hard to come by, said Dr. Soki Um-Lay, 42, medical director of
Kisangani's public hospital. He recently led a tour of the grounds,
passing first through a ward with 30 children suffering from
malnutrition, an affliction that he said had started only with the
current rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Several were soldiers' children. He stopped in intensive care to
talk with Garcon Mbale, 34, a former domestic worker who has wasted
away to near nothing and looked away when asked what was making him
sick. Um-Lay said the doctors had first assumed Mbale had AIDS.
``We tested him, and he doesn't,'' the doctor said. ``All he needs
is food.''

 &HT;    Millenium Bug could arrive early
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Millenium Bug that's expected to chew up
some of the world's computers on Jan. 1, 2000, could take a preview
bite out of some of them today, and on six other days later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite doomsday predictions, however, no emergency, or other
essential public services in the Austin area are expected to be
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that could develop today, and throughout the year,
are the same ones forecast for Jan. 1, 2000. They could arise early
because many computers have internal calendars which look ahead one
year.
</P>
<P>
   When computers afflicted with the Millenium Bug, which makes
them incapable of recognizing any year beginning with a number
other than 19, try looking ahead one year today, they could trip
over Jan. 1, 2000, and crash or spew erroneous data.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Austin has spent months testing and fixing computers
and computer chips involved in the delivery of public services, and
officials don't expect any problems today. But, to be on the safe
side, technicians at Austin's electric utility were on call last
night and will be again today, to manually keep electricity flowing
to homes and businesses if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can mobilize quickly if there's any problem,'' said Carol
Gittinger, the Austin utility's Y2K, or Year 2000, project
director. ``But we don't anticipate anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Georgetown, Round Rock and other area
municipalities said they also have prepared for potential problems
and expect no disruptions in their services.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Looney, the city of Austin's Y2K coordinator, said essential
city services, such as water, fire, police, and medical emergency
ambulances, shouldn't experience any problems today because most of
their computers have been fixed and tested to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin water department appears to be ready to keep water
flowing, and lifesaving equipment of the city's and county's
Emergency Medical Services will function properly. So will the fire
department, ``our star performer with all their systems certified
now,'' Looney said.
</P>
<P>
   Computers of the police department's 911 emergency system still
need some work, Looney said, but the worst that's expected to
happen to it is that a two-minute old incident report might be
mislabeled as two years old.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of hassle most experts expect to develop quietly
today, without fanfare, in, say, the computer cash registers or
accounting systems of some businesses that haven't completed Y2K
fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and governments, large and small, have devoted
millions of dollars and years of work to finding and fixing
year-date references in trillions of lines of computer code, but
some are farther along than others.
</P>
<P>
   The date references are found not only in software running cash
registers and on desktop and other computers, but in so-called
embedded computer chips studded throughout control systems for
manufacturing, transportation, security, gas and oil pipelines,
medical and other mechanical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Fixes by state agencies, for instance, are only 58 percent
completed, with 62,000 embedded chips left to be corrected,
according to Shannon Porterfield, the Y2K project director for
state government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility of some failures if (problems) haven't
been identified in advance testing,'' Porterfield said. ``Systems
won't necessarily crash. But you can get erroneous information. You
can have incorrect data and not know about it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would a computer that was not involved in accounting or
budgeting try to look ahead one year?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boyer, a University of Texas professor of computer science,
said many computers and chips may have been programmed to keep
running calendars of events pertinent to their past and future
operations. So they might decide to update themselves today by
including Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely calculating that date might cause some sort of data or
arithmetic overflow,'' Boyer said. ``It is hard to predict what the
consequences of an overflow error might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the year-date problem began at the dawn of digital
computing when memory was scarce and much more expensive than it is
today. Software programmers, faced with limited space, used only
the last two digits of a year. Some of the software has never been
changed and even new software may contain some references to the
old year-date scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Today's preview may not be the end of computer hassles this
year. For various reasons, experts say the bug could bite again at
least six times in1999: on April 4, July 1, Aug. 21, Sept. 1 and 9
and Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   April 4, for example, is the 99th day of the 99th year of the
20th century, which some early software was coded to regard as
``end of file,'' an order to shut down and await further
instructions. Sept. 9, likewise, is the 9th day of the 9th month of
the 99th year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (end of file orders) won't be relevant for every system,''
Porterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The other dates could be more problematic, for systems that have
not been fixed and tested, since some government and private
organizations begin their fiscal years on those days and their
computers will start budgeting into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For area residents wondering what might happen to their bank
accounts, grocery stores and other important services, Looney said
city officials are planning a series of public forums this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first one is scheduled Jan. 20 in city council chambers at
309 W. 2nd St., at a time to be announced later.

TERROR THREAT PROMPTS CLOSING OF U.S. EMBASSY IN TEL AVIV
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The U.S. ambassador to Israel ordered the U.S.
Embassy in Tel Aviv closed Thursday after what embassy officials
called a ``direct and credible'' threat of a terrorist attack
against the building.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the threat was received Wednesday night, but
they would not reveal its source or content, or how it was
communicated. They denied Israeli radio reports that the threats
were directed specifically against the ambassador, Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in memory that the U.S. Embassy in Israel
had closed its doors for security reasons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a threatened attack against an American Embassy,''
said embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz. He said that while he could
not confirm reports that the threatened action was a car bombing by
opponents of American air strikes on Iraq, such a threat would be
``consistent'' with security measures undertaken by the embassy in
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a credible threat,'' Schwartz said. ``It was a
direct threat. The ambassador, thinking it the prudent thing to do,
decided to close the embassy for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Children and other dependents of U.S. Embassy and consular
personnel in Israel were ordered out of the country by the State
Department during the four-day bombing campaign against Iraq in
December. The evacuation order has been lifted, but many families
remain abroad. The embassy in Tel Aviv had planned to close early
Thursday for the New Year's Eve holiday and is expected to reopen
as scheduled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Cairo was recently closed temporarily after
receiving threats linked to United states action against Iraq, and
Walker's action here Thursday should be seen in the same ``regional
context,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has kept its foreign missions in a state of
alert since the Aug. 7 car bombings of the embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania killed 224 people and prompted air strikes against Sudan
and the Afghanistan compound of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden,
who the United States says organized the attacks. The security
concerns increased in the Middle East as protesters throughout the
Islamic world condemned December's military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 24, the State Department said it ``continues to receive
reports that make us concerned about the safety and security of
both official U.S. government and civilian targets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We take these threats seriously and the U.S. has increased
security at United States government facilities worldwide,'' the
Department said. ``A number of our posts have temporarily suspended
or limited services to the public, and may have to do so in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. officials offered no details about the Tel Aviv
threat, the fear of a serious terrorist attack against U.S.
property and workers in Israel could in itself represent a
disturbing change here.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas across the border in
Lebanon and militant Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank savage the United States with words, but confine their
military actions and terror strikes to Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Israel say they doubt bin Laden has the
capacity to mount terrorist operations in Israel, and it remains
unclear who they believe to be the source of Wednesday's reported
threat.

TEST CAN DETECT ALZHEIMER'S YEARS AHEAD OF ONSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new brain scanning technique developed by doctors in New York
can apparently detect signs of Alzheimer's disease years and
perhaps decades before it begins destroying memory and mental
function, potentially offering hope to millions of Americans who
will be afflicted with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a study in the current Lancet, an English medical journal,
researchers describe how magnetic resonance imaging tests can
reveal shrinkage in part of the brain that is a telltale sign of
the onset of Alzheimer's well before people notice they are losing
memory.
</P>
<P>
   While no cure has been developed for Alzheimer's, which severely
afflicts more than 4 million Americans and affects millions more in
milder forms, a number of treatments have been shown to help slow
its ravages and fend off dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the disease now is not diagnosed until it has become
apparent when people are in their 60s or 70s, and brain scans have
not been commonly used as diagnostic tools. If the new brain scan
proves economical and workable on a large scale, it could one day
allow millions of people to begin treatment to preserve mental
function before their Alzheimer's becomes severe, or at least give
them the warning they need to be vigilant for any symptoms.
Alzheimer's is the fourth leading cause of death in the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite exciting and very significant work,'' said Dr.
Zaven Khachaturian, senior consultant to the Chicago-based
Alzheimer's Foundation and a former top federal Alzheimer's
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lancet paper, a team led by Dr. Mony de Leon of New York
University's medical school describes how shrinkage of part of the
brain called the entorhinal cortex, which is a key memory
processing center, is visible in people with very mild forms of
Alzheimer's, years before they begin noticing memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, a number of research teams around the US and
Europe have made key breakthroughs in correlating physical changes
in parts of the brain among people as young as their late 20s to
the onset of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon's team found that compared to healthy volunteers, as
measured by MRI scans, the entorhinal cortex was on average 45
percent smaller among people with severe Alzheimer's and 27 percent
smaller among people with milder cases.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon said he and his colleagues believe they have found ``a
way to measure what may be the earliest changes in the
memory-processing areas of the brain'' that are a sign of the
development of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   MRI scans may be a considerably faster, less expensive way to
diagnose early Alzheimer's than the traditional practice of
administering memory and learning tests, taking a family medical
history and performing other physical examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to the entorhinal cortex in people with Alzheimer's
proved to be greater than damage to another part of the brain
called the hippocampus, which has been a focus of considerable
research, and it was also a ``more reliable disease marker,''
according to the NYU team.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon's team developed a new way of measuring the size of the
entorhinal cortex based on what they call structural landmarks
inside the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a preliminary study that should be expanded over a
period of years,'' de Leon said, but added that ``for people with a
family history of Alzheimer's, it may be possible to observe such
changes and to treat the brain years before there are any signs of
memory loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kirk Daffner, co-director of the memory disorder unit at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that ``at this point,
there is no major advantage to knowing many decades in advance''
that someone is developing Alzheimer's because there is nothing
close to a cure.
</P>
<P>
   However, a drug trade-named Aricept, Ginko herbal extracts and
treatments involving vitamin E and estrogen have all shown benefits
in controlling symptoms of Alzheimer's, which begin with memory
loss and progress to incapacitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, in the next 5 to 10 years there will be the
increasing possibility of medications that improve cognition or
slow down the disease's progression,'' Daffner said.
</P>
<P>
   Khachaturian said work by de Leon and others is bolstering the
case that Alzheimer's ``should no longer be thought of as a disease
of the aged. It's more a disease of the young'' that takes decades
to become apparent to its victims, Khachaturian said.

RUSH IS ON TO CONVERT SECURITIES FOR EURO TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes hedline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While American recover from their New Year's celebrations this
weekend computer programmers and finance specialists will be
engaged in a distinctly un-celebratory enterprise: Racing to
convert billions of dollars' worth of mutual fund holdings, trust
assets, and bank accounts from their original mark, franc, or lire
denominations into that of Europe's new currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Their deadline is Sunday evening. ``That's when the trading day
begins in the Far East,'' said Richard A. Heckinger, senior vice
president with Boston's State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the entire effort will make little difference to
the typical American, even if he or she owns financial securities
from the 11 countries involved in the giant currency conversion.
That is because most people have their holdings through mutual
funds, whose value is calculated in US dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly means nothing is at stake in the conversion,
especially for a financial center like Boston. Any slip-up could
doom a company's _ and potentially even a city's _ reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't get it right and you can't trade Jan. 4, you're
in big trouble,'' said an official with Putnam Investments in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the region's financial giants are pulling out all
the stops, commandeering thousands of computer programmers and
finance specialists to work around-the-clock to ensure the switch
goes off smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   State Street has 1,000 people scheduled to work at its primary
processing center in Quincy, Mass., as well as another 600 at
satellite facilities in Sydney, Hong Kong, Munich, Paris, and
London, according to Heckinger. As chief record-keeper for $4.5
trillion in assets, a substantial fraction of them from the
European countries involved, the company probably has more at stake
in the conversion than many other firm.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments, several hundred people will be working
to make sure assets like those in the $1.7 billion Fidelity Europe
fund are repriced in euros, according to senior vice president
Richard Spillane. A similar number have been called in by Putnam,
Fleet Financial Group, and BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spillane said one measure of the financial world's confidence
that the conversion will come off without a hitch is that European
and non-European investors have been making deals this week that
will not be settled until next week, something they would not do if
they thought the accounting system that keeps track of what they
bought or sold was about to break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty routine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the conversion to the euro does not seem that
complicated a task. ``Basically, you can just look at it as adding
another currency,'' said Charles M. Lewis, executive vice president
with Fleet Financial. But there are several complicating wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, while all stocks and government bonds from the 11
countries involved will be quoted and traded in euros starting
Monday, the same is not true of corporate bonds or deposit
accounts. European companies are not required to convert their
bonds to the new currency until 2002. Neither are individual
deposit holders.
</P>
<P>
   That means banks and financial firms that handle European
securities will have to operate a dual-currency system for the next
several years, one that records the value of assets using the old,
so-called legacy currencies and that also uses the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is the question of whether the new currency
will catch on sufficiently to supplant the German mark, French
franc, and Italian lire.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis at Fleet Financial predicts the new currency will get off
to a ``somewhat tenuous start'' but will eventually take hold,
adding that the bank will provide its clients with whatever

LAST-MINUTE PHILANTHROPY HAS TAX-PLANNING MOTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes hedline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US stock market's strong recovery in the last months of 1998
prompted a flurry of charitable giving in December, as ordinary
investors rushed to blend warm-hearted philanthropic motivations
with the cold calculus of year-end tax planning.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence from national charities and gift-making
organizations Thursday suggested moderate to major increases in
donations before the New Year, when investors who feel financially
flush traditionally make contributions that can lead to a
wallet-fattening tax write-off come April.
</P>
<P>
   At The Jimmy Fund in Boston, staffers manned the phones from 7
a.m. to 8 p.m this week, fielding calls from people seeking to help
cancer research as well as secure a lesser tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very busy,'' said Fund spokeswoman Karen Cummings.
``It's more than last year. People are giving bigger gifts. And
there are more tribute gifts in the names of people who have
died.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services professionals said Wall Street's year-end
upswing after months of volatility was partly to credit for the
increase in giving. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, the broadest
measure of the stock market, closed Thursday up 27 percent for 1998
_ an unprecedented fourth year in a row of 20 percent-plus gains.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts are as much about the giver as the recipient, and
charitable donations are no exception. The market's robust returns
left Americans more flush with wealth _ and more anxious about the
tax consequences of all that cash and equity. While the two
feelings traditionally merge and grow in December, when charity
coffers swell on last-minute gifts before the new tax year sets,
donations _ and tax angst _ seemed a bit greater in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer at CARE's toll-free number said that 20 percent to
30 percent of year-end contributions were motivated by tax
planning, slightly more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Way of Massachusetts Bay, communications director
Carmen Fields said last year was a banner year, with the agency set
to meet its target of nearly $48 million, an annual increase of 10
percent. ``We don't ask people why they're giving, but this is the
time of year when taxes are on the fore of people's minds,'' Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners said clients whose stock portfolios swelled
in recent months were using increasingly complex methods to benefit
both charities and themselves. J. Michael Martin, a financial
adviser in Ellicott City, Md., said he had one husband and wife
team each withdraw $100,000 from their Individual Retirement
Accounts, a taxable action. They each then awarded various
charities $100,000 in appreciated stock from another account _ a
tax-free move that saved them each about $40,000 that helped offset
the taxable IRA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors seek to dump underperforming shares by giving
them to charity and taking the loss but offsetting the taxable gain
_ an often unwanted gift. Martin said one client rebalanced his
portfolio and won a tax break by donating a large portion of his
shares in railway concern Norfolk &AMP; Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, where an Internal Revenue Service study
showed residents to be among the stingiest givers in the nation,
donations swelled in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity Investments' Charitable Gift Fund, one of the
largest gift-making organizations in the nation, president Cynthia
L. Egan said 40 percent of last year's $530 million in donations
came in December alone, an increase of 16 percent on 1997's level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax planning is an important part of fueling charitable giving
at the year-end, but we also see surges in grant-making requests
when certain events, like Hurricane Mitch and Georges, happen,''
Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Red Cross of Massachusetts Bay, chief executive
Patricia Deacon said the past 90 days had been quite busy. ``It is
the season for many reasons,'' she said. `And we have had more
gifts of stock this year than ever before.'' Contributions through
stock gifts had nearly doubled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some investors, heady on expectations of gains both in
the market and before the taxman, apparently forget that charitable
donations actually cost money. ``The tax savings is always less
than what you give,'' said Martin, the financial planner. ``People
always forget this.''

LOOKING BACK AT SMALL GEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the year some videos stick in the memory for one
reason or another. Here is a selection from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK. But what happened to them? Back after 15
years out of distribution, Peter Weir's film about the vanishing of
three Australian schoolgirls during a picnic in the outback still
leaves one as achingly in need of an explanation of their
disappearance. During the film, however, one gradually comes to
realize that there won't be one. ``The challenge was to let the
audience know in a way that wouldn't upset them that there wasn't
going to be an ending,'' Weir said in an interview. Actually, what
does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   LAMERICA. Video's best answer to ``Where is it when we need
it?'' is the small gem of a film that comes along to relieve a run
of pretty bad bigger movies. This year perhaps the best of them was
Gianni Amelio's acclaimed movie about a young Italian hustler
(Enrico Lo Verso) who loses the clothes off his back, along with
virtually every shred of his identity, by trying to make a quick
buck off chaos in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   THE END OF VIOLENCE. In Wim Wenders' film, another of the year's
better finds, the movie mogul Mike Max (Bill Pullman) may not
understand why he is suddenly losing his studio, but he has the
good sense to stay calm, lie low and try to sort it out with the
moral support of Chicano gardeners who find him unconscious in a
flower bed. The result, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times,
generates ``more intriguing speculation about technology,
communications and the effects of mass media than a hundred
science-fiction fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   PONETTE. A third small prize, Jacques Doillon's film is about a
4-year-old girl who desperately develops strategies to deal with
the death of her mother. One amazing thing about this movie is the
mesmerizing, unsentimental performance by Victoire Thivisol, who
was just 3 when she was chosen for the role after a talent hunt in
French schools and day-care centers. It is also unusual how such a
subject becomes a piece of high drama.
</P>
<P>
   MY SO-CALLED LIFE. Speaking of children, Claire Danes had barely
turned 14 when she began her run in Ed Zwick and Marshall
Herskovitz's bitingly strong but doomed 1994 television series
about a teen-ager and her family. (Three episodes of the 19 made
are available from BMG.) Ms. Danes has since moved on to the
movies. Back then ABC had misgivings about the show before it
started. But, said Winnie Holzman, its primary writer, ``Claire was
so charismatic, so much a star right from the get-go, it was hard
to turn away and say no.''
</P>
<P>
   TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Robert Mulligan's adaptation of the
Harper Lee novel, with a screenplay by Horton Foote, was back in a
stunningly sharp black-and-white edition. When Alan J. Pakula, the
film's producer, first proposed the project, studio people seemed
puzzled. ``They asked, `What story do you plan to tell?''' he said
in an interview last year. ``I said, `Have you read the book?' They
said, `Yes.' I said, `That's the story.'''
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask how, but during his escape attempt from a Florida
prison, the suave bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney) manages
to get himself locked in a car trunk with a voluptuous federal
marshal named Karen Sisco (Ms. Lopez). This being an Elmore Leonard
crime tale, and these being movie stars in their prime, the
confinement sparks a twisty attraction. As more or less faithfully
adapted from the Leonard book, Steven Soderbergh's film manages the
slippery plot maneuverings with panache. Characterizations have
been altered, however, with Ms. Lopez resembling a younger sister
of Jackie Brown and Clooney making a more playfully roguish Foley
than the book's seasoned, sad-eyed Jack. Considering that this is
Soderbergh's first commercial film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New
York Times, ``he makes it work like a dream.''

   How Stella Got Her Groove Back
</P>
<P>
   Stella (Angela Bassett), a beautiful, in-shape San Francisco
stockbroker and divorced mother of one repairs to a tropical resort
where she undertakes some torrid revitalization with an impeccably
courtly hunk named Winston (Taye Diggs), who is 20 years her
junior. Kevin Rodney Sullivan's first film starts as a rosy
rendition of a May-September relationship, but gets back to reality
when Stella meets Winston's brutally condescending mother, who is
just a year older than she, and Winston seems more interested in
junk food and playing video games than he is in adult pursuits.
While Winston is never more than a fantasy, ``Ms. Bassett portrays
this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her
almost believable'' (Stephen Holden).

   Mr. Jealousy
</P>
<P>
   An articulate, self-defeating romantic who likes to thrash out
his troubles in coffee shops, the obsessively possessive Lester
Grimm (Eric Stoltz) anguishes over his girlfriend, Ramona Ray
(Annabella Sciorra), and her past relationship with Dashiell Frank
(Chris Eigeman), a wildly successful writer who is described as the
literary voice of his generation. Dashiell is the kind who sails
through multiple sexual exploits and has his best-selling book read
on audiotape by Tom Cruise. A schoolteacher with his own literary
ambitions, Lester is so thrown by the notion of the famous writer
and the frisky Ramona that he enrolls in Dashiell's therapy group,
the better to study the fellow close up.
</P>
<P>
   But with a fertile enough premise, Noah Baumbach's film would
have done better to cast the more naturally fretful Eigeman as the
neurotic Lester and the cooler Stolz as Dashiell, thereby stoking a
situation that ``could have been funnier if its actors weren't
playing against type'' (Maslin).

   IT HAPPENED TOMORROW, ALIBI and LURED. Three older American
films get their first release on tape. In Rene Clair's ``It
Happened Tomorrow'' (1944, 84 minutes), a reporter (Dick Powell)
gets himself into difficulties when he finds a way to get the news
a day in advance of its happening. In Roland West's ``Alibi''
(1929, 84 minutes), Chester Morris is a Prohibition-era gangster,
but the art-deco sets are really the star. Lucille Ball serves as a
decoy to help track a serial killer in Douglas Sirk's ``Lured''
(1947, 103 minutes). Kino. $24.95 each. Information: (800)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ Twenty years ago, when he was chancellor of
Germany, Helmut Schmidt thought there would be a single European
currency by the early 1980s. Instead, he is still carrying around
six different kinds of money in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have the German mark, English pounds, French francs,
Swiss francs and Italian lire, plus American dollars, but I always
end up just using credit cards,'' laughed Schmidt, who travels
frequently as a publisher of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   But as of January, he can write checks in euros, the common
currency that 11 countries in the European Union are introducing,
almost two decades later than he and other European leaders had
planned. And three years from now, he will finally be able to put
euro notes in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's launching is a particular point of pride for Schmidt
and two other prominent European leaders, Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
once president of France, and Sir Edward Heath, the former prime
minister of Britain. The three men took some of the earliest steps
toward a single currency, in the 1970s, and kept promoting the idea
even when it lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have happened a lot earlier,'' said Schmidt, 80.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could have, agreed Sir Edward, 82, who negotiated the
1972 treaty that took Britain into the European Economic Community
when he was prime minister. Later that year, he and other European
leaders endorsed a plan devised by Pierre Werner, then the prime
minister of Luxembourg, for a common European currency to combat
the monetary instability caused by the collapse of the Bretton
Woods system, which had been based on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped then to have it done by 1980,'' he said, but the
sharp rise in oil prices in 1973 derailed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Giscard d'Estaing, now 72, and Schmidt, friends from the days
when both served as finance ministers, tried to get monetary union
back on the rails over drinks in Schmidt's lakeside cottage north
of here in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded fellow European leaders to establish something
called the European Currency Unit, expecting it to become coin of
the European realm by the early 1980s, but it failed to speed the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay was unnecessarily long,'' Giscard d'Estaing said in
an interview in the French Parliament, ``and without wanting to be
too severe, I think it was caused by indifference and to some
extent lack of financial literacy on the part of the European
leaders of the early 1980s. They did not ascribe the same
importance to it as we did, and maybe they were hesitant to get
into the technical details, so the system went into a kind of
hibernation from 1981 to 1988.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the collapse of communism in 1989, French President
Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pushed harder
for the common currency again, partly to bind a reunited Germany
more firmly into a new single European market.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her
successor, John Major, kept Britain out. And, Schmidt said, ``the
central bank officials in the other countries did not want to lose
their power so they invented a thousand conditions, but in the end
the idea finally prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd only listened to us'' was the common refrain in
separate interviews recently with these fathers of the euro as they
fretted impatiently for the long-awaited birth.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to them now, a common currency, strengthening the
unified market that came into its own in 1993 when the last customs
and tariff barriers fell in the European Union, will finally give
Europe the opportunity to become a global power.
</P>
<P>
   Heath harrumphed all reservations aside in an interview in his
London pied-a-terre, near Eaton Square. ``There's no single market
in the world without a single currency, not in Japan and certainly
not in the United States,'' he said. ``Imagine what the United
States would be now if each of the 50 states had its own
currency!''
</P>
<P>
   With new confidence in the stability of the economic and
monetary policy of Europe, according to the these most enthusiastic
of the euro's cheerleaders, dynamic growth could finally cure the
Continent's chronic unemployment problem. And investors around the
world, they say, may welcome a strong new currency that can
diversify portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   That could weaken the dollar and force up interest rates in the
United States, they concede, but they shrug that off almost as
easily as most presidents since Richard M. Nixon have shrugged off
the effects of U.S. monetary policy on smaller currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``America and Europe will continue to need each other into the
21st century,'' Schmidt said, ``but it remains to be seen whether
the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift
dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated ones, which means
the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to
attract investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Giscard d'Estaing, though, wishes the euro were not quite so
strong at the start. ``The dollar at the moment is a little too
weak,'' he said. ``I have the feeling the American economy is
slowing down a bit, and that the American authorities accept that.
There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to
strengthen, and a monetary policy for the euro that will try to
contain that tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in
German and French attitudes toward money. For Germany, a strong
mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the
war, a fact Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into
account when he and Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Germans, the idea of abandoning the Deutsche mark,
losing it, and entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments
they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent
central bank, was impossible,'' Giscard d'Estaing said. ``So
independence for the European central bank was an essential core
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the
mark surprised me, and I think it surprised them too. The strict
criteria, the requirement to cut budget deficits, the independence
of the central bank in the plan, all had the merit of reassuring
the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty
that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade
later, though not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred.
Britain, alas, will not use the euro, at least at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our original plan, the City of London would have been
the center of the whole deal,'' he said. Instead, he added, ``it
all went to Frankfurt,'' where the new European Central Bank is
located.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders, with vivid memories of what World War II did
to their countries, said they hoped monetary union would force the
members of the European Union still closer, encouraging them to
share sovereignty in foreign, military and domestic policies, not
just economics.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, a junior officer in the Wehrmacht during the war,
looked out of his corner office high over prosperous Hamburg, a
city rebuilt on postwar trade with Britain and France, and
remembered seeing it as a vast expanse of rubble and flames strewn
with bodies after a huge raid by British and U.S. bombers in July
1943. ``I'll never forget it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Giscard d'Estaing, who joined the French Resistance as a
boy, were on opposite sides then, and both said French
reconciliation with Germany is at the heart of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the euro to be an instrument in the federative approach
to Europe,'' Giscard d'Estaing said. ``The word `federative' is a
French 18th-century word Montesquieu used. It means sharing power
or competence.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the same at all, he added, as the English word
``federal,'' as in the ``federal European superstate'' so dreaded
by Lady Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said it was nonsense to think that a common currency
would fail without a federal European state. ``Before 1914
Europeans had one currency: gold,'' he said. ``Parities were fixed
and did not change, and all countries followed the constraints that
the system entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath, who fought Germans as a British artillery officer during
the war, thinks his country's reserve is a historical mistake. ``I
was the only one bold enough to do it,'' he huffed.
</P>
<P>
   British financial and stock markets, like the Continent's, will
start dealing in euros in January, even though Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government, like its Conservative predecessor, wants
to see how the euro works before Britain decides whether to give up
the pound. Giscard d'Estaing said he thought the British attitude
was entirely reasonable, but Heath disagreed.

   ``Ever since the 1950s, Britain has stood aside while all the
European arrangements were made, so we had no influence on them,
and then we decided to come in later,'' Heath lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Britain first started negotiations for European membership in
1961, but France's autocratic president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed
it two years later. His successor, Georges Pompidou, relented in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're back on the old path,'' said Heath.
</P>
<P>
   A previous engagement, he said, would keep him from coming to
Hamburg on Jan. 6 for a delayed celebration of Schmidt's 80th
birthday, which was Dec. 23. But Giscard d'Estaing said he would be
there. ``We'll celebrate the arrival of the euro together,'' he
said.

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton, Edward Furlong and
Beverly D'Angelo. Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed
but gut-slugging, renounced by its director yet still a showcase
for his effective style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who
develops a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its
toughest images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing,
presented in the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials,
spins out of control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and
versatility, Norton plays a savage, racist killer who learns the
error of his ways through simple-minded but brutally effective plot
devices and trying to protect his younger brother (Furlong).
Hotheaded and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANTZ,' starring the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone,
Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman and Christopher Walken. Directed
by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer
animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute
romantic couple out of Allen and Ms. Stone. This and other surreal
tricks are shown off in a funny, ingeniously animated insect
picture that often reaches the anthropomorphic cleverness of ``Toy
Story'' and shows off Allen's sharpest comic timing with
one-liners. But ``Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely
grandiose ways, with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring
change of pace. Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one
with considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a
struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the
picnic basket would have done the trick (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `A BUG'S LIFE,' featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz.'' With the same anthropomorphism that
gave Lasseter's ``Toy Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued,
visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage
while incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of nature.
And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial expressions
that make this type of animation more and more invitingly lifelike
all the time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de
Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115
minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older
woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance is one of 1998's very
best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `DANCING AT LUGHNASA,' starring Meryl Streep, Brid Brennan,
Michael Gambon, Kathy Burke and Catherine McCormack. Directed by
Pat O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the
other principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from
Brian Friel's delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the
play's intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also
gained a good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint
rural charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five
unmarried sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the
return of their gently eccentric brother from many years'
missionary work in Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this
beguilingly atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter
these characters' lives (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a
royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the queen as if
her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting
consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the hand. For all
its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the
start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those
whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle,
complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent
of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the queen as a
glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense
case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ENEMY OF THE STATE,' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology whiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics bring an
additional touch of class (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE FACULTY,' starring Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura
Harris and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (R, 111
minutes). Like Frankenstein, ``The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of
cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy,
sharp-toothed creatures of ''Alien.'' And over there are the
movie-wise teen-agers of ``Scream.'' The list could be extended,
but the point is clear: This mediocre sci-fi horror film about an
Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on
world domination breaks no new ground. But written by Kevin
Williamson, it has an engaging cast, with half a dozen appealing
young actors playing the roles of teen-agers who are all that stand
between the Midwestern monsters and the end of the world as certain
moviegoers know it (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award time, McKellen
becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, the gay
``Frankenstein'' director, playing him late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener ( Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams, Dylan Baker, Philip Seymour
Hoffman and Lara Flynn Boyle. Directed by Todd Solondz (not rated;
135 minutes). In a much bigger film than his ``Welcome to the Doll
House,'' this audacious, deadpan filmmaker explores loneliness in
his murderously funny fashion. Outrageous touches _ none more so
than its title _ come easily to ``Happiness,'' and so do the dark
secrets that would surely have brought it an NC-17 rating. No point
in cataloging this film's perverse details: What emerges most
clearly is a ruthless yet tender portrait of suburban characters
seeking romance, captured with enough acid precision to make this a
``Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional
times. Ms. Adams plays the dartboard in a three-sister family with
hilarious tremulousness. Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming
pederast who is also a respected doctor and a loving father is
impossible to forget (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `JACK FROST,' starring Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston and Joseph
Cross. Directed by Troy Miller (PG, 100 minutes). Keaton stars as
the title character, one of those rock-and-roll musicians who are
also great husbands and devoted dads. The film is about what
happens after Jack dies in a Christmas Eve automobile accident and
returns to his family as a large, wisecracking marshmallow man
parked on the front lawn. As one more Hollywood effort to look on
the sunny side of fatality, this one is so sugarcoated that it
makes other recent efforts in the genre look blisteringly honest by
comparison. The actors are as plausible and nice as possible in
displaying emotions as sincere as the soap-flake snow that coats
the sets (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LITTLE VOICE,' starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan
McGregor and Michael Caine. Directed by Mark Herman (R, 99
minutes). The main attraction here is watching wispy Ms. Horrocks
put on a spectacular one-woman diva festival, with her phenomenal
mimicry of musical grande dames from Judy Garland to Marilyn
Monroe. What works less well is the broad and stagy story built
around her. As the timid title character, she is harangued by her
blowsy mother (Ms. Blethyn), latched onto by the talent agent who
is the mother's boyfriend ( Caine) and courted by a nice young man
who loves his pet pigeons. In that last role, McGregor makes a
telephone installer scintillating and once again shows that he can
do anything. Incidentally, the soundtrack is divine (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIVING OUT LOUD,' starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen
Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making
his directorial debut, LaGravenese, a sensitive screenwriter,
remains very much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective
character study laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter
stiffly but passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to
reinvent her life. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator
man who cares for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most
attention-getting figure in the small but glamorous role of a
torchy nightclub singer. Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this
story of lonely people, but they don't make it jell (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PATCH ADAMS,' starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
occasion for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen and William Macy. Written and directed by Gary Ross (PG-13,
116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black and white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the 1990s try to awaken benighted '50s types from their
slumber is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there
are witty tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and
nice little touches abound. The cast is poignant and amusing, with
Ms. Allen especially touching as a prefeminist housewife who's the
prime recipient of '90s hindsight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,' starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph
Fiennes, and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve
Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great
expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then
came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated
whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy
rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen
as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as
special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `PSYCHO,' starring Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, William Macy and
Julianne Moore. Directed by Gus Van Sant (R, 100 minutes). It turns
out that the apparent rocks in Van Sant's head, as he contrived
this near-exact color replica of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic,
were only pebbles. His remake (a modest term, but it beats
plagiarism) is artful and good-looking, faltering only when it
tries to improve on the brilliant original blueprint. The casting
of Vaughn as Norman Bates is the film's biggest Achilles' heel,
since the performance Hitchcock elicited from Anthony Perkins
remains an impossible act to follow. Still, Van Sant has tried an
outlandish experiment and come up with what are, especially for
fans of the original, intriguing variations on a theme (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE RUGRATS MOVIE,' starring the voices of E.G. Daily, Kath
Soucie, Tara Charendoff and Tim Curry. Directed by Norton Virgien
and Igor Kovalyov (G, 90 minutes). Dil Pickles is not the first
baby whose resentful older sibling wanted to return him to the
hospital, but he's probably the only one who has such an
interesting trip back. Dil (full name: Dylan Preston Pickles) is
the newborn hero of the first film starring the five talking babies
of Nickelodeon's hit children's series ``Rugrats.'' The pleasant
surprise is that the film is a delight, from encounters with
wolves, wizards and circus monkeys in the forest to musical numbers
at the ``baby store.'' There's material for grown-up moviegoers,
too, including a scene with some pathetic reporters who turn up at
the Pickles house when the children disappear, getting everybody's
name wrong and asking, ``Is it true a dingo ate your baby?'' (Anita
Gates).
</P>
<P>
   `STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,' starring Patrick Stewart and Jonathan
Frakes. Directed by Frakes (PG, 105 minutes). The latest movie
episode of the series that will not die finds Capt. Picard (
Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise saving a tribe of utopian
space pioneers who live on a planet where everyone enjoys eternal
youth. The bad guys want to relocate the people forcibly and
exploit the planet's life-giving properties. Picard, standing up
against the admiral of Starfleet and risking court-martial,
delivers impassioned speeches about the ugly history of forcible
relocation and also falls in love with a 309-year-old beauty (Donna
Murphy). Although in its ninth movie episode, the series has
retained its sincerity and multicultural right-mindedness. It's
hokum, but executed deftly and with a warm heart (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `STEPMOM,' starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife
and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two
children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars,
both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person
ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially
fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even
when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain
its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense
of fun. As in ``Home Alone,'' Columbus directs with sunny
indifference to reality: medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOUCH OF EVIL,' starring Orson Welles, Charlton Heston and
Janet Leigh. Directed by Welles (not rated, 108 minutes). Anyone
familiar with Welles' 1958 film-noir landmark knows that it could
just as well have been called ``Truckload of Evil,'' and that its
crazily sinister plot turns and breathtaking camera work remain
astonishingly fresh. ``Touch of Evil'' is, among so many things,
the other film to find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under
strangely menacing management, and the one in which Welles gave one
of his most droll, swaggering performances as a corrupt police
captain in an American town on the Mexican border. As visually
thrilling as it is sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version
of ``Touch of Evil'' remains one of the brightest lights on the
cinematic landscape this season (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `WAKING NED DEVINE,' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and
Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast
of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning career
directing television commercials means that everyone here is an
amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian
stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're
worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The Full
Monty,'' but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of
elderly gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `YOU'VE GOT MAIL,' starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg Kinnear
and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110 minutes). This
cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry between two
bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in love with
books themselves, the instant intimacy of e-mail and a
picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a
feel-good ambiance much less forced than that of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much
her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a
ruefully lovelorn Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again
(Maslin).

   THE STUFF THAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF: THE FILMS OF MARCELLO
MASTROIANNI. Before his death in 1996 at 72, Marcello Mastroianni
made more than 170 films, many of them for eminent directors like
Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica, Ettore Scola, Luchino Visconti,
Michelangelo Antonioni and Nikita Mikhalkov, and many of them among
the more memorable of the second half of the 20th century.
Beginning Friday and Saturday, with screenings of Pietro Germi's
``Divorce Italian Style'' (1962), De Sica's ``Marriage Italian
Style'' (1964) and Fellini's ``Dolce Vita'' (1960), the Film
Society of Lincoln Center in New York will pay homage to
Mastroianni with a retrospective. Spanning the years from 1962 to
1995, the series includes 22 films, among them Visconti's ``White
Nights'' (1957), Scola's ``Special Day'' (1977), Fellini's ``8
1/2'' (1963), Antonioni's ``Notte'' (1961) and Mikhalkov's ``Dark
Eyes'' (1987). The series continues through Jan. 16 at the Walter
Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. Tickets: $8.50; $5 for Film
Society members; $4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees.
Information: (212) 875-5600 (Van Gelder).

   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ The e-mail messages arrived first in a
trickle, then in a flood.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Pennsylvania State University were contacting their
president, Graham Spanier, with a desperate plea in the fall
semester: Create more classes in ballroom dancing. Nearly 1,500
undergraduates were languishing on dance-class waiting lists; on
Friday nights, the ballroom dance club was overwhelmed trying to
teach hundreds how to cha-cha and fox trot.
</P>
<P>
   After an emergency meeting in November, Spanier announced that
in January, the number of ballroom dance classes at Penn State
would rise to 48 from eight, increasing the number of slots to
1,440 from 240.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a society that is increasingly impersonal and there
is a need for a way to meet one another, to touch without immediate
sex,'' said Spanier, a sociologist with a scholarly interest in
interpersonal relations, in explaining why he moved with such
speed. ``Ballroom dancing offers that.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, at Yale and Arizona State
Universities, at the University of Wisconsin and San Diego State
University, partner dancing, both traditional ballroom and swing,
is sweeping campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Teague, vice president of the youth college network of the
U.S. Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association, said the rise was so
sudden and so fierce that it was not yet possible to know the exact
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way,'' Ms. Teague said, ``five years ago there
were dozens of schools with hundreds of students doing ballroom
dance. Today there are hundreds of schools with thousands and
thousands of dancers. In the Washington, D.C., area alone we have
gone from one school, Catholic University, with 20 to 30 dancers to
five schools with 2,000 dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   And while fads, fed by trend setters on the two coasts and
popular movies, are nothing new on campuses, scholars say that in
the era of AIDS, this is a phenomenon worthy of a close look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be moving back to the medieval notion of romance, love
that is unrequited,'' suggested Geoffrey Godbey, professor of
leisure studies at Penn State. ``These dances provide sensuality
and imagination. But, like Web pornography or phone sex, they are
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the structured nature of the male-female relationship in
ballroom dancing, the courting rituals and prescribed steps that
have drawn the attention of analysts.
</P>
<P>
   They also note other aspects: the strenuousness of the dances
for a generation that knows the importance of exercise, and the
desire by some for social graces to serve as a divider in a country
where class distinctions are blurred. Noncredit etiquette courses
are also on the rise on some campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, college officials say, anything that competes with
binge drinking, the current plague of college campuses, should be
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a kind of continuation of kids' soccer leagues,
increasingly structured social interaction,'' said Craig Bradley,
dean of student affairs at Bowdoin College in Maine, which is also
experiencing a surge in ballroom and swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first year in college it is so important to feel
like you belong, have a group,'' Bradley said. ``If it isn't
happening, drinking fills that void. The conventions around dating
fell away in recent decades. I have students come in and say they
want intimate relations but don't know how to get there. Ballroom
dancing is one answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend also seems to be a middle-class revenge against the
formlessness of popular dance that began in the early 1960s when
Chubby Checker's twist sent partner dancing packing. Dancing, for
millenniums a form of social glue, deteriorated in the 1960s into
group chaos against a background of loud, pulsating rhythms and
nervous two-step hugging to slower songs.
</P>
<P>
   As Laura Kelso, an 18-year-old Penn State freshman from
Greensburg, Pa., put it in describing her interest in the new swing
dance club here, ``Dancing in high school was either flailing
around or slow dances without steps. People need some kind of
structure, some form of socialization.''

   In the Penn State ballroom dance classes, held in several large
gymnasiums with pale green walls, exposed pipes and worn wooden
floors, that is precisely what may be observed. There are no
smart-alecks here, said Elizabeth Hanley, the teacher with nearly
four decades of experience. Here are tomorrow's stalwarts in all
forms, the smoothly decorous, the knobby-jointed and the
floppy-footed, content to be addressed as ``ladies and gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always good to know how to dance,'' said Jeffrey Ellis,
a rangy 22-year-old from Pittsburgh just finishing an accounting
degree.
</P>
<P>
   His skilled dance partner, Cara Chieffallo, also a 22-year-old
future accountant from Pittsburgh and a natural with the tango,
added, ``I always like a guy who knows how to dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The course they are in, which fulfills their physical education
requirement, is taught by Ms. Hanley and her husband, Patrick
Kolivosky. Together, they say, they teach not only dance but also
posture, grace and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stand up straight like that here on the dance floor,
why not hold that posture for your next job interview?'' Kolivosky
said.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of the course involve moves like the fox trot
Westchester step: basic box, quarter turns, lady's turn, dip and
two turns, Bolero break, weave and conversation pivot.
</P>
<P>
   The other dances include the waltz, polka, tango and swing. The
current generation of swing dance has much international influence,
especially Latin American.
</P>
<P>
   The international element seems especially significant on some
campuses. At Ohio State University, for example, the dance club,
which two years ago drew about 100 students each week and now draws
about 300, is heavily Asian and Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a structured, legitimate way for young people to meet,
and that can be especially important for foreigners,'' said Dr.
Robert Rodgers, the club's adviser and a professor of education and
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Stentiford, assistant director for recreation at New York
University, said ballroom and swing dance had so taken over her
program that she had to cancel a rock 'n' roll dance class for lack
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stentiford, too, noticed the interest among foreign
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful melting pot,'' she said, ``with different
cultures bringing different techniques to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stentiford said she was struck by the contrast with the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe sex has translated for many today into no sex,'' she
said. ``I'm a creature of the 1960s, the days of free love, and,
let me tell you, these kids are scared. But these dances can be
very sensuous, and they become physical with one another in a
nonsexual way that is romantic, a throwback to the 1930s. We're
going back to courtly love. We have to because of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s,'' Ms. Stentiford continued, ``dancing became
strange with everyone looking at themselves in the mirror saying,
`Aren't I sexy?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with ballroom dancing, it is like each person is the
frame of the other's picture. One creates a space, and the other
goes in and out. It's a whole other world but it's beautiful.''

ART NOTES: A $244,135 `CARTHAGE' TESTA GOES TO ISRAEL AS A $7.2
MILLION  ` JERUSALEM' POUSSIN; HICKSES FOR SALE: CROWD CONTROL AT
THE MET 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ISRAEL GETS AN APT POUSSIN  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A painting that Sotheby's experts attributed to the 17th-century
artist Pietro Testa and called ``The Sack of Carthage'' was
estimated to sell for $16,000 to $24,000 when it was included in a
London sale in 1995. But what began as a minor work in an Old
Master auction has ended up being one of the stars of the Israel
Museum's permanent collection, thanks to a combination of
scholarship and beneficence.
</P>
<P>
   The directors of Hazlitt, Gooden &AMP; Fox, a London gallery, bought
the painting at the Sotheby's auction for $244,135, more than 10
times its high estimate. The dealers suspected something Sotheby's
experts did not and were prepared to take a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable research and restoration, the gallery
discovered that the painting was in fact by Testa's friend and
colleague, the far more famous Nicolas Poussin, and that rather
than being called ``The Sack of Carthage'' it was titled ``The
Destruction and Sack of the Temple of Jerusalem,'' and is the first
of two works on the subject that Poussin painted in 1626.
</P>
<P>
   It was the English philanthropist Jacob Rothschild who, knowing
that the Israel Museum had no Poussin in its collection, offered to
give the institution a grant from Yad Hanadiv, the Rothschild
Foundation in Israel, to purchase the painting in memory of Sir
Isaiah Berlin, the philosopher and historian, who died a year ago.
The foundation paid $7.2 million for the work.
</P>
<P>
   Poussin based ``The Destruction and Sack of the Temple of
Jerusalem'' on the first-century historian Flavius Josephus'
eyewitness account of the sack of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, an event
commemorated each year as a day of mourning in the Jewish calendar.
It is one of three chaotic battle scenes he painted during his
first year in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The work had been lost for 320 years, until its appearance,
misattributed, at Sotheby's. Its past unfolds a complex chapter of
17th-century history: it was commissioned by Francesco Cardinal
Barberini in 1625, and eight years later he gave it to the Duc de
Crequy. It was later given to Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of
Louis XIII and a well-known patron of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Richelieu then bequeathed the work to his niece, the Duchesse
d'Aiguillon, upon whose death in 1675 it entered the collection of
M. de Saintot, Maistre des Ceremonies. From there, its whereabouts
was unknown until the 1995 auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an early Poussin yet it shows all the things that mark a
mature Poussin,'' said James S. Snyder, director of the Israel
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is currently on view at a Poussin exhibition in
Rome, where it will hang until March 1. It will then go to London,
where it will be shown at the National Gallery of Art for eight
weeks before going to the Israel Museum.
</P>
<P>
   RARE SALES OF HICKSES AT AN INTERESTING MOMENT
</P>
<P>
   It is rare to see one great painting by Edward Hicks, the folk
artist, turn up at auction, but this month Christie's New York will
be selling two.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a Quaker leader who supported himself as a painter, was
best known for his depictions of the Peaceable Kingdom, parables of
the animal kingdom inspired by the words of the prophet Isaiah.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Hicks painted about 60 versions of this
theme. In the earliest, dating from about 1825, the artist uses a
child as the central character; around 1830 Hicks' paintings become
more complex, including every animal the prophet mentions. At the
end of his life, around 1840, the artist's work becomes less
lifelike and more brooding in character and heavy in composition.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, Christie's will be selling a ``Peaceable Kingdom''
dating from around 1837, the middle period of the artist's career,
where the most prominent animals are a fierce lion and a docile ox
standing together and sharing straw.
</P>
<P>
   The painting comes from the collection of Robert S. Lee Sr., a
Philadelphia car dealer and art collector who died last year and
whose heirs sold a group of mostly contemporary art at Christie's
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lee bought the painting at a Philadelphia auction in 1980 for
$210,000, a record-breaking price for both the artist and a folk
art painting. While $210,000 may have seemed exorbitant 19 years
ago, today Christie's estimates that it will sell for $1.5 million
to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from his most optimistic period of his career,'' said
John Hays, director of Christie's American decorative arts
department. ``The painting, which is an icon of this artist's work,
is jampacked with animals.''
</P>
<P>
   That both Hickses are coming up for sale this season comes at an
interesting moment, Hays said. In February, the Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller Museum and Folk Art Center in Williamsburg is having a
Hicks retrospective, the first in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the artist's paintings for sale at Christie's, on
Jan. 15, is a late work, dating from about 1849, of ``The Residence
of David Twining,'' as the artist remembered it in 1785. It is
being sold by Dr. Thomas Lincoln, a direct descendant of both
Abraham Lincoln and David Twining, whom Hicks adopted when he was a
child. The painting depicts members of the Twining family engaged
in farming activities. It has been passed down in the family since
the artist painted it.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, a retired physician, is donating the proceeds from the
sale of the painting, which is expected to bring $700,000 to $1
million, to the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   MET CROWD CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you see ropes down the front steps of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, it's to control the crowds. The
institution has seen one of the five busiest days in its 128-year
history. On Tuesday, 47,165 visitors visited the Met, crowding its
great hall and jamming its gift shops, not to mention some of its
more popular shows like ``From van Eyck to Bruegel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tuesday after Christmas is traditionally our busiest
day,'' said Harold Holzer, the museum's vice president for
communications. ``The reason is a confluence of circumstances:
tourism, school holidays, family outings and the truly eclectic
exhibition schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to be raining on Tuesday and, Holzer added, ``a
little drizzle goes a long way.''

POLICE ACTION THAT KILLED WOMAN ROILS BLACK SENTIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Dastmalchi is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. _ Resident by black resident, the room swelled
with grief over a teenage girl's death in a hail of police bullets,
until John Dastmalchi stood to speak and was greeted with
foot-stomping, angry amens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't take the beating, we won't be beat,'' he told a
community gathering of 100 or so. ``Let's not go for that nonsense
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Where black leaders successfully urged calm, Dastmalchi gave
voice to an undercurrent of unchanneled outrage. Where they pressed
people to wait until Riverside police complete their investigation,
he demanded protest now. Their remarks received polite applause.
His approval bordered on the boisterous. Residents clearly heard
their own frustrations echoed in his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Calm prevailed for another day in Riverside, about 65 miles east
of Los Angeles. But it appeared more tenuous than ever. Suddenly,
longstanding but underlying tensions between blacks and police were
at the raw surface.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after police shot 19-year-old Tyisha Shenee Miller to
death as she sat in her disabled car at an all-night gas station,
residents and her relatives were calling them murderers and
demanding a federal investigation. A national civil rights group
announced plans to picket in Riverside next week. Miller's family
said they hoped attorney Johnnie Cochran would press their expected
wrongful-death suit against the city and the officers involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time that these people with the power of god in
their hands, in their pistols, be held accountable,'' Miller's
uncle, the Rev. Bernell Butler, told the gathering. ``We need as
much power and pressure as we can to bring Tyisha Miller's killers
to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The outrage, however, appeared confined largely to Riverside's
relatively tiny black community, which makes up about 7 percent of
the county's 238,000 residents. There was only a smattering of
whites and Hispanics at Thursday's community meeting, which lasted
several hours. Another divide was apparent among blacks themselves.
While no one advocated violence, the audience sounded far more
frustrated than black leaders, who one after another offered their
condolences to the Miller family before expressing confidence in
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This community is about to explode,'' said Cheryl Brown,
co-publisher of the Black Voice News in Riverside. ``The leaders
want to keep a lid on it, because they know it could blow up.
People don't understand how five grown policemen could empty their
guns into a girl who was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ameal Moore, Riverside's only black councilman, put it,
``Let's wait until all the facts are in and then decide what to
do.'' Kim Thomas, director of a violence-prevention program called
People Reaching Out, stressed that violence should not lead to more
violence, that Miller's death was already one too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a cry of anger and rage. We needed to stand
together as a community to say enough is enough,'' said the Rev.
DeWayne Butler, another of the victim's uncles. ``(But) anyone
could have grabbed pistols and started shooting. ... I was grateful
that everyone decided to go about it in a more controlled manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the audience _ and Miller's own family _ said
they did not trust Riverside police to police themselves. Instead,
they want a federal investigation and a civilian review. They said
they want answers, and they said they do not want to wait much
longer for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be held accountable,'' Lt. Jim Cannon promised the
crowd. ``I cannot emphasize enough that we are not in a defensive
posture. . .We're in a fact-finding mode.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts, even police agreed, remained resolutely unclear
Thursday, with some more muddled than others. What is known is that
Miller's friends and family called police for help early Monday
after they could not rouse an unresponsive and possibly unconscious
Miller. No one disputes that those same officers ended up killing
the young woman they set out to save.
</P>
<P>
   What is unknown is what happened to Miller after she pulled her
Nissan Sentra into the gas station with a flat tire around 2 a.m.,
or where she got the .380 caliber semiautomatic handgun that was on
her lap. Initially police said Miller, who lived in nearby
Rubidoux, fired the first shot, touching off the fusillade of
police bullets. They have since backed off that statement, giving
locals another unknown with which to grapple.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results were due late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of gray areas: How'd she lock the car, how'd she
end up foaming at the mouth, why'd the police break a window when
they couldn't wake her instead of waiting for someone to get a
spare key?'' said Don Bardo, president of the Urban League of
Riverside and San Bernadino Counties. ``At this point, we are
willing to say they used excessive force.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Chris Manning, a Riverside police spokesman, declined
Thursday to say how many shots the officers _ four white and one
Hispanic, all now on paid administrative leave _ fired into
Miller's car. Rumors continued to put the number at more than two
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, dispute residents' claims of repeated and
regular police misconduct. In 1998, there were seven shootings by
officers and four deaths, no more than usual, and police were
exonerated in each of the investigations completed so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things get clumped together and they want to make a nexus
where members of the `minority' community have been arrested and
hogtied and shot and killed, and it doesn't work out that way,''
Manning said. ``These are not related incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, however, black residents of Riverdale insisted
there is a correlation between their daily interactions with police
and Miller's killing. Several men at the meeting related how
police, guns at the ready, regularly approached their cars. Women
spoke of mistrusting them so much that they would not call police
if their own cars broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might be black, but we are definitely not animals,'' said
Lou Smith, whose granddaughter, a cousin of Miller's, witnessed her
killing. ``I don't want to take no more of this crap.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger, however, wasn't directed solely at police. Residents
spoke of underfunding of youth programs and a lack of educational
opportunities. People said they wanted more action from black
organizations before a crisis arises.

<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras _ Two months after a hurricane mauled
this country, it is still unclear how many Hondurans died in the
storm, but the government has been forced to retreat from its
earlier conclusion that at least 7,000 people perished.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here acknowledge that their initial death tolls,
gathered from panicked local officials in the chaotic days just
after the storm passed, were riddled with inaccuracies. In some
cases, local officials assumed that hundreds had died because
entire neighborhoods had been destroyed, but later learned that the
vast majority of villagers in those places had sought higher ground
and had survived.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, the government cut its official death toll
from the storm by close to a quarter _ from 7,007 down to 5,657 _
and suspended the governor of Santa Barbara Province for allegedly
inflating the casualty numbers in that state. The accuracy of even
the smaller figure is in doubt, however, because it includes at
least 2,600 deaths reported by distraught family members but never
confirmed, said the man in charge of the government's numbers,
Arturo Corrales. Even the 3,000 confirmed deaths were not based on
a body count.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane moved across Honduras in late October and early
November, dumping record amounts of rain as it disintegrated and
causing widespread flooding across the country. Though the winds
quickly abated, floods and landslides wiped away parts of many
towns and villages and severed communications and wrecked the road
network.
</P>
<P>
   With journalists raising questions about the death toll and with
international donors pumping hundreds of millions of dollars in
disaster relief into Honduras, President Carlos Flores has ordered
a review of all damages attributed to the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with counting the victims of natural disasters are
common in Third World countries, where many local officials are
poorly trained and illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 medical and engineering students have been
enlisted for the review and are being trained to conduct a survey
in the worst-hit towns.
</P>
<P>
   With help from United Nations human rights workers and equipment
provided by the United States, the students are fanning out in
small groups to try to compile accurate assessments not only of
deaths but also of damage to crops, roads and bridges, officials
said. Flores has promised that they will complete the survey and
that the government will produce an accurate count by mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, the mayors of small towns and villages were
called to emergency meetings in regional capitals to discuss the
death toll. The government has ordered these officials to compile
new lists of the dead and missing, complete with identification
numbers and names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to straighten the numbers out because there is no
excuse not to have the right numbers anymore,'' said Col. Jorge
Andino Almendares, who is overseeing the government relief
operation in the northeastern part of the country, one of the
hardest-hit areas, after meeting Dec. 16 with more than 40 local
mayors in San Pedro Sula. ``Today we asked for the names of the
dead. It has to go down to the village level.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in the absence of a complete study, it has become clear
that the initial estimates of the dead were not supported by a
count of bodies. In the municipality of El Progreso, for instance,
in Yoro Province, local officials at first reported that at least
100 people had died in floods and landslides in their jurisdiction,
which includes about 54 villages along the Ulua River. That figure
is still being used in the official tally for the northern region
that military officials are keeping at the disaster relief
headquarters in San Pedro Sula.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent interviews, disaster officials in El Progreso
conceded that the figure had been just a rough estimate. They said
they had confirmed 17 deaths at the most _ 9 members of one family
who were buried on a remote hillside in the town of Las Minas and 8
people drowned in various places in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lie,'' Oscar Ardon, the president of the federation of
local village leaders in the region, said of the 100 figure.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Caseres, director of the local community development
office in El Progreso, explained that in the early days of the
storm, officials assumed that almost everyone reported missing was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have at least 105 missing people,'' she said. ``But we
don't know if they are in some other place or they are buried
here.'' Mrs. Caseres said that many parts of the El Progreso
district are still cut off because of impassable roads and that it
was possible the death toll would rise again before all was said
and done.
</P>
<P>
   Nelly Soliman de Anariva, the president of the emergency
committee in El Progreso, insisted that at least 27 deaths had been
confirmed and that 63 more people were missing, though she could
not explain the discrepancy between her numbers and those provided
by the group of village leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now starting a program to find out how many deaths
there were by village,'' she said. ``The exact figure is not known
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just south of El Progreso, in the hamlet of Guacamaya, early
unconfirmed reports were that at least 70 people had died when a
third of the community, about 82 houses, was buried in mud and sand
during a flood. But the residents of the destroyed section of the
village appeared a day later, said the local community leader, Juan
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the destruction, I thought everyone was dead,''
Garcia said, though he denied ever reporting to his superiors that
70 people had died. ``It was terrible. I knew that if they hadn't
gone to the hills, they were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle that we didn't have any deaths here,'' he
added. ``I can't really explain it.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern was repeated in other areas. One of the
worst-hit villages was Morolica in Choluteca province in southern
Honduras. Though the floods left nothing standing other than the
church and a handful of houses, the entire population of the town
made it to high ground, partly because of the heroic work of the
mayor to evacuate the town.
</P>
<P>
   In one village in Santa Barbara, the mayor reported just after
the storm that dozens of people had died, after seeing that an
entire section of the town had been washed away, but most of the
residents returned a day later. It turned out there were no deaths
at all in the village, officials in the national capital now say.
</P>
<P>
   The appointed governor of Santa Barbara, Lucila Esperanza
Barahona de Castro, was suspended in early December after
investigators could verify only about 282 of the 1,159 deaths she
reported in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales, an engineer who was drafted by the government just
after the storm to compile figures, said from the beginning that
statisticians in Tegucigalpa, the national capital, had trouble
checking the accuracy of the information that was coming in from
remote regions.
</P>
<P>
   Roads were out. Telephone lines were down. And many of the
figures for dead and missing, he said, were being compiled by
untrained community leaders in small villages. Many of the reports
arrived in suspiciously round numbers _ 100 here, 900 there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand we were dealing with people who can't
read or write,'' he said in an interview in mid-December. ``We
decided every piece of information was better than nothing,'' he
added, referring to the initial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales also said there appeared to be a big overlap between
the figures for those counted as missing and the dead. In some
cases, the numbers submitted were identical.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had directed the staff of engineers digesting the
numbers to assume that all the dead were also being counted as
missing, usually the larger number. In each case, they added the
figures together and divided by two to get what they thought was an
accurate estimate of the dead. Using this method, he said, the
death toll at one point in the days just after the hurricane rose
to almost 8,000, though the government never put out a figure of
more than 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was always based on reported deaths, Corrales
said, not on body counts. But as missing people began to appear in
the days after the storm subsided, many did not report to the local
authorities, so that information was never passed along to the
capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Corrales said, the government has about 3,000 people
reported dead by credible authorities like a mayor, a local
official or a police officer. In some cases, the bodies were found,
but in many cases the bodies were either washed out to sea or
buried in mud from flooding or landslides. About 2,600 more people
have been reported dead by family members or untrained local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in addition to the 5,600 the government
believes have died, at least 8,000 people have been reported
missing. He said he believed that when the final study was done,
the death toll would be fairly close to the 7,000 figure his office
put out earlier. He acknowledged, however, that a complete study
was needed to resolve the inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my responsibility,'' Corrales said. ``I'm pretty sure the
numbers are not going to change.''

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR and LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is an Argentine-born preacher who appeals to both Hispanic
and Anglo audiences. Another is a young megachurch pastor in
Southern California who peppers his sermons with quotes from
Hollywood stars and sports idols. A third is an African American
equally beloved by convicts and unhappy homemakers. And then there
are two of the Rev. Billy Graham's children.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the colonial era, the United States has had a
pre-eminent preacher who played an unofficial role as national
evangelist, preaching a simple message of repentance and salvation
and drawing vast crowds in the process. For the last 50 years, that
role has been filled by the Rev. Billy Graham. But at the turn of
the century, with Graham now 80, the question arises who, if
anyone, can take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Graham revolutionized revival evangelism, using every available
technology from lapel microphones to television and radio to
satellite links. He preached a straightforward Gospel message that
appealed to Christians of every denomination. When other
evangelists sullied their names in scandal, Graham's stayed clean.
While others joined political wars, he ministered to every
president from Eisenhower to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars and observers of American evangelism predict that
no single preacher now on the scene has the universal appeal of
Graham, who rose to prominence when a stadium crusade was like
Barnum and Bailey coming to town. Today, stadium evangelists
compete for attention with televangelists, with self-help gurus and
motivational speakers who blend religion and psychology, and with
powerful pastors who draw thousands to weekly services in their
megachurches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Graham is not an official position in the Christian
church that must be filled. It's not an office,'' said William
Martin, a professor of sociology at Rice University and author of
``A Prophet With Honor'' (William Morrow, 1991), a biography of
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   But others survey the field and conclude that it may be only a
matter of time before one candidate, through charisma, organization
and the ability to capture the popular imagination, catapults to
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation there is somebody who emerges as what I
call the point man,'' said Stephen F. Olford, a British evangelist
whose fervent speaking style inspired Graham 53 years ago, and who
now trains new preachers at the Stephen Olford Center for Biblical
Preaching in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Keith J. Hardman, a professor of religion and philosophy at
Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pa., said, ``It's very true that
Christians generally seem to have room for one extremely prominent
person at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than a dozen interviews with scholars, theologians,
religious historians and evangelical leaders, a handful of
evangelists were consistently mentioned as possible successors to
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The five most frequently mentioned evangelists who are drawing
large crowds are: Luis Palau, Franklin Graham, Anne Graham Lotz,
Greg Laurie and Bishop T.D. Jakes. Like Billy Graham, all five
travel widely preaching the Bible to large crowds in stadiums and
conference centers.
</P>
<P>
   Two have their own churches, the others are itinerant preachers.
All attract Christians of many denominations. All use an emotional
``altar call'' in which new believers step forward to declare their
``decision for Christ.'' All use media including television and
radio, books, CDs or web sites. All have refrained from trying to
mobilize their flocks for political candidates or causes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Luis Palau may be the most prominent evangelist in the United
States after Graham, although he built his reputation at mass
events in other parts of the world, particularly Latin America,
where he is still best known.
</P>
<P>
   A Hispanic American raised in Argentina, he speaks impeccable
English and has a crossover appeal that draws multiethnic
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   His Luis Palau Evangelistic Association in Portland, Ore.,
organized in 1978, estimates that he has spoken before 12 million
people in 67 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most difficult countries of the world to
communicate the Gospel, and feel you've gotten past the facade, are
the Western nations,'' Palau said, in an interview. ``I think
western Europe is probably the most difficult because of the
cynicism and, frankly, the atheism.''
</P>
<P>
   Palau, 64, is a native of Argentina whose parents converted from
Roman Catholicism to evangelical Protestantism. He attended an
English-language boarding school, was born again at age 12 and
worked for a bank as a young man. At 18, he heard a radio broadcast
of the Rev. Billy Graham and decided that some day he too would be
an evangelist speaking to stadiums full of people. He moved to the
United States in 1960, attended Bible college and became an
American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Like Graham's organization, Palau's association is run by an
independent board of directors and stages ``crusades'' only when
invited to a city by its churches, which then collaborate with him.
</P>
<P>
   Palau hews to an ambitious schedule. In 1999, he said, he will
preach at events in Turkey, Mexico, Great Britain, France, India,
Latvia, Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   He will devote the month of April to preaching in Maine, with
three or four days in Lawrence, Mass., doing a ``Hispanic-only
crusade'' for that city's large Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   But Palau does not rely entirely on mass events. He has written
43 books. He produces three short daily radio programs, two in
Spanish, one in English, that together are heard in 22 countries.
His weekly cable television program airs across the country. His
crusades are saturation efforts, buttressed with nightly hourlong
television programs and daily luncheons to which business and civic
leaders are invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever there's a measure of sophistication, where people
feel I'm above being emotionally rattled in a rally, they will come
to luncheons,'' Palau said.
</P>
<P>
   Palau, at ease and animated on stage, often peppers his
preaching with references to contemporary culture and societal
problems like divorce and teen suicide. In one appearance last year
in Rapid City, Palau read aloud from a page of singles
advertisements, drawing hoots at the consistent requirements for
good looks. ``If that's the way we choose a spouse, no wonder there
is such trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham, in a telephone interview in December, said he
had just returned from Central America, where the relief
organization he runs, Samaritan's Purse, pledged to build houses
for families displaced during Hurricane Mitch. ``We're going to do
all our work through the churches,'' said Graham, oldest son of the
Rev. Billy Graham.
</P>
<P>
   His involvement with Samaritan's Purse _ whose budget next year
will be $79 million and which has taken him to some of the world's
most sorely afflicted areas _ echoes the work of his maternal
grandfather, Dr. Nelson Bell, a medical missionary in China.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham has drawn more attention for his rise within his
father's organization, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.
In 1995, its directors elevated Franklin Graham to first vice
chairman, and designated him his father's eventual successor as
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has bestowed a prominence and an expectation on
Graham, 46, that few might once have anticipated. The fourth of
Billy Graham's five children, he was, by his own telling, a
somewhat wayward youth, a heavy smoker and a none-too-attentive
student who preferred hunting to books.
</P>
<P>
   He became a born-again Christian several days after his 22nd
birthday in July 1974, when Billy Graham took him to lunch, told
his son he sensed a spiritual struggle within the young man and
said he was praying for him.
</P>
<P>
   It has only been since 1989 that Franklin Graham has began to
preach at mass events arranged by his father's organization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But although the younger Graham bears a strong physical
resemblance to his father, there are clear differences between the
two. The son, a business major in college, has not attempted to be
a pastor to the politically powerful. He favors jeans over suits,
and has been photographed astride his motorcycle. Married with four
children, he lives on a quiet back road near Boone, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Billy Graham calls his mass meetings ``crusades,''
Franklin has christened his own events ``festivals'' _ with plenty
of contemporary-sounding Christian music _ a more secular term to
appeal to a wide audience of potential converts.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, the association held such events in seven
cities, in Australia, Peru and the United States. (Next year, he
will preach in Bolivia, Canada, Jamaica and Scotland, as well as
the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to speak no more than 15 to 20 minutes, so that people
will hear you and listen to you,'' he said. ``I just realize that
to convey the truth of the Gospel, you don't have to take a lot of
time.'' In his preaching, he moves quickly to his point: no
salvation apart from Jesus Christ. His gestures sometimes reflect
his father's, like pointing with an index finger and raising a
Bible in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are cautious in assessing how effective he is. ``People
want to see how does Franklin stack up against his father,'' said
Martin, the author. ``I think they're generally pleased with what
they see. But that doesn't mean he will draw crowds for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham said, ``I aspire to wanting to be faithful to
God and his leading in my life. But I'm not my father and I have no
intention of trying to be Billy Graham, because I can't be Billy
Graham. But at the same time, I feel God has called me to preach.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Graham Lotz, one of the Rev. Billy Graham's three
daughters, calls herself a Bible teacher, and has said she had no
ambition to be an evangelist in the style of her father. But the
former full-time homemaker and mother of three adult children has
accepted invitations to speak before large groups around the world
and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, on a visit to southern India, she found herself
taken to a soccer stadium full of thousands of expectant people and
asked to give an evangelistic message like Billy Graham does.
Although Mrs. Lotz told her hosts that was not what she did, she
stepped into the pulpit and preached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there thinking, I'm an American housewife, I
don't belong here,'' she recalled. ``But I just stepped aside and
let God take over. And it's amazing what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mrs. Lotz, 50, lived a quiet life. A tall, slender
woman who has Graham's wide-set eyes and prominent nose, she
married Daniel Lotz, a Raleigh, N.C., dentist, when she was 18. She
says that the marriage went through a difficult period several
years later when she questioned whether she still loved her
husband. She said she then turned to prayer and Bible study, which
helped restore her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lotz volunteered to lead a women's Bible study group in
1976, which proved highly popular, drawing hundreds of women each
time she offered it. In 1988, feeling called to something larger,
she began AnGeL Ministries (the name incorporates her initials), to
allow her to travel and preach worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   What she does, she said, is try to relate the Bible to how
people live: ``I take a passage of scripture, then try to explain
it and apply it to their lives in such a way that the scripture is
dominant.'' She speaks in venues large and small, from stadiums to
college classes, and is in such demand that she says she can accept
only about one of every 20 invitations she receives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lotz, who is not an ordained minister, has occasionally
encountered resistance among conservative evangelicals opposed to
women preaching. A few years ago, some ministers at a conference
turned their backs to her.
</P>
<P>
   But her abilities as a speaker and Bible teacher have also won
her praise. ``A lot of times,'' she said, ``I've had a pastor come
up to me, and he's said all of his life he believed a woman
couldn't do what I just did.''
</P>
<P>
   Olford, who runs the school for training evangelists in Memphis,
said Mrs. Lotz received more applause than her father at two
evangelism conferences in Europe. ``She knows the Bible backwards
and forwards,'' he said. ``She has a tremendous gift of
communication, and a dignity and presence which is most
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   In preaching, she, too, has inherited some of her father's
gestures, like his emphatic, two-handed, chopping motions. And like
her father and her brother Franklin, she gives an ``altar call''
after she preaches, inviting people to come forward and declare
their faith in Christ, an approach she acknowledged was unusual for
a woman speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I resist people pressing me into my father's mold,'' she
said. ``I would love to be like him in the preaching. But my gift
is a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When he goes to the beach in his native southern California, the
Rev. Greg Laurie, 46, sometimes carries a volume of biblical
exegesis by the 19th century Baptist scholar C.H. Spurgeon along
with a ``People'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Laurie, a pastor who spends several weekends a year as a
stadium evangelist, said he wants to find ways to frame a biblical
message in terms the average American can grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My challenge is to speak in common English, and use terms and
expressions that people will understand,'' he said. ``That's why I
try to stay current with our culture, so I can be understandable to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Laurie, pastor of Harvest Christian
Fellowship in Riverside, Calif., has run Harvest Crusades,
preaching half a dozen three- and four-day weekends each year in
stadiums from Honolulu to Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He began his efforts at the suggestion of a mentor, the Rev.
Chuck Smith, pastor of Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, Calif., a
church that grew out of the ``Jesus Movement'' among young people
in the early 1970's. As a high school student, Laurie became a
born-again Christian after hearing a minister from Smith's church.
Calvary Chapel has spawned something like a denomination, a loose
association of hundreds of new congregations, Laurie's among them.
</P>
<P>
   A Laurie event typically lasts 90 minutes. Bands play rock or
pop tunes with Christian lyrics and he gives a sermon, appealing in
a conversational style to his listeners to accept Jesus as their
savior.
</P>
<P>
   As he preaches, Laurie cites quotations from movie stars and
athletes that he culls from popular magazines in the hope that they
will help him make his point about the need to rely on God. He
tries to keep his sermons simple, but to raise big questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the meaning of life? What happens after I die? Why am
I here? Whatever my text is, I'll get around to those things,'' he
said. ``Of course, the heartbeat of the Gospel is the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ, and you have to get around to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Only recently has Laurie begun to reach beyond his regional base
in the Southwest, so he is not as well known as some other
evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Keith J. Hardman, a professor of religion and philosophy at
Ursinus College in Collegeville, Pa., and the author of a biography
of the 19th century revivalist Charles G. Finney, attended a
Harvest event for young people this fall. Laurie preached a
``standard evangelistic message, but very much youth-oriented,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie's hobbies would appear to enhance that appeal. Married
with two sons, he has been photographed in evangelical magazines
riding his Harley-Davidson. A native of Orange County, he also
surfs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his future in an interview, Laurie, who serves on
the board of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said that
in a conversation with Graham recently, ``he mentioned to me that
he would like to see me go into full-time crusade evangelism.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie said that does not mean he is thinking about leaving his
church. ``I always shy away from any illusion that I could take his
mantle,'' he said. ``It would take 100 men to take his mantle.''
Bishop T.D. Jakes Sr., 41, began preaching full-time 16 years ago
in his native Charleston, W.Va. But he became more visible
nationally in the mid-1990's, after his sermons began being
broadcast on a religious cable network and Black Entertainment
Television, and after he moved his ministry to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes, who is married and the father of five children, is senior
pastor of the Potter's House, an independent church that draws
several thousand people. A Pentecostal minister, he is not well
known among experts who follow rising evangelists, but he has
developed a grass-roots following, enough to propel some of his
books onto the bestseller list of the Christian Booksellers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jakes has become known especially for speaking about how God can
help people overcome personal pain, and has developed a conference
for women called ``Woman, Thou Art Loosed,'' whose title comes from
words spoken by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke as he heals a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What started out many years as a group of women in a Bible
class went to 52,000 women in the Georgia Dome last year,'' Jakes
said, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of reaching people with a Gospel message, he said, ``In
this no-holds-barred generation in which we live today, the message
doesn't change, but perhaps the method will. I think we're talking
more openly today about pain and dysfunction than the previous
generation did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakes has also developed a seminar for men; his major meetings
are broadcast by satellite into prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His ministry has also drawn the attention of the secular world.
Last March, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk
spoke at a groundbreaking ceremony as Jakes' church began work on a
social services center for poor people, to be called the City of
Refuge. In September, Jakes was invited to a breakfast for clergy
members at the White House, at which President Clinton confessed to
having sinned in his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A broad-shouldered, bespectacled man with a neatly trimmed
goatee, Jakes strides the blue-carpeted stage at Potter's House,
preaching before a sanctuary that seats 5,000. Taking a Bible verse
and discussing how it might be directly applied to the life of his
congregants, he begins his sermons almost like a lecture, using
both index fingers to emphasize a point.
</P>
<P>
   But his delivery gradually builds in force, prompting members of
his racially mixed congregation to respond vigorously. Some raise
their hands, some applaud and some stand and shout amen.

S. KOREA SIGNS BANK-SALE AGREEMENT WITH GE CAPITAL, NEWBRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The South Korean government signed an agreement Thursday
to sell a controlling stake in Korea First Bank to a consortium led
by GE Capital, the world's largest nonbank financial services
company, and Newbridge Capital, a buyout fund backed by the
financier David Bonderman's Texas Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
   Coming 15 months after the government nationalized Korea First,
the agreement sets the pace and could well establish a blueprint
for other Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand and Indonesia,
that are struggling to shore up their financial systems in the
midst of one of the deepest economic downturns since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price was not disclosed, and a spokeswoman for the
Financial Supervisory Commission, the government watchdog agency
for the banking system watchdog, said the price and many other
important details were not final.
</P>
<P>
   Should the deal be concluded _ and several agreements between
foreign investors and Korean companies have already fallen apart _
it would be significant in a couple of respects.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is the clearest vote of confidence that the government
of President Kim Dae-jung has received from a foreign investor
since the Asian economic crisis took hold here last year. It also
marks the start of the final phase of government efforts to
overhaul South Korea's debt-laden financial system, underscoring
the swiftness with which Kim and his economic team have moved to
repair parts of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an achievement for the Korean government and for
Morgan Stanley to attract such high-quality bidders into the Korean
market,'' said Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild,
who is an adviser to the Halla group, a large Korean conglomerate
undergoing a painful reorganization, and to the Chohung Bank,
another troubled South Korean bank. ``I think it's another sign
that the Korean economy is getting fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was retained by the government to
sell Korea First and Seoul Bank, another nationalized bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers involved in the discussions said Thursday that the
government was seeking at least $2 billion for a portion of the
93.8 percent stake it acquired in August 1997 when it recapitalized
Korea First by nationalizing it after two large corporate
bankruptcies effectively made it insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   The selling point of the consortium's bid was apparently its
willingness to take only a 51 percent stake. The other bidder, HSBC
Holdings PLC, parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, wanted a
much bigger stake, as large as 80 percent, according to one person
close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But the government wanted to hang on to more of its stake than
that. Presumably, if a buyer succeeds in turning Korea First
around, its shares will be worth more in the future, and that would
help the government recover a bigger portion of the 1.5 trillion
won of tax money _ currently almost $1.25 billion _ that it used to
recapitalize the bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, Korea First's capital-adequacy ratio stood
at 7.78 percent, up from a negative 2.7 percent at the end of 1997.
The Bank for International Settlements, which sets guidelines for
international banking supervision, has established 8 percent as the
minimum standard for a bank's capital adequacy _ the percentage of
the institution's assets held as reserve capital.
</P>
<P>
   But after June, the government was forced to give Korea First a
second capital injection, in part because of severity of the
economic crisis. Korea First now has 3 trillion won in
nonperforming loans _ almost $2.5 billion at today's exchange rate
_ and the government has pledged to buy back any more loans that go
bad in the first year after the consortium's purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale of Korea First Bank will help the country to bolster
its financial industry by acquiring advanced financial
technologies,'' Lee Hun Jai, head of the Financial Supervisory
Commission, said at a news conference Thursday in Seoul.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No doubt some analysts will contend that a deal with HSBC would
have better served the government's goals. HSBC is one of Asia's
few remaining banking powerhouses, and its involvement in the
restoration of the South Korean banking system would have been
reassuring to many investors.
</P>
<P>
   But GE Capital is also adept at financial management, and HSBC
may end up owning part of Seoul Bank, which the government has also
nationalized and promised to sell by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by selling to the GE Capital consortium, the
government may be hoping to mute criticism that it is selling
Korean assets to foreigners in a fire sale. Were HSBC to buy the
bank, it would forever become part of HSBC. But because GE Capital
and Newbridge are financial buyers rather than strategic ones, the
bank may again return to Korean hands through a sale of stock or
some other exit strategy that allows them to gain a hefty return on
their investment. Newbridge's main strategy is to buy into
distressed companies in the hope of turning them around and
reselling them at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   For GE Capital, a General Electric Co. unit, the agreement
represents another step in its expansion across Asia since the
economic crisis began in Thailand in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And for Newbridge, the deal puts its name in the spotlight. The
relatively little-known fund has been on an Asian shopping spree,
buying an electronics business from Astra Indonesia and Haitai
Beverage from the bankrupt Haitai Group of South Korea. This deal
will significantly raise its visibility.

SPEEDY ACTION URGED ON CHINA'S THEFT OF TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading Senate Republican on Thursday called a
special House committee's findings that China obtained or stole
some of the United States' most sensitive military technology
``extremely troubling,'' and said the Senate should act quickly to
address the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who last year led an investigation
into China's efforts to funnel covert contributions to the 1996
U.S. election campaigns, said his Governmental Affairs Committee
may hold additional hearings into the issues raised by the House
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extremely troubling findings,'' Thompson said in
telephone interview. ``But it should come as no surprise to those
who have been following our export policies and the activities of
the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been well known for some time that China has been
actively involved in trying to obtain technology information, and I
believe that our policies have played into their efforts,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee concluded that over the past two decades,
China obtained, sometimes by theft, some of the country's most
sensitive military technology, including nuclear-weapons design.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who chairs the House panel
investigating the technology transfers, said on Wednesday that the
nine-member committee unanimously approved a report concluding that
``national security harm did occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These transfers are not limited to missile-satellite
technology, but cover militarily significant technologies,'' Cox
told reporters, citing ``serious, sustained'' efforts by China
during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations to acquire
sensitive U.S. military technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said Thursday they did not
expect to receive a copy of the 700-page report until next week.
The classified five-volume report contains 38 specific
recommendations for legislative remedies and executive-branch
actions.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations cover a wide range of issues, from security
at the nuclear laboratories to the handling of intelligence data to
export-control policies.
</P>
<P>
   But until Congress and the administration can agree on a
declassified version of the report in the next several weeks,
lawmakers and policy-makers said it would be difficult to discuss
the findings and their significance.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials familiar with the report said, however,
that the findings agree with assessments by the Pentagon and State
Department that information shared with Chinese scientists by two
U.S. companies, Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space and
Communications, had improved Beijing's ability to launch satellites
and long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive part of the report may be evidence of a
pattern that China stole nuclear-weapons design technology from
U.S. nuclear laboratories, said one person who has read the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Thursday, a government spokesman expressed China's
``strong resentment'' of the House report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal exchanges on technology and trade between China and the
United States serve the common interests of both sides,'' said Zhu
Bangzao, spokesman of the Foreign Ministry, at a regularly
scheduled press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The House report ``is totally groundless and irresponsible,'' he
said, adding that China hopes the United States will ``take
practical measures to eliminate barriers in our normal trade and
technology relationship, not the opposite.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LHASA, Tibet _ A man with a crumpled brown fedora picked through
the yak hoofs that lay on a roadside table, next to the slabs of
fresh red yak meat. The man, whose name was Gomchen, seemed to be
looking for something he could not find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these all you have?'' Gomchen asked, pushing up his hat
and rubbing his forehead, as though the fedora were one size too
small.
</P>
<P>
   The meat seller, Lobsang, was eager to make a sale on a slow
day, but he seemed to grow impatient with the way Gomchen kept
picking up the same hoofs, inspecting them and setting them back
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you buying or looking?'' Lobsang, who like many Tibetans
uses only one name, asked between swats at the flies that buzzed
around the hunks of yak meat on his tabletop. ``A hoof is a hoof.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomchen wandered off without a word to inspect the wares at
neighboring tables, where other meat sellers lounged patiently,
each with a makeshift canopy to shield his meat from the afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   It was just another day at the yak meat market.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet may be known around the world as a mountainous region
where a devoutly religious people have been persecuted by their
Chinese landlords, but everyone has to eat. In Tibet, shopping for
food inevitably includes a trip to the yak meat market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yak, tsampa, tea,'' Lobsang said, describing his diet with a
simplicity befitting this simple mountainous land. Tsampa is the
main staple in Tibet, a mix of barley flour and rancid yak butter
that tastes like flour with a little liquid butter added.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Tibetans are strict Buddhists, vegetarians are not
as common here as in some other Buddhist regions. Yak meat is
consumed in stew, in grilled hunks, and even _ particularly in
restaurants frequented by tourists _ in yak burgers. The main
restaurant in the Lhasa Hotel is called the Hard Yak Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the meat market was moving at Tibetan speed,
meaning things were slow. A few customers wandered up as the hours
stretched by, but many resembled Gomchen, minus the fedora, since
they looked more than they bought. A monk wearing an intricately
woven gold-and-crimson cap and oversized sunglasses, his arms
invisible under a full-length red robe, wandered from table to
table, looking at the yak meat in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is bad,'' said Lhamo, whose red brocade headdress is
the signature of Khampas, or people from Kham, a region in eastern
Tibet. ``Too many sellers, not enough buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A rough winter of 1997-98 was followed by serious flooding in
the summer. Though that might have set off a meat shortage, and
driven prices up, yak meat sellers said it scared many Tibetan
herders into thinking about what would happen if there was another
rough winter this season.
</P>
<P>
   So an unusually large number of them decided to slaughter their
yaks in the fall and cart the meat to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, where
prices are traditionally the highest. With so much supply, however,
the price of yak meat has fallen to 75 cents a pound, roughly half
what it was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials in Tibet boast that there are 1.5 million yaks
here now, up from roughly 600,000 in 1959, when Beijing assumed
full control over the region, as if that showed how beneficial
Chinese rule has been.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics are questionable in an area as remote and
inaccessible as Tibet, where 95 percent of the population are
herdsman and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It took Lobsang six days to haul his slaughtered yak from Kham
to Lhasa in the back of a truck. The truckless sellers ride a yak
to market and kill it after arrival. Tibetans often use yak hair
for clothing and carpets, and make shoes, coats and boats out of
the skin, and fashion decorations and utensils out of the horns.
The dung is dried for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   But it was yak hoofs that interested Gomchen. Not that he would
say why. G Yak hoofs could be had for a quarter apiece, the seller
said over and over. Instead, Gomchen picked up several hoofs,
inspecting each one closely, before putting it back on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are these all you have?'' he asked again, as if this yak-meat
seller might be hoarding more hoofs. But no, the seller said,
``What you see is what we have.''

<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ Twenty years ago, when he was chancellor of
West Germany, Helmut Schmidt thought there would be a single
European currency by the early 1980s. Instead, he is still carrying
around six different kinds of money in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have the German mark, English pounds, French francs,
Swiss francs and Italian lire, plus American dollars, but I always
end up just using credit cards,'' laughed Schmidt, who travels
frequently as a publisher of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   But as of January, he can write checks in euros, the common
currency that 11 countries in the European Union are introducing,
almost two decades later than he and other European leaders had
planned. And three years from now, he will finally be able to put
euro notes in his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's launching is a particular point of pride for Schmidt
and two other prominent European leaders, Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
once president of France, and Sir Edward Heath, the former prime
minister of Britain. The three men took some of the earliest steps
toward a single currency, in the 1970s, and kept promoting the idea
even when it lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have happened a lot earlier,'' said Schmidt, 80.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could have, agreed Sir Edward, 82, who negotiated the
1972 treaty that took Britain into the European Economic Community
when he was prime minister. Later that year, he and other European
leaders endorsed a plan devised by Pierre Werner, then the prime
minister of Luxembourg, for a common European currency to combat
the monetary instability caused by the collapse of the Bretton
Woods system, which had been based on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped then to have it done by 1980,'' he said, but the
sharp rise in oil prices in 1973 derailed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Giscard d'Estaing, now 72, and Schmidt, friends from the days
when both served as finance ministers, tried to get monetary union
back on the rails over drinks in Schmidt's lakeside cottage north
of here in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded fellow European leaders to establish something
called the European Currency Unit, expecting it to become coin of
the European realm by the early 1980s, but it failed to speed the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay was unnecessarily long,'' Giscard d'Estaing said in
an interview in the French Parliament, ``and without wanting to be
too severe, I think it was caused by indifference and to some
extent lack of financial literacy on the part of the European
leaders of the early 1980s. They did not ascribe the same
importance to it as we did, and maybe they were hesitant to get
into the technical details, so the system went into a kind of
hibernation from 1981 to 1988.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the collapse of communism in 1989, French President
Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pushed harder
for the common currency again, partly to bind a reunited Germany
more firmly into a new single European market.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her
successor, John Major, kept Britain out. And, Schmidt said, ``the
central bank officials in the other countries did not want to lose
their power so they invented a thousand conditions, but in the end
the idea finally prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd only listened to us'' was the common refrain in
separate interviews recently with these fathers of the euro as they
fretted impatiently for the long-awaited birth.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to them now, a common currency, strengthening the
unified market that came into its own in 1993 when the last customs
and tariff barriers fell in the European Union, will finally give
Europe the opportunity to become a global power.
</P>
<P>
   Heath harrumphed all reservations aside in an interview in his
London pied-a-terre, near Eaton Square. ``There's no single market
in the world without a single currency, not in Japan and certainly
not in the United States,'' he said. ``Imagine what the United
States would be now if each of the 50 states had its own
currency!''
</P>
<P>
   With new confidence in the stability of the economic and
monetary policy of Europe, according to the these most enthusiastic
of the euro's cheerleaders, dynamic growth could finally cure the
Continent's chronic unemployment problem. And investors around the
world, they say, may welcome a strong new currency that can
diversify portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   That could weaken the dollar and force up interest rates in the
United States, they concede, but they shrug that off almost as
easily as most presidents since Richard M. Nixon have shrugged off
the effects of U.S. monetary policy on smaller currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``America and Europe will continue to need each other into the
21st century,'' Schmidt said, ``but it remains to be seen whether
the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift
dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated ones, which means
the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to
attract investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Giscard d'Estaing, though, wishes the euro were not quite so
strong at the start. ``The dollar at the moment is a little too
weak,'' he said. ``I have the feeling the American economy is
slowing down a bit, and that the American authorities accept that.
There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to
strengthen, and a monetary policy for the euro that will try to
contain that tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in
German and French attitudes toward money. For Germany, a strong
mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the
war, a fact Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into
account when he and Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Germans, the idea of abandoning the Deutsche mark,
losing it, and entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments
they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent
central bank, was impossible,'' Giscard d'Estaing said. ``So
independence for the European central bank was an essential core
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the
mark surprised me, and I think it surprised them too. The strict
criteria, the requirement to cut budget deficits, the independence
of the central bank in the plan, all had the merit of reassuring
the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty
that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade
later, though not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred.
Britain, alas, will not use the euro, at least at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our original plan, the City of London would have been
the center of the whole deal,'' he said. Instead, he added, ``it
all went to Frankfurt,'' where the new European Central Bank is
located.
</P>
<P>
   All three leaders, with vivid memories of what World War II did
to their countries, said they hoped monetary union would force the
members of the European Union still closer, encouraging them to
share sovereignty in foreign, military and domestic policies, not
just economics.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, a junior officer in the Wehrmacht during the war,
looked out of his corner office high over prosperous Hamburg, a
city rebuilt on postwar trade with Britain and France, and
remembered seeing it as a vast expanse of rubble and flames strewn
with bodies after a huge raid by British and U.S. bombers in July
1943. ``I'll never forget it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Giscard d'Estaing, who joined the French Resistance as a
boy, were on opposite sides then, and both said French
reconciliation with Germany is at the heart of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the euro to be an instrument in the federative approach
to Europe,'' Giscard d'Estaing said. ``The word `federative' is a
French 18th-century word Montesquieu used. It means sharing power
or competence.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the same at all, he added, as the English word
``federal,'' as in the ``federal European superstate'' so dreaded
by Lady Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said it was nonsense to think that a common currency
would fail without a federal European state. ``Before 1914
Europeans had one currency: gold,'' he said. ``Parities were fixed
and did not change, and all countries followed the constraints that
the system entailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath, who fought Germans as a British artillery officer during
the war, thinks his country's reserve is a historical mistake. ``I
was the only one bold enough to do it,'' he huffed.
</P>
<P>
   British financial and stock markets, like the Continent's, will
start dealing in euros in January, even though Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government, like its Conservative predecessor, wants
to see how the euro works before Britain decides whether to give up
the pound. Giscard d'Estaing said he thought the British attitude
was entirely reasonable, but Heath disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the 1950s, Britain has stood aside while all the
European arrangements were made, so we had no influence on them,
and then we decided to come in later,'' Heath lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Britain first started negotiations for European membership in
1961, but France's autocratic president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed
it two years later. His successor, Georges Pompidou, relented in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're back on the old path,'' said Heath.
</P>
<P>
   A previous engagement, he said, would keep him from coming to
Hamburg on Jan. 6 for a delayed celebration of Schmidt's 80th
birthday, which was Dec. 23. But Giscard d'Estaing said he would be
there. ``We'll celebrate the arrival of the euro together,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Golden hands, moves set Warrick apart
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ As with any successful football program, Florida
State has its benchmark players _ those who set the standard that
all others at a position are judged by.
</P>
<P>
   At defensive back, the Seminole standard-bearer is Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   At quarterback, it's Charlie Ward, the 1993 Heisman Trophy
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Running back? Warrick Dunn. Middle linebacker? Marvin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a generation, Florida State's definitive wide
receiver has been Fred Biletnikoff. In fact, college football's top
award for receivers is named for the former Oakland Raider great.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Warrick could change all that. For all the steadiness
Biletnikoff showed over his career, no receiver at Florida State
ever has put together a highlight reel to match the one belonging
to the junior from Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he the best wide receiver we've had? I don't know if we can
say that just yet,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``But
he's certainly the most elusive and explosive one we've had. Once
he gets in the open field, he is hard to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Florida State receivers have had better seasons than
Warrick's 1998 statistics: 61 catches for 1,232 yards. But none has
made more plays that caused observers _ friend and foe alike _ to
shake heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching film of him the other day and several times I
just caught myself going `Wow,' '' said Tennessee cornerback Steve
Johnson, who will take his turn against Warrick in Monday night's
Fiesta Bowl. ``He's got moves I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense faces a dilemma as it prepares for Warrick.
The Volunteers have been successful all season by single-covering
receivers, freeing a defensive back to help against the run. But
teams who tried to single-cover Warrick have paid dearly, as
Tennessee coaches are aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch film of the guy and afterward you aren't able to
sleep at night,'' Tennessee defensive coordinator John Chavis said.
``We've played against a lot of great receivers here, but this guy
is something very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few examples from Warrick's video scrapbook for the 1998
season:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before an Oct. 10 meeting with Miami, several Hurricanes
suggested publicly that Warrick was overrated and promised to shut
him down. Warrick caught seven passes for 190 yards, including a
62-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the showdown at Georgia Tech on Oct. 24, Warrick caught
touchdown passes of 44 and 8 yards, and scored on a 16-yard reverse
that featured several mind-boggling moves.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the summer, North Carolina cornerback Dre' Bly ran into
Warrick during a photo shoot for a preseason All-America team. Bly
called Warrick out, saying he would shut him down when they met on
Oct. 31. Warrick caught three passes for 126 yards against the Tar
Heels, including a 33-yarder over Bly that set up a touchdown and a
56-yarder for another score.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Florida leading Florida State 12-6 at halftime on Nov.
21, Warrick caught a 32-yard touchdown pass and then threw a
46-yard touchdown pass on a reverse to lead the Seminoles to a
23-12 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to score points, sooner or later you have to get the
ball to the guys who can make plays,'' Florida State offensive
coordinator Mark
</P>
<P>
   Richt said. ``Peter can make plays as well as anyone we have
ever had here.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick will have a better shot at displacing Biletnikoff if he
comes back for his senior season, but right now that return is very
much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave (leaving) some thought earlier, but now I've put it out
of my mind,'' said Warrick, who averaged 20.2 yards per catch this
season. ``I'm just thinking about winning the national
championship. I'll think about leaving or staying when the game is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Warrick leaves, whenever that is, does he want to be
remembered as Florida State's greatest receiver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to say that Peter Warrick was a good person
off the field,'' the former high school quarterback said. ``I
really don't care what people are going to say about me in the
future, because once you're gone, you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   For the defensive backs who had to cover him the past three
years, Peter Warrick can't leave soon enough.

BRAZIL SLASHES MONEY FOR PROJECT AIMED AT PROTECTING AMAZON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Under intense pressure to reduce its
spending, the Brazilian government has slashed funds toward a $250
million pilot project backed by seven leading industrial nations
that has been the centerpiece of Brazil's efforts to save the
Amazon rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists warn that without Brazil's participation, the
project stands to lose almost all the donations yet to come from
the Group of Seven industrial nations. Under the main agreement,
approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil was to provide just
10 percent of the $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program pays for surveying the rain forest, and it has
been the principal vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for
indigenous reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying what is in the vast mysterious rain forest is seen as
the first step toward protecting it from destruction by ranchers,
loggers, farmers and miners.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven money was also earmarked for promoting
sustainable development, controlling deforestation and other
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the money also would have helped pay for setting
aside 10 percent of the rain forest, or 240,000 square miles, as
national parks and ecologically protected areas. Amid much fanfare,
Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, had pledged to
establish the protected areas during a visit to New York last
April.
</P>
<P>
   Covering an area half as big as the continental United States,
the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria
that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the decade, as other countries criticized
Brazil for failing to protect the rain forest, the government
insisted that wealthy nations pay to map the rain forest and to
protect its resources, and it frequently contended that the scale
of the program agreed to was insufficient to the task.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say that even that modest effort is now in
jeopardy. Under pressure to rein in its budget deficit, Brazilian
government officials have slashed spending across the board. A
recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is
spearheading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces
government spending on environmental programs by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pilot program, the Brazilian government provides
matching funds and manpower to administer the Group of Seven grant.
The government's revised budget, released in November, cuts the
amount Brazil can expect to get from the group to $6.4 million from
more than $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is arguably a far more irrational and perverse consequence
of the IMF agreement than even the harshest critics of the IMF
could have imagined,'' said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist
at the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Acre, in western Brazil, one of the nine states
covered by the rain forest, had developed a three-year program
counting on some $5 million of the Group of Seven funds to survey
and zone its forest. Ninety percent of the cost would have been
underwritten by the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was all under way and ready to move forward _ boom _
the cuts came,'' said Maria Janet Santos, who is coordinating
zoning for Acre's environmental protection agency. ``It really cuts
into the credibility of what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulo de Oliveira Lopes, who also works on the zoning project,
said that without the Brazilian government contribution, the
project would collapse. ``Without the resources of the G-7 to carry
out zoning, there's no way it can happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to vote on the budget by Jan. 15, and Sen.
Marina Silva of the opposition Workers' Party said the government
had not ruled out restoring the environmental funds if cuts could
be found elsewhere.

EDITORIAL: WHY THE MILLENNIUM COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 1:
</P>
<P>
   It seems only fair to begin 1999 by taking a strong stand on
whether we endorse holding a big millennial celebration next Dec.
31, or playing down the event. So far the countdown has not
produced much more than a catchy name for consumer products and a
list of the century's greatest books that ranks the Studs Lonigan
trilogy above everything written by Joseph Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   Purists claim that next New Year's Eve will not begin a new
millennium anyway, since mankind will not have actually lived
through a thousand-year cycle until midnight on Dec. 31, 2000.
Millennium-phobes argue that the whole event has an air of cultural
and religious chauvinism, and that the celebration of the 2,000th
anniversary of Jesus Christ's birth might be an event of more
interest to Christians than Muslims, Buddhists or Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to get technical, we actually passed the 2,000th
anniversary of Christ's nativity around 1995. The gap arises from
an error in computation made by Dionysius Exiguus, a sixth-century
monk who preferred the more humble name ``Dennis the Small.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis' real aim was to standardize the liturgical calendar, and
in the process he created the system of counting years we use
today, starting from the year he calculated Jesus was born. But we
know now that Dennis was off by more than four years. Herod, who
was ruler of Judea when Christ was born, died in 4 B.C., and Jesus'
own unrecorded birth must have happened a year or two earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis was probably distracted by his main concern, which was
resolving a complicated, bitter and longstanding dispute about when
to celebrate Easter. He lived in a time when people fought about
calendric issues with great passion but little information, a
combination that remains troublesome to this day.
</P>
<P>
   But his creation, however faulty, has endured and been adopted
as a secular measurement of enormous power and utility. It has
become the standard measure of time for nations that privately
prefer to calculate the years differently.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be 4698 in China, 1421 on the Islamic calendar,
5761 in Israel and 2390 to the Zoroastrians in India. But the
people in Shanghai, Bombay, Tel Aviv and Tehran will also know that
it will be 2000 for the purposes of business, international
relations and worrying about the Y2K computer crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming year, that fact will be the jumping off point
for a big planetary party, commemorated by everything from U.N.
documents to the marketing of millennial cheese products.
</P>
<P>
   Historians differ, by the way, on how the Western world
celebrated the last millennium, but chances are that the reports of
hysteria and anticipation of the end of the world were overstated
by later writers who felt that was the way the medieval mind ought
to have responded to the sight of all those zeros.
</P>
<P>
   The zeros, however, were only being used by people in places
like India and the Arab world, who were utterly indifferent to the
turnings of a calendar adopted by the Synod of Whitby, which
accepted Dennis' recommendation for numbering the years in 664.
</P>
<P>
   When the year 1000 rolled around in Christian Europe, the few
people who had calendars were counting with Roman numerals, and for
them, 1000 just meant the year ``M'' _ a tidy but somehow less
threatening concept.
</P>
<P>
   The year M was greeted in some places on Dec. 25. But others _
following another of Dennis' recommendations _ celebrated the turn
of the year on March 25, the feast of Jesus' conception. Spain and
Portugal did celebrate the New Year on Jan. 1, but they were still
counting the years from the date of the Roman conquest of the
Iberian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Even areas that shared a common calendar often did not have
enough common culture to take note of any events that happened more
than a few miles down the road. People's lives were for the most
part defined by the forests that covered most of the continent, by
terrors of the road and the inability to conceive of a world that
stretched beyond their own pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who wandered about without armed escort were regarded
as deserving whatever dreadful fate befell them. A monk who got
lost on his way to Chartres at the turn of the millennium recalled
having to cross a bridge after sundown by crawling over the shield
his guard placed to cover the holes in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   From a Western perspective, it was in every way a time of
groping in the dark. A scholar could yearn to read a certain book
without ever learning that it was available in a nearby monastery.
A peasant could pass life without meeting a stranger. People had
little sense of belonging to a nation, a culture or any secular
group larger than the men and women they could see around them.
</P>
<P>
   In China, Constantinople, Baghdad and Ghana, the citizens were
leading different and often more sophisticated lives. But almost no
one in Europe could conceive of their existence, let alone bridge
the gulfs of ignorance, race and religious hostility that separated
them.
</P>
<P>
   A thousand years later, we understand that there are other folks
with widely different histories and viewpoints sharing our planet,
and that, like it or not, their needs must be taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics, pedants and otherwise unclassifiable grumps may rightly
say that next New Year's Eve, we will be celebrating nothing more
than the 2,000th anniversary of the point at which we first began
counting _ five years too late, thanks to Dennis. But the
arbitrariness that some may denigrate makes the occasion more
universal in its humanness. The things that bind us, however
artificial, are worth noting and making a fuss over.
</P>
<P>
   For if we cannot always see into each other's souls, we have at
least agreed on what time it is, down to the last millisecond. We
all march forward, from history into the future, and we measure the
passage by a common system. That is a beginning worth celebrating,
an excuse for us all to look back and consider what our trip over
the last thousand years has meant. It is the context in which the
hubbub over the millennium makes perfect sense to us.

 &HT;    Tech's had its moments against Irish
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The 54th Gator Bowl will be the 32nd time
Georgia Tech and Notre Dame have matched up on the football field,
and the books are seriously unbalanced on the Tech side _ 4-26-1. A
TKO in prize-fight terms, but for all the times the Yellow Jackets
have gone down for the count, they have been witness to some
historical stuff in this off-and-on series that began in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   That was the sophomore season of the fabled ``Four Horsemen,''
Layden, Stuhldreher, Crowley and Miller. They had not yet become
immortalized in print. That was to follow later when Grantland Rice
sat down to his writing machine after Notre Dame had upset Army and
began his story, ``Under a blue-gray October sky ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Tech managed to win one in 1928, but it was a freshman who had
just crossed town from Boys High who deflated the Un-fighting Irish
13-6 on their field in South Bend in 1942. Clint Castleberry, Bobby
Dodd said later, ``might have been the best of them all, had he
lived.'' Soon after his only season, Castleberry joined the Army
Air Corps and died in a bomber crash in Africa. But he left his
mark on this series, this clean-cut halfback playing only his
second collegiate game. Even now, his 19 is the only football
number retired at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   It was ages before Tech would beat Notre Dame again, again in
South Bend on a snowy afternoon in 1959. Marvin Tibbetts, another
local high-school lad, did the deed this time at quarterback. The
score was 14-10. And as a Gator Bowl sidelight, Tibbetts ran 51
yards for a touchdown against Arkansas the next year, the first
bowl game a Dodd team ever lost.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech finally beat the Irish the fourth time in 1976 at
Grant Field, a game as strange as a three-legged dog. Gary Lanier
was a tidy little quarterback from Savannah, short and plump. He
might have been the starter because he reminded Pepper Rodgers so
much of himself, no picturesque physical attributes but a
competitive spirit. Lanier bumbfuzzled the Irish, 23-14, throwing
not one pass. In fact, he threw only 16 the whole season.
</P>
<P>
   That was the game in which Dan Devine, irritated by the fish
thrown at him out of the Tech student section, walked out on the
field holding a mackerel in his hand, appealing to the referee.
That was when it was said, ``Give him a loaf of bread and let him
feed the multitude.'' The next season, Devine got even. He
pulverized Tech 67-14 at South Bend and Pepper Rodgers hasn't
forgiven him yet.
</P>
<P>
   The tie was probably the sweetest moment of all, coming at the
time and circumstance as it did. Notre Dame arrived in Atlanta
rated No. 1 in the national polls in 1980, Bill Curry's first
season. Tech had won one game and wouldn't win another. All eyes
were on the Georgia-Florida game in Jacksonville. Nobody was paying
attention to Grant Field. Georgia was on its way to a national
championship and, in time, would beat this same Notre Dame in the
Sugar Bowl to nail it down.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech clawed and scratched its way to lead by a field
goal. Three quarterbacks came down wounded, leaving Tech with a
freshman utilityman, Ken Whisenhunt, to finish it off. Notre Dame
got a tie only in the closing minutes with a field goal that
wobbled between the posts. It was as sweet as any game any Georgia
Tech team ever won.
</P>
<P>
   Another little dollop of minutiae here. Remember the movie
``Rudy,'' the Notre Dame scrub, and Rudy's one big play? He sacked
another Rudy, Rudy Allen from Columbus, Tech's quarterback in 1974.
Tech lost that one 31-7.
</P>
<P>
   So, you see, while Tech's record lists heavily to the losing
side, there has been some historic stuff registered between these
two teams. It's amazing how winning one like this Gator Bowl can
take the sting out of all the defeats that have gone before. That
said, Happy New Year.

 &HT;    Jackets seek to reach elite
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ All season, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets
have talked about finishing strong, working a full 60 minutes and
taking every play as if it's the last.
</P>
<P>
   Today is the last chance for the seniors, Charlie Rogers, Jesse
Tarplin, Craig Page and Jerry Caldwell, who came in after Tech's
1-10 season in 1994 and now have the chance to reverse it to 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   A win over No. 17 Notre Dame (9-2) in today's Gator Bowl would
give the No. 12 Yellow Jackets their first 10-win season and their
first New Year's Day victory since 1990. It also would give them a
legitimate shot at breaking into the Top 10. Coupled with an ACC
championship shared with national-title contender Florida State and
the first victory against Georgia in eight years, a triumph today
also would place the 1998 team among the Tech elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win would really set this team as one of the special teams
at Georgia Tech,'' offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen said.
``(With) a loss, it's another good team. A win puts them in a
bracket that few of our teams are in. You've won an ACC
championship, you've won 10 games, you beat Notre Dame on New
Year's Day. That's got to set you a little bit apart.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss would tarnish what the Yellow Jackets have accomplished,
at least in the mind of one senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take away from having a great season,'' Rogers said.
``We've already had one big disappointment, losing to Boston
College. We don't want to have another one, especially when we're
favored....This is a big game. We took every game this year as a
championship game. This is just another championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory also would bring the Yellow Jackets full circle from
last season's opening 17-13 loss at Notre Dame. That game had given
Tech its first opportunity to regain some national prominence since
it played Arizona when the Wildcats were Sports Illustrated's
preseason No. 1 pick in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crushed by last year's defeat at Notre Dame,'' Rogers
said. ``I thought we had the game won. ... I don't want to feel
like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gator Bowl officials are expecting a sellout and the biggest
crowd since the 1989 Gator Bowl, when Clemson beat West Virginia
27-7 in front of 82,911 fans. That game was played before Alltel
Stadium was reconfigured to seat 72,433 for the Jacksonville
Jaguars. The Gator Bowl attendance mark hasn't gone over 54,000 in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame should be stronger than it was at the end of the
regular season, with quarterback Jarious Jackson ready to play
despite a partially torn right knee ligament. Jackson said
Thursday, ``I feel as close to 100 percent as I'm going to get.
It's real loose.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10th victory would not hold the same meaning for the Irish _
they have had five 10-win seasons in the past 10 years _ but it
still would mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average teams win nine games,'' Notre Dame linebacker Kory
Minor said. ``Good teams win 10.''

 &HT;    The pluck of Irish lives, still puts foes on defensive

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Peggy O'Leary wants everybody to know that
she bleeds white and gold for Georgia Tech instead of blue and gold
for those facing the Yellow Jackets in today's Gator Bowl. ``I used
to be a Notre Dame fan,'' O'Leary said, ``but not now.''
</P>
<P>
   It mostly is because O'Leary's son, George, coaches Tech's
football team these days. It also is because Peggy O'Leary joins
others in believing the myth that Notre Dame just doesn't ``Shake
Down the Thunder'' anymore in the psyche of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Let's return to the latter 1980s, when those associated with the
University of Miami began a new tradition around Notre Dame known
as hearing opponents trash the Irish's old traditions.
</P>
<P>
   One Miami player was asking, ``What's a Gipper?'' Another was
threatening to torch Touchdown Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   There was more of the same after Florida State replaced Miami as
Notre Dame's Evil Empire. Even Notre Dame athletics director Mike
Wadsworth admitted Thursday that most recruits don't know much of
the Irish's storied past until they arrive on campus.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us back to Peggy O'Leary, whose former love affair
with Notre Dame was helped by both of her parents coming from
Ireland. Peggy said George joined her three other sons and four
daughters as Fighting Irish zealots during their youth on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   All of Peggy O'Leary's children will join her in Alltel Stadium
with their families for this one. Peggy said they'll spend the
three hours rooting only for the team with ``GT'' on the side of
their gold helmets.
</P>
<P>
   As for Notre Dame, Peggy said, ``A lot of what Notre Dame meant
to people is dying out now. They had something special with Knute
Rockne, and it lasted until about Ara Parseghian.''
</P>
<P>
   Others would extend Notre Dame's glory years through the middle
of the Lou Holtz era. Whatever. Here's the truth about the myth
that Notre Dame has lost its mystique: It's a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy of Notre Dame, the Gator Bowl is enjoying its first
capacity crowd in a decade. In fact, 109 of the past 126 games
anywhere involving Notre Dame have been sellouts. The Texas A&AMP;M
athletics department began promoting its 2001 home game against
Notre Dame five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Notre Dame is the only football program with
contracts on national television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   And although Tech cornerback Kofi Smith said he joins many of
his peers in not knowing the Four Horsemen from a slice of
pastrami, Smith said that whatever Notre Dame had in the past still
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. Definitely,'' said Smith, who helped Tech nearly
pull an upset last season at Notre Dame. ``I've never played before
a crowd like that. From the time you stepped into the stadium, you
could feel the sense of urgency from the players and the fans. It
was a unique experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For my generation, Notre Dame's reputation is more about the
great players they've had in recent years. It makes it more
desirable for you to want to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weren't opponents saying the same thing about Notre Dame during
most of the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and
1990s?
</P>
<P>
   Yep.

SOME SENATE REPUBLICANS UNHAPPY WITH PROPOSAL ON CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first signs of serious discord among Senate
Republicans over impeachment, several senators, both conservatives
and moderates, said they opposed a proposal that would permit a
preliminary vote on articles of impeachment without a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a whitewash and a shirking of our responsibility the
Constitution gives us,'' said Sen. James Inhofe, a conservative
Oklahoman, in a telephone interview Thursday. ``We have to have
witnesses and have a full trial. How can someone vote without
hearing from witnesses and without hearing all the evidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who served as a
Senate committee lawyer during the Watergate hearings, echoed
Inhofe's concerns and said that the Senate must guard against
moving too hastily as it prepares to sit in judgment of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ```It's beginning to appear that there's an effort to cut this
down to a very short period of time at all costs,'' Thompson said
Thursday. ``It's important that we not try to jury rig some kind of
process that will solve our short-term political problems, but
might not do justice to our obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal that is now being floated by Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, the minority leader, the House and the White House would
take no more than two weeks, and as little as a few days, to make
their cases to the Senate. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist would
preside, but no witnesses would be called.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the proceeding, the Senate would vote on
whether the charges are serious enough, and the evidence behind
them strong enough to warrant a full trial that could lead to
Clinton's removal from office. The vote would require the approval
of 67 senators, the same number needed to convict and remove
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If the resolution fails, the Senate would then turn to a censure
proposal, an alternative that is already being hotly disputed.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the proposal is a compromise between Republicans,
who want a trial and a vote on articles of impeachment alleging
perjury and obstruction of justice, and Democrats, who want to put
forward a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition to the compromise idea places Lott in a bind as
he balances the desires of his conservative supporters for an
impeachment trial and the desire of moderates to wrap up the
proceedings swiftly, with Democratic cooperation and as little
political fallout as possible. Daschle said Thursday he believes
that the proposal has the backing of most Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissension among Republicans could be significant since,
under the Senate's complicated rules and its tradition of deference
to individual members, a single renegade can often stall
proceedings. If that happened now, a difficult situation could be
transformed into an untenable one for both the Senate and Lott
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader has made it clear he is aiming for a quick
transition from impeachment to Social Security, Medicare and other
legislative mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent is between a rock and a hard place,'' said Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa. ``He's looking at enormous public opposition to an
extended trial, but on the other hand, he's considering the
Senate's obligation to have a trial.''

 WASHINGTON: a trial.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, an influential Kentucky Republican and an
ally of Lott's, called the Lott-Daschle proposal a ``work in
progress'' and cautioned that it could change. Both Lott and
Daschle must present the idea to their colleagues next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the Senate's response on the proposal will be difficult
until then, since senators are on vacation scattered across the
country and difficult to contact. But in several interviews
Thursday, the initial reaction seemed to serve as a warning that
the idea could be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said he would back the Lott-Daschle proposal, arguing
that the Senate would, in effect, be voting on the articles of
impeachment and fulfilling its constitutional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Constitution, we have to dispose of the articles of
impeachment,'' said McConnell, who heads up the Senate Republican
campaign committee and will serve as chairman of the Rules
Committee in the next Congress. ``This motion sounds very much like
a disposition of the articles.''
</P>
<P>
   But others took a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he opposed the Lott-Daschle plan. ``I really don't
see how it could be done,'' Specter said. ``I don't see how
senators would be in a position to vote on that kind of an issue
without knowing a fair amount about the case by hearing evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're really asking you to do,'' Specter continued,
``is make a preliminary vote on impeachment. But to cast an
intelligent vote on that subject would require senators to make a
determination whether there really is a factual basis for
obstruction of justice or perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, the fourth-ranking Republican in
the Senate leadership, said he was still thinking over the
Lott-Daschle plan.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview, Craig sounded skeptical,
underscoring the need to give the House managers latitude to
present their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any judge or jury could effectively tell the
prosecution how they could present all their evidence,'' he said.
``I support our leaders' effort to support a timetable and a
process. But I reserve the right to adjust that timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, a
conservative advocacy group, flat-out called it a ``terrible
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If senators want to vote not to convict, then they ought to
have the courage to vote not to convict after a trial,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee who will serve as the chief prosecutor in the Senate,
weighed in on the idea on Wednesday, when he sent a strongly worded
letter to Lott, urging him to abandon the proposal and permit
witnesses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he was especially concerned with the notion that 67
votes, not a simple majority, would be required to initiate a
trial. With 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate, the
resolution's success would hinge on at least 12 Democrats, many of
whom would be unlikely to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate rules and its impeachment precedents required only
a majority vote to dispose of impeachment matters other than
conviction,'' Hyde wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson voiced a similar concern, as did Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're telling people in advance that you need a quick vote
and a super majority just to keep this alive, you're sending all
these wrong messages,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that 51 senators _ a majority _ may feel strongly
enough about the evidence to want to move to a trial and under the
current proposal, their wishes would be unjustifiably cast aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be quite a few people, a majority of people, who
say, `Wait we need more facts,' '' Thomas said. ``If it took
two-thirds to go forward, Democrats won't vote for it, and it would
be over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to abbreviate too much this final vote,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Senate could muster the 67 votes that would be
needed for a full trial, McConnell said, ``Who knows? We are all
operating under the assumption that there is not likely to be 67
votes to remove the president under any event.''

 &HT;    49ers, Packers showing cracks
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like the thick fog that blanketed the Bay area earlier
in the week, a veil of uncertainty hangs over the San Francisco
49ers and Green Bay Packers, two franchises that have defined NFL
stability in recent years. By Monday morning, both clubs could have
coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the imperial have become the imperiled. Franchises
that have operated with seamless precision have bared their
unseemly sides.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers and the Packers meet in a first-round playoff game in
San Francisco on Sunday, and, certainly, few wild-card games have
been of this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been teams that operated on an even keel,'' 49ers
strong safety Tim McDonald said. ``Now we're heading into choppy
waters, and it's a place that neither of us is accustomed to being.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling,'' McDonald said, ``and I'm betting they
have it as well, that we're going into a game unsure how we'll come
out. It's like driving into a tunnel not knowing what might be on
the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   It is stunning enough that two teams with a combined nine
division titles in the '90s _ at least one has participated in the
past six conference championship games _ would be taken down a peg
in the same season. But compounding their problems on the field has
been a common concern about the future
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the 32 previous games in the wild-card round have
opponents combined for so many regular-season victories. Green
Bay's five-game winning streak in the series and the state of the
49ers' collective psyche provide plenty of fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the pre-game buzz revolves around Steve Mariucci and
Mike Holmgren, and where each will be employed when the NFL
coaching carousel stops.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, in just his second season and with a .765 winning
percentage, might need a victory to keep his job. Holmgren, who
made clear his intention a year ago to leave the Packers for a
chance to run an organization, could be auditioning for 49ers owner
Eddie DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it hasn't been a distraction would be a lie,'' Packers
receiver Antonio Freeman acknowledged. ``We're supposed to be the
model franchise, the team everybody else in the league wants to be.
I guess we're seeing a little of how the other side lives. There
hasn't been much change around here since I arrived (in 1995), but
the impression ... is that changes are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential departure of Holmgren, who quietly courted suitors
at last year's Super Bowl, might be offset by the continuing
presence of general manager Ron Wolf, the man most responsible for
resurrecting the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, however, change could be more sweeping. At
some point, the exiled owner, DeBartolo, will regain control of the
club and put his imprint on it.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo entrusted the day-to-day operations to club president
Carmen Policy, even before DeBartolo relinquished control of the
team to his sister while he battled federal racketeering charges in
Louisiana. When their longtime friendship deteriorated, Policy
moved to Cleveland to run the new expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that DeBartolo will purge the
remaining Policy loyalists when he returns. That means the return
of former 49ers coach Bill Walsh in a management capacity. And
since Holmgren is a Walsh protege, it could mean his return, too.
Whoever runs the team will have to cope with a budget $22 million
over the projected salary cap for 1999. Policy was the master at
manipulating the cap; general manager John McVay, a onetime 49ers
executive installed by the NFL to maintain some semblance of order,
is a novice at it. The 49ers' roster is one of the oldest in the
league, and the club's most irreplaceable player, quarterback Steve
Young, is 37.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' foundation clearly shows cracks, and a simple
patch-up job might not be enough to address them all. A loss on
Sunday could set off a tremor that, even along the San Andreas
Fault, would be considered a seismic event.

MORTGAGE LENDER PACIFICAMERICA TRYING TO STAVE OFF DELISTING BY
NASDAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With the threat of stock-market delisting hanging
over its head and a recent default on a loan, mortgage lender
PacificAmerica Money Center announced it has taken a number of
steps to get its financial house in order.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday that the company recently completed the
sale of $104 million in loans to four unnamed institutional buyers,
is restructuring its debt and is taking other steps to improve its
liquidity and meet trading requirements to stay on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica, based in suburban Woodland Hills, blamed the
weak subprime mortgage loan market for its woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking steps to improve the position of the company,''
Executive Vice President Richard Fremed said in a telephone
interview. ``We're progressing to meet all our required
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica officials said management decided to sell a
``substantial amount of loans before the end of 1998 in order to
increase liquidity, pay off the remaining balance owed on the
company's warehouse line of credit and reduce the company's loan
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the loan sale, the company paid off the $46
million balance on a warehouse line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   In October and November, PacificAmerica sold an additional $60
million in loans through a prior agreement with Advanta, bringing
its total amount of loans sold in the quarter to $164 million.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica now holds about $60 million in loans it also
wants to sell off.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mortgage lender has defaulted on a $5.1 million
payment due to an unnamed lender, which it said at this point is
requiring only payments on the interest-only strips receivable
securing the financing.
</P>
<P>
   PacificAmerica has proposed a repayment schedule that would pay
off the debt by March 2001 and would let it keep a portion of the
cash flow from those strips during the payment period.
</P>
<P>
   Also, problems linked with the subprime market led the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the California Department of Financial
Institutions to take steps that prompted subsidiary Pacific Thrift
and Loan to stop selling loans for securitization, file a revised
capital plan and take other actions to keep regulators at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock has had a rocky year, during which it traded
at a high of $25 on March 6 but ended the year at 43.75 cents, its
lowest point.
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported Thursday that Nasdaq said on Dec. 24
it would delist PacificAmerica from its national market Feb. 26 if
its common stock does not maintain a market value of at least $5
million for the 10 days before Feb. 24, and on March 29 if its
stock price doesn't maintain a minimum $1 per share for the 10 days
before March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management is currently uncertain whether it will achieve
either of these standards as required to avoid a delisting of its
common stock from trading on the Nasdaq national market,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   If delisted, PacificAmerica stock would trade on the
over-the-counter market, which would reduce the ability of
stockholders to trade it.
</P>
<P>
   The weak subprime market forced PacificAmerica in October to
discontinue its wholesale loan division and led its proposed sale
to Santa Monica-based Fremont General Corp. to fall apart.

IN PORTLAND, A MARKET FOUNDED BY A PHILANTHROPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)  (lb) 
 By SARA RIMER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ Owen Wells, financial adviser to the Maine
philanthropist Elizabeth Noyce, had just returned from a trip to
the Pacific Northwest, where he had visited the Pike Place Market
in Seattle and the Granville Island Public Market in Vancouver,
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Betty, `I think we ought to build a public market in
Portland,''' Wells recalled. ``She said that was a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Noyce, who had come into her millions through a divorce
settlement from her husband, Robert Noyce, a co-inventor of the
microchip, was not particularly concerned about cost. It was 1993,
not long after she had responded to the closing of banks across
Maine by blithely creating a new bank in downtown Portland, Maine
Bank and Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   If a public market would help further revitalize downtown, if it
would create jobs for this city of 65,000, if it would help the
farmers of her beloved state of Maine, then she was all for it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Noyce, who lived in Bremen, died in September 1996 at the
age of 65. She had given away $75 million, primarily to Maine
charities, including the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime
Museum, the University of Maine and the Maine Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Public Market, nearly as long as a city block and
about half as wide, opened last October. It is a soaring two-story
structure of glass and timber built on land owned by Mrs. Noyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great fall,'' said Ted Spitzer, the market director.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer was giving a tour of the market the day after Christmas,
showing off the displays of poultry, beef and bison (the bison is
raised in Waterford), fruits and vegetables, homemade pies and ice
cream, and fish not just from Maine but from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland market, with 23 vendors and more expected, is a
tiny fraction of the size of the Pike Place Market, which has 250
businesses. But it does have the expertise of Walter Compare, who
left his fish job at Pike Place to move back east with his wife,
Holly, a Maine native.
</P>
<P>
   Compare was behind the counter at Hanson Brothers Seafood, where
he had arranged a still life composed of mussels, eels, oysters,
tuna and salmon. He does throw an occasional fish, he said, like
the showmen at Pike Place, ``but we don't like to copy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the market, the Port City Jazz group was
serenading shoppers. People were grazing on generous free samples
of smoked salmon, goat cheese and homemade jam and crackers. Emma
Hayes, 6, and her sisters, Isabel, 4, and Eliza, almost 2, from
Cumberland, were enjoying strawberry ice cream cones from Smiling
Hill Farm with their mother, Betsy Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   At Borealis Breads, which was closed for the day, a hand-printed
sign said the bakers were home with their families. Spitzer said
the owner, Jim Amaral, had contracted with several Aroostook County
farmers to grow wheat for his bread.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the market that Betty Noyce would have wanted,
Wells said. ``She would have admired the entrepreneurial ability of
these people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $9.4 million to build the market, which operates seven
days a week, year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted it done right,'' said Wells, who is the president
of Mrs. Noyce's philanthropic foundation, Libra. ``She said, `I
don't want the market to become like Quincy Market where they sell
T-shirts and knickknacks.' She wanted food.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The market is next to Maine Bank and Trust, which now has 14
branches around the state, and a few blocks from Barbara Bush
Children's Hospital, which Mrs. Noyce helped endow.
</P>
<P>
   None of Mrs. Noyce's projects bear her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never wanted any kind of memorial,'' Wells said. ``People
wanted to name scholarship funds after her, and buildings, and she
always said no.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same spirit, she also refused honorary degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought just giving money was not the appropriate measure
for an honorary degree,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the second floor of the market is Wells' private tribute,
a small sculpture of an old woman pushing a cart laden with
vegetables, and feeding corn to a crow. The sculpture, by a
Colorado artist named Nancy Roper, was originally titled
``Henrietta and the Heckler.'' Wells has renamed it ``Betty Sharing
the Bounty.''

<P>
   For the first time in many years, New York was not the city that
recorded the most killings in the country last year, officials said
Thursday. Chicago had more homicides.
</P>
<P>
   As the year drew to a close, Chicago officials said they had
recorded 697 homicides in 1998, while New York City officials said
they had recorded 628. The figures are all the more remarkable
because New York City, with an estimated 7.3 million people, is so
much bigger than Chicago, which has 2.7 million. New York City
officials seized on their lower tally as cause for some
celebration, while their counterparts in Chicago were quick to
downplay its significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago, which is about a third the size of New York, has I
think about 700 homicides already,'' New York Police Commissioner
Howard Safir noted last week. ``They're now going to have more than
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Officer Cesar Guzman, a spokesman for the Chicago Police
Department, said it would be unfair to jump to any conclusions
about the relative safety of Chicago based on its homicide tally in
one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at statistics over the last 15 years, New York has
had more than 21,000 murders since 1985; Chicago has had only
11,000,'' Guzman said. ``New York has a police force of 40,000; we
have a force of 13,500. You see, there are lots of factors you have
to look at, not just one figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminologists said New York was surpassed by Chicago in part
because New York's murder rate is dropping faster, by about 19
percent compared with 8 percent in Chicago. But they also noted
that when crime rose during the crack epidemic of the late 1980s
and early '90s, Chicago did not even come close to being as
dangerous as New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``While New York City had more than 2,000 murders a year in the
early 1990s, Chicago never cracked a thousand,'' noted Thomas
Repetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission in New York and
a former commander of detectives in Chicago. ``They are not
dropping as fast as we are, but they never rose as high as we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Repetto pointed out that Chicago had more murders than New York
in the past: In 1951, he said, Chicago had 249 reported killings
while New York had 243. In 1960, he said, each city had roughly 4
percent of all the killings in the nation. By 1990, though, while
Chicago still had about 4 percent of the nation's killings, New
York City had almost 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chicagoans have not taken kindly to their home's new status as
the city with the most homicides in the nation. Homer Munoz, 28,
who works in the kitchen of a Chicago restaurant, said: ``You hear
we are No. 1 in murders and you think we have to do something about
that. I don't know what _ hire more police or something _ but it's
scary. We have to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took it in stride. Arnetta Zellers, a candy store clerk
who was born and raised in Chicago, said: ``Chicago is a big city,
so we get a lot of attention and publicity about murders and things
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are smaller places that I think are a lot less safe
_ look at Gary, Indiana,'' she said, referring to stubbornly high
crime statistics that have plagued Gary for years. ``Now that's a
place where I definitely wouldn't want to go.''

 &HT;    Florida parents' good intentions not enough when it comes to car
safety seats
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tucking a child into a car safety seat
before a trip is one of the hallmarks of responsible parenting.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their good intentions, the vast majority of
Florida's parents aren't strapping in their children properly, a
new study says, putting them at greater risk of injury or death in
a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The study by University of Florida researchers found that 97
percent of the more than 1,500 child safety seats inspected
statewide weren't properly installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very scary problem,'' said Morya Willis, a
University of Florida engineering researcher and director of the
Florida Child Passenger Safety Program, who oversaw the study.
``It's something that's not going away any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Transportation paid for the study.
Researchers set up voluntary ``checkpoints'' where parents could
have their safety seats examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw very, very few seats that were properly installed,''
said Mary Russell, a Florida Atlantic University instructor and
director of the Safe Communities Project.
</P>
<P>
   Russell conducted several safety checkpoints in West Palm Beach
last year for the study. ``Usually we found multiple errors,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Determining how many children are killed or injured because of
improperly installed safety seats is difficult, Willis said.
Accident reports typically don't record whether the safety seat was
correctly installed.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little doubt that cars can be dangerous places for
youngsters. Car crashes, especially those in which passengers
aren't correctly restrained, are a leading cause of death for
children, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The chief problem is that passenger seat designs vary widely
among car models, so installing the safety seat can be confusing,
Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 900 car models, 1,000 types of child-safety
seats and 20 different seat belt systems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method of securing a seat in one car may be entirely
different in another type of car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, some common mistakes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Placing child safety seats in the front seat of the car. If
the air bag inflates, it can smash into the child, causing serious
injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not using a metal locking clip on the seat belt. In a crash,
the clip, which sometimes comes with the child seat, prevents the
seat belt from sliding, which could throw the child forward.
</P>
<P>
   _ Loosely or incorrectly threading harness straps, which can
allow the child to pitch forward in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Placing an infant in a seat designed for a larger child.
</P>
<P>
   Florida law requires any child under 4 years old to be in a car
seat. Older children are allowed to wear a seat belt _ but safety
advocates recommend safety seats for all children under 12.
</P>
<P>
   Even child safety seat manufacturers acknowledge there is a
problem with proper installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many different types of car seats, it's difficult to
make them work,'' said Kirk MacKenzie, president of Snug Seat, a
Matthews, N.C., company that manufactures car seats for disabled
children. ``It's an ongoing problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even car seat designers can have trouble correctly installing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen car seats where it took me 45 minutes to hook it in
safely,'' said Mitchell Komisar, Snug Seat's vice president of
design and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Safety seat manufacturers and auto makers are considering a
universal standard for child seats that would include a device to
tether the seat to the car's interior. Tethers would dramatically
decrease the chance of injury in a crash, Komisar said.
</P>
<P>
   But agreeing on a universal design will be difficult, he said,
because of the many types of seats in cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also going to add some expense to new automobiles,'' he
said. ``But you have to remember, it would save a lot of lives.''

 &HT;    Fellow workers say planner is `blowing smoke'
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``I don't even know if you can consider
me a smoker,'' the woman said, exhaling. ``I only do it when I'm
stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   She took another drag on her Capri 120. ``I don't even smoke in
my own home,'' she explained. said. ``Or in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   She does, however, smoke out here in the courtyard of the Palm
Beach County Governmental Center. For county employees, this paved
and shaded space with the splashing fountain and picnic tables _
several with large plastic ashtrays _ is that hallmark of modern
compromise, the ``designated smoking area.''
</P>
<P>
   Smokers puff through their lunch hours, nonsmokers lunch through
smoking breaks, and everyone, it seems, has an opinion about Ed
Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, 54, a health planner for the county, is fighting for
the right to smoke inside the governmental center _ where smoking
is forbidden _ because, he says, he feels harassed out here in the
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the county employees taking a break in the
courtyard Thursday, the woman puffing the Capri didn't want her
name used. This is, after all, a burning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That building's not very well-filtered, and it's no place for
him or anyone else to be smoking because it is a health hazard,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's deputy who doesn't smoke was adamant. ``It's
ridiculous,'' he said. ``If he comes to work from the outside, he
can go outside to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   One smoker who didn't mind being named was Tom McCombs, 55, an
information specialist in the Tax Collector's Office who was
relaxing with a Misty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here four years and I've never been harassed,'' he
said. ``When all the tables are full and people want to sit down,
we just tell them, `This is a smoking table because we were here
first.' If he can smoke inside, I think we all should be able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Chatos, 58, smoked for 45 years and quit in 1992 by using a
nicotine patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's blowing smoke,'' the computer programmer said of
Holloway. ``He has the same right as anyone else to come out here
and smoke. Smokers choose to smoke, and they're also choosing to
leave the building when they want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, a man and woman shared another table. She was
smoking a Merit menthol. He was puffing a Virginia Slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would he have his own private place to smoke?'' the woman
wondered. ``Boy, that would open a can of worms! I don't see how
they can do it for one and not everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, a smoker since he was 10, favored a smoking lounge
for all employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have us out here if it was snowing,'' he complained.
``Smokers are looked upon now as if you have some sort of defect,
like you're a leper. Are they going to outlaw people who eat too
much next? Some people are coffeeheads. Everybody's got
something.''
</P>
<P>
   At the headquarters of Smokenders in Vancouver, British
Columbia, vice president of operations Arnie Willcuts said the
problem isn't where people smoke _ it's that they smoke at all.
</P>
<P>
   Making people outcasts is counterproductive, Willcuts said. ``It
creates the opposite of what the nonsmoker is trying to
accomplish,'' he said. ``It creates resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Willcuts, who's taught smoking cessation clinics for 20 years,
said: ``Ninety percent of smokers say they plan to quit, but not
today. They perceive themselves as failures because they're still
smoking, so rather than fail again, they make excuses about why
they need to smoke _ It's called denial.''

PANAVISION STOCK IN FREE FALL SINCE PERELMAN TOOK OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- 1998 turned out to be a year to forget for
shareholders of movie-camera specialist Panavision Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Shares have lost 53 percent of their value since billionaire Ron
Perelman acquired control of the company seven months ago. The
issue took a 9.8 percent hit on the last day of the year, falling
$1.375 to $12.0625 with more than 77,000 shares traded in its
heaviest volume since the takeover. At one point, the stock dipped
to $11.875.
</P>
<P>
   The activity prompted a request by the New York Stock Exchange
for a public statement about any developments that might have
caused the sell-off, which represented less than 1 percent of the 8
million shares outstanding. But Panavision, which tends to shun
publicity, made no comment and cited its policy of refusing to
respond to rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman, one of the richest Americans with assets worth $6
billion, completed a $600 million buyout and recapitalization of
Panavision in early June that left him with 72 percent control. He
pledged to expand sales for Panavision, which has annual revenues
of nearly $200 million, and announced in September that he would
take over at the end of the year for longtime Chairman William C.
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street has been unimpressed, and the stock has slid
steadily. Panavision, which obtains most of its revenue by leasing
its cameras to studios and producers, reported in November that its
results had been hurt by declines in big-budget movie production;
third-quarter cash flow dropped 15 percent to $18.4 million and
revenues fell 9 percent to $50.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Panavision spokesman said employment levels of more than 300
in suburban Woodland Hills and 1,200 worldwide have not changed
significantly since Perelman took over.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman, a 55-year-old New Yorker, also controls Revlon,
California Federal, Coleman, Sunbeam and Consolidated Cigar.
Bloomberg News recently reported that investors in those companies
shifted holdings in advance of important disclosures at least five
times during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The news service cited a two-session period in the early fall
when Revlon shares fell 18 percent for no reason, then fell an
additional 44 percent after the cosmetics maker issued a negative
earnings forecast on the third day. Investors who sold earlier were
spared the impact of the larger decline.
</P>
<P>
   However, officials at Perelman's McAndrews &AMP; Forbes holding
company told Bloomberg that they have strict policies against
insider trading and asserted there was no reason to believe that
violations had occurred.

EXCLUSIVE: GORE TO ANNOUNCE FORMATION OF CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal
step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal
Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization,
aides to the vice president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The aides said papers would be mailed to the commission Friday
as official confirmation so the organization could begin to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one other Democrat has signaled his intention to
run for president _ former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who has
created an exploratory committee. Gore has decided to skip this
preliminary step to an official announcement of candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But other prominent Democrats are expected to test the waters,
as well, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sen. John McCain of Arizona became the first
Republican to announce the formation of an exploratory committee.
Other Republicans, like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
publishing magnate Steve Forbes, have given every indication they
also intend to run.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President Clinton, most recently
as the White House political adviser, has been hired as Gore's
campaign manager, a sign that he intends to draw heavily on people
and grass-roots organizations that helped Clinton become the first
Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win successive terms as
president.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would
also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and
former Gore chief of staff; another former vice presidential chief
of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep.
Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who is one of Gore's best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a Clinton-Gore operation for the last six years,
not a Clinton operation and not a Gore operation,'' Smith, 40, said
Thursday in an interview. ``The Clinton years will become the
foundation for Gore to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was on a skiing vacation with his family in Utah, was
not available for comment, and the announcement by his staff
included no statement from him.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many political experts, Gore will enter the 2000
campaign as the leading Democratic candidate, after a political
career that spans eight years as a House member from Tennessee,
eight years in the Senate and six years as vice president. He was
untouched by the Clinton sex scandal, and after a review by the
Justice Department, Attorney General Janet Reno found no reason to
investigate his fund-raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore has access to enormous amounts of money as a
result of countless trips around the country for speeches, which
exposed him to local political leaders and grass-roots
organizations to cement his own ties for the future.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 midterm election campaign, he stumped for
hundreds of Democrats across the country, appearing in more than 30
states in just the final two months of the campaign _ chits that
will no doubt make him the least likely candidate to encounter
problems raising the federal spending limit for 2000, which is
expected to be set at about $35 million. The 1996 limit was $30.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, 50, is not without concerns as the campaign unfolds. A
speaker who often sounds wooden and looks stiff, he has yet to
demonstrate consistently a folksy side that appeals to many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne Conlin, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Iowa, where
the first caucuses are held, said she expected Gore to be the
front-runner. ``But Iowans are pretty sophisticated evaluators,''
she said. ``All candidates, no matter what their title is, have to
sit down in living rooms and talk policy and issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, the outgoing state party chairman in New
Hampshire, site of the first primary, and a Gore supporter said:
``His biggest negative, especially running in the small, early
states, could be his person-to-person approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore could find that many voters, including
Democrats, are turned off by a candidate aligned so closely to a
president who has encountered so many personal difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that in a country of 250 million, somebody would
say that,'' Smith said. ``The situation exists as it exists. There
are upsides and downsides. But the president's job approval rating
is at 72 percent, so there is a strong feeling that the upsides
outweigh any downsides, if there are any.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A SEASON OF RENEWAL FOR THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets celebrate the first day of the new year with
an unfamiliar personae. They begin 1999 as champions.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Jets are a perfect team for Jan. 1. They
embody the theme and spirit of a new year: rejuvenation, clean
slates and second chances.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious symbol of this regeneration is Vinny Testaverde, the
Jets veteran quarterback whose career was in the lost and found
before the Jets signed him as a backup quarterback last summer. The
season began with the starting quarterback, Glenn Foley, being
elected as team captain; four months later and in an indication of
how the Jets have evolved, Testaverde was voted the most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Testaverde the core of this Jets team is rehabilitated
careers: Pepper Johnson, squeezing one more season out of a 13-year
career; Bryan Cox, dismissed as too volatile to be productive,
giving form and passion to the Jets defense.
</P>
<P>
   There have been smaller triumphs as well. Coach Bill Parcells
said the player who has come the furthest is Matt O'Dwyre. The
26-year-old guard has managed to check his volatile temper, which
resulted in costly, ill-timed penalties last season when he led the
offensive line in penalties and personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing that you need is to make the wrong play at the
wrong time,' O'Dwyre said Thursday. ``You pick your spots better.
You do it earlier rather than later. It's not good for the team.
It's not good for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   In another corner of the Jets locker room, Corwin Brown
contemplated the dramatic course his career has taken. Brown was
with Parcells in New England in 1996 when the Patriots reached the
Super Bowl, then was unexpectedly waived the following summer.
Parcells invited him to camp, and last week Brown was promoted to
starting safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to the Super Bowl one year, then the next year you
don't even make the playoffs, that's a long season,'' Brown said,
referring to his first season with the Jets. ``But I believed in
Bill. I was thinking about all this last Saturday in the last
couple minutes of the Buffalo game. I didn't know what I was
getting into when I came here. This happened quicker than I thought
it would happen. The attitude on this team has changed; it's like a
completely different team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown stopped short of saying he is a new player, even a
rehabilitated player. He's a confident player whose self
confidence, shaken after being cut by New England, is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't down on my ability,'' Brown said. ``I was just
disappointed in the way things turned out. I didn't think I
deserved to be cut, but things happen. Bill said not to let it get
me down. I never really did.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's best friend, teammate and chess partner in New England,
Jimmy Hitchcock, was unexpectedly traded to Minnesota before the
season, and he, too, is flourishing. ``We talk a lot about things
that have happened,'' Brown said. ``When things happen to you that
you don't feel are right, I really believe that things will turn
out good if you just hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Vikings in Super Bowl XXXIII? ``That would be like
a story book ending,'' Brown said. ``But we've got a lot of
football to play between then and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mickens sat on a stool next to Brown. The last three
seasons have been a roller-coaster ride for him as well. Mickens
started at cornerback in 1996 for the 1-15 Jets. Last season he
lost his job to Otis Smith who came with Parcells from New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bitter at first,'' he said. ``I did not welcome the
change. But you have to eat what's on the table in front of you. I
vowed to be the best nickel back in the NFL, but I never lost my
desire to play all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Aaron Glenn was injured four weeks ago, Mickens was
beginning to doubt that he would ever have an opportunity to be a
full-time player. But when Glenn was injured in a game against
Seattle, Mickens was suddenly pressed into service. Mickens shut
down Joey Galloway, Seattle's All-Pro receiver, and has played
nearly flawless football since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity didn't come when I wanted it to come, but God
is always on time,'' Mickens said. ``I've started a quarter of the
season, played in some of the biggest games in the history of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unwalked on ground for me,'' he added, referring to
playing in the playoffs. ``I'm excited. I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   New year, new season, a fresh lease on life. &QL;

TESTAVERDE NAMED MVP BY TEAMMATES  
(DW)

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Capping a splurge of individual honors he has
not known since his Heisman Trophy season of 1986, Vinny Testaverde
Thursday got the one that means the most to him as a pro: his
teammates voted him the Jets' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback with the 12-1 record as a starter had never been
named his team's most valuable player in a career that stretched to
Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, it feels pretty good to have your teammates
vote for you,'' Testaverde said. ``It probably means more to me
than any other award because it comes from your teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is the first Jets quarterback since Ken O'Brien in
1985 to be voted the most valuable player. It came a day after he
became the first Jet to be named one of six finalists in the Miller
Lite Man of the Year Award, an official National Football League
presentation, and was voted the American Conference's offensive
player of the month a second straight time.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago he was named to the Pro Bowl. His newly found
celebrity status was punctuated with an appearance Wednesday on
``Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   While Testaverde is not quite the court jester, he did amuse his
teammates by bringing in a video Thursday of the tortilla chip
commercial with Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our New Year's Eve celebration,'' wide receiver Wayne
Chrebet said.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who had warned his players to avoid any late-night
revelries, viewed the film briefly while players roared at their
coach singing.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde quietly has taken over as the leader of the offense
with his remarkably solid play, calm demeanor under fire and
occasional flashes of humor. Glenn Foley, whom Testaverde displaced
as quarterback, remains the club's offensive captain _ a position
he was voted to before the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has presided over a pair of six-game winning streaks
in setting a team-record 29 touchdown passes. His passer rating,
which is weighted heavily for touchdowns and interceptions, was
second in the league to the Minnesota Vikings' Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jets who received honors from their teammates were: Bryan
Cox, the Dennis Byrd Award for inspirational play; Pepper Johnson,
the Ed Block Courage Award, and running back Leon Johnson, the
Marty Lyons award for community service. Center Kevin Mawae was
voted the Kyle Clifton Good Guy award by the Jets' staff.

AND THE WINNER IS PICKED BY ... ABC?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After clanging around the empty champagne bottles
from last season's Jan. 1 college football bowlapalooza, Jim Nantz
had a very nasty hangover.
</P>
<P>
   What CBS's then-main college play-by-play guy couldn't stomach
was how cavalier ABC was in declaring Michigan the national
champion after covering its Rose Bowl win over Washington State _
and before CBS was to televise the Orange Bowl between Nebraska and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember, the final Associated Press writers' poll had
Michigan No.1 while the coaches' poll went with Tom Osborne's
Nebraska team at the top, so there was (as usual) no clear-cut
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the spirit of ABC throughout (the New Year's Day
coverage) was that they awarded Michigan the championship and the
season was over before our Orange Bowl,'' Nantz sounded off in some
newspaper columns and on any all-sports talk radio shows that would
have him. ``ABC's role was... almost indefensible. The last time I
looked ABC doesn't award championships, the polls do.''
</P>
<P>
   Look again, Jimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the fact that Disney's TV properties are gettin'
jiggy with the bowls _ it owns the rights to 18 of the 22 games
this season _ Monday night's Fiesta Bowl between No.1 Tennessee and
No.2 Florida State is all aligned to provide the climax to a
successful, if not perfect, ABC-sponsored Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result, the 12 hours worth of games on the picture box
today add up to nothing more than gloried booby prizes, including
the UCLA-Wisconsin Rose Bowl, which ABC carries this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this Promised Land that TV helped create _ a playoff-free
national championship system using the profit-machine bowls as game
pieces _ it must also realize it has contributed to tarnishing
whatever mystique its other loyal bowl partners have provided
through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the bowls are hurt some by hype for the BCS
championship game, particularly the Rose Bowl,'' said Keith
Jackson, whose ABC broadcasting career comes to a self-imposed end
after he does today's game in Pasadena and Monday's in Tempe,
Ariz., then heads into a golf-filled retirement.
</P>
<P>
   This all-or-nothing mentality that allowed UCLA a chance to
bypass the Rose Bowl if it qualified for a national title shot has
its downside, and TV _ particularly ABC _ must also try to pretend
these tradition-rich bowl games have something to offer after years
of pumping them up.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agrees that the New Year's Day charm is gone from
Pasadena. But the change that may be uncomfortable for some may
also shake things up for the good of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps this will be a period of adjustment and maybe it'll
clean itself up _ maybe the Rose Bowl down the road will decide
it's had enough of this nonsense and force the BCS to alter their
demands for the alleged championship series,'' said Jackson, who
holds doggedly to the idea of a four-team, post-bowl playoff that
could be played later in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a letdown in this case, tied to the long conference
showdown between the Pac-10 and Big Ten champions that people have
become accustomed to. But there have been many times when the city
of Los Angeles and surrounding areas have had a rather (begin
ital)laissez-faire(end ital) attitude toward it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The KJ Victory Tour: On his upcoming retirement, Jackson admits
if he had his druthers, ``I woulda kept my mouth shut and when it
was time just walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, his decision nearly three years ago that the '98
season would be his last allowed time for those who wanted to thank
him for his 47 years of service to the game (32 as ABC's main man).
</P>
<P>
   Autographed helmets and footballs are one thing. Jackson and his
wife Turi Ann also received a pair of maple rocking chairs (from
Penn State coach Joe Paterno), a certificate to attend a cooking
school in the Napa Valley, and _ what he says he'll never forget _
a round of applause from 111,000 fans during a game he and Bob
Griese did in Ann Arbor, Mich., this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a difficult year to be sure,'' said Jackson. ``I'm
not used to crying this much. Maybe some folks did like my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson cringes at the thought of any farewell address on-camera
either today or Monday. Rumors of the 70-year-old taking off a year
and returning _ either to ABC or CBS _ are also just speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The next part of his life, he says, is ``a blank page.... I've
never been unemployed, and that may scare the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not as much as some viewers will be next college football
season without Jackson there to make the call. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Nothing hit the fan just because Al Michaels slipped in an
off-color remark by mistake during the season-ending ``Monday Night
Football'' telecast. In reference to a halftime interview Michaels
was to do with Buffalo quarterback (and Boston College grad) Doug
Flutie, Dan Dierdorf make a comment about being tired of hearing
about Boston College. ``No s---,'' said Michaels. The banter was
intended to tease sideline reporter Leslie Visser, a B.C. alum who
can hear all audio on her headset. Although a monitor in the booth
that lets the broadcasters know when they're on air was in a
different position than usual, Michaels said it would be unfair to
blame this on the fact ABC has been working most of the year with
replacement technical people because of a strike. He simply thought
he was in a standard 1 minute, 50 second commercial break near the
end of the first half when it was actually just 30 seconds. ``When
you do as many live hours as we do, it'll happen no matter how many
safeguards,'' said Michaels. ``It's also not the first time you've
ever heard that word during a football telecast with all the
microphones used these days. I think people are pretty desensitized
to it.'' Hey, it happens. &QL; 
_Since last college basketball season, Time-Warner Cable in
Chatsworth added Fox's willy-nilly cable channel, FX. Which means
more Valley folk can watch Saturday's UCLA-Arizona contest (7:30
p.m.) in the annual FX hostage situation with key Pac-10 games.
Steve Physioc and George Raveling do the call. FX goes to about 1.8
million homes in L.A. these days. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Having the last word. ``They gave me the damn ball! Now we're
money.'' That's the headline of the ESPN magazine Jan. 11 cover
story on New York Jets receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who plays off his
autobiography title with another self-scribed article (with help
again from ESPN's Shelly Smith). ``There are still people who don't
want to see me succeed,'' he writes ``... I've played under this
kind of messed-up media scrutiny at a high level for three straight
seasons. I took on the New York pressure that has run other guys
out of town. I've held my own and I'm holding my own now, and I
ain't never gonna crack. So let's dance.'' Uh, let's not and say we
did, OK? &QL; 
_Anyone who thinks that based on NBC's ratings of ``It's A
Wonderful Life'' that more people would rather spend Christmas Day
with Michael Jordan than Jimmy Stewart. NBC's telecast of the
Christmas classic starring Stewart posted a 5.4 overnight rating.
The movie was shown instead of the Knicks-Bulls/Lakers-Suns
doubleheader, which was canceled because of the NBA lockout. Jordan
and the Bulls played on Christmas last year and posted a 6.6
overnight rating during the 8-to-11 p.m. time block on the East
Coast. &QL; 
_And for a Fiesta Bowl update, let's go to Chris Fowler, Mel Brooks
and Kirk Herbstreit who CONTINUE TO SIT IN AN EMPTY Sun Devil
Stadium a week before the game.

RESISTANCE GROWS TO QUICK TRIAL FOR CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several key Republicans have begun to show signs of
resistance to speeding up Senate impeachment proceedings, objecting
to a proposal that could end President Clinton's trial in less than
a week and repeating vows not to compromise on a censure deal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for a swift trial, floated this week by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, drew support Thursday
from Democrats, particularly Senate Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle, who called the plan a blueprint for ending the matter
``fairly and expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a number of Republicans compared opinions Thursday in
cross-continental phone calls from their home districts, it became
clear the deal was far from done.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most ardent detractors was Senator Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, who last November suggested Clinton should not face
trial at all before leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Specter had reversed course, condemning the ``swift
trial'' proposal as logistically problematic and legally
irresponsible, and criticizing it for ``asking people to make a
decision when they're not armed with all the facts,'' according to
John Ullyot, his deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the House has voted, he thinks the Senate has an
absolute duty to proceed in an absolutely judicious manner, one
that gets at the core facts and involves hearing from witnesses, if
need be,'' Ullyot said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, designed by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat, and Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican,
the Senate would hear abbreviated evidence on both sides, then hold
a vote sometime in the next few weeks on whether to proceed with a
full trial.
</P>
<P>
   If 67 senators voted in favor, a full trial could begin. If the
motion failed, they could start considering censure.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lieberman and Gorton plan to outline the proposal in
greater detail during television appearances over the weekend, and
in doing so may allay the fears of some Republican opponents,
according to Eric Federing, a spokesman for Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republican senators and their staff members said they
expect roadblocks for any proposal that did not include at least
beginning a trial. They also said they remained firmly opposed to
censure, and the swift trial proposal, at least as they understood
it, seemed like an even lighter slap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   As one senior Republican Senate aide put it: ``In the current
form, it appears to accommodate the concerns of Democrats more than
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the problem is the political hornet's nest Lott
is trying to avoid, according to both Democratic and Republican
staff members.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly everyone agrees there are not the 67 votes required
to convict Clinton in the Senate, and while most Democrats and some
Republicans say that is reason enough to quickly end the process, a
steady core of Republicans believes the Constitution requires a
trial without possibility of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lott) in a difficult place,'' said one Senate staff member.
``On the one hand, he is trying to avoid the partisan cut-up he saw
in the House. At the same time, he's got to please people on his
fringe as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those vehemently opposed to creating a censure resolution
is Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, who has
said he will vote for guilt or innocence, and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate's constitutional responsibility is to hold a trial,
and, after hearing the evidence, either vote to remove the
president from office or leave him in office,'' Smith said in a
statement released through an aide. ``Where does the Constitution
give the Senate the power to do anything other than hold a trial on
the articles of impeachment?''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's objections from the Senate cane one day after some
House Republicans fired a round of criticism of their own. In a
letter to Lott, Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, called on the Senate leader to allow witness testimony,
cautioning him against sacrificing ``substance and duty for
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was unclear whether Hyde, who would act as prosecutor
during a Senate trial, was voicing the concerns of the Republican
majority in the House or simply airing his own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably quiet was Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the
speaker-designate, who said simply that ``the House has done its
constitutional duty,'' according to his spokesman, Pete Jeffries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now up to the Senate to do its constitutional duty,''
Jeffries said Thursday. ``He (Hastert) is not going to get into
advising the Senate on how to do its job.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats are prepared to be flexible, ``But we're
going to stay within this framework,'' he said. ``We're just hoping
everybody understands our desire to deal with this fairly and
expeditiously.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A few days before the referendum two
weeks ago on this island's political status, Filiberto Ojeda-Rios,
a radical Puerto Rican nationalist, denounced the vote as
illegitimate and called for a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during a strike by workers protesting the sale of
the government-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co., he sided with the
strikers and attacked the privatization policies of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda-Rios usually issues his pronouncements through written
releases to the news media, although he has also recorded
statements that were later played for crowds. And in July, for a
centennial commemoration of the United States' invasion of Puerto
Rico in the Spanish-American War, he even produced a videotape.
``He looked like a statesman,'' said Dr. Hector Luis Pesquera, a
physician and independence-movement leader who saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda-Rios' ubiquity would not be particularly remarkable were
he not a federal fugitive in a highly publicized case: the armed
robbery of $7 million from the Wells Fargo depot in Hartford,
Conn., by militant Puerto Rican nationalists in September 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is expected to announce soon that it has raised the
reward _ to $500,000 from $150,000 _ for information leading to
Ojeda-Rios' arrest, a response to renewed violent activity this
year by the small clandestine group he leads, the Boricua Popular
Army, better known as Los Macheteros: the Machete Wielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represents a tremendous threat to law enforcement,'' said
Marlene Hunter, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI office
here. ``He's quite intelligent, and a lot of people in his
organization are educated and quite capable of using their talents
to achieve the many things that are needed in Puerto Rico, and yet
they have chosen to rob banks, place bombs and shoot it out with
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda-Rios does indeed subscribe to violence. Los Macheteros,
which he helped organize after working with similar underground
groups, has claimed responsibility for the Wells Fargo robbery and,
in the 1970s and '80s, for a series of spectacular assaults, among
them the blowing up of several planes at a Puerto Rico Air National
Guard base, an ambush of a Navy bus that left two sailors dead, and
rocket attacks on two federal buildings here, one of which houses
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the investigation of the rocket attacks that the
bureau learned of Los Macheteros' involvement in the Wells Fargo
robbery and, in 1985, traced Ojeda-Rios to a safe house in the
eastern part of the island, where he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years in prison awaiting trial, was then freed
with his trial still pending and, in September 1990, jumped bond.
He has been a wanted man ever since, frequently communicating with
the outside world and never denying a role in the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Having eluded federal agents for eight years on an island only
100 miles by 35 miles in area, Ojeda-Rios, who is believed to be 65
to 68 years old, has developed the appeal of a David fighting a
Goliath. He is often compared to Tono Bicicleta, a killer and
rapist who, with the help of the populace, evaded arrest in Puerto
Rico's mountains for 14 years, mocking the authorities throughout,
until he was killed by the police in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Tono Bicicleta, though, Ojeda-Rios is regarded by many
Puerto Ricans as a defender of political principles. Federal
officials say that he has undoubtedly counted on help to avoid
capture and that despite the reward, investigators have hardly been
showered with leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are almost happy that he hasn't been caught, because he
is perceived as ours and as someone who turned out to be smarter
than the Feds,'' said Daisy Sanchez, a television reporter here who
interviewed him shortly after he had gone underground. ``It is
obvious that there is no revolutionary movement here and that he is
in the minority. But that doesn't mean he doesn't count on support
to protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Hunter, the FBI agent, cited Ojeda-Rios'
resourcefulness. She called him ``a master of disguises'' who was
accustomed to a clandestine life and was ``well able to survive in
very harsh conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before his arrest for the Wells Fargo robbery, Ojeda-Rios
had lived underground for 15 years, pursued because of the earlier
attacks launched by Los Macheteros and similar groups. Once, Ms.
Hunter said, he was found living in a cave in the island's
northwest. He is even believed to have traveled to the mainland and
back since 1990, when he was last seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be in a condo yesterday, in the mountains the next day
and in New York the next,'' Ms. Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda-Rios' career as a revolutionary had an unlikely beginning.
After entering college here at the age of 15, he became a trumpet
player in salsa bands that still remember him as a gifted musician.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York City as a teen-ager, married and in the
early 1960s left with his family for Cuba, where, federal officials
say, he was trained by the Castro government to spy for it in
Puerto Rico. The Cubans, the officials say, later provided aid to
Los Macheteros.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter, who has worked on the Wells Fargo case since the
beginning, said there was evidence that $2.5 million of the loot
had gone to Cuba. Of the $7 million taken by the robbers, she said,
investigators have recovered only $85,000, in a series of arrests
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda-Rios was indicted with 19 other suspects. In 1992, two
years after he removed an electronic monitor and vanished on the
island while free on bond, he was convicted in absentia in
Connecticut and sentenced to 55 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   There were a total of 12 convictions in the case, and charges
against five other suspects were dropped. In addition, three of
those indicted were never arrested. One of these was Victor Gerena,
a Wells Fargo employee who remains on the FBI's list of the top 10
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   While his three fellow fugitives have not been heard from since
the robbery, Ojeda-Rios hardly keeps quiet. His audiotapes are
routinely sent to pro-independence rallies, and his ``communiques''
to the media, left at drop-off points or sometimes mailed, are now
almost expected in the event of a major news occurrence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And at least three times in the last eight years he has given
interviews to reporters, who have been blindfolded and taken by car
to his hideout. Luis Penchi, a radio reporter and talk-show host
who was the last to interview him, five months ago, says he regards
his pursuers as ``inept.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Los Macheteros had been largely dormant since
Ojeda-Rios' disappearance, they resumed their violent activity this
year, in attacks that were small, virtually symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, this summer, they claimed responsibility for two
attacks on branches of Banco Popular, a member of the consortium
buying a controlling stake in the government-owned telephone
company. Los Macheteros said the attacks _ a pipe bomb shattered
windows in one, and someone fired two bullets through a branch's
main door in the other _ were meant to prevent the sale of ``a
national patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Puerto Rico's political leaders, including Gov. Pedro
Rossello, call Ojeda-Rios isolated and express doubt that his group
has many active adherents, he has found sympathy within an island
of 3.8 million people, who, although U.S. citizens, have a sense of
their own distinct nationhood and who, while overwhelmingly
rejecting independence at the polls, often view as noble the
efforts of those who seek it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the independence movement do not advocate armed
struggle, and federal officials say militant Puerto Rican groups
have become less of a threat since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But radical nationalists like Ojeda-Rios are far from shunned.
Some advocates of independence say Los Macheteros have helped bring
attention to the movement, and defend the group's violence as a
legitimate weapon of national resistance. Many ``independentistas''
regard those convicted of crimes in pursuit of independence as
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest interview, with Penchi, the radio reporter,
Ojeda-Rios denied that any of the Wells Fargo money had gone to
Cuba and said it had all been spent on his clandestine army. He
also said that he had never left the island while at large and that
his greatest sacrifice since vanishing was his inability to speak
with with his four children, whom, he said somewhat vaguely, he
seeks to protect by refusing to communicate with them.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is not moved. ``He's a bank robber and a criminal,'' Ms.
Hunter said. ``We don't excuse things because of people's
motivation.''

AS JETS PREPARE FOR PLAYOFFS, PARCELLS WEARS A SIGNIFICANT RING
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBN-RHODEN-COLUMN, FBN-TESTAVERDE-MVP)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Ray Lucas saw it shimmering in the meeting
Thursday as the Jets went back to work. But he was afraid to say a
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Bill was going to jump at me for staring,'' said
Lucas, the backup quarterback and special-teamer. ``With Bill, you
never know what he's trying to get at.''
</P>
<P>
   What was sparkling before Lucas' eyes was the Super Bowl XXV
ring, the one with the two huge diamonds, one for each Giants Super
Bowl victory, that Parcells wore Thursday. It was the first time as
Jets coach he showed up with either of his Giants Super Bowl rings,
which he earned after the 1986 and 1990 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But why shouldn't he wear one of his rings on this very morning?
After all, the Jets began the serious work of preparing for their
first home playoff game in 12 years as they returned to the
practice field after a three-day layoff. And at the end of the
rainbow is Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   They don't play until Jan. 10, and they don't know whether they
will face Jacksonville or the winner of the Miami-Buffalo game. But
they peered at Jacksonville films Thursday. It's not that Parcells
figures the Jaguars will be the Jets' opponent. His team and
coaches know more about the Bills and Dolphins, having faced them
both in the last three weeks. If the Jets play either of those
teams, there will be enough time next week to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde has faced the Jaguars more often than any other
Jet. Even though he has tossed nine touchdowns and thrown eight
interceptions in six games against them while playing for the
Browns and Ravens, it's not the statistics that he he remembers.
Nor does he think Jacksonville will be any less challenging with
Mark Brunell nursing an ankle sprain at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've faced them twice a year for the last three years,''
Testaverde said. ``I've faced them when they've had injuries, and I
don't recall ever beating them.'' Indeed, Testaverde's teams lost
all the games they played against the Jaguars since Jacksonville
joined the National Football League in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, by contrast, dwelt on the positive Thursday even
though he never said a word to his team about the ring. Nor would
he explain why he was wearing it. It is a handsome ornament, with
``GIANTS'' engraved in yellow gold across the top. There is a
circle of smaller diamonds surrounding a blue field. In the middle
are two large almond-shaped diamonds _ one for each Giants Super
Bowl triumph.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of motivational gambit is not unheard of around here.
When the Jets started their playoff run under Walt Michaels in
1982, he showed up in the locker room one day and dumped a few
thousand dollars in a pile on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's at stake here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But playoff money these days is a smaller percentage of the
players' take. Parcells was showing them something money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty big ring,'' someone mentioned to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it is,'' he acknowledged. But he also said, ``I didn't
talk to my team about the Super Bowl or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, would the players notice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they will, maybe they won't,'' he said. ``They'll get a
chance to. I never wear it. I just felt like putting it on today.''
</P>
<P>
   The players noticed, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Lewis said that each time Parcells moved his right hand, ``my
head was bouncing up and down and followed the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also paid attention, they said, to watching
Jacksonville, though this was an odd sort of day. It was part of a
bye week, and they knew there was someone coming up. They just
didn't know who.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the privilege of feeling relaxed right now,'' said
tight end Kyle Brady. ``We earned an off week for what we did in
December.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, who earned All-Pro honors Thursday _ the first Jet in
13 years to do so _ this was highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like waiting for a baby,'' he said of the anticipation of
being in a playoff bye week. ``You don't know if it's going to be a
boy or a girl. We don't know who we'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the only current Jet who has ever been to a playoff
game as a Jet. That was back in his rookie season of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's concentrating on 1999. ``They've got two good
quarterbacks that help them win,'' Lewis said after viewing the
Jaguar films. ``They can both move around and put them in good
position.'' Behind Brunell, Jacksonville has the rookie quarterback
Jonathan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jaguars beat the New England Patriots on Sunday, the
Jets' rookie right tackle, Jason Fabini, who has faced such strong
pass rushers as the Bills' Phil Hansen and the Panthers' Kevin
Greene, would line up against Jacksonville's Bryce Paup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to get after you,'' Fabini said after taking his
first look at the Jaguars. ``They're aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the Jets will have three days of watching a team they
may never face, but they will also work on fundamentals. After
taking off Saturday and Sunday, they will practice next Tuesday
through Friday. Parcells admitted he was concerned about
fundamentals, and that he had not spent enough time drilling his
team in cold-weather strategy and performance. But he has given
them game-situation quizzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what you do when the wind's in your face, five seconds
to go in the game, and you've got the ball and we're ahead,''
Parcells told them in one mental drill.
</P>
<P>
   He knows there is plenty of time for the Jets to go out in the
cold again before anyone can think of Super Bowl warmth in Miami on
Jan. 31. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1998, when ``technology'' and ``Internet''
were synonymous with almost instant paper wealth and the stock
market staged as stunning a turnaround as any in recent memory,
left many professionals rubbing their eyes in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it other than to say it is irrational
exuberance,'' said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call.
``It is momentum investing, and there is no logic to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was some logic to why stocks rose from an apparent
abyss to solid double-digit gains for the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, when financial markets appeared on the verge of
imploding, the Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 210
points and closed less than 100 points above 7,539.07, the low it
hit on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, foreign markets have staged a comeback. The steep
slide in U.S. stock prices was seen by many as a buying
opportunity. Third-quarter earnings were not as bad as expected.
Perhaps most important, the Federal Reserve Board and more than 50
central banks around the world have cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a liquidity-driven market,'' said Byron Wien, chief
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
``The world was awash in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in interest rates not only helped to revive Wall
Street's badly shaken psyche, but also propelled the three most
widely watched market indexes _the Dow, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
and the Nasdaq composite _ to new highs during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The gains for those measures were undeniably impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 17 percent during the quarter. The S&AMP;P's 500-stock
index gained nearly 21 percent, its second-best quarter ever. And
the Nasdaq, weighted heavily with technology company stocks,
performed amazingly, rising 29.45 percent, just shy of its best
quarter ever.
</P>
<P>
   The strong finish accounted for most of the market's
double-digit gains for the year. For all of 1998, the Dow rose 16.1
percent; the S&AMP;P 500 was up 26.67 percent, and the Nasdaq jumped
39.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, as was true for most of the year, a mere handful of stocks
accounted for most of the market's strength in the fourth quarter.
The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rebounded from Oct.
8, when it closed at 310.28. But the index never came close to
regaining the peak of 491.41 it hit on April 21 and finished at
421.96, down 3.4 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the four major indexes _ the Dow, the S&AMP;P,
Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange composite _ two of them have
Intel, Cisco Systems, MCI Worldcom, Lucent Technologies and Dell
Computer,'' said Walter Murphy, a senior market analyst at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very narrow market,'' he said. ``To me that
suggests there is a case to be made that once this rally is over,
the market will go through a reasonably substantial retracement.''
</P>
<P>
   Those five stocks, among the biggest and most widely traded, did
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, for example, which started the quarter at 85 3/4, closed
Thursday at 118 9/16, up 38.3 percent. Cisco, at 61 13/16 at the
end of September, finished the year at 92 13/16, a gain of 50.8
percent. And Lucent Technologies moved from 69 1/16 to 109 15/16
Thursday, up 59.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, while technology stocks in general and Internet stocks
in particular grabbed the headlines, they were not the S&AMP;P 500's
best-performing group during the quarter. Transportation issues,
battered earlier in the year, gained that distinction, followed by
investment banking and brokerage stocks and apparel retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the steep decline in oil prices hurt energy
stocks, particularly oil-service and production companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four worst-performing groups in the S&AMP;P 500, these stocks
occupied three of the slots. Only gold stocks did worse.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow stocks, none did better than Wal-Mart Stores,
which rose 49 percent in the quarter. And none did worse than
Eastman Kodak, which fell 6.3 percent despite strong competition
from Boeing, which dropped 4.9 percent, and Sears, Roebuck, down
3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine, let alone explain, the rise in a stock
like Ebay. The online auction house, which went public in
mid-September at 18 a share and was trading at just more than 45 on
Sept. 30, finished the year at 241 1/4, a gain of about 435 percent
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com did not do badly, either. The online book, tape and
video retailer purveyor started the quarter at 111 5/8. It closed
Thursday at 321 1/4, for a jump of 187.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, the 50 stocks that make up Interactive Week's
Internet Index _ a list that does not include stocks that have not
been publicly traded for less than six months _ posted a gain of
71.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The golden touch of the Internet seemed to reach nearly any
company that operated a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the brokerage house that does a lot of business
online, was the best-performing stock in the S&AMP;P 500 index for the
quarter. Earlier in the week, its market capitalization rose above
that of Merrill Lynch, a far bigger, more diversified enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the current mania to continue. But the excitement
generated among investors by the Internet's potential is justified,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the most exciting business phenomenon since
the airplane or television,'' Wien of Morgan Stanley said. ``It is
truly a dramatic life-changing event, an open-ended situation
investors have not been confronted with for some time. To say that
this is a fad is an easy trap to fall into. But this is bigger than
that.''

EDITORIAL: DRUG SAFETY FOR CHILDREN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1960s, the federal Food and Drug Administration
has required pharmaceutical companies to prove through clinical
tests that the drugs they market are safe and effective. Such tests
are typically conducted only on adults. But new regulations
effective in April will at last require separate testing on infants
and children.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians have long called for separate clinical studies and
labeling of drugs for pediatric use. Differences in metabolism,
volume of body fluids and elimination of a drug from a child's
system can cause drug responses that are different from that
experienced by adults. Yet only about 20 percent of all drugs
marketed in the United States have been tested for infants and
children. Many that have not been formally tested are routinely
prescribed for children anyway. This means that doctors are often
left guessing about a drug's effectiveness and safe dosages for
young patients.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations will require pediatric testing if a new drug
or a new form of an old drug is likely to be used by children or if
it provides a benefit that is not available in existing treatments.
The regulations will allow companies to delay pediatric testing
until after the drugs have been approved as safe for adults.
Manufacturers also may be allowed to use some data from adult
testing in certain cases, and to seek an exemption if the product
is likely to be unsafe or ineffective for children or if a study
would be highly impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA estimates that the cost of pediatric testing will be
less than 1 percent of the total cost of developing a new drug, or
less than $50 million annually for all pediatric testing. Yet
savings in reduced health costs as a result of better drug
treatments for children are estimated at $100 million a year. This
is a safeguard that has been put off for too long.

 &HT;    Final call rests with results of NBA, union meeting
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If only to avoid a public-relations disaster, the NBA
and union negotiators will sit down in New York next week to hammer
out a labor agreement to save the season.
</P>
<P>
   While the league takes a hard-line stance, the union has toned
down the harsh rhetoric of previous weeks, is making conciliatory
gestures and has marked the specific areas required for accord.
</P>
<P>
   Players and agents will be startled if Commissioner David Stern
refuses one last chance for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close to an agreement,'' the Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo
said. ``We can write a number on the board, and they can write a
number on the board, and we can have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   So, after nine months of discord and often strident speech, the
fate of the game rests on the good will of two groups of men who
have sought to bury each other.
</P>
<P>
   Who are they?
</P>
<P>
   The league's nine-member labor committee is made up largely of
tough, wealthy businessmen who built their own fortunes or greatly
expanded the generous hands dealt them.
</P>
<P>
   On the players' side, four of 19 members are clients of agent
David Falk, including association president Patrick Ewing and vice
president Mutombo. With Juwan Howard and Alonzo Mourning, nearly
one-fifth of the membership represents Falk's views, just one
reason the most powerful agent is seen as the union bogeyman.
</P>
<P>
   While the voices of Falk clients might ring loudest, the
committee also includes seven who earned less than $1 million last
season and a total of 10 who made less than the league average of
$2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the accusatory Falk voices linger in the air, and the
deadline approaches with lingering animosities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, can Miami's Mickey Arison ever deal with the Heat's
Mourning in quite the same way after the player accused the owners
of being greedy, and racist besides?
</P>
<P>
   Verbally, Mourning has been the meanest bomb-thrower in this
bunch, although Seattle's Jim McIlvaine has been astonishingly
bellicose, considering his modest talent and relatively huge
contract. Players have speculated that McIlvaine, ridiculed for his
ineffectiveness on the court, is attempting to curry favor by
lambasting the owners who have made him rich beyond his skills.
</P>
<P>
   The players have spoken out often, to the public chagrin of
executive director Billy Hunter and to the detriment of their own
cause, while Stern has kept a tight rein on his people, threatening
six-figure fines for any club owner or executive who speaks out.
Only Dave Checketts of the Knicks did so, but Stern forgave his
inflammatory speech in New York. Not coincidentally, it contained a
message the league espoused.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik and lead counsel Jeffrey Mishkin
often speak for the league, but there is no question that this is
Stern's lockout, his list of proposals and his yea or nay on a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The union might aim a pitch at one or more members of the
labor-relations committee, but it is Stern who orchestrates and
conducts for his side, the players say. He runs his show with an
iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hunter and various player agents wonder if Stern wants
to save the season, they are speaking of a genuine authoritarian.
It is believed that the commissioner told the owners to retain him
only if he had a free hand to retake control of their financial
destiny. And when two owners, Boston's Paul Gaston and Portland's
free-spending Paul Allen, bucked him on the lockout vote, they were
brought into line quickly. There has been no dissent since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know David's in charge when you sit down to meet,'' the
Hawks' Ty Corbin says. ``He controls everything. You can be in the
middle of a pretty meaningful discussion with one or two of the
owners, thinking you're making progress, but if David doesn't like
the way it's going, he stops it by changing the subject or calling
for a caucus. When they come back from their caucus, the agenda
changes completely, and it's all his doing, his show.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not all of the owners play by Stern's rules. On
occasion, committee members have shown flagrant disregard, as when
Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix attempted to broker a trade for Mutombo
during the moratorium of 1995 or when he made under-the-table
promises to Danny Manning. Only a few days ago, it was reported
that Utah's Larry Miller had agreed to give Karl Malone a $20
million annual extension starting with the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   But on this issue, Stern makes the final call. ``You can bet on
that,'' Mutombo says.

EDITORIAL: KEEPING MILITARY SECRETS FROM CHINA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 1:
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan investigation in the House of Representatives has
uncovered serious damage to American national security from two
decades of inappropriate, careless and in some cases illegal
nuclear and missile technology transfers to China. These findings
constitute an urgent warning that American businesses and political
leaders must deal more carefully with China, a country with great
power ambitions and nuclear weapons. Chinese interests sometimes
conflict with those of the United States. The White House and
Congress should quickly declassify as much of the report as
possible, so that vulnerable areas can be identified and corrective
measures taken.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began last June after The Times reported that two
American companies, Loral Space and Communications and Hughes
Electronics Corp., may have improperly helped China fix problems in
rocket design. The House committee confirmed Pentagon and State
Department findings that this assistance not only helped the
Chinese space industry, serving the business interests of Loral and
Hughes, but may also have helped improve the reliability of China's
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   House investigators further uncovered a Chinese effort to
acquire American military technology extending over the Reagan,
Bush and Clinton administrations. It included stealing weapons
designs from American nuclear laboratories and obtaining sensitive
computer, missile and satellite technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also reviewed the activities of the daughter of a
senior Chinese general who helped channel Chinese government
payments to Democratic Party fund-raisers. But the larger question
of possible links between political contributions and national
security damage will be pursued by the Senate intelligence
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite partisan skirmishing on other issues in Congress, the
committee's Republican chairman, Christopher Cox, and its ranking
Democrat, Norm Dicks, conducted a responsible inquiry on a
crucially important subject. They deserve America's thanks and
serious attention to their findings.

   SATURDAY GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   12:30 p.m. _ Buffalo (10-6) vs. Miami (10-6)
</P>
<P>
   _ KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Bills (87.4) _ Doug Flutie quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins (80.0) _ Dan Marino quarterback rating.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: This is the third meeting this season between these
divisional rivals, with Miami winning by 13-7 at home and Buffalo
winning by 30-24 at home. This one is in Miami's house, Pro Player
Stadium, site of Super Bowl XXXIII. Miami is 7-1 at home, where it
has allowed an average of only 10.3 points a game. These teams are
so familiar that it will be difficult to pull punches or surprises.
Both, however, will try. Watch Miami to try something funky in the
kicking game. Look for Buffalo to razzle with a reverse or two or a
halfback pass. But when you get right down to it, two factors will
swing this game Buffalo's way: the running game and turnovers. The
Bills boast the second-best rushing game in the American Football
Conference (135.9 yards averaged a game) and are 6-0 this season
when back Antowain Smith scores a touchdown. In turnovers, Buffalo
is plus 3 over Miami, and the Bills have lost only six fumbles,
fewest in team history. Watch Buffalo kicker Steve Christie _ he
has 20 playoff field goals and needs 3 more to pass George Blanda
for most in postseason history. Christie will get his kicks. So
will Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   BILLS, 23-17.
</P>
<P>
   4:05 p.m. _ Arizona (9-7) vs. Dallas (10-6)
</P>
<P>
   _ KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (89) _ Frank Sanders NFC-best receptions total.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (32-19) _ playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT _ No wonder Dallas has such a worldwide following. The
Cowboys' .627 playoff winning percentage is second only to Green
Bay's .710 (22-9 record). Dallas has more playoff seasons (25) than
any other franchise, more games (51), more victories (32) and more
points (1,254). It is a league-best 12-3 in the playoffs in the
1990s, and that includes a 7-0 home record. Do you hear the Arizona
Cardinals knees knocking? No.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say poor Arizona. Don't pity the Cardinals. They are
flying now, winning last week over San Diego in dramatic fashion to
reach their first playoffs in 16 years. So, the Cardinals have not
won a playoff game since 1947. So what. This is a special team. It
won a league record seven games by 3 or fewer points. It has a
quarterback in Jake Plummer who passed for 3,737 yards, third-best
in the National Football Conference. Receiver Frank Sanders made 31
third-down catches, second-best in the NFC. Safety Kwamie Lassiter
earned an NFC-best eight interceptions, four of them last week in
the San Diego game. The Cardinals dropped both games to Dallas in
the regular season, and Dallas scored 38 the first time and 35 in
the rematch. Arizona will need a solid game from end Simeon Rice to
help spur its defense and slow down the Dallas scoring. Once that
is accomplished, watch Plummer, who passed for 465 yards vs. Dallas
in November, finish it.
</P>
<P>
   CARDINALS, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   12:40 p.m. _ New England (9-7) vs. Jacksonville (11-5)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (1,115) _ Rookie back Robert Edwards rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars (1,223) _ Rookie back Fred Taylor's rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Two rookie running backs square heads as two teams who
played in the 1997 AFC championship game meet once again in the
post-season. The running backs will gain attention but not nearly
as much as the quarterbacks. Mark Brunell believes he can bounce
back from injury for Jacksonville. Drew Bledsoe is out for New
England. This is Jacksonville's first home playoff game in its
history. Jacksonville has won 21 of its last 24 at home and is 7-1
there this season. The battle is uphill all the way for New England
and Scott Zolak, its starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   What gives New England a chance is a savvy group of veterans on
defense who know how to perform well in big games. Linebacker Chris
Slade, cornerback Ty Law and others along the defense have immense
pride and talent to match, and they will make the game rugged for
the Jacksonville offense, especially early. But without enough help
from the depleted offense, the Patriots will suffer. New England's
chances are better if Brunell couldn't go and rookie backup
Jonathon Quinn played. That would be an equalizer. Jacksonville,
though, slips by.
</P>
<P>
   JAGUARS, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   4:15 p.m. _ Green Bay (11-5) vs. San Francisco (12-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS:
</P>
<P>
   Packers (4-0) _ Wild card playoff record.
</P>
<P>
   49ers (17-1) _ Coach Steve Mariucci's home record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Five straight losses. Three straight playoff losses.
Mind games. That's what the Packers have done to the 49ers: tossed
them aside for five straight and put doubt and confusion and
frustration into the 49ers' minds. In 18 home games, 49ers coach
Steve Mariucci has lost only once. Guess to which team? Green Bay,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is tired of it. They want the streak to end now.
Watch Steve Young enter with precision and watch the 49ers play
with a type of emotion we have seldom seen. This matchup will bring
out their greatest passion. And, yet, it might not be enough. There
are reasons why Green Bay has hammered the 49ers. First, they've
physically hammered them. Then, too, quarterback Brett Favre has
outplayed Young, and the Green Bay defense has thoroughly outplayed
the 49ers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   The game will boil down to receiver Antonio Freeman against the
49ers' secondary. In the last two games between these teams,
Freeman has 11 catches for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. There is no
one back there to shut down Freeman. He is the thorn that will
pierce San Francisco most. Once again.
</P>
<P>
   PACKERS, 28-21

BELL ATLANTIC TALKS WITH CELL PHONE GIANT COULD SET OFF PRICE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A LONGER VERSION OF THIS STORY WILL MOVE BY 10 p.m. ET.) 
(htv) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and DAVID MORROW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local telephone company, is
in talks to buy Airtouch Communications, the largest wireless
telephone company for $45 billion in stock, executives close to the
companies said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could be announced as early as Monday, would
bring New York-based Bell Atlantic, which already offers cellular
services along the East Coast, one step closer to creating a
nationwide and even international wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch serves the entire West Coast and has a number of
partnerships in Europe and Asia that would expand Bell Atlantic's
network considerably on those continents. Among those is a
partnership with Mannesmann Mobilfunk of Germany that makes
Airtouch one of the biggest providers of cellular services in
Europe. In all, international wireless services make up 57 percent
of Airtouch's operating income, according to Deutsche Bank
Research.
</P>
<P>
   As with any deal not yet sealed, talks could fall apart at any
time. Both boards are expected to meet over the weekend to discuss
details.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would also need the blessing of GTE, which agreed last
summer to be acquired by Bell Atlantic in a $52.9 billion stock
swap. At the time, GTE shareholders complained that Bell Atlantic
did not pay a premium for their shares as is typical in large stock
acquisitions. But as of Thursday night, GTE executives were said to
be supportive of the deal, believing it would be good for the
combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that if a deal is reached, the prices of
some cellular calls on the newly combined network could be sliced
by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the increased competition in the industry, rates have
been falling around 15 percent to 20 percent annually in
wireless,'' said Mel Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``If
this acquisition doesn't accelerate that amount, it should
definitely keep it continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   And beyond lower prices, analysts said that the main impetus for
combining cellular networks was the ongoing effort within the
industry to offer service plans that can be used anywhere in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AT&AMP;T introduced its Digital One rate service, which
lets users buy 600 wireless minutes at $90 a month that can be used
anywhere in the country. Sprint PCS has introduced similar plans. A
Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination, analysts said, would be
well positioned to compete against both plans.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the closing stock price Thursday, Bell Atlantic has a
market value of $87 billion, twice that of AirTouch, which is
valued at $41.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal makes all the sense in the world,'' said Charles A.
Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund,
which owns AirTouch stock. ``This allows them to have a national
footprint and compete with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any combination of the two companies faces hurdles among
both regulators and investors. For one thing, the merger between
GTE and Bell Atlantic, which is currently under scrutiny by the
federal government, has not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding another party to that merger could raise even more
eyebrows in Washington, even though some industry observers suggest
a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination is likely to be completed
first.

MODERN RUGS THAT BROKE WITH THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WENDY MOONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jed Johnson, the interior designer, used to advise
clients to ``start with a good rug and build the room around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers who follow this credo have a treat in store, though it
will last only one week. On Jan. 14 Doris Leslie Blau, a veteran
Manhattan carpet dealer, is opening ``Les Annees Folles'' (``The
Crazy Years''), an exhibition of about 30 rare Art Deco rugs, at
the Beadleston Gallery at 724 Fifth Ave., near 56th Street. A
homage to the artists who reinvented carpet styling between 1920
and 1940, the show, which runs through Jan. 21, was organized in
conjunction with the Textilia gallery in Rome, where it has already
been on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``These artists revolutionized the style of rugs,'' Mrs. Blau
said. ``For the first time, there is no Oriental influence.'' She
added: ``These rugs aren't copies of anything. They are based on no
previous design. They were inspired by music, art and furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Many artists in the show, like Jules and Paule Leleu, Ivan Da
Silva Bruhns and Marion Dorn, are not well known, though they were
famous in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people did paintings, drawings, furniture and carpets,''
Mrs. Blau explained. ``I think they did the floor coverings after
they had done the rest of the decor. For them, the mood of a room
was set by the art, the textiles and furniture. From these things,
they interpreted something to go on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The rugs are neither handmade nor one of a kind, but most were
created in limited editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, designers were an integral part of the making
of the rug; they were there from start to finish,'' said Mrs. Blau,
who opened her rug gallery in 1972. ``The Deco designers were
different. They were artists who simply decided to do rugs. They
did not work at the factories.''
</P>
<P>
   In style, the rugs made after 1925 tend to be abstract and
geometric, with overlapping blocks of color. The rug artists were
vehemently antihistoricist. As Roberto Danon, an owner of Textilia,
wrote in the show's catalog, ``For the first time, the concept of
tradition was seriously put into question.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The modern designers adapted to their time. In fact,
they leaned toward aesthetics inspired by mechanization and speed,
linked to different movements such as Futurism and the specific
branch of Cubism influence by African art.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the artists participated in the Exposition
Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, which
was held in Paris in 1925 and gave Art Deco its name. Originally
planned for 1907, rescheduled for 1912 and postponed again until
after World War I, the show featured fashion, textiles, interior
decoration, furniture design and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The artists in the 1925 exposition were a Who's Who of French
Deco design. There were interiors by Robert Mallet-Stevens,
furniture by Pierre Chareau, glass by Rene Lalique and silver by
Jean Puiforcat. None of those big names designed rugs for the fair,
Mrs. Blau said, and none are in her show.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blau said her exhibition pointed out the great artistic
distance between Art Nouveau and Art Deco. ``Art Nouveau was round
and curvey,'' Mrs. Blau said. ``Deco was clean and minimalist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deco artists adapted a new palette for their rugs. Some used
quiet colors: taupes with sandy beiges and browns. Others combined
bold, vivid colors, like purple with yellow, orange with brown, or
pink with aqua.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rugs are either earthy or brilliant,'' Mrs. Blau said. ``I
think the theatrical, bold ones have a lot to do with the music
that African-Americans introduced to France in the 1920s. Think of
jazz and Josephine Baker.''
</P>
<P>
   Danon wrote, ``The use and choice of color pervade the French
environment of the time.'' He suggested that the designers adapted
the colors in Fauvist paintings and in sets seen in Diaghilev's
Ballets Russes.
</P>
<P>
   One rug in the show looks like an abstract painting of a pale
blue mountain range set against a brown sky. Thin vertical lines in
white and aqua rain down from the sky, almost like a meteor shower.
The rug was designed around 1930 by Marion Dorn, an American who
lived in Paris from 1921 to 1925 and who became the best-known
carpet designer in Britain in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn was prolific; she designed textiles in Modernist motifs for
Claridges and other hotels and the ocean liner Queen Mary. She also
did the white carpet for Syrie Maugham's famous all-white London
living room in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Dorn was married to the American poster artist and costume and
set designer Edward McKnight Kauffer. They lived in London until
1940, then returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Dorn's rug noteworthy is that it has a top and
bottom, like a painting. One yearns to see the interior it was
designed for.
</P>
<P>
   Another rug in the show is done in an abstract red and purple
diamond pattern. Signed ``Leleu,'' it may have been designed by
Jules-Emile Leleu, a French designer who did interiors for more
than 20 ocean liners, including the Ile de France in 1926 and the
Normandie in 1935. Or the artist might have been his daughter Paule
Leleu, a painter and designer.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Keshishian, an owner of the Keshishian rug gallery in
London and an authority on Deco carpets, pointed out the importance
of women designers in this period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it was the result of the suffragette movement,'' he
said. ``It was the first time women had a chance to promote
themselves. They became the home furnishers rather than letting the
men dictate to them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Paule Leleu often collaborated with Ivan Da Silva Bruhns, an
artist who is not yet in most design dictionaries but is
represented by two circa 1930 rugs in the Blau show. The son of
Brazilians, Bruhns, a painter, worked in France in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was influenced by Cubist painters, Picasso in particular,
and in his rugs he adopted bold interlocking shapes relieved by
small motifs,'' Keshishian said. ``He was most inspired by an
exhibition of crafts from the French colonies in Marseilles in
1922. He saw Berber rugs from Morocco for the first time and soon
began using their browns and creamy colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Keshishian is selling a rug that he said Bruhns was commissioned
to create for the bedroom of the Maharajah of Indore, who decorated
his new modernist palace, Manik Bagh, in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The palace was one of the largest Art Deco projects ever
undertaken,'' Keshishian said. ``The furniture was supplied by
Ruhlmann, Charlotte Alix and Eileen Gray. Sotheby's auctioned 200
works from the palace in Monaco in 1980.''
</P>
<P>
   Deco rugs were the first made in different shapes, like circles,
ovals and triangles, Keshishian said. They tend to be small but
still pricey. Those at the Blau show range from $12,000 to $65,000.

 CLINTON FINDS RELAXATION AT RENAISSANCE WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ When the choice came down on this bright
cool day to golf or heartfelt indoor gab, President Clinton, who
has not had much recreation lately, made his preference clear.
</P>
<P>
   On his 15th visit to the annual Renaissance Weekend retreat, he
spent almost six hours on the golf course and about 90 minutes,
after dark, answering questions about subjects like the euro and
biological warfare and voter turnout, with guests 13 to 25 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   All seminars held during Renaissance Weekend are off the record,
and reporters were not admitted to Clinton's session Thursday
evening. But a White House spokeswoman, Amy Weiss, said the subject
of impeachment never came up.
</P>
<P>
   She said the final questioner in the audience of about 125
people asked Clinton what he had learned about life. She said he
replied that ``he's more optimistic than when he took office in
1993, about the capacity of the American people to make changes and
the ability of the government to help people improve their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 365 seminars are being held by the businessmen,
politicians, journalists, academics and others who have assembled
for five days of highbrow chatter and aggressive networking beside
the Atlantic. So far, Clinton has skipped all the planned sessions,
on matters from searching the soul to fattening the portfolio; he
had suggested the one he led Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he and Hillary Rodham Clinton attended a banquet to mark
the new year with the other guests.
</P>
<P>
   The president's travails in 1998 have not dampened turnout here.
About 1,350 guests attended, more than in recent years, said Linda
LeSourd Lader, one of the retreat's founders.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is whether Clinton's difficulties have lent a
certain frisson to the gathering, even more than his mere presence
traditionally has. It is part of the ethic of Renaissance Weekend
for guests to be blase about celebrities in their midst (since part
of the satisfaction of attending is that everyone is supposed to be
distinguished).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, once Clinton arrived Thursday evening, some guests
far older than 25 could be seen scurrying through the halls of the
Hyatt Hotel in the direction of his seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by eagerly greeted Clinton after he arrived Wednesday
evening, when he took a stroll with his dog, Buddy, along the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her own long walk on the beach
Thursday. She spent most of the day, with her daughter, Chelsea, in
the beachfront home that the family is renting from an Atlanta
commodities trader.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Powell, one of five men who played golf with the president,
said before the banquet Thursday evening that Clinton had clearly
enjoyed himself. ``The people we saw along the golf course were
very supportive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the assistant secretary for management at the Department
of Veterans Affairs, said it bothered him ``when people say, how
can he take six hours to play golf?'' He called the time spent
talking and joking on the course _ and sometimes taking a couple of
extra drives when the first was unsatisfactory _ ``pure
relaxation'' and ``a way to get away from the foolishness.''

 AS McKAY GETS BACK INTO SHAPE, DEVILS SHOW SOME MUSCLE  
(bl) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. _ After his first rigorous practice in more
than a week, Randy McKay sat down on the ice at the South Mountain
Arena to speak with New Jersey Devils coach Robbie Ftorek. As the
discussion went on, there was an exhausted McKay, lying on the cold
ice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When McKay finally retreated to the locker room and struggled to
pull his skates off, his teammates sarcastically welcomed him back,
commenting, ``It wasn't the same without you,'' and, ``Great to see
you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McKay was back with the team on the ice for the first time in
approximately 10 days. In mid-December, he suffered a elbow cut,
which required three stitches to close. The wound became infected
and inflamed, sending him to the hospital for two days before
Christmas. After the team took a two-day Christmas break, McKay
then contracted a flu and lost approximately 10 pounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had done just fine without him, winning three of the
four games he missed. Still, McKay pushed himself Thursday and will
do so again Friday, hoping to be ready to play when the Devils go
on the road face Ottawa for the first time since the senators upset
them in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I skated for about 20 minutes on Monday and about a half-hour
on Tuesday,'' McKay said. ``I did not have energy both days, but it
was mostly to get my legs and muscles back going again. Today was
definitely my hardest day. I felt good, now I'm a little tired. I
think that's expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The infection and flu took a toll on his body and while McKay
insisted that he felt much better Thursday, he may be far from game
ready. ``I watched him today and I'll watch him tomorrow,'' Ftorek
said. ``He's lost a lot of weight, and when you lose weight, you
lose strength. But he skated today and that's part of the job of
getting back into the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little need for McKay to rush back. In his place, Vadim
Sharifijanov has played well, posting two assists against St.
Louis, a goal against Buffalo on Dec. 28, and then netting the
first goal of the game and adding an assist Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing really well,'' McKay said of Sharifijanov.
``He's starting to put up some numbers. That's great for him. He's
been in and out of lineup all year. To get a few games back-to-back
in the lineup and producing is great for his confidence and it's
good for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek is not worrying over how McKay's return will affect the
lineup.``Things usually work their way out,'' the coach said said.
``You cross the bridges as you get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOB CARPENTER &LR; , who did not skate with the team Thursday, had a
toe extender made for his skate in an effort to ease the pain of a
bruised toe. &QL;

DESPITE TURMOIL, BIG INVESTMENT BANKS HAD LUCRATIVE YEAR

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The finance industry had a turbulent year, with sharp swings in
stock and bond markets and the spreading global financial crisis
threatening America's long bull market. But in the end, major U.S.
investment banks did more business and earned more money than ever,
and the hierarchy of Wall Street banks remained as solid as the
limestone portico of the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A robust first six months of the year and a racing finish
compensated for the near shut-down of financial markets in the
July-September quarter, according to statistics released Thursday
by Securities Data Co. Investment banks underwrote $1.82 trillion
in new stocks and bonds, an increase of about 40 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The underwriting docket was heavily skewed toward bonds this
year, which rose 44 percent as companies and government agencies
took advantage of record low interest rates. U.S. stocks sales
slumped almost 10 percent, with the market drying up in the second
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The ardor among companies worldwide to acquire one another grew
to unprecedented levels. Investment banks advised companies on
mergers and acquisition deals valued at $2.5 trillion, up by almost
half from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, despite the shock induced by Russia's financial
meltdown in August, many Wall Street firms are on course to earn as
much or more than they did last year, which set records for most
firms. Bankers say they are now hopeful that the late summer scare
_ and the layoffs that followed _ were more an aberration than a
foreshadowing of tough times. But the optimism is subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a bullet,'' said Jeffrey Weiss, a managing director
and the global head of fixed-income syndication at Lehman Brothers.
``But there are still some unresolved issues in the world _ Brazil,
Asia and Russia. Everyone is starting off a bit more cautious than
we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The year's turmoil did not rock the rankings of top investment
banks. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.,
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and Lehman
Brothers earned the most fees and underwrote the most stocks and
bonds, as they did in the previous year. But Merrill, Morgan and
Goldman dominated the most lucrative investment banking businesses,
including initial public offerings of stock and advising on
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   One half of all first-time stock offerings by American companies
last year were brought to market by Morgan, Merrill or Goldman.
Even more impressive, those three investment banks advised one side
or the other in nine out of every 10 worldwide mergers and
acquisitions by dollar value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top three are continuing to pull away and gain market
share,'' said Raphael Soifer, brokerage industry analyst for Brown
Brothers Harriman. ``In tougher times, clients tend to gravitate to
the bigger firms. That makes it tougher for their competitors to
break into the super bulge bracket category.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were some warning signs even for the biggest firms.
Investment banks continue to see their overall profit margins
shrink. The fees they disclosed totaled $8.8 billion for the year,
but the pace of increase, at 2.5 percent, slipped well behind the
growth in underwriting. That reflects the running battle among
banks to be part of big underwriting deals, with competition for
market share sometimes eating into profits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, the quarterly rankings of investment banks, known in the
industry as the league tables, can be misleading. Bankers
acknowledge privately that they lose money underwriting half to as
much as two-thirds of the high-grade bonds they work on. They
justify these loss leaders as good advertising and as a way to
please big clients. Similarly, many of the top merger advisory
deals require relatively little work and generate small fees, but
can propel advisers high up the league tables.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch retained its title as the high-volume underwriter
of stock and bonds, increasing its total market share to almost 17
percent from 16 percent the year before with $356 billion in sales.
Salomon Smith Barney arranged $249 billion for second place, buoyed
in part by WorldCom Inc.'s $6 billion bond sale, the world's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill held its top spot despite falling into the red in the
third quarter, largely because it suffered losses in emerging
markets and trading bonds. As a result, Merrill laid off nearly 5
percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   In mergers, Goldman dominated the advisory business worldwide _
and substantially increased its market share. Goldman advised on
$960 billion in deals, or about 38 percent of all those announced.
Merrill beat out Morgan Stanley, last year's number two, for the
second spot. Merrill advised companies involved in 26 percent of
all announced deals. Morgan Stanley had a role in just under 26
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The market for initial public offerings cooled dramatically this
year, a direct result of global financial turmoil. The number of
new companies brought to market in the United States fell to 372
from 630, and the value of those deals declined by about 15 percent
from the year-ago levels.
</P>
<P>
   The tougher market _ which hit technology and health-care
companies especially hard _ dislodged Goldman from its pedestal as
the largest underwriter of new issues. Morgan Stanley took top
billing, with a 21 percent market share. Morgan underwrote Conoco
Inc.'s $4.4 billion public offering. Merrill was close behind and
Goldman was third.
</P>
<P>
   Other major firms solidified their leads in niche markets.
Lehman, for example, has a commanding market share in mortgage- and
asset-backed securities. It increased its slice of that market to
15 percent this year from 12.7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette did likewise in the market for
high-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds, which are considered
the most lucrative fixed-income business. The firm increased its
share of that market to nearly 15 percent from 12 percent a year
ago.

WELLESLEY PROFESSOR'S LIBEL SUIT AGAINST STUDENT JOURNALIST
DISMISSED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  By FELICITY BARRINGER 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Massachusetts trial court judge has dismissed a Wellesley
professor's libel suit against a student journalist who had
written, incorrectly, that the professor ``gained tenure within the
Africana Studies department only after successfully suing the
college for racial discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Tony Martin, sued Wellesley for racial
discrimination in 1987, and the lawsuit was settled out of court.
But Martin had been granted tenure in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The student journalist, Avik Roy, writing in a student
publication called Counterpoint, had included the incorrect
information in a long article about various controversies involving
Martin, and about the Wellesley administration's reluctance to have
these controversies publicized.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, Justice Judith Fabricant, a justice of
Massachusetts state Superior Court wrote, ``There is simply nothing
in the statement that a reasonable reader could interpret in a
manner that would damage Martin's reputation among any respectable
segment of the community.'' The judge said Martin did not prove
defamation or malice.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 23 ruling was mailed to Roy's lawyer, Robert A.
Bertsche, who made the ruling public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roy's article was published in the journal _ a joint publication
of students at Wellesley and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology _ in 1993, when he was an MIT student.
</P>
<P>
   A year before the publication of Roy's article, Martin had drawn
widespread criticism for using the book ``The Secret Relationship
Between Blacks and Jews,'' which was published by the Nation of
Islam, as a text in his courses.
</P>
<P>
   Roy's lawyer, Bertsche, said, ``The same First Amendment values
that protect his right to teach that book protect the right of a
student journalist to do reporting about him and give that student
breathing room to have honest mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that he would not decide whether to appeal until he
had a chance to consult with his lawyer.

CARDINALS' DUO FIND IT BETTER TO RECEIVE  
 MOORE-SANDERS TANDEM AT TOP OF THEIR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Think of the great receiving tandems in the NFL,
and the mind goes directly to Minnesota and the 2,324 yards and 29
touchdowns compiled by Randy Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each individual team in the league would give credence to
their own guys being the best, but I wouldn't trade our two for any
two,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said of wide receivers Rob Moore
and Frank Sanders. ``I know you would be hard pressed to find a
tandem that is any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that is debatable.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, the fourth-year pro who played in a run-oriented
program at Auburn, leads the NFC in receptions with 89 and only
trails Miami's O.J. McDuffie by one for the NFL lead.
</P>
<P>
   And Moore, a product of Syracuse, needs no introduction after a
nine-year career with the New York Jets and Cardinals that has seen
him make 591 catches for 8,747 yards and 44 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky during my coaching career,'' Cardinals
offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said. ``I've had a chance to
work with Johnnie Morton and Herman Moore, Jerry Rice and John
Taylor and that group, and, in their early years, Carter and Jake
Reed, and Reggie Langhorne and Webster Slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank and Rob are as a formidable group as any of those _
well, Rice and Taylor are kind of in a place of their own. But Rob
is a very experienced guy and Frank is just stepping up into his
own and still hasn't reached his potential. I know they're
certainly as good as any in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was slowed for much of the early season because of a
nagging hamstring pull that limited his performance. Sanders
suffered a bruised knee Sunday against San Diego and missed
Thursday's practice to undergo a precautionary magnetic resonance
imaging, basically just to ease his mind.
</P>
<P>
   While their combined yardage (2,127) and receptions (156) this
year are impressive, they've only produced eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those numbers have been lost in a new system and a
young quarterback,'' Trestman said. ``I think the last half of the
season has been more like the production they want as a tandem, and
it will be carried on through the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tobin, Trestman insists he wouldn't trade them for another
pair. Sanders is 6 feet 3, 203 pounds, and Sanders is 6-2, 200.
Trestman likes their size, strength, big-play ability and, better
yet, their character.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have big-play ability, but they can be physical at
times,'' he said. ``They're willing blockers, and we want them to
take pride in that. Eventually, we want to have the best set of
blocking receivers in the NFL, and we talk about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches and their teammates agree that the tandem's work
ethic has paid dividends in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dave Brown came in from New York and saw them, he told
me, `You guys are lucky _ not to say the Giants' receivers aren't
good _ but those guys come out and bust their butts everyday,
whether it's mini-camp, training camp, practice or a game,' ''
Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer said. ``You have to enjoy that
because it enables you to get quality repetitions yourself every
day throughout the season.'
</P>
<P>
   Perennial All-Pro cornerback Aeneas Williams says ``amen'' to
that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be up there in the top three,'' he said. ``They
help me tremendously, going against the best receivers in the
league everyday.'' &QL;

ESPN'S MAGUIRE ADDS PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could  &UR; Eric Swann have lasted the whole season? Should  &UR; Deion
Sanders give it a try with his bad toe?
</P>
<P>
   ESPN analyst  &UR; Paul Maguire, who will be calling the
Cardinals-Cowboys game Saturday for ABC-TV along with  &UR; Mike Patrick
and  &UR; Joe Theismann, said it's all on a case-by-case basis, but when
he played . . .
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, who punted 11 seasons for the Chargers and Bills, let
out a little chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' he said. ``I do know that only
the people who are hurt know how badly they're hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, you played hurt. If you didn't, they had
somebody else to take your job, no question about it. The trainers
would say you're hurt, and the coach said you could play. So I told
the coach, sure, I can play. You took a pain pill, a shot, and you
played. It doesn't work that way anymore. You've got guys making a
lot of money, and their careers are on the line, and they're not
about to jeopardize the remaining years of their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire worked last year's Super Bowl for NBC-TV. His move to
ESPN has served to solidify the broadcast, and he's able to add a
different perspective than Theismann, the former quarterback.
Maguire said it's been a great first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we made some mistakes at the beginning, but we were
very fortunate to have four preseason games,'' he said. ``At NBC,
we had one and then got started.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio were in Tempe earlier this season to broadcast the
Cardinals-Eagles game, and the excitement level in Sun Devil
Stadium was nowhere near the current euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals didn't look like a playoff team in September,''
Maguire said. ``But you definitely could see potential. I think
during that game, and shortly thereafter, they let  &UR; Jake Plummer do
what he does best, and that's run and throw and improvise, and that
made the biggest difference in the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're turning the corner and going in the right direction
when you look at the way they won games. Good teams win when they
have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And winning will continue to bring in the crowds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give fans a product, and we are talking about a
lot of money,'' he said. ``Dallas isn't always sold out. When you
talk about great support, it's anywhere that you win. They support
you when you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has triggered most of this year's excitement, and
Maguire said the Cardinals did the smart thing in giving him the
big contract. He pointed out that there are many teams in desperate
need of a top-line quarterback. And the terms of Plummer's contract
_ a four-year extension worth $29.7 million, including a $15
million signing bonus, the largest in NFL history _ didn't make
Maguire flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Arizona, you have potentially a great quarterback,'' he
said. ``If you look at the Redskins, they signed two defensive
tackles for millions of dollars. Have you ever seen a defensive
tackle win a Super Bowl? I never have. I have seen quarterbacks win
them. To lock up a quarterback is the smartest thing any team can
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the youngest quarterback in the Pro Bowl?  &UR; Chris
Chandler, and he's 33. Jake's in now (third alternate). You've got
to make sure this guy is happy, I don't care what it takes. You
gotta do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third meeting of the season between the two
teams, but that doesn't make his preparation any easier, Maguire
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals have played Dallas twice and got beat twice,''
he said. ``That doesn't make the job any simpler. First of all,
what the Cardinals did in the first two games, they won't do in
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire's fear, and it's become pandemic around the country, is
that a bad call decides the game, as was the case when the Cowboys
beat the Cardinals earlier this season. He said on the air this
season that the only mistake made is an uncorrected mistake, and
that the technology is there to make the game better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any owner can look himself in the mirror and
vote against some sort of instant replay,'' he said. ``This has got
to be done to correct, not to embarrass. To allow some teams who
work 12 months and invest money, to have it all taken away by calls
that can be corrected . . . if you don't do that, something is
totally wrong with the entire system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, there were too many bad calls. The idea was always
that things level out. It won't ever level out.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
On the first playoff weekend, ABC has had the contract to televise
the Saturday games since 1990. CBS (AFC) and FOX (NFC) get one of
the Sunday games for their respective conferences.
</P>
<P>
   As for who got the 49ers-Packers or Cardinals-Cowobys, league
officials said there was no bidding between ABC or FOX for either
game. The NFL decided which game went to which network, according
to
 &UR; Dick Maxwell, the director of broadcasting services said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be a great game (Cardinals-Cowboys),''
Maxwell said. ``Dallas is a big name, and the Cardinals are kind of
a Cinderella team. It's a great time to do a Cardinals game, and
it's a good story line.'' &QL;

TEAMMATE DOES JOB WITH PEP TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals wide receiver  &UR; Anthony Edwards, who has
been on the injured reserve list the entire season, gave the team
an emotional speech after Thursday's workout. It has been
traditional for a player to talk to the team after the final
practice of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged them and reminded them that we haven't reached
our ultimate goal, which is to make it to the Super Bowl,'' Edwards
said. ``I told them we have to work together as a unit and that we
shouldn't be happy to just make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me the grace to be an inspiration, and if I can be an
inspiration, I'll do whatever I can to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said that even though Edwards has not been
able, he is respected by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony is a very emotional guy,'' Tobin said. ``He's been a
big part of our football team for many years. Your experiences are
based on what has happened in the past and when I first got around
a coach ( &UR; Ted Marchibroda at Indianapolis) that had players get up
and speak when we got into that playoff run. We had a guy who used
to be here,
 &UR; Freddie Joe Nunn, talk before our last game. That's what Anthony
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie continued to be the guy for us and continued to do a
great job. I just felt like Anthony would do the same thing. He's
going to be eventually a very good coach if that's what he chooses
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner  &UR; Bill Bidwill also tried the inspirational bit by
agreeing to  &UR; Tobin's request to take the nine players on injured
reserve, the four practice squad players and the four on the
inactive list to Dallas. The players can't be on the sideline but
will sit in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince wanted them to come to this first game, and I said OK,''
Bidwill said. ``It is a reward, as long as they understand it's not
a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill's action thrilled Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Edwards said. ``It's `we' in this team. We all
should go. I feel we're all a part of this. The practice guys give
good pictures (to the regulars).'' &QL; 
His heart's in Arizona &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, the Cardinals offensive
coordinator two years ago, went through a strange metamorphosis
during Sunday's regular-season finale against the Philadelphia
Eagles. The Giants knew at halftime that Tampa Bay had defeated
Cincinnati and that they were eliminated from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at halftime, my emotions switched to Arizona,'' Fassel
said. ``I wanted them to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he called Tobin to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm genuinely happy for him,'' he said. ``The year I spent
there, he treated me fantastically, the whole organization did.'' &QL; 
Sanders, McWilliams hurt &QL; 
 &UR; Frank Sanders (knee) and  &UR; Johnny McWilliams (hamstring) are listed
as questionable for Saturday's game. Tobin said he believes
Sanders' knee is getting better, but that the hamstring injuries
bother him because ``they can go at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders underwent a magnetic resonance imaging Thursday, and it
was good news. He has what is basically a bruised knee. Tobin said
that he is optimistic that Sanders will play, although  &UR; Ronnie
Anderson is available as a fourth receiver.
</P>
<P>
   On the inactive list are defensive lineman  &UR; Jomo Cousins,
offensive linemen  &UR; Jerome Daniels and  &UR; Allen DeGraffenreid and
defensive back  &UR; Ty
 &UR; Howard. Three more will be declared on game day. &QL; 
Extra points &QL; 
The Cardinals and America West Airlines will hold a send-off today
before the team heads for Dallas. The event, which will last about
20 minutes, will be held at the west cargo ramp area of Sky Harbor
International Airport. Gates open at 10:30 a.m., and the Bandwagon,
from the Cardinals' flagship station, KSLX-FM (100.7), will provide
entertainment. The rally begins at 11:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's playoff celebration at the Cardinals' training
facility, from 1-5 p.m. drew thousands of fans. Players and
cheerleaders were on hand. &QL;

PAST COACHES PRAISE TOBIN'S SUCCESS WITH TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Gene Stallings, Hank Kuhlmann, Joe Bugel and
Buddy Ryan share much in common.
</P>
<P>
   The four are known as football coaches to most, but Valley fans
know them as skeletons created by one of pro football's most futile
franchises, a coaching graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   They know the true meaning of frustration, each having been at
the controls of the Cardinals franchise since it was uprooted from
St. Louis and moved to the Valley for the 1988 season.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Kuhlmann, who now coaches Cardinals tight
ends and served as interim coach for five losing games after the
departure of Stallings in 1989, they each strived to be where Vince
Tobin and the Cardinals will be Saturday: in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs? This quartet coached a combined 189 games for owner
Bill Bidwill. They won 71 of them. Playoff games were a dream.
</P>
<P>
   But each, to a man, appreciates what Tobin has done in getting
to the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done an outstanding job,'' said Stallings, who was
fired with five games left in the 1989 season and then won a
national championship at Alabama. ``Not only with the way the
offense and (Jake) Plummer are playing, but with the way the
defense is playing, despite injuries. I'm very pleased for
everybody, and especially the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that Stallings and management never saw eye to
eye, especially Stallings and scouting director George Boone. He
was asked whether he is surprised the organization is spending the
money it is on talent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times change, and you have to keep up with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings' Cardinals carried playoff hopes into the final game
of the 1987 season at Dallas, but a 21-16 loss eliminated them.
</P>
<P>
   His first team in Arizona in 1988 was 7-4 and seemed destined
for a playoff berth. It had wins over Pittsburgh and Washington and
back-to-back victories over San Francisco and the New York Giants.
But a hip injury to quarterback Neil Lomax, combined with a series
of other injuries, sent the season into the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were close when Lomax got hurt, but it has been a
struggle ever since,'' said Kuhlmann, who was a Stallings assistant
at the time. ``It shows the importance of the quarterback, and now
we finally got a guy (Plummer) who can do it. What's good about
this is it shows people we are on the right track now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallings lists those experiences among the most frustrating of
his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Lomax's injury) obviously was disappointing, but so was
not being able to finish my last year there,'' he said. ``That, and
losing the final game of the season in Dallas _ all those things
were frustrating. But you can't help injuries. Like I've always
said, the healthiest team at the end of the season is the one to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   While oddsmakers give the Cardinals little chance in Dallas,
Stallings does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep up with them the best I can,'' he said from his
ranch in Paris, Texas. ``I have a satellite dish, but I'm so busy
that I'm not here a lot and don't have a chance to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a shot. It might be a better one if the game was in
Phoenix, but the Cowboys are crippled up, too. Both teams have fine
quarterbacks, but Plummer has the ability to scramble and create.
That can be a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   During Bugel's reign, he never saw a glass that was half-empty.
Or half-full, for that matter. It was always full, win or lose. The
community was split about his firing, believing the rebuilt
Cardinals were on the cusp of winning, but he harbors no grudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' said Bugel, who was coaching San
Diego's offensive line Sunday when the Cardinals clinched a
wild-card spot. ``The excitement was unbelievable. I've never had a
doubt that the Phoenix area is a great sports city. The people who
live there understand the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for them, and I'm happy for Mr. Bidwill and his
family, especially Michael Bidwill. He's a very bright young man
who has a lot of good ideas. He has done a great job. I'm happy for
guys like Aeneas Williams and Larry Centers, and their quarterback
is going to be a great one over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bugel, who also was fired after last season as the Oakland
Raiders coach, wishes he would have been allowed to see what he had
built on the field for another season with the Cardinals. But Ryan
was hired and went 8-8 with that team, then tore the roster apart
and was gone after the following year and a 4-12 record.
</P>
<P>
   So much for having a winner in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that team,'' Bugel said. ``We had (Steve) Beuerlein
and (Chris) Chandler, and the pieces were in place,'' he said. ``I
like their team now. They have a lot of good players who are close
to being great. They can give Dallas trouble because they have a
heck of a team for turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan keeps track of the NFL via a satellite dish at his Kentucky
farm but says he doesn't go out of his way to follow Arizona. In
typical fashion, he manages to take a bit of credit for the
Cardinals' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that they made it,'' he said. ``That Kwamie
(Lassiter) kid we picked up out of Kansas did a hell of a job. But
I'm glad they made it. Maybe it will help them with the stadium
issue. Tell Mr. B I'm happy for him.'' &QL;

DICKENS WITH DARKNESS AND DETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Felicitations from PBS and ``Masterpiece Theatre,'' which begin
the new year with a dark Charles Dickens tale of decay and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Love, too. It's sloshed in among the grime and muck of the
Thames River in ``Our Mutual Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour miniseries, based on Dickens' last completed novel,
will be shown in three parts, on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This excursion into deep, dark Victorianism is big, and it's
slow. The cast seems to include half the population of England.
</P>
<P>
   It's so big that screenwriter Sandy Welch's adaptation dwells
not only on the central love story in Dickens' novel but also pumps
a second, subsidiary love story into equal, center-ring
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The usual objections to ``Our Mutual Friend'' also apply. One is
a plot ruse that's stretched past breaking. Another is the tendency
to lash the story onward with barely plausible coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be news if the BBC had mangled Dickens altogether.
``Our Mutual Friend'' divvies out some compensating rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Story A involves young John Harmon (Steven Mackintosh), heir to
a fortune amassed from treasures unearthed in one of London's
immense trash heaps.
</P>
<P>
   He's required to marry a stranger, Bella Wilfer (Heather
Tobias), before he can claim his inheritance. Returning to England
from abroad, though, Harmon apparently is murdered and his corpse
plunked into the Thames. It won't take long to guess that he's
still alive and determined to win Bella's love without the
distraction of the fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But Bella wants crown sterling. She tells her father (Peter
Wight) at one point, ``I made up my mind that I must have money.
And as I can't beg, borrow or steal it, I must marry it.''
</P>
<P>
   Story B is about a listless upper-crust lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn
(Paul McGann), who falls in love with Lizzie Hexam (Keeley Hawes),
the virtuous but unpedigreed daughter of a river scavenger.
</P>
<P>
   Wrayburn isn't Lizzie's only suitor. There is also a dour
schoolmaster, Bradley Headstone (David Morrissey), one of the
scarier wild and crazy guys ever to set foot on PBS. He's insane,
and he's insanely jealous of Wrayburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterpiece Theatre'' host Russell Baker makes much of the
twin love stories. In truth, though, there's at least one more
that's worth comment. But these lovers aren't so young and
physically attractive.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ``dustman'' Mr. Boffin (Peter Vaughan) and Mrs.
Boffin (Pam Ferris), the kindly couple who end up with the
inheritance intended for John Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a settled but nevertheless palpable love. You can
almost spread your fingers and warm your hands on Mr. and Mrs.
Boffin. They're also the most recognizably Dickensian characters in
this late novel.
</P>
<P>
   The story has been pared from Dickens' weighty original but
surely could have withstood further streamlining _ maybe as much as
two hours of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Mutual Friend'' is dark, too. And muddy. Water is a
recurring motif, and hardly a cleansing agent. At night, corpses
pop up out of the Thames, and rain seems to aid and abet dirty
dealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits pay customary attention to detail. If you don't mind
the thick plot and labored pace, ``Our Mutual Friend'' is the sort
of show a patient viewer can inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   The feel is always right; you can lose yourself in mid-19th
century London, with all its avarice, grime, social climbing and
snobbery. You might be treading all that water, but so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens is in for a boffo few years on ``Masterpiece Theatre,''
by the way. A new ``Great Expectations'' is due in April, and
``David Copperfield'' and ``Oliver Twist'' are in the pipeline,
too.

(ATTN: CALIF .,  N . C . )  
 ANITA HOFFMAN, WIDOW OF YIPPIE LEADER, DIES AT 56  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anita Hoffman, who aided and abetted her Yippie husband, Abbie
Hoffman, in his anti-establishment protests and pranks and then
sustained him through her letters during his years as a fugitive,
died on Sunday at the age of 56.
</P>
<P>
   She had been suffering from breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hoffman had lived in Petaluma, Calif., where she sold rare
books. Until shortly before her death she continued to advise
actively on the production of ``Steal This Movie,'' a film produced
by Robert Greenwald that is scheduled for release next summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on letters she had exchanged with her husband during
the six years that he was sought by the FBI on charges of selling
cocaine. The exchanges appeared in a book, ``To America With Love:
Letters from the Underground,'' not long before Hoffman committed
suicide at 52 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   After the founder of the Yippie movement jumped bail in 1974,
Mrs. Hoffman and her son, america, who was deliberately named with
a lower case a, became the objects of constant FBI surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hoffman traveled in the United States and Europe
and eventually settled with his companion, Johanna Lawrenson, in a
remote hamlet in New York near the Thousand Islands, where under
the name of Barry Freed he became an ecological activist
campaigning to protect the St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
   Fully aware of his relationship with Ms. Lawrenson, his wife
wrote regularly and supportively, at one point helping him to find
a psychiatrist to treat him for what was later described as
schizophrenia and manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   The couple divorced after Hoffman surfaced in 1980 and served a
short prison term, but Greenwald, who is also the director of the
film, said, ``They always remained good and close friends, even
after the romance had ended.''
</P>
<P>
   They had met on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1967. She, then
still Anita Kushner, recently had received a master's degree in
psychology and he was operating Liberty House, a store that sold
the produce of rural blacks in Mississippi. Like him she had been
active in civil rights groups and was thinking of ways to engage
the hippies that were flocking to the Lower East Side in antiwar
protest.
</P>
<P>
   As Abbie Hoffman was to write in his book, ``Soon to Be a Major
Motion Picture,'' they had much in common. ``If I had been born a
woman, I would have been Anita. Sometimes couples take 50 years of
living together to look and act alike; we began right off. The
first night we spent together we fell in love. She was a born
rascal.''
</P>
<P>
   She reportedly helped plan and certainly witnessed her husband's
first major piece of guerrilla theater when he and a group of
blithe spirits burned money at the New York Stock Exchange. She was
also with her husband during the huge antiwar protest in Washington
in 1967 when Yippie formations encircled the Pentagon in an effort
to levitate the building with incantations. She was with him in
Chicago when street battles with police officers led to Hoffman's
arrest and trial in the Chicago Seven Conspiracy trial.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Mrs. Hoffman went to Algeria to meet with Eldridge
Cleaver in an attempt to forge a coalition between the anarchic
Yippies and the militant Black Panthers. According to Marty Jezer,
the author of a recent biography of Abbie Hoffman, she was shocked
by Cleaver's misogynist behavior and fled his residence through a
window.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, she had a son. As many Americans, they notified the
White House and duly received pro forma congratulations from the
Nixons, a fact they gleefully announced through the press, even
showing off the letter after the White House spokesman had denied
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 on, after Hoffman fled trial on drug charges, his wife
raised their son on her own, leading a less prominent life. After
working as an organizer of welfare recipients, she moved to the
West Coast where she read scripts for Hollywood producers. In 1970
she had written a novel about radicals of the period, called
Trashing, using the pen name Ann Fettaman.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her son, an electrician who lives in North
Carolina; her sister, Truusje Kushner, of the Los Angeles area, and
her mother, Leah Kushner, of Laguna Hills, Calif.

POSTSEASON HISTORY HAS BEEN SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It first happened in 1947. It last happened in
1982. In between, it happened four more times.
</P>
<P>
   That's six measly NFL playoff appearances in nearly eight
decades of gridiron warfare.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's happened again.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Texas Stadium, the Cardinals meet the unforgiving
Dallas Cowboys in a wild-card game, only the seventh time since
1920 the Chicago/St. Louis/Phoenix/Arizona franchise has ventured
into the land of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short playoff history, yes. Short and sometimes sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Cardinals, coached by Jim Conzelman, went 9-3 and
edged Philadelphia, 28-21, for the NFL championship at Comiskey
Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, behind long touchdown scampers by halfbacks
Charley Trippi and Elmer Angsman, grabbed an early 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ancient ones,'' said Bill Blackburn, a center and
outside linebacker on the 1947 team. ``We started it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater majority of the team were just a bunch of guys out
of the service or out of college. I think we only had nine
leftovers (from the 1-9 1945 team) so we were all relatively pretty
new. But we were full of piss and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (Conzelman) was a master at motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-2 Cardinals nearly returned to football's pulpit the
following season, again making it to the championship finale
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the game was played in snowy Philadelphia, where the
falling white stuff was so thick, Blackburn lost sight of the ball
several times throughout the game, won by Philly, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every four downs both teams were having to
punt,'' said Blackburn, who lives in Richardson, Texas. ``As soon
as the ball got 20 feet in the air, we all just stood around
because we couldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember both teams agreed they wouldn't contest (referee's)
calls regarding first downs and if someone went out of bounds
because there was so much snow you couldn't see the lines on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Marshall Goldberg, a running back and safety on
the 1947 and 1948 teams, recalls the game still was scoreless late
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible game because of the snow,'' said Goldberg,
who lives in Chicago. ``We ended up losing on a blocked punt. We
were on about our 15- or 20-yard line when they blocked our punt,
then ran it in about three or four plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good team, but I think the '47 team was better
because we were hungrier. We could taste the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 years passed before the Cardinals' next playoff game,
a 24-17 win over Green Bay in the Playoff Bowl, a non-advancing
playoff game between second-place teams in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still was an important game for us,'' said Cardinals Vice
President Larry Wilson, a safety on the 1964 team. ``It was big
because it was in the Green Bay Packers' heyday and they had a hell
of a football team. We took the game dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were 9-3-2 during the regular season (they split
two games against Dallas) and finished runner-up in the Eastern
Conference to eventual NFL champion Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good team,'' Wilson said. ``We had Charley
Johnson at quarterback, Bobby Joe Conrad (at flanker) and John
David Crow at running back. Defensively, we probably had one of the
best secondaries we've ever had with Pat Fischer, Jerry Stovall,
Jimmy Hill and myself. We really got along well together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years before the team's next playoff adventure,
capturing the NFC East title with a 10-4 record behind quarterback
Jim Hart, the NFC Player of the Year, and running back Terry
Metcalf, who was Hart's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   It led to a divisional playoff game at Minnesota, where the
Cardinals lost, 30-14, on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, someone named Jake Plummer was born in Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals again won the NFC East crown in 1975, going 11-3
and 1-1 against Dallas, only allowing an NFL-record eight sacks the
entire season. Seven players went to the Pro Bowl, including
Metcalf, now the offensive coordinator at Franklin High in Seattle,
Hart and linemen Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler.
</P>
<P>
   In a divisional playoff game at the Los Angeles, however, the
Cardinals were beaten by the Rams, 35-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals again made it into the postseason in the
strike-shortened 1982 season, finishing 5-4 and losing, 41-16, in a
first-round playoff game at Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That year it was called the Super Bowl Tournament because 16
teams made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss, quarterback Neil Lomax set a league postseason
record with 385 passing yards. It wasn't enough, just as none of
the Cardinals' regular-season records over the next 15 years was
enough to earn a return berth in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998. &QL;

BOMB-MAKING MATERIALS REMOVED FROM SAN FRANCISCO UTILITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Police and fire investigators Thursday safely
removed an assortment of bomb-making materials, including 250
pounds of the type of fertilizer used in the Oklahoma City bombing,
from a Pacific Gas and Electric Co. service center and took an
employee of the company into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said that the man, 44, who
works out of the service center in the city's Mission district,
told investigators about a storage facility a few blocks away,
where they found more bomb-making materials. The materials were
removed, but the officer would not specify what they were. The
man's home also was searched, but Ackerson said he did not know the
results of that search.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not release the name of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He obviously has a lot of charges hanging over his head,''
Ackerson said. ``But we cannot speculate as to why he was in
possession of these materials.'' He said police had no other
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The substances found at the service center included five
50-pound bags of ammonium nitrate _ the fertilizer that was
combined with fuel oil to make the 4,800-pound bomb that killed 168
people in the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995 _ and a
33-gallon drum of calcium nitrate. At least one book about
bomb-making was also found at the scene, Ackerson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the materials were discovered when an employee noticed a
puddle of water on a basement floor. An inspector traced the water
to an employee locker on the first floor of the building. Inside
the locker were the bags of ammonium nitrate, leaking because they
had been frozen and were thawing. Neither the police nor the
company would say whether the locker belongs to the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company employees notified firefighters stationed
across the street, who in turn alerted the police department. The
FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also joined the
investigation, and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger locker on the second floor, police found broken
flares, fuses, blasting caps, the calcium nitrate and information
on how to make bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerson said the frozen material was a concern because bomb
makers sometimes mix chemicals, then freeze the potentially
dangerous mixtures to stabilize them.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Scott Blakey said the
facility houses 115 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Police evacuated the two-story building, as well as 120
employees from a neighboring Pacific Gas building. By midafternoon
Thursday the employees had returned to work, and the fire
department's hazardous material crew prepared to remove the
chemicals from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey said he had no information connecting the discovery of
the materials to any threats against the company. He also said that
all employees are required to wear photo identification cards, and
that other security measures are in place.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been the target of saboteurs in the past. In
October 1997, a third of San Francisco suffered a power outage
after someone deliberately turned dozens of knobs on a bank of
controls at an electrical substation. Investigators said in a
subsequent investigation that the vandal would have needed to be
familiar with the facility's operation.

POSTSEASON HIS TORY HAS BEEN SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It first happened in 1947. It last happened in
1982. In between, it happened four more times.
</P>
<P>
   That's six measly NFL playoff appearances in nearly eight
decades of gridiron warfare.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's happened again.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Texas Stadium, the Cardinals meet the unforgiving
Dallas Cowboys in a wild-card game, only the seventh time since
1920 the Chicago/St. Louis/Phoenix/Arizona franchise has ventured
into the land of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   It's a short playoff history, yes. Short and sometimes sweet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Cardinals, coached by Jim Conzelman, went 9-3 and
edged Philadelphia, 28-21, for the NFL championship at Comiskey
Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, behind long touchdown scampers by halfbacks
Charley Trippi and Elmer Angsman, grabbed an early 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ancient ones,'' said Bill Blackburn, a center and
outside linebacker on the 1947 team. ``We started it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater majority of the team were just a bunch of guys out
of the service or out of college. I think we only had nine
leftovers (from the 1-9 1945 team) so we were all relatively pretty
new. But we were full of piss and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   ``And (Conzelman) was a master at motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-2 Cardinals nearly returned to football's pulpit the
following season, again making it to the championship finale
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the game was played in snowy Philadelphia, where the
falling white stuff was so thick, Blackburn lost sight of the ball
several times throughout the game, won by Philly, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every four downs both teams were having to
punt,'' said Blackburn, who lives in Richardson, Texas. ``As soon
as the ball got 20 feet in the air, we all just stood around
because we couldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember both teams agreed they wouldn't contest (referee's)
calls regarding first downs and if someone went out of bounds
because there was so much snow you couldn't see the lines on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Marshall Goldberg, a running back and safety on
the 1947 and 1948 teams, recalls the game still was scoreless late
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible game because of the snow,'' said Goldberg,
who lives in Chicago. ``We ended up losing on a blocked punt. We
were on about our 15- or 20-yard line when they blocked our punt,
then ran it in about three or four plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good team, but I think the '47 team was better
because we were hungrier. We could taste the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 years passed before the Cardinals' next playoff game,
a 24-17 win over Green Bay in the Playoff Bowl, a non-advancing
playoff game between second-place teams in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still was an important game for us,'' said Cardinals Vice
President Larry Wilson, a safety on the 1964 team. ``It was big
because it was in the Green Bay Packers' heyday and they had a hell
of a football team. We took the game dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were 9-3-2 during the regular season (they split
two games against Dallas) and finished runner-up in the Eastern
Conference to eventual NFL champion Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good team,'' Wilson said. ``We had Charley
Johnson at quarterback, Bobby Joe Conrad (at flanker) and John
David Crow at running back. Defensively, we probably had one of the
best secondaries we've ever had with Pat Fischer, Jerry Stovall,
Jimmy Hill and myself. We really got along well together.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years before the team's next playoff adventure,
capturing the NFC East title with a 10-4 record behind quarterback
Jim Hart, the NFC Player of the Year, and running back Terry
Metcalf, who was Hart's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   It led to a divisional playoff game at Minnesota, where the
Cardinals lost, 30-14, on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, someone named Jake Plummer was born in Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals again won the NFC East crown in 1975, going 11-3
and 1-1 against Dallas, only allowing an NFL-record eight sacks the
entire season. Seven players went to the Pro Bowl, including
Metcalf, now the offensive coordinator at Franklin High in Seattle,
Hart and linemen Dan Dierdorf and Conrad Dobler.
</P>
<P>
   In a divisional playoff game at the Los Angeles, however, the
Cardinals were beaten by the Rams, 35-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals again made it into the postseason in the
strike-shortened 1982 season, finishing 5-4 and losing, 41-16, in a
first-round playoff game at Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   That year it was called the Super Bowl Tournament because 16
teams made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the loss, quarterback Neil Lomax set a league postseason
record with 385 passing yards. It wasn't enough, just as none of
the Cardinals' regular-season records over the next 15 years was
enough to earn a return berth in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998. &QL;

A LONG TIME COMING  
 CARDINALS' LONG PLAYOFF CLIMB HAS BEEN BITTERSWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They sweated, felt pain and bled together. And, more often than
not, they all came up empty together.
</P>
<P>
   It's the legacy of being a modern-day Cardinal. Few, if any, can
appreciate Saturday's trip to the playoffs more than this
fraternity born of utter frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the playoffs was often painful, as Larry Wilson, a
former Cardinal, NFL Hall of Famer and vice president of the team,
and Johnny Roland, the team's current running backs coach, can
attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s and early '70s when I played, we had good teams,
but we could never get over the hump,'' said Roland, the team's
fourth-leading career rusher with 3,608 yards. ``Making the
playoffs is significant for everybody who has put on the uniform
and tried to get where these guys are. I've had two dozen calls
from guys who are as pleased as punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, when San Diego scored a game-tying touchdown with 16
seconds left to set up a sure overtime period, Roland's stomach
twinged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really melancholy,'' he said. ``In 1970, we had a
1{-game lead with three games left and lost all three. I said to
myself, `No, no, no . . . not again.' I get all choked up thinking
about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Getting this Cardinals team into the playoffs meant so much to
Roland that he passed up going to New York City three weeks ago to
be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Instead, he
stayed to help prepare the team for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the right decision,'' he said. ``Whether my presence
here was important or not, I thought it best to stay here with the
guys. They have rewarded me.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Wilson, who is the team's all-time interceptor with
52, got to being in a playoff was a 1964 victory over Green Bay in
the ill-fated Playoff Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic, I'm so happy for everybody in the
organization,'' he said. ``People have waited so long for this; the
players, trainers, equipment guys and staff people. To them this is
special and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to the runners-up bowl in '64, it was our
championship game, our Super Bowl. I feel good for every Cardinal
who has lived and died. It's never the intention to have a losing
season, and there are always a lot of factors involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He's speaking of former Cardinals like Roy Green, Ron Wolfley,
Joe Wolf, Ed Cunningham, Neil Lomax and even one-year guys like
Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited, and it's probably my first time just as a
fan,'' Green said. ``I left Aeneas (Williams) a message telling him
how proud I was before Sunday's game and said I was for them _ win,
lose or draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down deep I was saying, `If you lose this game . . .' So many
of these guys have suffered for so long; guys like Aeneas and Larry
Centers, Rob Moore and Frank Sanders. I know how hard they work and
how difficult it is for them to keep hearing they're not winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody bled Cardinals red _ literally and figuratively _ more
than Wolfley, the crazed fullback-wedge buster on special teams. He
never tasted the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being vindicated and cleansed of the sins of the
past,'' said Wolfley, a Valley sports radio talk-show host.
``Seeing guys I played with, Aeneas and Larry, get there makes me
feel good in a weird way. We didn't always have good teams, but we
had a lot of good players who didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they got the loser tag collectively hung on them, which is
horrible. I've got to feel Larry feels the same way. He has been
positive about the organization going the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomax had the Cardinals on a collision course with the playoffs
with a 7-4 record in 1988 when he injured his hip and his career
came to an end after back-to-back wins over San Francisco and the
New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic that they made it,'' Lomax said. ``In 1984, we
lost our last game to Washington and missed them. It happened again
in '87 when we lost to Dallas in our last game and we were on our
way in '88 when everybody got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pointed fingers for years at management, and rightly
so. When you're not successful, the buck stops at the owner. But
now there are new guys and new leadership, and things are going
right.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want frustration, try Wolf, the all-purpose offensive
lineman. He played under every coach the Cardinals have had since
moving to the Valley, but was released in the final cut of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could've been a part of it, but I wouldn't say I'm
bitter,'' he said. ``I'm happy for a lot of my friends and all the
guys who have been through the bad times. It's what everybody plays
for. There are a lot of great football players who haven't reached
the playoffs during their careers. They will never experience what
these guys will.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, a center turned CBS college football analyst, was in
the stands Sunday and said he was overjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the fun part for me, seeing the fans' reaction,'' he
said. ``This organization and Mr. Bidwill always treated me well,
and I can't be happier for everybody. Everybody talks about the
schedule and playing opponents with the worst records in the NFL.
The players don't make the schedule, they only play it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is they beat the teams they were supposed to
beat, which the teams I played on didn't always do. They earned the
right to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason was not always on great terms with management,
struggling with contract clauses and such. His departure to
Cincinnati coincided with the draft of Jake Plummer, but even he
seemed pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great and I'm happy for a lot of guys I know back
there,'' he said. ``The organization is much like the Jets, filled
with a lot of good people behind the scenes, who for so many years
watched the playoffs with envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can beat Dallas. But I don't know if they can beat anyone
else. It's tough to beat a team three times in a season, and the
last game was close. After that, though, I don't think they have a
chance in hell of beating anyone else in the playoffs.'' &QL;

A NEW FLOCK OF CARDS  
 FLEDGLINGS DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOSING HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Same old Cardinals?
</P>
<P>
   They are neither the same nor old.
</P>
<P>
   That they are preparing for their first playoff appearance in a
full-length season since Jake Plummer was a 1-year-old speaks to
that.
</P>
<P>
   The roster now is full of young guys who have come from winning
collegiate programs that played regularly in high-stakes bowl
games. They're not used to losing. There are 28 players who were
not yet in the league when Vince Tobin became coach in 1996 and 45
who have been added during the Tobin regime. Eight starters on
defense and five on offense are in their first, second or third
year. They are not tainted by Cardinals malfeasance past.
</P>
<P>
   They also are not the beneficiaries of any NFL playoff
experience, and that could be a factor Saturday when the wild-card
Cardinals (9-6) meet NFC East champion Dallas (10-6) in the opening
round at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year, even before all the injuries, we were the
youngest defense in the league by a full year per man,'' said Dave
McGinnis, Cardinals defensive coordinator. ``Vince's philosophy is
that he is not afraid to play young people. They're not going to
get any better not playing. What we've gained from it is that now
we have guys who have stepped in and played, they've performed and
they've won. We can only benefit from that.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true on both sides of the ball. Complementing the young
defense that was among the league's best at forcing turnovers is an
offense guided by Plummer, in his second season. In his 26 pro
appearances, he has directed nine fourth-quarter comebacks. He's
working behind a line with three players in their first full year
as starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals reached the playoffs with three season-ending
wins, each decided by a game-ending field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in so many pressure games now that I don't think
it's that big a leap for them to the playoffs,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, the first year coach of the Cowboys, whose roster
is loaded with players who have not only experienced the playoffs
but have won Super Bowls, knows that the Cardinals are reading
about it, hearing about it, and consequently thinking about it. He
said playoff inexperience becomes less of a factor once the team
gets locked away in the closing hours of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big factor because everybody talks about it from Monday
to Saturday,'' Gailey said. ``But Saturday, I'm not sure it really
matters a lot. The team that has the best execution is the team
that wins. Now, maybe experience has a little bit of an effect on
that execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like I told people here the other day: Every team
started somewhere. All of sudden experience just didn't show up
with the Cowboys. They had to win that first playoff game somewhere
along the line. After this game. Arizona will have playoff
experience, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman, the Cowboys quarterback who has three Super Bowl
championship rings, recalls when he was in Plummer's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind-set was to go out and be as mentally prepared as
possible and let the physical things take care of themselves,''
Aikman said. ``My first playoff game as a starter was in 1992. We
knew we were a good team, but we didn't know how good. Everything
we had accomplished that year was a first time, really, for all of
us. So we made up our minds we were going to play hard and see what
we could accomplish. The next thing we knew, we were playing in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from one level to the next to reach the playoffs is a
relatively easy step. But then going from playoff team to among the
very elite in the NFL and competing for the world championship is a
different deal. That's when it becomes tough, and it becomes tough
to maintain that each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the young Cardinals is a rookie class that is one
of the team's best ever, one that Tobin says ``will be the core of
our team for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   From first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth, the starting left
defensive end who has five quarterback sacks, to seventh-round
draft pick Pat Tillman, who was an unexpected starter at safety the
first 11 games, they've been contributors. Second-round pick Corey
Chavous started the final five games at right corner, getting an
interception in each of the first two. Fourth-round draft pick
Michael Pittman made the key block last week that sprung Eric
Metcalf on a 46-yard kickoff return that set up the game-winning
field goal to secure the playoff bid. Sixth-round pick Zack Walz is
the special-teams leader with 71 blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another second-rounder, Anthony Clement, who at 6 feet 7, 355
pounds is the largest player ever drafted by the Cardinals, was
pushing for a starting position in the offensive line before his
season ended in September with surgery on a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of rookies playing and contributing
significantly on this football team,'' Tobin said. ``I'm enthused
by our rookie class. They're not only good football players,
they're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   That speaks well for the future, according to Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just our first year together. There's no telling what
we can do next year, when I'm there in camp,'' said Wadsworth,
whose contract holdout lasted until the day before the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous, who spent three months at safety before being moved
back to corner, where he played in college, said a reason so many
young players are performing so well is because they've been
accepted by the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took us under their wings, showed us the way,'' Chavous
said. ``It has really paid off for us. Now we have all these young
guys, just beginning to reach the upside of their careers, who have
NFL experience. Now all we need is NFL playoff experience.'' &QL;

AIKMAN STILL HEART OF COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By David CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas - It was the summer of 1989. Troy Aikman's first
training camp. The rookie quarterback's appearance in Thousand
Oaks, Calif. was such big news that my assignment was to provide a
detailed account of his first day as a Dallas Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   It began:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6:45 a.m.: Aikman wakes up. Yawns. Showers. Dial soap.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7:19 a.m.: Aikman walks from dorm to cafeteria. Eats first
Cowboys breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7:33 a.m.: Takes tray to dishwashing window, setting an example
for others.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9:34 a.m.: Cowboys line up for calisthenics. Aikman is in
second row. Shows excellent rhythm in clapping drill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 12:08 p.m.: Aikman signs autograph. `It's kind of a weird
deal,'' he later says of all the attention. ``That's the reason you
play, for the recognition. But I'm not comfortable with it. I'd
rather be a lineman and play in obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward nine years. The Cowboys are preparing to play the
Cardinals. As the Dallas quarterback strolls into the spacious,
blue-carpeted locker room a half-dozen TV cameramen scurry toward
his locker and climb small stepladders that are arranged in a
semi-circle around No. 8's cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   He wades through. Faces his waiting audience.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrown 141 career touch down passes. Played in four NFC
Championship games. Won three Super Bowls. His playoff record is
remarkable, 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran, a celebrity, the claustrophobic crush doesn't faze
him. In fact, as he prepares to give his weekly
state-of-the-Cowboys address, a faint smile touches the corners of
his mouth. He appears amused by the media's hovering presence, the
jockeying for position, boom mikes overhead, hand-held mikes _ a
thicket of them _ thrust beneath his chin.
</P>
<P>
   They are waiting to hear from him.
</P>
<P>
   Everything he says is broadcast, printed, analyzed, discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman ``is'' the Dallas Cowboys. He would argue otherwise.
But it's true. Troy Aikman is his team's heart and soul. Its
leader. Its rudder. Its glue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 he took over a team far worse than the one Jake Plummer
inherited his rookie year. Dallas finished 1-15. Three years later,
the Cowboys won it all. In the Super Bowl, Aikman threw four
touchdown passes against Buffalo. Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to know what he thinks because he is Troy Aikman
and this is his time, his favorite time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the playoffs,'' Aikman said. The klieg lights
illuminate his face. ``I like the finality of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for why my numbers statistically might be better in
postseason'' _ no active NFL quarterback has a better passing
rating in the playoffs _ ``I don't know that I can give you a real
good answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He spreads the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our offensive line drives our football team. I've been
part of some good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He is questioned about the importance of playoff experience _ a
popular story line in advance of Saturday's first-round game. The
Cowboys have it; the Wild Cards don't.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith have played in a combined
44 postseason games. For what it's worth, that's five more games
than all the Cardinals players with playoff experience combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive,'' Aikman said. ``But experience alone is
overrated.'' He paused, smiled. ``I'm sure Arizona will be happy to
read that.'' Playfully Aikman pictured the imaginary banner
headline in ``The'' ``Republic'' and said, ``Troy Says It Doesn't
Matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to him, watching him, it is hard to believe nine years
have come and gone since the first player selected in the draft
took over a rock-bottom team that in 1989 lost to Arizona at home.
The Cards haven't beaten Aikman in Texas Stadium since.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't flashy, like Deion Sanders. He doesn't take off his
helmet after scoring as Smith used to do so the world could see and
share his smile.
</P>
<P>
   All he does is throw the ball on the money. All he does is win.
The Cowboy the Cardinals worry about most was talking about Jake
Plummer, but he could have been describing himself once upon a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very athletic guy. He's done a good job of giving them
a spark. I think he's going to be a great player if he gets a
little better supporting cast.'' &QL;

DAY IN SUN HAS ARRIVED FOR AENEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Suffering is the pipeline to perspective.
</P>
<P>
   It runs through Bugel's bungling and Buddy's bloated ego.
Through fields of futility and humiliation. Through crude insults
and Leeland McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after eight years and 78 losses, Aeneas Williams
will walk out the tunnel at Texas Stadium. And he'll finally see
the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some excitement,'' Williams said. ``A chance to
go out there with the soldiers I've enlisted with and hear the
commander in chief _ Coach Tobin _ say, `Let's go.' Excitement,
yes. And I'll definitely be a prepared soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   He better be. Because for all the Pro Bowls and accolades, the
Cardinals have never needed him more than now.
</P>
<P>
   When he walks out of that tunnel, he will resume a spirited
rivalry with Michael Irvin. If not Ali-Frazier, they are the
Duran-Leonard of the NFC East. And when it's over, Williams alone
may decide how long this party lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic match-up,'' Cardinals safety Tommy Bennett said.
``Michael is a physical receiver, Aeneas is a physical corner. I've
been here two years, and I tell you what, it's been something to
watch. He has really been a thorn in Michael Irvin's side, and he's
shut him down more times than not.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at Texas Stadium, Williams held Irvin to five catches
and 51 yards. In their rematch later that season, Irvin racked up
198 yards in receiving, including a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in an overtime upset of the Cowboys, Williams earned
Defensive Player of the Week by shutting down Irvin over the final
36 minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And this season, after Irvin lit him up in the opener, Williams
snapped Irvin's streak of 117 consecutive games with a reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main things is having the ability to meet force
with force,'' Williams said. ``Knowing what to expect, knowing
you're going against someone who is going to play every down.''
Here's what else he can expect:
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense will be dedicated to stopping the run at
all costs, a team that has been steamrolled by the Cowboys' ground
game in both match-ups this season. And the first priority is
taking Emmitt Smith out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had success running the ball against us, but I think
we're going to put an end to that this week,'' Bennett said.
``We're going to expect it and we're going to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means a secondary left to fend for itself, and no one will
be isolated as much as Williams. Against a prime-time receiver who
is starting to find his groove. A guy who was reportedly seething
over his streak ending in Week 10. A guy who will be looking for a
bit of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I hadn't thought about it in terms of my match-up,''
Williams said. ``Right now, my only thoughts are about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Williams is a cornerback who plays hard, prays hard
and says very little, especially about himself. But here's what you
might not know: When Buddy Ryan came to town and made everyone
endure an 880-yard run, Williams was the only one to post a time
under two minutes. When Corey Chavous was moved to cornerback
midway through the season, Williams eased the transition, helping
the rookie at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the most poignant, recurring sights of this
season is Williams and Chavous discussing the intricacies of their
craft immediately after a game has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's allowed me to diversify my game,'' Chavous said. ``I've
always been a confident player, but he's helped me take that to
another level.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, he was the best the Cardinals had to offer, a
position they never had to worry about. And now the payoff is here,
the moment that always happened elsewhere, the moment that seemed
so elusive: a playoff game separating the regular season and his
annual trip to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I never lost belief,'' Williams said. ``I don't look
at things as permanent. I know things can change, and I knew were
going in the right direction. I knew this day was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So the soldier is prepared. Now, if he can only be the best
player on the field, on a day when the Cardinals need him the
most. &QL;

   BELL ATLANTIC IN TALKS TO ACQUIRE AIRTOUCH
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could touch off a nationwide price war for
cellular telephone services, Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest
local telephone company, is in talks to buy Airtouch
Communications, the largest wireless telephone company, for $45
billion in stock, executives close to the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which could be announced as early as Monday, would
bring Bell Atlantic, which offers cellular services along the East
Coast, one step closer to creating a nationwide and even
international wireless network. Airtouch serves the West Coast and
has partnerships in Europe and Asia that would expand Bell
Atlantic's network. Shares of Airtouch rose $3.0625, to $72.4375,
after the talks were first reported. Bell Atlantic fell $3.50, to
$54.
</P>
<P>
   EXCHANGE RATE IS SET FOR EURO
</P>
<P>
   After years of preparation, the 11 European countries locked in
the exchange rates of their currencies to the new single currency,
the euro, setting its value at about $1.17. In technical terms, the
action was perfunctory _ nothing more than plugging numbers into a
formula. But in political and economic terms, it was far broader
and signaled a new era in the integration of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar fell in the last day of trading before the euro took
effect. The dollar traded at 113.57 yen, down from 114.85, and at
1.6685 marks, down from 1.6717.
</P>
<P>
   WASTE MANAGEMENT CLOSES DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management, the largest U.S. trash hauler, completed its
$1.1 billion acquisition of Eastern Environmental Services after
agreeing to sell some assets to settle federal and state challenges
to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END LAST TRADING DAY MIXED
</P>
<P>
   Shares of large companies fell and shares of small companies had
their best day in two months as investors completed tax-related
selling. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.21 points, to
9,181.43. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.70 points,
to 1,229.23, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 25.74 points, to
a record 2,192.69.
</P>
<P>
   In its quarterly adjustment of the so-called circuit breakers,
the New York Stock Exchange said that it had set the level for a
trading halt in U.S. markets at a drop of 900 points, up from 800
points last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BIGGER LOSS SEEN AT NORTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northwest Airlines fell after an analyst said the No.
4 U.S. airline expected its fourth-quarter loss to be wider than
expected because of the effects of a 15-day pilots' strike and
higher maintenance costs. The shares fell 37.5 cents, to $25.5625.
</P>
<P>
   BANKAMERICA HURT BY HEDGE FUND
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica's business dealings with D.E. Shaw, a securities
firm and hedge fund that suffered severe financial trouble over the
last year, are expected to reduce the large banking company's
fourth-quarter profits by about $100 million, analysts said.
Investor concern about BankAmerica's exposure to Shaw's problems
has caused a selloff in the banking company's shares. They fell
$1.5625 Thursday, or 2.53 percent, to $60.125.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURING ON RISE IN MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing in the Midwest picked up unexpectedly in December,
helped by rising production and an increase in inventories,
according to the National Association of Purchasing
Management-Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose
79,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 368,000, the Labor
Department said. That pushed total weekly claims to their highest
level since July.

PLUMMER HAS GOT THE GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Mama Plummer knew her baby boy was big in the
Valley, but when she peered down from her seat last Sunday, she
thought he had been cloned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my binoculars and looked down to see Jake and saw 100
red Number 16 jerseys,'' Marilyn Plummer said. ``I thought, `I'm
not going to find him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the most popular athlete in the Valley couldn't
pick out her son in a crowd. That's quarterback Jake Plummer _
Boise, Idaho's, native son; Arizona State's Pac-10 championship
hero; and the savior of the Cardinals' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer took the Cardinals where 15 other starting quarterbacks
couldn't in 11 seasons in Arizona, to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (9-7) meet the Dallas Cowboys (10-6) on Saturday
at Texas Stadium in the team's first non-strike playoff game in 15
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer is flying his mother from Boise to Dallas for the game.
He's also paying for the flights of his father, Steve, from Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho; brother, Eric, from Connecticut; and brother,
Brett, from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he can afford it. The Cardinals just made him the
second-richest player in the NFL, giving him a four-year extension
worth $29.7 million and the biggest signing bonus in league history
at $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Think the money is going to change him? Ask his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 3 years old,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``I asked him
what he wanted for Christmas, and he said a remote-control car.
Yes, a remote-control car. So I bought him a remote-control car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen how he dresses?'' asked reserve wide receiver
Chad Carpenter, another second-year pro from Idaho. ``He wears
flannel shirts and cotton long-sleeve T-shirts. He knows what type
of lifestyle he wants to live. He could live in the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The family did live in Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains for six years,
when Plummer was 3 to 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jake was 3, a family friend, Buzz Cheatum, took him
cross-country skiing and called him, ``Jake the baker, the money
maker,' '' Plummer's mother said. ``Who would have thought Buzz
Cheatum would be prophetic?'' &QL; 
Instant success
</P>
<P>
   Former San Francisco 49ers Coach Bill Walsh predicted Plummer's
success two years ago. He advised the 49ers to draft him, listing
17 positive features and six negative features.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers ignored him, taking Virginia Tech's Jim Druckenmiller
in the first round even though Walsh, in scouting notes, compared
Plummer to Joe Montana six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage, he is almost identical to Joe,'' one of Walsh's
notes read.
</P>
<P>
   Another said, ``Expect a long-term future _ he seems to be
ideally suited to the 49ers' offensive system.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was a consultant to the 49ers at the time, told the
``San'' ``Francisco Chronicle'' this week that ``there's no
question (Plummer) is going to be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he's a dynamic player,'' Walsh added. ``He's going to be
the central figure whenever he takes the field, like Joe was.''
</P>
<P>
   It took former Cardinals receiver Roy Green one game to realize
that Plummer had a chance to be something special. Plummer drove
the team 98 yards for a go-ahead touchdown in his first possession
13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what he has done, plus carrying the burden on so many
other things is incredible,'' Green said. ``From his first series
against the Eagles, it was like people were saying, `Jake, take us
there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what (Washington cornerback) Darrell Green said,
``You just look at him and you can tell he likes to play the game.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Plummer has led the Cardinals to nine comeback
victories in 26 games. ``It's just a matter of believing, having
the attitude to get it done,'' Plummer said. ``That attitude is
different here than in years past.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Plummer won twice in nine starts. He couldn't
believe the way some players accepted losing. He was determined to
hit the road if that didn't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was tough,'' Plummer said of the 4-12 season. ``I
saw a lot of things I didn't like. There were guys laughing on the
plane after we got our butts kicked or lost a close one. I couldn't
believe it. If a salesman went out on the road and sold nothing, he
wouldn't be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the season, at a team meeting, I said somethings about
that. Some of the guys like what I said. A few of the guys knew
they had done it and didn't like it. But I just said what I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Plummer has led the Cardinals to seven
come-from-behind victories, including the past three weeks when
they won each game on a Chris Jacke field goal on the final play of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, San Diego tied the score at 13, with 16 seconds
left. But after Eric Metcalf's 46-yard kickoff return, Plummer's
10-yard completion set up Jacke's game-winning 52-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things have been going for us, you see 40 seconds and
go, `Sweet,' '' Plummer said. ``We've got a whole day working for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past eight games, Plummer has completed 59 percent of his
passes for 2,515 yards and 11 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cardinals played Dallas, he threw for 314
yards in the second half and 465 yards overall, the second most
allowed by the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that got everybody's attention,'' Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said, ``not only in that ballgame, but look at the
season the Cardinals have had, and the games they've been in, and
the close games, and the way they've been able to pull a number out
and win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake just starts playing on instinct as much as anything else,
realizing the situation, knowing that you've got to start taking
some chances and zip some balls in. . . . I think Jake is at his
best when able to get outside the pocket and put some pressure on
that defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said Plummer is most dangerous when ``we play controlled
backyard football.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, team vice president of player personnel, refers to
Plummer as Captain Choas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw him at the combine after his senior year, you
looked at him, his measurables, you said, `He's fine but nothing
special,' '' said New York Giants Coach Jim Fassel, former
offensive coordinator of the Cardinals. ``Then, you watched him in
game-type situations, and he just made play after play after play.
. . . They may have gotten the steal of the whole draft that
year.'' &QL; 
Only just begun
</P>
<P>
   Plummer knows he's far from a finished product. After all, he
has thrown 20 interceptions and 17 touchdown passes this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has unlimited potential,'' offensive coordinator Marc
Trestman said. ``When he reaches that potential, I don't know. But
I do know that he's an extremely special guy. He loves ball. He
loves to play. He's a very charismatic young man. He's a natural, a
natural leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke said Plummer's leadership skills remind him of former
Green Bay teammate Brett Favre, three-time Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put both of them in different uniforms, they're almost
exactly the same,'' Jacke said. ``They're out there doing things,
and you scratch your head and wonder how they do them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter thinks Plummer's small-town upbringing is a big reason
for his success. ``You're just like everybody else,'' he said.
``People there don't put you on a pedestal. They're grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Plummer's brothers don't give him a break and try to
beat him in everything from pingpong to video games.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer has an eclectic background.
</P>
<P>
   His mother fed him carrot juice and home-grown basil. His
cousin, Susie Davis, toured with the artist formerly known as
Prince, Van Morrison and Billy Idol. His uncle, Norman Davis, was a
Bay area disc jockey who sent the family his favorite tapes _ Pink
Floyd, Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix, among them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was Plummer's grandmother, who was a devout
Seventh-day Adventist.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer took it all in and it helped him ``hit it off with
everybody,'' according to Trestman.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ben Keller, 13, a fan who showed up at the team's
training facility Thursday wearing Plummer's No. 16 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother (Lance) bought it for me,'' Keller said. ``It was
the best Christmas gift I received.'' &QL;

A LIGHT, A VOICE GONE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - They are burying him in a New York cemetery as I write
this. I cannot be there, do not belong. I never met the man in
person, only through his words. All the same, I stole from him,
learned from him, owe him. I figure making good on my debt requires
at least a few hundred words.
</P>
<P>
   They will be sad words, let me say up front. Mike McAlary dying
colors newspapers a deeper shade of gray. It is always that way
when brilliance quits the game.
</P>
<P>
   McAlary died Christmas Day, courtesy of colon cancer. He was 41.
He leaves a wife, four kids and a few thousand columns about a few
thousand city streets.
</P>
<P>
   God, what tales. What a voice, what rhythm. Scalpel-sharp,
pitch-perfect. Every sentence tugged like a finger crooked around
your conscience. I didn't read McAlary whenever I got the ``New
York Daily News''; I held each word tight as an infant. I needed
those words.
</P>
<P>
   This was in 1992, back East. Fresh out of journalism school, I
got a job in Trenton as a copy editor. It was a newspaper job,
yeah, but fixing other people's words wasn't my thing. I wanted to
tell stories. I dreamed of my face above a byline.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, I barged in on Gale Baldwin, the editor, and
volunteered to write columns. Every day, he sent me back to writing
headlines. Then one day he didn't _ he wanted some samples. I had
some in me he liked, and Gale had a thought: I could write columns
by day _ for free _ and edit copy by night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Only 1 problem &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a great break. It presented a huge problem. Namely, I
sucked.
</P>
<P>
   I had no feel for the form, no sense of structure, no voice in
print. My true talent was saying in a hundred words what could've
been said in 10. Detail was the thing I missed that everyone else
saw.
</P>
<P>
   But I could read, and I could scavenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Royko for humor. Jimmy Breslin for street sense. McAlary
for style.
</P>
<P>
   I tore out every column, parsed it, memorized. Yes, some columns
fell short. Yes, McAlary himself found trouble _ with a car crash
that almost killed him in 1993, with a since-dropped libel suit in
1996. But most of his work sang. The clippings are deep beige now,
but I still read them whenever I feel lost on a story.
</P>
<P>
   The one about the 4-year-old stuffed down a garbage chute.
</P>
<P>
   The one about Jimmy Miracle, the junkie dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The one about a punk on trial for his role in the Crown Heights
riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``His defense,'' McAlary wrote, ``is that he was just another
rioter in a block of rioters _ just another clenched fist on a
headless body of rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine line, but not his best.
</P>
<P>
   McAlary saved those for 1997, for the story of Abner Louima and
Brooklyn's 70th Precinct cops.
</P>
<P>
   I was following from afar then _ my McAlary imitation having
evolved into writing columns for pay, then a spot on this page.
Last summer, an anonymous tip on McAlary's answering machine became
seven columns that seared a city: Louima, a 30-year-old Haitian
immigrant, had been sodomized by White police officers wielding a
plunger. &QL;

Other dreams &QL;

</P>
<P>
   McAlary went from a chemo treatment to Louima's bedside. He
broke the story in print, got every interview that mattered. In
April, those columns won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pinnacle in journalism, but there is so much more
I want to do in life,'' McAlary said. ``I want to dance at my
daughter's wedding and walk old and gray on the beach with my wife.
See my son, Ryan, graduate from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Those spare phrases evoke deep dreams _ dreams denied. So it was
in McAlary's columns; so it was in his life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't live to fulfill his every dream. He gave voice to many
of mine.
</P>
<P>
   This means I owe him. These words are partial payment. I will
read the yellow news clippings again on many days, up against many
deadlines. I will recite the best lines out loud. I will think
``God, if only.'' I will try like hell to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   It is always that way when brilliance quits the game. &QL;

TAKING THE CHILDREN: `THE PRINCE OF EGYPT'; `MIGHTY JOE YOUNG';
`PATCH ADAMS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Amick Byram, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Glover, Sandra Bullock, many others.
Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells. PG. 93
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A decidedly unsunny tale, Dreamworks' animated biblical epic is
an abbreviated version of the Book of Exodus. Set afloat in a
basket, the Hebrew baby Moses survives perilous waters and washes
up at the Egyptian royal court, where he is taken in and raised as
the brother of Ramses, the future pharaoh.
</P>
<P>
   A rambunctious youth who believes he is Egyptian, Moses
anticipates a life of high position until he is made aware of his
true origin. Resistant at first, he comes to abhor the Hebrews'
captivity at the hands of the Egyptians. Encountering God in the
burning bush, he fearfully accepts the command to lead his people
to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, from frogs to pestilence, the plagues bend but fail
to break the Egyptian hold on their slave laborers. Finally, the
slaughter of the firstborn convinces Ramses to let the Hebrews
leave. And that, of course, sets the stage for the flight, pursuit
by the Egyptians and the parting of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The animators are working with an extremely violent
story, which they soften with brief montages and other pictorial
allusions to brutality, plagues and mass murder. (The killing of
the firstborn, for instance, is a whirling spectral presence.)
Nevertheless, the violence is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   SEX None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 The film tries hard to entertain, but obviously this
isn't a merry tale for the little ones. Many of them simply
wouldn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8 It depends on the child. With parental guidance
beforehand, they could well get into step with the film.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 9-12 This is a good age. Many children will find the film
exciting visually and narratively.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Teen-agers may scoff but they, too, could well be
caught up.
</P>
<P>
   MIGHTY JOE YOUNG
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron, Bill Paxton, Rade Sherbedgia, Regina King,
Peter Firth. Directed by Ron Underwood. PG. 114 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the misty Tanzanian high country, a little girl named Jill
witnesses the murder of her mother, a Jane Goodall-type researcher,
by Strasser (Sherbedgia), a poacher who has also just blasted a
mother gorilla so he can cart off Joe, her valuable baby.
</P>
<P>
   Joe eludes him. Twelve years later, he stands 15 feet high,
weighs 2,000 pounds and needs inordinate quantities of foliage to
stay fed and hidden away from promoters who would make a latter-day
mini-King Kong of him. Ever by his side, Jill (Ms. Theron), now a
willowy young woman (and a foxy one considering all the years she
has spent entirely in the jungle), keeps him sequestered and
humored with games of hide-and-seek.
</P>
<P>
   But this being a remake of Ernest B. Schoedsack's 1949 film,
Joe, who's really a sweet lug at heart, is destined for the bright
lights. A well-meaning zoologist (Paxton) persuades Jill to pack
Joe off to Los Angeles for a supposedly protected existence in a
game preserve. Still bent on appropriating the gorilla for himself,
Strasser follows and purposely riles him up.
</P>
<P>
   After scattering the well-heeled assemblage at a charity event,
Joe takes to the streets for a halfhearted rampage. Later he
redeems himself by rescuing a child, but maybe Los Angeles wasn't
such a good idea after all. An admiring public takes up a
collection to set Joe up properly back home.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The killing of Joe's mother and Jill's will scare many
small children, an odd thing to do in a movie whose principal
audience is the very young. Strasser is graphically the worse for
wear after Joe flings him onto some power lines, but while other
mayhem yields injuries, nothing is visibly too serious.
</P>
<P>
   SEX Jill and the zoologist haltingly try a kiss or two.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 They will love Joe, who's just a little kid himself.
With parental pointers, they should also basically understand what
is going on. With the exception of matricide and Joe's outbursts,
which are messy but not all that menacing, the film rigorously
stays as cuddly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 This is a good age, provided attention is paid to
children's reactions and questions.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 The 10-year-olds may still be in the fold, but by age
11 many viewers will find the film too gooey.
</P>
<P>
   PATCH ADAMS
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams, Daniel London, Monica Potter, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Harve Presnell. Directed by Tom Shadyac.
PG-13. 110 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After having himself committed for suicidal urges, Hunter
``Patch'' Adams (Williams) discovers that his suppressed
proclivities for clowning and good cheer have a miraculously
salutary effect on himself and other patients. And so it's on to
medical school, where Patch, blessed with a brilliant mind to go
with his new faith in mirth, determines to build a medical practice
based on warm, personal attention to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that a dangerously seditious pipe dream, the medical
school does all it can to restrict Patch to the straight and
narrow.
</P>
<P>
   In response, he continually has the teaching hospital in an
uproar with his antics and sets up a rural hospice, called the
Gesundheit Institute, where the downtrodden ill, meaning primarily
those with no health insurance, can receive treatment and succor.
</P>
<P>
   In a succession of highs and lows, Patch and the medical school
coexist uneasily until a fellow student and love interest (Ms.
Potter) is killed by a disturbed man who is being helped by the
institute. For a while that rocks Patch's faith, but soon he is
back to his outrageous stunts and railings against the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is graduation and, this being a film based on a
true story, a postscript stating that the real-life Patch Adams
went on to treat 15,000 patients without charge. Take that, you
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Patch's colleague is killed by a shotgun blast, but it
happens off-screen.
</P>
<P>
   SEX None, but there is some bawdy humor.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A lot of crudities and gross-out joking involving
masturbation, gynecologists, proctology and similar topics.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 The film is inappropriate for young children, and
despite Williams' clowning it would bore them to tears.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-12 Williams makes funny faces and wears an enema bulb on
his nose, but this film is essentially a protracted and at times
mawkishly preachy plea for better medical treatment. As such, it
may bore many young children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP The film's sentimentality, which is cloying at
times, and Patch's zeal may annoy some teen-agers, but others will
enjoy the film.

ECLIPSE RACES ARE CLOSE CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ If you like the tingling headache that comes from
trying to pick tomorrow's winners, you'll love the challenge of
picking last year's champions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare season when strong arguments could be made for
more than one candidate in most Eclipse Award divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Balloting by racing writers and executives ends Jan. 5. Results
will be announced Feb. 16 at an awards dinner in Bal Harbour, Fla.
Until then, happy old year:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2-year-olds: &LR;  Bob Baffert-trained Exploit is probably the most
talented of the group, and he'll get the votes of those who treat
this category as a Kentucky Derby future book. But Exploit skipped
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, won by favored Answer Lively at
Churchill Downs. And we're rewarding achievement, not ability
(aren't we?).
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Answer Lively. Who will win: Answer Lively or
Exploit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2-year-old fillies: &LR;  Baffert dominated with Golden Eagle Farms'
Excellent Meeting, who was best in the West, and Mike Pegram's
Silverbulletday, who beat her in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies
while winning 6 of 7.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Silverbulletday. Who will win: Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3-year-olds: &LR;  Wish we'd seen a race between Real Quiet, who
came within a nose of the Triple Crown, and Coronado's Quest, who
had a great run from April to August before flopping against older
horses. But Real Quiet was hurt after the Belmont and Coronado's
Quest was too much of a head case to face the big crowds at the
3-year-old classics.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Real Quiet. Who will win: Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3-year-old fillies: &LR;  Flip a coin: Banshee Breeze led the group
in earnings, won at distances from 7 furlongs to 1{ miles, beat
elders in the Spinster and lost the Breeders' Cup Distaff by just a
nose to 5-year-old Escena. Jersey Girl went undefeated and beat
Banshee Breeze once but got hurt before facing elders.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Banshee Breeze. Who will win: Banshee Breeze or
Jersey Girl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Older males: &LR;  There was an Awesome Again groundswell after the
Frank Stronach-owned colt completed an undefeated year by winning
the Breeders' Cup Classic. But reflective voters realize Skip Away
won major races in six states during a rugged campaign and was
simply worn out when he finished sixth in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Skip Away. Who will win: Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Older fillies and mares: &LR;  I'm supporting Wally Dollase-trained
Sharp Cat, who had to miss the Breeders' Cup Distaff, over Escena,
who won that race. This isn't a vote for what might have been. This
is a vote for what Sharp Cat achieved in her brief season: She
never trailed while going 4 for 4 by a combined 23 lengths and
earned a Beyer speed figure (119) in Skip Away's realm when she and
jockey Corey Nakatani ran away with the Beldame.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Sharp Cat. Who will win: Escena.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turf horses: &LR;  Fascination with Da Hoss' two-race campaign may
net the Breeders' Cup Mile winner a couple of votes. But this looks
like a romp for Breeders' Cup Turf winner Buck's Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Buck's Boy. Who will win: Buck's Boy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turf fillies and mares: &LR;  Fiji deserves to be the easiest winner
of the year after going 6 for 7 in Southern California for the
amazing trainer-jockey team of Neil Drysdale and Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Fiji. Who will win: Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sprinters: &LR;  Kelly Kip won up and down the East Coast but his
season ended in September. Affirmed Success was a deserving
favorite in the Breeders' Cup Sprint but turned out to be another
New York 7-furlong specialist. That leaves Craig Dollase-trained
Reraise, who led all the way in the Breeders' Cup race under
Nakatani to go 4 for 4 at the classic sprint distance of 6
furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Reraise. Who will win: Reraise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Horse of the Year: &LR;  Those who vote for Awesome Again must ask
themselves: Do I mean to encourage campaigns like the one Patrick
Byrne plotted for Awesome Again, who ducked the big races until the
Breeders' Cup, or campaigns like the one Sonny Hine plotted for
Skip Away, who stared into the spotlight all year? Easy question.
We'll be lucky to see another horse like Skip Away anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Skip Away. Who will win: Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jockeys: &LR;  The West's Gary Stevens leads the East's Jerry Bailey
in earnings and in Grade I winners ridden, was the hero of the
sensational Belmont Stakes and had two Breeders' Cup victories to
Bailey's one. If Stevens doesn't get the Eclipse this year, it's
only because voters can't break the Bailey habit.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Stevens. Who will win: Bailey, for the fourth
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trainers: &LR;  Santa Anita-based Baffert led the nation in earnings
with a barn topped by Silver Charm, Real Quiet, Silverbulletday,
Excellent Meeting and Exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Baffert. Who will win: Baffert, for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Owners: &LR;  Assuming 3-year-old Real Quiet and 2-year-old filly
Silverbulletday win Eclipses, Mike Pegram will be the first person
in the '90s to be the outright owner of two champions in the same
year. Pegram's frat-boy personality rubbed the racing establishment
the wrong way, another reason to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Pegram. Who will win: Pegram, Stronach or
Carolyn Hine (Skip Away).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Happy new era: &LR;  This is the day Californians will begin
wagering on full programs from out of state, in effect doubling the
menu for Santa Anita fans. Today, in addition to eight races at
Santa Anita and eight from Golden Gate Fields near San Francisco,
we can bet on nine from Aqueduct in New York and 11 from Calder in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   After the Miami horses move from Calder to Gulfstream Park on
Sunday, we'll be able to follow the East Coast's classiest winter
track, with important 3-year-old races leading to the March 13
Florida Derby.
</P>
<P>
   A law passed last summer permits California tracks to take as
many as 20 races a day from out of state. Until now, they've been
limited to a few big-purse races.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the popularity of the expanded simulcasting will take
more than a day. Fans will have to be at Santa Anita or a satellite
pretty early on New Year's morning to bet on the 9:30 a.m. first
races. &QL;

PATAKI TO TOUCH ON NATIONAL THEMES IN 2ND INAUGURAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki will begin his second term Friday
with an inaugural address that provides a glimpse of the themes he
plans to emphasize as he seeks to broaden his reputation nationally
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was officially sworn in Thursday night at a private
ceremony in Albany. He is to attend a church service Friday morning
before a public swearing-in ceremony and reception.
</P>
<P>
   The modest schedule contrasts sharply with that of four years
ago, when Pataki and the Republicans held an extensive celebration
to rejoice in having taken over the governor's mansion for the
first time in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Since easily winning re-election in November, Pataki has shifted
some of his attention to the national stage, announcing that he
will begin traveling the country to promote his brand of
Republicanism, which combines fiscal conservatism with a moderate
stance on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   He has also sought to distance himself from the Republican
leaders in Congress at a time when their pursuit of the impeachment
of President Clinton has hurt their standing in the polls. He has
said he does not favor impeachment, and asserted that a censure of
the president was more appropriate and would allow Congress to
avoid getting bogged down in lengthy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has declined to say whether he is seriously considering
running for president, though his aides have not discouraged
speculation about his intentions. Such a campaign would probably be
difficult for the governor because he favors abortion rights and
holds other views on social issues that are at odds with those of
the dominant, conservative wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
   At the inauguration Friday, Pataki is expected to give a
relatively short speech in which he reviews his first term and
discusses how the state can tackle the challenges of the next
century. He is not expected to detail major new programs, his aides
said Thursday night, holding off those announcements until his
state of the state and budget speeches later this month.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 DAVID C. ADAMS, FORMER NBC CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David C. Adams, a former chairman of NBC and member of its board
of directors, died Dec. 27 at Cedar Manor Nursing Home in Ossining,
N.Y. A resident of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Adams was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his dry wit and lack of pretension, Adams was regarded
as one of television's most popular executives.
</P>
<P>
   He joined NBC's legal staff in 1947 and retired in 1980, serving
under seven company presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he took what he described as ``an open-ended
sabbatical,'' a year that he said he hoped would give him time to
travel, read, walk, garden, attend concerts, and engage in good
talk with friends
</P>
<P>
   By that time Adams, then senior executive vice president, had
been responsible for the network's legal department, its Washington
office, program standards and practices, research and planning,
advertising, publicity and promotion, and relations with affiliated
stations. But when the problems of a job become too familiar, Adams
once said, he subscribed to the need for ``repotting.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of ``repotting'' in Europe, he returned to NBC as a
member of its board and as executive vice president of its
corporate staff, dealing in planning and policy matters. Less than
two years later he was appointed chairman of the company, and from
1975 until retirement he served as vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo on March 5, 1913, Adams received his
undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Buffalo. In
1941 he joined the legal staff of the Federal Communications
Commission in Washington, to which he returned in 1945 after
service in the U.S. Army. He joined NBC two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is survived by his wife, Ilyana, of Croton-on-Hudson; a
step-daughter, Kristina Lanin-Stufano of Hamden, Conn.; a
daughter-in-law, Audrey Adams of Scarsdale, two grandchildren and
two step-grandchildren.

Ever since the colonial era, America has had a pre-eminent preacher
who played an unofficial role as national evangelist. For the last
50 years, that role has been filled by the Rev. Billy Graham. But
at the turn of the new century, with Graham now 80, the question
arises who, if anyone, can take his place. Speculation focuses on,

and Bishop T.D. Jakes. (Monica Almeida, MJ Sharp, John Gress, Danny

<P>
   (NYT15) UNDATED -- Dec. 31, 1998 -- CARS-DESIGN-1, 12-31 --

extra little something that creates attachment to an inanimate
object.'' (New York Times Photo)

spray painted to read: ``The Exploited'' near the harbor to

<TEXT>
<P>
   Damon Wright, a playwright, died on Monday at Beth Israel
Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness, his family said.
He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Long Beach, Calif., and a graduate of Stanford
University, he was the author of ``Testimony,'' `` Baldwin Goes to
Heaven'' and ``The Quadroon Ball: An American Tragedy,'' among
other plays. He was a member of the Usual Suspects, a community of
artists at New York Theater Workshop, and had worked at the
Directors' Lab at Lincoln Center Theater. Both groups mounted
workshops of `` Baldwin Goes to Heaven'' in 1995 and 1996,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testimony'' was presented at Dixon Place in 1996 and ``The
Quadroon Ball'' at La Mama E.T.C. in 1997, as well as at the
Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., and the Alley Theater in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who earlier had been an administrator at Sounds in
Motion, the choreographer Dianne McIntyre's company, worked for The
New York Times from 1985 to 1995, most recently in the news
department. His articles about experimental theater appeared in the
Arts &AMP; Leisure section.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his parents, Artis and Birdell, and two
sisters, Joni and Lydia, all of Long Beach, and a brother, Carter,
of Jefferson, Texas.

Ever since the colonial era, America has had a pre-eminent preacher
who played an unofficial role as national evangelist. For the last
50 years, that role has been filled by the Rev. Billy Graham. But
at the turn of the new century, with Graham now 80, the question
arises who, if anyone, can take his place. Speculation focuses on,
from left, Rev. Greg Laurie, Rev. Anne Graham Lotz, Dr. Luis Palau,
and Bishop T.D. Jakes. (Monica Almeida, MJ Sharp, John Gress, Danny

ROBERT JOHNSON, 78, WORLD WAR II FIGHTER PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., S.C.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert S. Johnson, an 8th Air Force fighter pilot who shot down
27 German planes in an 11-month span during World War II and then
came home to a hero's welcome from President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
died on Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla. He was 78
and was the second-leading American air ace of the war in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lived in Lake Wylie, S.C., was hospitalized on Dec.
24 after collapsing while on a visit with relatives, according to a
niece, Margaret Sue Roth. The cause of death was not immediately
known.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting Flying Fortress bombers on their missions deep into
Germany in his barrel-nosed P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, Johnson was
the second World War II fighter pilot to break the U.S. record of
26 air ``victories'' set by Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker in World War
I. He accomplished that feat when he knocked down two Luftwaffe
fighters near Brunswick, Germany, on May 8, 1944, on his final
mission.
</P>
<P>
   His squadron commander in the 56th Fighter Group, Lt. Col.
Francis Gabreski, was the only U.S. fighter pilot in Europe with
more ``kills,'' having shot down 28 German planes and destroyed
three more on the ground. Major Richard Bong of the Army Air
Forces, the first pilot to break Rickenbacker's mark, was the
leading American ace of the entire war, downing 40 Japanese planes.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1944, _ the date of the D-Day invasion _ Johnson was
flown back to the United States for a new mission: selling war
bonds, exhorting factory workers to greater feats of production and
bucking up homefront morale in the face of heavy air-war
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Gabreski would recall how Johnson had ``phenomenal eyesight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some guys who just seemed to have an uncanny knack
for seeing things before anyone else did,'' Gabreski wrote in his
memoir ``Gabby'' (Orion, 1991). ``His eyes were very keenly tuned
to the sky. If he looked into a certain area, and enemy aircraft
were there, he saw them ahead of the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Samuel Johnson, who was born in Lawton, Okla., became
fascinated by planes as an 8-year-old the day he perched on his
father's shoulders at Post Field near Lawton and watched three
World War I fighters perform stunts. ``Then and there I changed my
goal from cowboy or railroad engineer to Army aviator,'' he
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   He started flying at age 13, got his first license the day
before he turned 16, and after attending junior college at what is
now Cameron University in Lawton, entered an Army aviation school
on Nov. 11, 1941.
</P>
<P>
   He scored his first ``kill'' on June 13, 1943, when he broke
from formation to go after a Focke-Wulf fighter, something that was
decidedly against the book then. That foray brought a bawling out
from his superiors, and Johnson would recall that he ``had a
reputation as a sort of wild man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other pilots would say, `Don't fly with Johnson, he'll get you
killed,''' he recalled in an interview with Military History
magazine in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver
Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross with the 56th Fighter
Group, the renowned Zemke's Wolfpack. Named for its commander, Col.
Hubert Zemke, the Wolfpack boasted five of the top 10 American air
aces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was never shot down, but had a harrowing experience on
June 26, 1943, when the pilot of a Focke-Wulf 190 fighter fired 21
cannon shells into the fuselage of his Thunderbolt during a mission
over France. Burned and momentarily blinded by splashing hydraulic
fuel and slightly wounded in the right leg and his nose, he tried
to bail out but could not open his shattered canopy.
</P>
<P>
   He headed back to England, but another Focke-Wulf riddled his
plane with small-arms fire over the English Channel. That pilot
finally ran out of ammunition, pulled alongside, wiggled his wings
in tribute and peeled off as the crippled Thunderbolt continued to
England.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States in June 1944, Johnson was
reunited with his wife, Barbara, and they were greeted by Roosevelt
at the White House. Later that day, he received a standing ovation
from members of the U.S. Senate when he appeared with his wife in
the visitors' gallery, and the couple had tea with Mrs. Roosevelt
at the White House afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he received the applause of thousands of aircraft
workers when he visited the plant of Republic Aviation, which built
the Thunderbolt, in Farmingdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Johnson was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force
reserves and recounted his combat experiences in ``Thunderbolt!''
(Rinehart, 1958). He was an executive with Republic Aviation for 18
years, and then worked in the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's wife died in 1995. He had no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering his fighter-pilot days, Johnson once observed: ``I'm
a fatalist, a strong believer that when your time is up, you're
gone, out of here. Why worry about that?'' But he added: ``I was
always scared _ that was what made me move quick.''

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMMOKALEE, Fla. _ Even before taking office in January,
Florida's governor-elect, Jeb Bush, is fulfilling at least one of
his major campaign promises.
 &HT;    In September, candidate Bush traveled to Immokalee, a small
farming town in Collier County, and spent two hours listening to
grievances outlined by members of the Coalition of Immokalee
Workers, a non-profit organization representing several thousand
poorly paid area laborers in various industries, including tomato
harvesting.
 &HT;    ``My hope is that everyone here today and all residents of
Florida can earn a decent wage and be able to provide for their
kids, be able to get adequate health care,'' Bush told reporters
following the meeting. ``Part of the reason that I aspire to serve
is to create the best possible climate for the greatest number of
people, so that they can pursue their dreams independently. And
part of that is getting a good wage.''
 &HT;    Although the farm workers at the meeting liked Bush's words,
most doubted that this wealthy young man and son of a U.S.
president would do more than talk. But they, along with skeptical
reporters, may have been wrong. Shortly after becoming
governor-elect, Bush telephoned J. Luis Rodriguez, a friend and
former president of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, an
umbrella group for farmers.
 &HT;    ``He called on me ... after the elections ... and urged me to
see what could be done,'' Rodriguez told the Naples Daily News.
``He would like to help those people. Those were his words. I think
he has the migrant labor force at heart, and I think he'll have
agriculture as a whole at heart.''
 &HT;    On behalf of Bush, Rodriquez met privately in Immokalee with
some of the area's largest tomato growers and two of nearly a dozen
commercial growers targeted by coalition protests last year, agreed
to increase the piece rate from 40 cents to 45 cents per bucket,
roughly a 13 percent pay increase.
 &HT;    This is the first increase pickers have received in 20 years.
The average picker earns less than $10,000 a year.
 &HT;    Another company, Garguilo Inc., had already agreed last year to
pay workers 45 cents per bucket then and 50 cents during this
season that is now under way. Several other growers at the meeting
agreed to incremental wage hikes in the near future.
 &HT;    Rodriquez, an agriculture consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and former federal agriculture official, said that he and the
growers also discussed worker housing and living conditions. A task
force _ consisting of growers and leaders in other industries _ has
been formed to address housing problems.
 &HT;    ``The coalition appreciates the efforts of Gov.-elect Bush in
helping to bring about this raise, and we look forward to working
with the governor and agribusiness leaders in the future to
continue to improve working and living conditions for our members
and farm workers throughout the state of Florida,'' coalition
leader Lucas Benitez said.
 &HT;    ``Wages and other conditions in Florida's fields have been a
disgrace for our state since before the Harvest of Shame, the
famous CBS documentary filmed here in Florida, and it is gratifying
to see that Gov. Bush will bring his political and moral leadership
to efforts to aggressively address those conditions once and for
all. Greater justice for Florida farm workers is not just good for
the men and women who pick our fruit and vegetables, but good for
agriculture as an industry and for the state as a whole.''
 &HT;    While welcoming the modest pay increase, coalition leaders know
that the biggest hurdle remains: Most of the growers refuse to sit
down and talk with the pickers' representatives.
 &HT;    ``Their hard-line refusal to meet with the coalition in a
respectful dialogue on wages and other working conditions
represents a continuing challenge to us as organized farm workers
and to all those who would work for significant change in Florida's
fields,'' said coalition representative Greg Asbed. ``Indeed, until
that obstacle is overcome, until growers and workers can meet and
work together as partners in the same industry, significant change
will remain a distant goal.''
 &HT;    Corey Tilley, Bush's spokesman, told the Naples Daily News that
the governor-elect, referring to the tomato growers' agreement to
increase the bucket rate, is ``very encouraged by what seems to be
a positive step forward. The important thing is the rank-and-file
workers, the people who the coalition represents, get additional
money. Now we can go from there and see what else can be
addressed.''
 &HT;    No other governor since Reubin Askew, who left office in 1979,
has taken such a direct interest in farm workers. Bush said during
his acceptance speech that he intended to do ``things the new
way.''
 &HT;    Taking the plight of farm workers seriously and doing something
about it is certainly doing ``things the new way.''

 By JOYCE EVANS-CAMPBELL 
 &HT;    (Joyce Evans-Campbell, African American, is a columnist for the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1996, when Travis Davidson was a student in a program called
the Leaves of Learning, he was introduced to space. Then one
morning while crunching on his breakfast cereal, he saw an
African-American astronaut on TV and declared that that was what he
wanted to do: become an astronaut.
 &HT;    Since then, Travis, now 11, has waited for the opportunity to
attend the program at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
 &HT;    A column about Travis and his dream ran in the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel on Dec. 23, 1996. And now, a generous donor is about to
make it happen. Jeff Richter, 36, a database administrator for a
Milwaukee company, was touched _ and inspired to pay for Travis'
trip.
 &HT;    The space camp is open to fourth- through 12th-graders and lasts
six to eight days. The tuition, which depends on the program and
time of year, ranges from $550 to $875 for hands-on training in
simulated space missions.
 &HT;    Vicki Davidson had told her son that he had to be 12 years old
and to keep his grades up. Only then, would she let him apply for
the Space Camp and Academy, knowing also that in order for him to
go, she would have to make a considerable financial sacrifice.
 &HT;    A single parent whose family roots are in Alabama, Davidson
wanted to give her son a goal to make sure he had something to look
forward to and to work toward.
 &HT;    Although Travis will be 12 on April 25, Davidson had to tell her
son he had to wait yet another year. ``I'm very interested in
letting him go, but I've just taken a new job. It won't be
financially feasible for us this year. I told him he had to wait,
and he said, `OK.'''
 &HT;    His heart sank a little, but he resigned himself to waiting
another year.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he has developed another interest as well. He is
involved in the Youth Leadership Academy and the Youth Leadership
Academy Boys Choir and these have broadened his horizons. He's
traveled and performed with the choir, which is patterned after the
Harlem Boys' Choir, and has visited places that he would not
otherwise be able to. ``Next year, we'll be going to New York!'' he
said.
 &HT;    Travis has a mentor who's an engineer, and that connection has
opened his eyes to the possibility of becoming an engineer. ``I
still want to be an astronaut but if I don't become an astronaut,
I'll become an engineer. My mentor has told me some exciting things
about engineering.''
 &HT;    The middle school student entered a private Catholic school this
year, and he has continued to work hard. ``He's earned all A's and
two B's,'' his mother said. He's keeping those grade up: He hopes
to be able to get into historically black school, Morehouse
College, or Stanford University.
 &HT;    ``He's always doing school work and involved in something
constructive,'' she added.
 &HT;    Then, on hearing Travis' story, Jeff Richter stepped in. He
himself has attended the space camp three times as an adult and
loves the space program. ``I believe strongly in the space program,
as well as in the mission of the camp, which is education of
today's youth in science,'' he said.
 &HT;    When Vicki Davidson received the news about Richter's offer, she
was stunned _ and elated.
 &HT;    She is a program coordinator for a housing/apartment complex,
and when Travis visited the computer room at her office recently,
another employee let him surf the Net. He went straight to the NASA
site.
 &HT;    ``He has every possible piece of information about the space
program,'' said his mother. ``And he'll be able to pick a date
that's good for him to go.''
 &HT;    Now he is excitedly looking forward to going to the space camp.
His donor, who came in like Santa Claus, is already on a pedestal _
a man who was born a day before John Glenn's first fight ... a man
who had dreams of becoming an astronaut himself ... a man who's
making it possible for Travis to blast off at space camp.
 &HT;    ``I think it's pretty nice of him,'' Travis marveled. ``I'm
blown away,''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Miami-Dade County Commission made gay civil-rights history
recently. By a vote of 7-6, commissioners agreed to add the
category of ``sexual orientation'' to the county's
anti-discrimination laws, thereby prohibiting discrimination based
on sexual orientation in housing, employment, credit, finance, and
public accommodations.
 &HT;    The new ordinance does not apply to companies with fewer than
four employees and rental buildings with fewer than four units.
There are exemptions for not-for-profit religious affiliated groups
and religious organizations.
 &HT;    The Miami-Dade County gay civil-rights ordinance enjoys broad
support from a variety of civic and political organizations,
including labor unions and business groups, the NAACP, the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the Urban League, People
for the American Way, and the Spanish-American League Against
Discrimination, as well as a number of high profile religious and
secular leaders, including the chairman of The Miami Herald.
 &HT;    The vote was ``a turning point in this community,'' according to
Miami Mayor Alex Penelas, a strong advocate of the new law. ``This
was one of those moments when we were at a fork in the road. It was
a vote that would show whether we were the progressive, tolerant,
and mature community we believe we are, or whether we would take a
step backward,'' Penelas told The Miami Herald.
 &HT;    Dade County made history as well 20 years ago, passing what was
then one of the nation's first gay civil rights laws. But several
months later _ in a highly charged referendum campaign led by the
singer Anita Bryant _ voters repealed the new ordinance by a 2-1
margin.
 &HT;    Back then the turn of events in Florida, catapulted the issue of
gay civil rights into the national spotlight. Over the last two
decades there has been steady progress. As one measure of that
progress, 11 states, 27 counties, and 136 cities have passed
ordinances similar to the one passed in Dade County, according to
the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay political
organization. Fewer than 10 have been repealed.
 &HT;    But will the new ordinance in Dade County stand? Or will the
Christian Coalition, the ordinance's chief opponent, attempt to
repeal it? ``We are obviously disappointed at this point, and we
will regroup,'' Anthony Verdugo, chairman of the local chapter of
the Christian Coalition, told The Miami Herald, declining to say
whether the group will try to overturn the ordinance through a
referendum.
 &HT;    Still, this past weekend opponents of the new law held a rally _
``family indignation Saturday'' _ in the Orange Bowl. About 2,000
people attended although organizers had hoped for 100,000.
 &HT;    One thing seems certain this time: Anti-gay forces attempting to
repeal the ordinance will face an electorate that, according to a
recent public opinion poll, favors the new law by a wide margin: 20
percent.
 &HT;    Hispanics and African-Americans, two of the regions major ethnic
and racial groups, support the law. ``There are very few issues
upon which all of Miami's ethnic groups agree, but this is one,''
said Rob Schroth in The Miami Herald. Schroth, a veteran South
Florida pollster, conducted a telephone survey of 650 voters for
the Herald and the local NBC affiliate.
 &HT;    Another group that favors the new gay civil rights law is people
who attend church. ``Forty-six percent of the people who go to
church at least once a week said they support the ordinance,
compared with 38 percent who oppose it,'' reported the Herald.
 &HT;    Based on the results of the survey, Schroth said the Christian
Coalition would have to outspend the pro-gay side by a margin of 2-
or 3-to-1 in a referendum battle. ``If their campaign is
well-funded and their message is based on scare tactics and fear,
they could certainly make it very close, but victory would still be
an uphill climb in my opinion, based on this poll,'' Schroth told
the Herald.
 &HT;    Still, scare tactics and virulent anti-gay rhetoric are what
prevailed 20 years ago when Anita Bryant's ``save our children''
crusade succeeded in rolling back the Miami-Dade County gay
civil-rights ordinance, calling it a means to approval of a
``perverse and dangerous'' way of living.
 &HT;    ``Many people see 1977 as the beginning of the rise of the
extreme right in this country, with a real focus on anti-gay
rhetoric,'' Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Washington,
D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, said in an article in The New
York Times. ``This is a wonderful victory for Miami-Dade County,
but it's a watershed victory for gays and lesbians nationally. This
shows how far we've come toward basic fairness for gay Americans,''
she said.
 &HT;    Along the road to equal rights for gay Americans, there is
perhaps no sweeter victory than this one.

AN AMERICAN INDIAN MUSICAL IN NEW YORK

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is publisher and editor-in-chief of
Indian Country Today. His Indian name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Whenever I come here, I always try to squeeze in a
Broadway show because it's not something that often comes to the
rolling hills of South Dakota.
 &HT;    This trip something special happened. Perhaps it was just good
timing or, as I would like to believe, pure fate.
 &HT;    I recently spoke at the Labor Department during a celebration of
Native American Heritage Week in Washington, D.C. The other guest
speaker was J. Reuben Silverbird, who told me about a musical
production soon to open in New York City, at the Henry Street
Settlement/Abrons Arts Center, with a cast of American Indians. It
sounded intriguing and I was elated to find I would be in New York
at the time.
 &HT;    The American Indian musical ``Red Sky'' was directed by Robert
Whitmore, an author and composer who also acted in ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' and starred as Judas in ``Jesus
Christ Superstar,'' which he also directed. His movie credits
include Kurasawa's ``Runaway Train'' and Bogdanvich's
``Texasville.'' The production of ``Red Sky'' marked his return to
the theater.
 &HT;    The theater at Abrons Center is small and intimate. It gets the
audience very close to the actors. Music for the production was
provided by Perry and Gil Silverbird, sons of Reuben. Both talented
musicians also acted in the production.
 &HT;    It was obvious this was a barebones production but it did not
deter the cast from giving a riveting performance. The play is an
Indian love story that turns out to be more of a triangle. Kyoko
MCrae as Anatah is torn between Kalani Queypo (Greyhawk) and
William Toll (Jeremiah), a man of mixed blood. In their argument
over her affections, a rifle accidentally discharges and Anatah is
killed. The first part of the play takes place during the wars
between the eastern tribes and the British.
 &HT;    The second part moves to more modern times with the same cast of
characters. It revolves around a land deal that would cost the
tribe its lands and Anatah, now working for her tribal government,
attempting to stop the corrupt action.
 &HT;    Rebecca ``Sami'' Yanes impressed me the most. As Eena, the
mother of Grey Eagle, she is a strong woman of the tribe. In the
second part, she plays the part of a bag lady living in the slums
of a city. But beyond all of that, she has a terrific voice and her
songs brought cheers and applause from the crowd who threw in some
traditional chants of appreciation for good measure. The audience,
by the way, must have included most of the Indian population of New
York City.
 &HT;    I wish I had been able to record some of the beautiful songs
from the production, but tape recorders are, of course, banned at
musical productions.
 &HT;    Having seen Broadway shows like ``Les Miserables,'' ``Cats,''
``Showboat,'' and others, it really made my day to see this small
cast of mostly American Indian actors standing on stage and singing
these beautiful songs about the culture and the traditions of the
Indian people.
 &HT;    Aside from the great piano renditions by Gil Silverbird and his
brother, Perry, the real stars of this production were J. Reuben
Silverbird and Rebecca ``Sami'' Yanes, whose performances came
straight from their hearts.
 &HT;    The show was a real learning experience for Robert Whitmore: he
learned much about American Indians as he worked side-by-side with
J. Reuben and his sons in planning and staging the show.
 &HT;    Alas, it closed after a 10-day run. The director and cast are
seeking additional funds to revive the production either on a New
York stage or to take it on the road.
 &HT;    The Indian dialogue in the show was in the Mohawk language and
the instructor, Jake Swamp, is an elder of the Wolf Clan of the
Mohawk people. Archie Cheeco, a Cree elder, also gave his support
and inspiration to the play.
 &HT;    The show deserves to be seen by many. It touches upon the
confrontation between the invaders and the indigenous people and
shows that Indian men and women can love and be loved.

``Texasville.'' The production of ``Red Sky'' marked his return to
the theater.
 &HT;    The theater at Abrons Center is small and intimate. It gets the
audience very close to the actors. Music for the production was
provided by Perry and Gil Silverbird, sons of Reuben. Both talented
musicians also acted in the production.
 &HT;    It was obvious this was a barebones production but it did not
deter the cast from giving a riveting performance. The play is an
Indian love story that turns out to be more of a triangle. Kyoko
MCrae as Anatah is torn between Kalani Queypo (Greyhawk) and
William Toll (Jeremiah), a man of mixed blood. In their argument
over her affections, a rifle accidentally discharges and Anatah is
killed. The first part of the play takes place during the wars
between the eastern tribes and the British.
 &HT;    The second part moves to more modern times with the same cast of
characters. It revolves around a land deal that would cost the
tribe its lands and Anatah, now working for her tribal government,
attempting to stop the corrupt action.
 &HT;    Rebecca ``Sami'' Yanes impressed me the most. As Eena, the
mother of Grey Eagle, she is a strong woman of the tribe. In the
second part, she plays the part of a bag lady living in the slums
of a city. But beyond all of that, she has a terrific voice and her
songs brought cheers and applause from the crowd who threw in some
traditional chants of appreciation for good measure. The audience,
by the way, must have included most of the Indian population of New
York City.
 &HT;    I wish I had been able to record some of the beautiful songs
from the production, but tape recorders are, of course, banned at
musical productions.
 &HT;    Having seen Broadway shows like ``Les Miserables,'' ``Cats,''
``Showboat,'' and others, it really made my day to see this small
cast of mostly American Indian actors standing on stage and singing
these beautiful songs about the culture and the traditions of the
Indian people.
 &HT;    Aside from the great piano renditions by Gil Silverbird and his
brother, Perry, the real stars of this production were J. Reuben
Silverbird and Rebecca ``Sami'' Yanes, whose performances came
straight from their hearts.
 &HT;    The show was a real learning experience for Robert Whitmore: he
learned much about American Indians as he worked side-by-side with
J. Reuben and his sons in planning and staging the show.
 &HT;    Alas, it closed after a 10-day run. The director and cast are
seeking additional funds to revive the production either on a New
York stage or to take it on the road.
 &HT;    The Indian dialogue in the show was in the Mohawk language and
the instructor, Jake Swamp, is an elder of the Wolf Clan of the
Mohawk people. Archie Cheeco, a Cree elder, also gave his support
and inspiration to the play.
 &HT;    The show deserves to be seen by many. It touches upon the
confrontation between the invaders and the indigenous people and
shows that Indian men and women can love and be loved.

 By CHRISTINE GRANADOS 
 c. 1998 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Here are just some of the standout individuals who have brought
Hispanic issues into the limelight this year. HISPANIC spotlights
10 exceptional people:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Our Man in Washington
 &HT;    The highest-ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration and
one of the most visible Hispanic politicians in the United States,
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson leads the list of trendsetters.
The native New Mexican has been nominated two times for the Nobel
Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts to free hostages in several
countries. His diplomatic successes did not escape President
Clinton's notice when he first appointed him UN ambassador.
Richardson held that position from Feb. 13, 1997 to Sept. 10, 1998
before being appointed secretary of energy.
 &HT;    He now must contend with protecting national security, advancing
the frontiers of science and technology, helping to solve the
challenge of global climate changes, making progress on the
environmental cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex, and ensuring
a balanced energy portfolio for the nation.
 &HT;    Richardson says that Latinos are becoming prominent players in
the international arena.
 &HT;    ``My goal as secretary of energy is to demonstrate to the
Hispanic community and all Americans how the Department of Energy
makes an extraordinary impact on their everyday lives,'' says the
50-year-old Mexican American. ``The department's scientists are
making spectacular breakthroughs in medicine, computers, and many
other fields. It is my hope that young Latinos will join with us
and that some day they will join Mario Molina [who received a Nobel
prize in chemistry in 1995] as a Nobel Prize winner the department
has sponsored.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    La Guera
 &HT;    The Hollywood paragon that is Cameron Diaz is also Hispanic.
Dubbed the ``It Girl of '98'' by Entertainment Weekly, Diaz is
showing Hollywood her roots. The 25-year-old Cuban American actress
was born to Emilio Diaz, a second-generation Cuban American, and
Billie, his German-English-Native American wife.
 &HT;    Like some third-generation Hispanics, Diaz cannot speak Spanish,
but the ``There's Something About Mary'' star's family is
tight-knit like many traditional Latino clans. When she is not
working, she spends most of her free time with her sister, Chimene,
and her niece, Chloe. She even calls her mother every day.
 &HT;    Choosy about the types of roles she plays, the former model has
come a long way from her 1994 big screen debut in ``The Mask,'' a
film, in which she played Tia Carlyle, the girl who made Jim
Carrey's eyes pop out of his head. She can be seen as Laura in
``Very Bad Things,'' which came out this fall.
 &HT;    Diaz is the first Latina of her generation who has landed the
girl-next-door, bad-girl, and blond-bombshell roles without being
pigeonholed as a luscious Latina. Her stereotype is more of the
zany girl next door.
 &HT;    Except for her name, Diaz is not identifiably Hispanic, but
she's breaking new ground for Hispanic women in Hollywood,
commanding $2 million per picture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Becoming a Role Model
 &HT;    Danny Villanueva made the trendsetters list for several reasons.
He was a successful professional football player. He is co-owner of
the country's only Latino-controlled venture capital firm. He is
also the second-richest Mexican American in the United States
according to the Los Angeles Times magazine. But it is his capacity
for giving to and teaching children and Latinos in the business
world that cemented his place on the list.
 &HT;    ``I have gone into areas where I had no role model and no
example,'' says Villanueva, recalling his days as a place kicker
and the only Latino in the National Football League (NFL). ``I did
it with the very conscious and very deliberate attempt to become a
role model. I was always very cognizant of what I was doing and
what impact it would have.''
 &HT;    Throughout his days as a football player, television
broadcaster, and businessman, Villanueva gave his time and money to
charity and nonprofit groups. ``At one point in my life, I made
about 150 appearances a year, talking to kids and groups,'' he
says.
 &HT;    He always remembers what his late mother, Pilar Villanueva,
instilled in him. ``She always thought service to the people was
our highest calling and our overriding obligation.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Color Purple
 &HT;    The most exciting, provocative, and exploratory writing in the
United States is coming from the Hispanic community, and Sandra
Cisneros leads the pack of refreshingly unconventional talent.
 &HT;    The Chicago native has published six books and numerous short
stories, essays, and poems. Her works have won many awards and have
been translated into 10 different languages. ``The House on Mango
Street'' has sold more than one million copies and is included in
college, elementary, and high school curricula across the country.
 &HT;    She received a genius fellowship in 1995 from the MacArthur
Foundation which afforded her the time to work on her current novel
tentatively titled ``Caramelo.'' ``Genius has a responsibility,''
she commented in a 1997 article in the San Antonio Express News.
``I'd like to see us a legion of superheroes who come to the aid of
communities in peril.''
 &HT;    However, it's Cisneros' political savvy and controversial manner
that also make her a leader in the community. Her propensity for
using the national media, reminiscent of Spike Lee, to bring to
light Latino causes has catapulted her onto the trendsetters list.
In 1997 Cisneros clashed with her San Antonio neighborhood
association over her choice of color for her house, which is
purple. When reporters showed up at her doorstep to ask why she
chose to paint her house a color not offered by the King William
Historic District board, she explained that she was using her own
cultural palette that represents the first Texas settlers: Native
Americans and Mexicans.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Para Yucas
 &HT;    With a visionary's perception and a slacker's attitude, Cuban
America Bill Teck of Miami launched a successful niche magazine for
the Latino community: ``generation n.'' The magazine, targeting
generation-x Latinos living in Miami, made its debut in a 28-page
black-and-white format in 1996, with a circulation of 13,500.
 &HT;    Teck attributes the success of his venture to micro marketing.
``As we approach the millennium, mass marketing to Hispanics as a
whole will become less and less effective,'' says the 30-year-old.
``It's cool that we're empowered politically and economically, but
culturally we're all very different. There are fly-fishing
magazines and survivalist magazines out there, so we thought, let's
try to micro market to, say, Hispanics who grew up in Miami in the
last 10 to 20 years speaking English.''
 &HT;    His strategy has worked. Now 17,500 copies of the publication
are printed in full color with both local and national advertisers.
In addition, the magazine has a television show that is a spinoff
of the same title in Miami. Teck is also co-host of a radio program
titled El Mango Azul, which covers the same topics as the magazine
but with a lot more humor.
 &HT;    As for the future, Teck, a former record store manager with
plenty of college credits and no college degree, has plans to use
his regional strategy throughout the United States. He envisions
``generation n'' magazines in every large city in Texas, New York,
and California, covering regional topics that people in each state
can relate to.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Doctor in the House
 &HT;    Professor David Hayes-Bautista has spent 30 years trying to
correct misconceptions and stereotypes about the health of the
Latino community. The 54-year-old Mexican American is part
scientist, number cruncher, anthropologist, sociologist, lecturer,
and medical doctor. His research team at the Center for the Study
of Latino Health at the UCLA School of Medicine finds ways to
better serve the Hispanic community's medical needs by researching
the Latino culture.
 &HT;    ``What we find is that Latinos don't look like anyone else. If
we look at Latinos in California, Arizona, and Texas they look
virtually alike. In those three states, Latinos have low income,
low education, and low access to health care. That's nothing new,''
says Hayes-Bautista. ``However, Latinos have a longer life
expectancy than non-Latinos _ about three to four years longer. Yet
Latinos are using doctors and hospital services a lot less. This is
a mystery because the thought is, `Well, if they are a low-income,
low-education population, they're going to be sicker and have to
use services a lot more.' But Latinos do it differently.''
 &HT;    The difference, or deviation from the norm, is what
Hayes-Bautista terms the ``Latino Epidemiological Paradox.'' This
paradox exists in all aspects of Latino life, and Hayes-Bautista
wants America to know that it is this paradox that is the strength
of the Hispanic population.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Crossover Surprise
 &HT;    Many Latinos in the music industry hope to record a crossover
hit. Selena did it, as did Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada. But when
a whole musical genre crosses over to mainstream audiences, it's
called a phenomenon. The latest musical phenomenon is rock en
espanol and one of the bands leading that trend, albeit
reluctantly, is Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The eight-person
Argentinean band doesn't like its label. ``We don't believe in the
phrase `rock en espanol,''' Flavio Cianciarulo, the band's bassist
and main songwriter, told Isaac Guzman, a writer for Newsday. ``It
doesn't exist as a movement.''
 &HT;    The band's music is a blend of ska, hip-hop, Afro-Cuban jazz,
punk, metal, rock, and a few other musical styles thrown in as well
_ something that cannot be easily labeled. What is easily labeled
is success. The band won the first-ever Grammy Award in the rock en
espanol category earlier this year for its 11th album, ``Fabulosos
Calavera.'' Although the band is already a major player in its
homeland and around the globe, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs is just now
gaining momentum in the United States. The group has come a long
way from the 1989 Los Angeles concert at which its eclectic brand
of music was greeted with showers of beer.
 &HT;    But the Latino rockeros' provocative sounds have helped enliven
and internationalize the music industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Couture With Soul
 &HT;    The wedding gown, a bias-cut pearl-silk crepe with subtle
draping in the font and back, that was worn by Caroline Bessette
for her wedding to John F. Kennedy, Jr., brought Latino designer
Narciso Rodriguez to the forefront of the fashion world. Since that
fateful day in 1996, Rodriguez has been setting fashion ablaze with
his soft, feminine designs.
 &HT;    The 37-year-old Cuban American from New Jersey struck out on his
own last year. He left the Cerruti Fashion house to start his own
ready-to-wear line, which drew raves from fashion critics. He was
nominated for the Perry Ellis Award for Womenswear at the Council
of Fashion Designers of America Awards ceremony earlier this year.
 &HT;    His fall/winter line wowed fashion critics with its cashmere
jumpers and strapless dresses with bustiers in flat dry wools worn
over fluffy sweaters. In the tradition of his predecessors, Oscar
de la Renta and Carolina Herrera, Rodriguez's Latino heritage
shines through his designs, especially when he plays with beading
and embroideries. ``A little bit of my Cuban roots came out in
beading and lace,'' Rodriguez told Elsa Klensch of CNN about his
latest collection.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Home-Run Hero
 &HT;    Standout performances by Latinos in baseball is no surprise, but
what finer example could one possibly find than Sammy Sosa? The
Chicago Cubs' right fielder hit a major league record of 20 home
runs in June, and his RBIs were the highest in the league this
season at 158.
 &HT;    However, it was the home run race in which he and St. Louis
first baseman Mark McGwire battled during the season that is his
most renowned accomplishment. He ended the season with 66 home
runs, to McGwire's 70. He worked hard during the entire season and
never once, despite all the hoopla, lost sight of the team goal of
making the play-offs.
 &HT;    After Sosa tied with McGwire at 66 home runs, he told an ESPN
reporter: ``[McGwire's] the one going to finish up there a little
bit higher than me. You have to remember, my situation is
different. I have to go out there and try to win the last five
games.''
 &HT;    But Sosa was chosen as a trendsetter for conducting himself with
poise and class throughout the season and the home run race. Who
would expect anything less from a man who wears Number 21 in honor
of his childhood hero: Roberto Clemente.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    No se Habla Espanol
 &HT;    Braving death threats, nasty telephone calls, and hate mail
because of her support and authorization of Proposition 227 (a bill
that ended bilingual education in California), Gloria Matta Tuchman
paved a road less traveled in primary and secondary education. With
the passage of Proposition 227 in June, she helped set the trend in
education toward English-immersion instruction for
non-English-speaking students. States such as Colorado and New York
are watching the outcome in California closely for ideas that could
help in reforming their bilingual education programs.
 &HT;    ``This whole issue is not about English-Only _ it is about
literacy for the kids. As a teacher, that is why I fought so long
and that is why Jaime Escalante [the math teacher dramatized in the
film ``Stand and Deliver''] fought,'' says the 57-year-old
elementary school teacher, who is running for superintendent of
public instruction in California. If elected, Matta Tuchman will be
the first Hispanic to hold that post.
 &HT;    Matta Tuchman says that California students have long been used
as guinea pigs in bilingual programs and that mandated bilingual
education has been tried and proved not to be effective. ``It
didn't teach English _ that was the intent and purpose of the
program, but that was not what was happening,'' she says.

Latinos are using doctors and hospital services a lot less. This is
a mystery because the thought is, `Well, if they are a low-income,
low-education population, they're going to be sicker and have to
use services a lot more.' But Latinos do it differently.''
 &HT;    The difference, or deviation from the norm, is what
Hayes-Bautista terms the ``Latino Epidemiological Paradox.'' This
paradox exists in all aspects of Latino life, and Hayes-Bautista
wants America to know that it is this paradox that is the strength
of the Hispanic population.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Crossover Surprise
 &HT;    Many Latinos in the music industry hope to record a crossover
hit. Selena did it, as did Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada. But when
a whole musical genre crosses over to mainstream audiences, it's
called a phenomenon. The latest musical phenomenon is rock en
espanol and one of the bands leading that trend, albeit
reluctantly, is Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The eight-person
Argentinean band doesn't like its label. ``We don't believe in the
phrase `rock en espanol,''' Flavio Cianciarulo, the band's bassist
and main songwriter, told Isaac Guzman, a writer for Newsday. ``It
doesn't exist as a movement.''
 &HT;    The band's music is a blend of ska, hip-hop, Afro-Cuban jazz,
punk, metal, rock, and a few other musical styles thrown in as well
_ something that cannot be easily labeled. What is easily labeled
is success. The band won the first-ever Grammy Award in the rock en
espanol category earlier this year for its 11th album, ``Fabulosos
Calavera.'' Although the band is already a major player in its
homeland and around the globe, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs is just now
gaining momentum in the United States. The group has come a long
way from the 1989 Los Angeles concert at which its eclectic brand
of music was greeted with showers of beer.
 &HT;    But the Latino rockeros' provocative sounds have helped enliven
and internationalize the music industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Couture With Soul
 &HT;    The wedding gown, a bias-cut pearl-silk crepe with subtle
draping in the font and back, that was worn by Caroline Bessette
for her wedding to John F. Kennedy, Jr., brought Latino designer
Narciso Rodriguez to the forefront of the fashion world. Since that
fateful day in 1996, Rodriguez has been setting fashion ablaze with
his soft, feminine designs.
 &HT;    The 37-year-old Cuban American from New Jersey struck out on his
own last year. He left the Cerruti Fashion house to start his own
ready-to-wear line, which drew raves from fashion critics. He was
nominated for the Perry Ellis Award for Womenswear at the Council
of Fashion Designers of America Awards ceremony earlier this year.
 &HT;    His fall/winter line wowed fashion critics with its cashmere
jumpers and strapless dresses with bustiers in flat dry wools worn
over fluffy sweaters. In the tradition of his predecessors, Oscar
de la Renta and Carolina Herrera, Rodriguez's Latino heritage
shines through his designs, especially when he plays with beading
and embroideries. ``A little bit of my Cuban roots came out in
beading and lace,'' Rodriguez told Elsa Klensch of CNN about his
latest collection.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Home-Run Hero
 &HT;    Standout performances by Latinos in baseball is no surprise, but
what finer example could one possibly find than Sammy Sosa? The
Chicago Cubs' right fielder hit a major league record of 20 home
runs in June, and his RBIs were the highest in the league this
season at 158.
 &HT;    However, it was the home run race in which he and St. Louis
first baseman Mark McGwire battled during the season that is his
most renowned accomplishment. He ended the season with 66 home
runs, to McGwire's 70. He worked hard during the entire season and
never once, despite all the hoopla, lost sight of the team goal of
making the play-offs.
 &HT;    After Sosa tied with McGwire at 66 home runs, he told an ESPN
reporter: ``[McGwire's] the one going to finish up there a little
bit higher than me. You have to remember, my situation is
different. I have to go out there and try to win the last five
games.''
 &HT;    But Sosa was chosen as a trendsetter for conducting himself with
poise and class throughout the season and the home run race. Who
would expect anything less from a man who wears Number 21 in honor
of his childhood hero: Roberto Clemente.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    No se Habla Espanol
 &HT;    Braving death threats, nasty telephone calls, and hate mail
because of her support and authorization of Proposition 227 (a bill
that ended bilingual education in California), Gloria Matta Tuchman
paved a road less traveled in primary and secondary education. With
the passage of Proposition 227 in June, she helped set the trend in
education toward English-immersion instruction for
non-English-speaking students. States such as Colorado and New York
are watching the outcome in California closely for ideas that could
help in reforming their bilingual education programs.
 &HT;    ``This whole issue is not about English-Only _ it is about
literacy for the kids. As a teacher, that is why I fought so long
and that is why Jaime Escalante [the math teacher dramatized in the
film ``Stand and Deliver''] fought,'' says the 57-year-old
elementary school teacher, who is running for superintendent of
public instruction in California. If elected, Matta Tuchman will be
the first Hispanic to hold that post.
 &HT;    Matta Tuchman says that California students have long been used
as guinea pigs in bilingual programs and that mandated bilingual
education has been tried and proved not to be effective. ``It
didn't teach English _ that was the intent and purpose of the
program, but that was not what was happening,'' she says.

 By CHRISTINE GRANADOS 
 c. 1998 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Here are just some of the standout individuals who have brought
Hispanic issues into the limelight this year. HISPANIC spotlights
10 exceptional people:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Our Man in Washington
 &HT;    The highest-ranking Hispanic in the Clinton administration and
one of the most visible Hispanic politicians in the United States,
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson leads the list of trendsetters.
The native New Mexican has been nominated two times for the Nobel
Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts to free hostages in several
countries. His diplomatic successes did not escape President
Clinton's notice when he first appointed him UN ambassador.
Richardson held that position from Feb. 13, 1997 to Sept. 10, 1998
before being appointed secretary of energy.
 &HT;    He now must contend with protecting national security, advancing
the frontiers of science and technology, helping to solve the
challenge of global climate changes, making progress on the
environmental cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex, and ensuring
a balanced energy portfolio for the nation.
 &HT;    Richardson says that Latinos are becoming prominent players in
the international arena.
 &HT;    ``My goal as secretary of energy is to demonstrate to the
Hispanic community and all Americans how the Department of Energy
makes an extraordinary impact on their everyday lives,'' says the
50-year-old Mexican American. ``The department's scientists are
making spectacular breakthroughs in medicine, computers, and many
other fields. It is my hope that young Latinos will join with us
and that some day they will join Mario Molina [who received a Nobel
prize in chemistry in 1995] as a Nobel Prize winner the department
has sponsored.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    La Guera
 &HT;    The Hollywood paragon that is Cameron Diaz is also Hispanic.
Dubbed the ``It Girl of '98'' by Entertainment Weekly, Diaz is
showing Hollywood her roots. The 25-year-old Cuban American actress
was born to Emilio Diaz, a second-generation Cuban American, and
Billie, his German-English-Native American wife.
 &HT;    Like some third-generation Hispanics, Diaz cannot speak Spanish,
but the ``There's Something About Mary'' star's family is
tight-knit like many traditional Latino clans. When she is not
working, she spends most of her free time with her sister, Chimene,
and her niece, Chloe. She even calls her mother every day.
 &HT;    Choosy about the types of roles she plays, the former model has
come a long way from her 1994 big screen debut in ``The Mask,'' a
film, in which she played Tia Carlyle, the girl who made Jim
Carrey's eyes pop out of his head. She can be seen as Laura in
``Very Bad Things,'' which came out this fall.
 &HT;    Diaz is the first Latina of her generation who has landed the
girl-next-door, bad-girl, and blond-bombshell roles without being
pigeonholed as a luscious Latina. Her stereotype is more of the
zany girl next door.
 &HT;    Except for her name, Diaz is not identifiably Hispanic, but
she's breaking new ground for Hispanic women in Hollywood,
commanding $2 million per picture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Becoming a Role Model
 &HT;    Danny Villanueva made the trendsetters list for several reasons.
He was a successful professional football player. He is co-owner of
the country's only Latino-controlled venture capital firm. He is
also the second-richest Mexican American in the United States
according to the Los Angeles Times magazine. But it is his capacity
for giving to and teaching children and Latinos in the business
world that cemented his place on the list.
 &HT;    ``I have gone into areas where I had no role model and no
example,'' says Villanueva, recalling his days as a place kicker
and the only Latino in the National Football League (NFL). ``I did
it with the very conscious and very deliberate attempt to become a
role model. I was always very cognizant of what I was doing and
what impact it would have.''
 &HT;    Throughout his days as a football player, television
broadcaster, and businessman, Villanueva gave his time and money to
charity and nonprofit groups. ``At one point in my life, I made
about 150 appearances a year, talking to kids and groups,'' he
says.
 &HT;    He always remembers what his late mother, Pilar Villanueva,
instilled in him. ``She always thought service to the people was
our highest calling and our overriding obligation.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Color Purple
 &HT;    The most exciting, provocative, and exploratory writing in the
United States is coming from the Hispanic community, and Sandra
Cisneros leads the pack of refreshingly unconventional talent.
 &HT;    The Chicago native has published six books and numerous short
stories, essays, and poems. Her works have won many awards and have
been translated into 10 different languages. ``The House on Mango
Street'' has sold more than one million copies and is included in
college, elementary, and high school curricula across the country.
 &HT;    She received a genius fellowship in 1995 from the MacArthur
Foundation which afforded her the time to work on her current novel
tentatively titled ``Caramelo.'' ``Genius has a responsibility,''
she commented in a 1997 article in the San Antonio Express News.
``I'd like to see us a legion of superheroes who come to the aid of
communities in peril.''
 &HT;    However, it's Cisneros' political savvy and controversial manner
that also make her a leader in the community. Her propensity for
using the national media, reminiscent of Spike Lee, to bring to
light Latino causes has catapulted her onto the trendsetters list.
In 1997 Cisneros clashed with her San Antonio neighborhood
association over her choice of color for her house, which is
purple. When reporters showed up at her doorstep to ask why she
chose to paint her house a color not offered by the King William
Historic District board, she explained that she was using her own
cultural palette that represents the first Texas settlers: Native
Americans and Mexicans.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Para Yucas
 &HT;    With a visionary's perception and a slacker's attitude, Cuban
America Bill Teck of Miami launched a successful niche magazine for
the Latino community: ``generation n.'' The magazine, targeting
generation-x Latinos living in Miami, made its debut in a 28-page
black-and-white format in 1996, with a circulation of 13,500.
 &HT;    Teck attributes the success of his venture to micro marketing.
``As we approach the millennium, mass marketing to Hispanics as a
whole will become less and less effective,'' says the 30-year-old.
``It's cool that we're empowered politically and economically, but
culturally we're all very different. There are fly-fishing
magazines and survivalist magazines out there, so we thought, let's
try to micro market to, say, Hispanics who grew up in Miami in the
last 10 to 20 years speaking English.''
 &HT;    His strategy has worked. Now 17,500 copies of the publication
are printed in full color with both local and national advertisers.
In addition, the magazine has a television show that is a spinoff
of the same title in Miami. Teck is also co-host of a radio program
titled El Mango Azul, which covers the same topics as the magazine
but with a lot more humor.
 &HT;    As for the future, Teck, a former record store manager with
plenty of college credits and no college degree, has plans to use
his regional strategy throughout the United States. He envisions
``generation n'' magazines in every large city in Texas, New York,
and California, covering regional topics that people in each state
can relate to.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Doctor in the House
 &HT;    Professor David Hayes-Bautista has spent 30 years trying to
correct misconceptions and stereotypes about the health of the
Latino community. The 54-year-old Mexican American is part
scientist, number cruncher, anthropologist, sociologist, lecturer,
and medical doctor. His research team at the Center for the Study
of Latino Health at the UCLA School of Medicine finds ways to
better serve the Hispanic community's medical needs by researching
the Latino culture.
 &HT;    ``What we find is that Latinos don't look like anyone else. If
we look at Latinos in California, Arizona, and Texas they look
virtually alike. In those three states, Latinos have low income,
low education, and low access to health care. That's nothing new,''
says Hayes-Bautista. ``However, Latinos have a longer life
expectancy than non-Latinos _ about three to four years longer. Yet
Latinos are using doctors and hospital services a lot less. This is
a mystery because the thought is, `Well, if they are a low-income,
low-education population, they're going to be sicker and have to
use services a lot more.' But Latinos do it differently.''
 &HT;    The difference, or deviation from the norm, is what
Hayes-Bautista terms the ``Latino Epidemiological Paradox.'' This
paradox exists in all aspects of Latino life, and Hayes-Bautista
wants America to know that it is this paradox that is the strength
of the Hispanic population.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Crossover Surprise
 &HT;    Many Latinos in the music industry hope to record a crossover
hit. Selena did it, as did Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada. But when
a whole musical genre crosses over to mainstream audiences, it's
called a phenomenon. The latest musical phenomenon is rock en
espanol and one of the bands leading that trend, albeit
reluctantly, is Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The eight-person
Argentinean band doesn't like its label. ``We don't believe in the
phrase `rock en espanol,''' Flavio Cianciarulo, the band's bassist
and main songwriter, told Isaac Guzman, a writer for Newsday. ``It
doesn't exist as a movement.''
 &HT;    The band's music is a blend of ska, hip-hop, Afro-Cuban jazz,
punk, metal, rock, and a few other musical styles thrown in as well
_ something that cannot be easily labeled. What is easily labeled
is success. The band won the first-ever Grammy Award in the rock en
espanol category earlier this year for its 11th album, ``Fabulosos
Calavera.'' Although the band is already a major player in its

of music was greeted with showers of beer.
 &HT;    But the Latino rockeros' provocative sounds have helped enliven
and internationalize the music industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Couture With Soul
 &HT;    The wedding gown, a bias-cut pearl-silk crepe with subtle
draping in the font and back, that was worn by Caroline Bessette
for her wedding to John F. Kennedy, Jr., brought Latino designer
Narciso Rodriguez to the forefront of the fashion world. Since that

   BUSH ACTS ON BEHALF OF FARM WORKERS _ Even before taking office
in January, Florida's governor-elect, Jeb Bush, is fulfilling at
least one of his major campaign promises, notes columnist Bill
Maxwell, one that he made to farm workers. Under his
behind-the-scenes encouragement, two of nearly a dozen commercial
tomato growers have agreed to increase wages for pickers by about
13 percent _ ``the first increase farm workers have received in 20
years,'' Maxwell writes.

   BOY'S ASTRONAUT DREAMS COME TRUE. In 1996, when Travis Davidson
was a student in a program called the Leaves of Learning, he was
introduced to space, reports writer Joyce Evans-Campbell. Then one
morning over breakfast, he saw an African-American astronaut on TV
and declared that that was what he wanted to do: become an
astronaut. A column about Travis and his dream appeared in the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Dec. 23, 1996. ``And now, a generous
donor is about to make the first step of Travis' dream happen,''

add the category of ``sexual orientation'' to the county's
anti-discrimination laws, thereby prohibiting discrimination based
on sexual orientation in housing, employment, credit, finance, and
public accommodations. ``Along the road to equal rights for gay
Americans, there is perhaps no sweeter victory than this one,'' he

in January, Florida's governor-elect, Jeb Bush, is fulfilling at
least one of his major campaign promises, notes columnist Bill
Maxwell, one that he made to farm workers. Under his
behind-the-scenes encouragement, two of nearly a dozen commercial
tomato growers have agreed to increase wages for pickers by about
13 percent _ ``the first increase farm workers have received in 20
years,'' Maxwell writes.

LIMOR MIZRACHI: ABL'S DEMISE CATCHES ISRAELI PLAYER OFF GUARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ct., Fla., Israel)   By JACK CAVANAUGH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the American Basketball League folded on Dec. 22, most
players got the news that afternoon from their team's offices. But
not Limor Mizrachi of the New England Blizzard. She heard about it
in a phone call, a day later, from one of her sisters in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, Sigi, heard about it on the radio back home and
called my mother's aunt's house in Fort Lauderdale, where she
thought I was,'' said Mizrachi, the first and only Israeli player
in the women's pro league which went out of business less than half
way through its third season because of a money shortage. ``But at
the time, I was in Orlando'' _ at Disney World _ ``with my mother
and father and no one knew how to reach us.''
</P>
<P>
   As it developed, the 28-year-old Mizrachi, a three-time most
valuable player of the Israeli women's professional league, did not
find out about the ABL's collapse until she and her parents arrived
back at her aunt's home in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 23, the day
after the league had announced it was ceasing operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she told me about the phone calls, I thought she was
talking about the Israeli league,'' Mizrachi said in an interview
from her home in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A flashy point guard whose no-look passes and deadly 3-point
shooting are her trademarks, Mizrachi had gone to Florida with her
parents _ who were visiting from Israel _ for a few days after the
team's coach, K.C. Jones, had given his players a break between
what turned out to be the Blizzard's last game on Dec. 19 and a
scheduled Christmas Day game in Nashville. Instead, Mizrachi flew
to Connecticut with her mother, Shula, and her father, Natan, on
Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are going back to Israel on Saturday,'' said
Mizrachi, who has played on the Israeli national women's team since
she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not sure what I'm going to do,'' she said. ``I can't
go back and play in the Israeli league, because the season has
started, and, once it's started, you can't play in the league if
you've been playing in another country. But I've been in touch with
my agent, and it's possible I could play in Europe. But for now,
I'm staying in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be in a rented apartment in Rocky Hill, a Hartford
suburb that is a far cry from her family home in Givataim, a town
near Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   She began the season slowly, as a backup guard to Jones and
Jennifer Rizzotti. But she had started the team's last six games
after Jones was lost for the rest of the season following a knee
injury. In her last five games, the 5-foot-7-inch Israeli, playing
in the backcourt with Rizzotti, had averaged 11 points a game. She
had began to play more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limor is a great player,'' Jones, the coach and basketball
Hall of Famer, said. ``She didn't do too much at the beginning, and
had a tendency to go for a steal every time, which often left her
out of position. But we had a chat and she had become more
contained on defense. There's a certain hardness about her as a
player. And she's a great passer who sees the court so well. Plus
she's intelligent, tricky and deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' assistant coach, Boe Pearman, helped recruit Mizrachi,
when she was an assistant at Maryland during the 1991-92 season.
That season, Mizrachi started all 30 games for the Terrapins, who
reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association East Regional
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruited Limor on the basis of a tape that a former
Israeli player we had had sent to us,'' Pearman said. ``She was
flashy with a lot of pizazz, and the fans, including a lot of
embassy people from Washington, loved to watch her play. But she
was also the consummate point guard who beat you with her skills,
her mind and her quickness.''
</P>
<P>
   But after one season at Maryland, Mizrachi, who still holds the
school's single-season record for 3-point accuracy (41.6 percent),
returned to Israel after her mother was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mizrachi was about halfway though a mandatory two-year
tour of duty in the Israeli Army when the Gulf War broke out.
Assigned to a base in Tel Aviv as a weight-lifting instructor, she
would dribble a basketball while walking the three miles to the
base and home every day. ``There were times when I heard missiles''
_ that had been fired at Israel from Iraq _ ``and it was scary. One
missile landed near my grandmother's house and did considerable
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite renewed tension in the Middle East, Mizrachi is prepared
to return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad that the league ended, but I have no regrets over
coming here to play,'' she said. ``It was a great experience,
playing against so many good players. And K.C. Jones was such a
great coach and great person to play under. I'm going to miss
everybody. But maybe I can come back to play in the WNBA.''

UCLA'S RUSH SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Freshman forward JaRon Rush has been suspended for
Saturday's game against Arizona after missing two practices and one
game because of homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   Rush spent Christmas with his family in Kansas City and did not
return to UCLA until Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great empathy for what he's going through, but you
still have to be accountable for your actions,'' Bruins coach Steve
Lavin said. ``It was not a situation of active rebellion or active
defiance. (Homesickness) is a lot different from breaking team
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush was homesick throughout the fall quarter but did not feel
its full force until he was surrounded by friends and family. His
return ticket was mistakenly purchased for Monday morning, and then
he missed his flight. At that point, the homesickness was in full
bloom and he remained in Kansas City for two additional days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would come back (to UCLA), it was just a matter of
time,'' Rush said. ``I had to spend time with my family. I went
home, and it hit me. It was hard to get back on that plane. But
I've only got three months left (until spring break), and I've just
got to get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush is UCLA's No.3 scorer, averaging 11.1 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   The big fella returns: Freshman center Dan Gadzuric erased any
doubt about his importance to UCLA's success when he returned from
a one-game absence (tendinitis) to grab seven rebounds in 19
minutes against Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jerome Moiso, who waits for the ball to enter his
airspace, Gadzuric pursues rebounds regardless of their distance
and direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a space eater,'' Lavin said. ``Obviously, his
aggressive style gives us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, he's the man: Sophomore forward Travis Reed has
improved his foul shooting dramatically, from 33.3 percent last
year to 66.7 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   To reward Reed, Lavin let him shoot free throws after Loyola
Marymount coach Charles Bradley was assessed a technical foul.
Traditionally, a team's best shooter takes the technical free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot I was leading the team, but now I guess I've got to
shoot them,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Changing shirts: After several unsuccessful attempts to
rehabilitate his groin injury, sophomore guard Billy Knight has
decided to sit out the season. Because he played in the exhibition
games, Knight must apply for a medical redshirt after the season.

   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's largest local telephone

bring New York-based Bell Atlantic, which already has 5.7 million
cellular customers in services blanketing the East Coast, one step
closer to creating a nationwide and even international wireless
network.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch, which has 7.8 million customers in the United States
and more than 11 million worldwide, serves the entire West Coast
and has a number of partnerships in Europe and Asia that would
expand Bell Atlantic's network considerably on those continents.
</P>
<P>
   Among those is a partnership with Mannesmann Mobilfunk of
Germany that makes AirTouch one of the biggest providers of
cellular services in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In all, international wireless services make up 57 percent of
AirTouch's operating income, according to Deutsche Bank Research.
</P>
<P>
   As with any deal not yet sealed, talks could fall apart at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   But if the deal is approved, the purchase price would be about a
10 percent premium over AirTouch's Thursday closing price of
$72.4375. Both boards are expected to meet over the weekend to
discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal would also need the blessing of GTE executives. The
company agreed last summer to be acquired by Bell Atlantic in a
$52.9 billion stock swap. As of Thursday night, GTE executives were
said to be supportive of the deal, believing it would be good for
the combined companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, one of the original ``Baby Bells'' spun off from
AT&AMP;T, absorbed Nynex, the local phone company serving the New York
and New England areas, in 1997. That deal was more a merger of
equals that resulted in the former chairman of Nynex, Ivan G.
Seidenberg, being named vice chairman and president of Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that if a deal was reached between the
companies, the prices of some cellular calls, especially charges
for roaming _ calls made when the user travels outside the area
served by the provider _ could be sliced as much as 50 percent on
the newly combined network, possibly enough to generate an
industrywide reduction of rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the increased competition in the industry, rates have
been falling around 15 percent to 20 percent annually in
wireless,'' said Mel Marten, an analyst with Edward Jones, an
investment company. ``If this acquisition doesn't accelerate that
amount, it should definitely keep it continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   And beyond lower prices, analysts said that the main impetus for
combining cellular networks was increasing consumer demand for
convenience and simplified pricing _ the ongoing effort within the
industry to offer service plans that can be used anywhere in the
United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, AT&AMP;T introduced its Digital One Rate service, which
lets users buy 600 wireless minutes a month that can be used
anywhere in the country for $90. Sprint PCS has introduced similar
plans. A nationwide network forged in a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch
combination, analysts said, would be well positioned to compete
against both plans.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the closing stock price Thursday, Bell Atlantic has a
market value of $83.8 billion, twice that of AirTouch, which is
valued at $41.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal makes all the sense in the world,'' said Charles A.
Morris, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science and Technology Fund,
which owns AirTouch stock. ``This allows them to have a national
footprint and compete with AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any combination of the two companies faces hurdles among
both regulators and investors. For one thing, the merger between
GTE and Bell Atlantic, which is currently under scrutiny by the
federal government, has not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Adding another party to that merger could raise even more
eyebrows in Washington, even though some industry observers suggest
that a Bell Atlantic and AirTouch combination is likely to be
completed first.
</P>
<P>
   And some investment analysts said Thursday that the deal could
dilute Bell Atlantic's earnings, which in turn could have a
negative impact on the share price of GTE stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investor reaction Thursday as rumors of an acquisition began to
circulate on trading floors was predictable _ favoring the buyout
target and pushing down the share prices of the buyer. AirTouch
stock closed at $72.4375, up $3.0625, after flirting with a 52-week
high of $75 per share earlier in the day. Bell Atlantic closed at
$54 a share, down $3.50, while GTE's stock fell in tandem, dropping
$3.375 to close at $65.
</P>
<P>
   In all, analysts said an AirTouch acquisition would be a coup
for Bell Atlantic, giving it a 13 percent share of the wireless
market and moving it ahead of AT&AMP;T, which has around 10 percent.
More importantly, the deal would allow Bell Atlantic to have a
nationwide wireless network similar to AT&AMP;T's system.
</P>
<P>
   Competition between the wireless companies has become intense in
recent months, as several providers have rolled out new service
plans to lure new subscribers. The changes come as a direct
response to angry consumers, who grew tired of unpredictable
monthly phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main factors that spiked the bills were roaming fees.
In 1997, wireless customers racked up nearly $3 billion in roaming
charges, some 11 percent of the year's $27.5 billion in revenue.

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ No matter how tortured or how beholden it was to
those blasted computers, the Bowl Championship Series did its job.
No. 1 Tennessee will play No. 2 Florida State for the national
championship here on Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl. The other
seven bowl games over the New Year's weekend are simply warm-up
acts, except for one, the Dissent Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you like, the Sugar Bowl. That's a matchup that dares to
spit in the face of the computer age, and can undo the BCS'
best-laid plans to crown an undisputed national champion.
</P>
<P>
   It goes like this: If Ohio State (10-1) rolls over Texas A&AMP;M
(11-2) and Florida State squeaks by Tennessee in an ugly game, then
the Associated Press poll could presumably crown the Buckeyes No. 1
as the best one-loss team. The coaches poll, however, has promised
its national title to the winner of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is a remote possibility, but Ohio State coach John
Cooper likes the idea enough to keep it floating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ranked third in the country, got a chance to finish
second, maybe first,'' Cooper said. ``It all depends on how well we
play and what happens to Tennessee and Florida State. I think it's
a long shot. We would have to have an exceptional ball game, and
Florida State would have to win a sloppy game.''
</P>
<P>
   The last team that looked beyond the Aggies, however, had its
season ruined. In the Big 12 championship game, Kansas State was
leading by 15 points and was packing its bags for the Fiesta Bowl
when Texas A&AMP;M came back to win in double overtime, 36-33.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Aggies' coach, R.C. Slocum, nor his players have
said much about Cooper's campaign to win a split poll. But they do
resent the implication that a team with the 10th-ranked defense led
by the Butkus award winner Dat Nguyen is not worthy of a BCS bowl
and its $11 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat some pretty good teams to get here,'' Slocum said.
``We think we deserve to be here, and now we want to show what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The two other BCS bowls _ the Orange and the Rose _ also award
their participants the big-money payout, but will have to settle
for offering fans entertainment value this year while waiting their
turn for the championship game to rotate their way.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orange, the Florida Gators (9-2) will be without their
defensive coordinator, Bob Stoops, who recently took the head
coaching job at Oklahoma, as well as defensive end Tim Beauchamp
and cornerback Dock Pollard. Both were suspended this week for
violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Spurrier concedes those aren't the ideal conditions
for containing the high-scoring Syracuse Orangemen (8-3) and
quarterback Donovan McNabb, who takes 8,389 passing yards, another
1,561 on the ground and 96 touchdowns into his final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donovan can avoid people,'' Spurrier said. ``He's a tremendous
passer, too. So it's going to be a big challenge to keep him in the
pocket and try to cover some guys and slow down their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Bowl, it is Cade McNown of UCLA (10-1) and an
offense that averaged 40.5 points and 482 yards a game against a
Wisconsin defense that allowed only 10 points and 270 yards a game.
The Badgers (10-1) have also been maligned for playing a soft
schedule that did not include Ohio State or Michigan, but also
posted two shutouts and gave up seven points or fewer in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to come out and pull any magic tricks or
bunnies out of the hat,'' said Badger end Tom Burke, who leads the
nation in sacks with 21. ``We are just going to come out and play
fundamentally strong, as we have all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest of the opening acts are Notre Dame (9-2)
against Georgia Tech (9-2) in the Gator Bowl, and Penn State (8-3)
and Kentucky (7-4) in the Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Irish quarterback Jarious Jackson says he is fully recovered
from a knee injury that kept him out of Notre Dame's final game
against Southern California and five weeks of workouts. ``I'll do
whatever they call; whatever they call, I'm going to run,'' he
said, though it was unclear if he would start or how much he would
play. ``I'm just looking forward to playing the game. If I get hit,
I get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Nittany Lions, along with the rest of college football,
will see the Heisman finalist Tim Couch for perhaps the final time.
The junior will probably declare for the National Football League
draft and may be its No. 1 choice _ the expansion Cleveland Browns
hold it and are interested in the record-breaking passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think everyone's excited about us,'' Couch said of the
large Kentucky contingent that has descended on the Tampa-St.
Petersburg, Fla., area. ``Usually everyone's wrapped up in
basketball in Kentucky this time of year.''

BRAZIL SLASHES MONEY FOR PROJECT AIMED AT PROTECTING AMAZON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Under intense pressure to reduce its
spending, the Brazilian government has slashed funds toward a $250
million pilot project backed by seven leading industrial nations
that has been the centerpiece of Brazil's efforts to save the
Amazon rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists warn that without Brazil's participation, the
project stands to lose almost all the donations yet to come from
the Group of Seven industrial nations. Under the main agreement,
approved at the 1992 Earth Summit here, Brazil was to provide just
10 percent of the $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program pays for surveying the rain forest, and it has
been the principal vehicle for marking off 40,000 square miles for
indigenous reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying what is in the vast mysterious rain forest is seen as
the first step toward protecting it from destruction by ranchers,
loggers, farmers and miners.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to rein in its budget deficit, Brazilian
government officials have slashed spending across the board. A
recent agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which is
spearheading a $41.3 billion standby loan for Brazil, reduces
government spending on environmental programs by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pilot program, the Brazilian government provides
matching funds and manpower to administer the Group of Seven grant.
The government's revised budget, released in November, cuts the
amount Brazil can expect to get from the group to $6.4 million from
more than $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is arguably a far more irrational and perverse consequence
of the IMF agreement than even the harshest critics of the IMF
could have imagined,'' said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist
at the Washington-based Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Covering an area half as big as the continental United States,
the Amazon is a lush laboratory of plants, animals and bacteria
that contains more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water
supply.

RECENT BUS CRASHES CANNOT DETER THESE CASINO DAY-TRIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Md.))  (mk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ They are as different as the games they
play.
</P>
<P>
   They sit side by side on the motor coach rumbling down the
Garden State Parkway, the 75-year-old widower who travels here to
shoot craps all night, up to five times a week, and the 53-year-old
woman with a Jamaican accent who dabbles in slots a few times a
year on days off from her job sorting medical records at a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There is Molly Kessert, 72, who likes to view her weekly trips
to the jacks-or-better video poker machines as sport rather than
addiction. And Annette Topolanski, 52, who plays pai gow poker
because it's slow, taking all afternoon to drain her pockets.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Nick. He is on the bus four times a week from
his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to the poker room at the Taj
Mahal, which feels like a private club as Scott, the dealer, shakes
his hand, and Larry, the waiter, slaps his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play, win or lose,'' said Nick, a 59-year-old
divorced man on disability who spoke on the condition that his last
name not be used. ``It doesn't make any difference. The reason is
to kill time.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the day-trippers, lured by freebies and shuttled en
masse down the asphalt ribbons of New Jersey's highways, where
three similar buses filled with similar people crashed in separate
accidents over the last week, killing eight and injuring dozens
more. All three crashes are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Some driven by addiction, others by boredom, one in three
visitors to Atlantic City arrives this way, with an average of
1,114 buses pouring into the resort daily, ferrying a total of
9,492,238 passengers through November 1998. Most are ``line
buses,'' like this one, which snakes through immigrant
neighborhoods in Brooklyn, picking up people like Nick at bagel
joints, smoke shops and candy stores before the morning commute and
dropping them off way after dark.
</P>
<P>
   With a scarce local population nearby but the big cities of New
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington all a day-trip away,
Atlantic City relies more on the bus business than any other casino
market. At the Taj, the stable of bus bays looks like the Port
Authority terminal in Manhattan as the coaches line up nose to nose
and a ``greeter'' from the casino hops aboard to give each
passenger coupons, chips or coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mainstay, it's the basic market, it's America,'' said
William Thompson, an economics professor who studies gambling at
the University of Nevada. ``Some of them become addicted, but I
think they become addicted more to the bus ride and the
socialization. It beats sitting at home and watching `Oprah.'''
</P>
<P>
   The casino-bus concept dates to 1957, when William Harrah
arranged charters to Reno from 31 cities in California and Nevada.
But it has been perfected in Atlantic City, where gambling was
legalized in 1978 and casinos compete fiercely for the bus market,
offering passengers free food, free taffy, even free money to get
them to stop at their door first.
</P>
<P>
   Nosher, a grimy convenience store at the corner of 82nd Street
and Flatlands Avenue in Brooklyn, offers tickets for at least a
dozen different buses a day. On SGS Tours Bus No. 853 on Wednesday,
riders paid $22 round trip and could choose between getting off at
the Sands, where they received $20, and the Taj Mahal, where they
got $17. (Sometimes people take the $20 from the Sands and walk the
seven blocks to the fancier Taj.) The drive each way, including
half a dozen stops for pickups and drop-offs, took about three and
a half hours; players got seven hours in the casino.
</P>
<P>
   With tolls and gasoline, it is cheaper to ride the bus from New
York to Atlantic City than to drive. Consider cataracts, which
inhibit night driving, and speeding tickets, and the bus sounds
convenient to would-be gamblers, especially the older ones. They
even show movies on board. (On Wednesday, it was Ricki Lake in
``Mrs. Winterbourne'' on the way down and Robin Williams in ``The
Birdcage'' for the trip home.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive, but I have a little heart condition, so I
don't put stress on myself,'' said Sam Denino, who makes the trip
about twice a month with his wife of 47 years, Millie. ``You're at
an age, you're over 60, you've got to get out of the house. You
need a diversion. I can only garden so much. I can only fix the
house so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elderly retirees fill most of the seats on the Atlantic City
buses. At 2 p.m. at the Taj, there is a line of older women waiting
at the water fountain to take their pills.
</P>
<P>
   For lonely widows, the trips provide a much-needed day out,
often including a walk in the fresh air of the Boardwalk. But what
starts as an innocent hobby can easily become an addictive,
savings-draining habit.
</P>
<P>
   The crapshooter on Bus 853 spoke only on the condition that he
not be named, and the embarrassment is not surprising. The
75-year-old widower started playing dice when Las Vegas first
opened in the 1940s, once came home with $15,000 in his pocket and
gifts for everybody. On Wednesday, he was up $1,000 at one point,
but went home $1,100 in the hole. He goes to Atlantic City a couple
of times a month with the ``kids'' _ he has four children, 10
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren _ or his buddies from the
Knights of Columbus. In between, he goes alone, on the bus,
sometimes every single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trouble is I don't get up and walk away,'' he admitted. ``I
used to go to shows. I used to sleep overnight. Now, I get a room _
I don't sleep anyway. I'm downstairs playing while everyone else is
up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kessert is much more upbeat about the situation, but she
knows that she, too, may have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning on the ride down, she talks of video poker as
therapy _ stimulating, a little like playing bridge as you decide
what to keep and what to toss. In the casino, as she pumps the
quarters into the machine and punches the bright red ``payout''
button with gusto every time she gets two pairs, Mrs. Kessert is
resigned to the monotony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you have to get up,'' she said as five hopelessly
unmatched cards flashed onto the video screen. Then, three kings!
Fifteen quarters jangled out. ``Sometimes,'' she added, ``it
doesn't pay to get up.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a meal of Maryland crab cakes, a baked potato and
soup, complimentary because of her volume of play, Mrs. Kessert
makes her way back to the bus, her bag $250 lighter, her smile only
slightly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come every week,'' she sighed. ``Maybe I'll take
intermission one week. I think I am addicted. If I don't go that
week, I don't feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every Molly Kessert there is a Jim Lunenfeld, who talks
more of the buffet at the Sands, where he can pile Peking duck,
orecchiette and mac-and-cheese on the same plate, than of the
gaming tables.
</P>
<P>
   Lunenfeld, a teacher who visits the homes of emotionally and
physically troubled students, is here with his 21-year-old son,
Joel. They ate at the Sands, took a long walk on the Boardwalk, and
each dropped $20 on the slots. Lunenfeld's friend, Peter Cruciata,
also a teacher, lost $40 during about four hours playing poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-day vacation, the cheapest one-day vacation you can
have,'' said Cruciata, who learned to play poker in his native
Italy at age 5, using buttons instead of chips. ``Most of all, I
play for fun. I don't bet my paycheck. I'm able to be objective:
OK, I'm down $50, kiss goodbye to the machine, kiss goodbye to the
table. We don't have to lose it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Two sisters, Sylvia Anderson, 43, and Faye Glynn, 48, left their
husbands at home and took the bus to Atlantic City for an overnight
getaway. They played cards with each other in the hotel room, but,
in the casino, dared only the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice little time for me to relax,'' Mrs. Anderson,
who is a secretary for a dean at Brooklyn College, explained on the
way home. ``It's hectic at school. When I go home, it's hectic. I
need to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win money,'' she said, ``then you really relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Bus 853 was eerily empty Wednesday, with just a dozen of the 57
seats filled on the way to Atlantic City and four more on the way
back to Brooklyn. Passengers and the veteran driver, Milton Hobbs,
and company representatives figured it was partly because of the
coming New Year's Eve holiday, a big night in casinos everywhere,
and partly because of the grim weather forecast. But they knew,
also, that the news of the accidents had most likely kept many
away.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly crash happened on Christmas Eve, when a bus run by
the same company, SGS Tours, spun out of control and tumbled down
an embankment, throwing passengers through the window. The driver
has told police that he swerved to avoid an icy patch, and
investigators are also looking into mechanical problems with the
bus and whether the driver was speeding.
</P>
<P>
   The other two accidents came as a frightening coincidence, but
were much less severe. A busload of 30 people from Chinatown on
their way home from a concert by a Hong Kong entertainer ran into a
tree last Sunday morning; the next day, a bus carrying 27 people to
the casinos crashed into a bridge abutment off the Garden State
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``God should watch us,'' Mrs. Kessert said, to nobody in
particular, as she got on the bus at about 8 Wednesday morning at a
Manhattan Bagel in Canarsie, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   As they cruised home, Denino pointed out the exit where the bus
in the fatal crash went down a week before. Hobbs, the driver _ who
has been ferrying busloads to Atlantic City since the casinos
opened two decades ago _ made an announcement over the public
address system wishing the injured, and the relatives of the dead,
a peaceful New Year in their time of sadness.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness, the strangers sat side by side, nodding
agreement and offering condolences. Then, impromptu, they fell
silent for a moment.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the biggest, loudest crowd in years herded
neatly into barricaded quadrangles, New Year's Eve descended on
Times Square on Thursday night in a carefully controlled explosion
of festivity that felt like both a gala and a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   An expected crowd of half a million, held in check by more than
5,000 police officers, gathered in midtown to watch the big
aluminum ball make its final trip down the big aluminum pole. The
ball will be replaced by a fancier crystal creation at next year's
millennial extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   There were, as there have been every Dec. 31 for decades, the
crowds of tourists seemingly inured against the cold by the dazzle
and the glitter, and the local folks drawn by the spectacle or
unable to afford the high cover charges of the nightclubs. But
there were also many merely caught in the chaos, struggling to get
to restaurants and theaters as police officers checked ticket stubs
and reservation letters, looking liked armed ushers and maitres
d'hotel.
</P>
<P>
   If it was easier for the average reveler to see and hear what
was going on this year than in recent years, it was only because of
the new video screens and speakers installed as far as eight blocks
away from the puppet shows and fireworks at the heart of the
action. Some people said they had come this year because they did
not stand a chance of getting a front-row seat for New Year's Eve
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year it's going to be really insane, so we thought we'd
come this year,'' said Joshua Fifer, 18, an Americorps volunteer
who made the trip from Washington with his girlfriend and staked
out a spot on Broadway at 44th Street at 3 p.m. ``Next year, it's
going to be a tough choice. We're worried about the terrorism. But
I'll probably be stupid enough to come.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those unable to get to the center of the action _
probably a vast majority this year _ the show of police force was
as impressive as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get through because of the barriers, but I'm very
impressed with the police,'' said Gaudin Wilfrid, a school bus
driver in his 20s from Nantes, France, on vacation with his
girlfriend. ``I've only seen this many at a student strike in
Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Times Square had actually been drawn there by the
promise of a display of state-of-the-art crowd control, like Damien
Villa, a 15-year-old who said he plans to go into law enforcement
and drove with his father from Gaffney, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said: `He's only 15; do you want to take him out in an
environment like that?''' the boy's father, Jerry Villa, said. ``I
said: `Look, he's had two years of karate, he's interested in
criminal law, maybe in becoming a police officer and then a lawyer.
This would be a good place to see how they do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Damien was asking one officer how he kept his cool in the
midst of chaos, the officer demonstrated by politely defusing a
woman who likened the police to Nazis. ``His response was great,''
Villa said. ``He said, `Thank you, I appreciate it, happy New
Year.' And she went off even more, but he didn't lose it for a
minute.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When disorder broke out, it was quickly quelled. About 7:30
p.m., two vendors illegally selling party favors and plastic hats
had a confrontation at 45th Street and Eighth Avenue. Three seconds
after shouts of ``Yo! yo! yo!'' flew back and forth, four helmeted
police officers at the barricades nearby converged and broke things
up.
</P>
<P>
   Even most people who were inconvenienced took the gantlet in
stride _ though striding was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to crawl under a couple of barricades,'' said Irv
Birnbaum, 47, a medical technician from Baltimore who had come to
see the musical ``Chicago'' at the Shubert Theater on 44th Street.
``We got dirty. My wife is recovering from knee surgery; we knew it
would be bad. But the police were polite. We knew it would be
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people did not think it would be so bad. Maryanne and
George Klein and their daughter Alexis, former New Yorkers
transplanted to Greenville, N.C., had tickets to ``Phantom of the
Opera,'' and they had to pick them up at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked our way across 44th Street, but at each block we had
to explain where we were going,'' said an exasperated Mrs. Klein.
``We were frustrated. We just didn't expect this to be that much of
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were already in the neighborhood, they said
they had no plans to stick around after the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough Times Square already,'' she said. ``This is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience and we're not going to do it next
year.''

ANNUAL GAY FUND-RAISING PARTY IS DISCONTINUED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing a growing chorus of concern about drug use and unsafe sex
at the event, organizers of a hugely popular annual gay party on
Fire Island that raises money to fight AIDS announced Thursday that
they were abandoning the event.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade and a half, the gathering, known as the
Morning Party, has been a poignant remembrance of those who have
died of AIDS as well as an important fund-raiser for its sponsor,
Gay Men's Health Crisis. But recently, the Morning Party, a swank
social event held in the summer, has become something else: a cause
for anger between GMHC, perhaps the nation's leading AIDS service
organization, and some gay critics who say the party has veered out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   The event had also lent cachet in recent years to a growing
number of similar parties around the nation, known as ``circuit
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Gay Men's Health Crisis said it was
canceling this year's party because ``regrettably, over the past
few years the Morning Party has become associated with alarming
levels of recreational drug use, despite GMHC's many attempts to
discourage drug-taking at the event.''
</P>
<P>
   At last year's party, a man from Bronxville, N.Y., overdosed and
died in the predawn hours before the party officially began. In
1996, a man was evacuated by helicopter after falling into a
drug-related coma. Dozens of police officers were brought to the
party after those incidents, prompting some in attendance to say
that the event resembled a police state.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wojcak, a former producer of the Morning Party, said that
members of the charity's organizing committee met on Dec. 2. ``In
previous years, the attitude was, why not hold the Morning Party?''
said Wojcak, a member of the committee. ``This year, the attitude
was enough was enough. How long do we have to take this bad
press?''
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation poses a critical problem in fund-raising for
GMHC, even as contributions from other sources have fallen sharply
_ apparently because the success of new drugs in controlling AIDS
has led some donors to see the issue as less urgent. The Morning
Party is the charity's second-largest fund-raiser after its AIDS
Walk, which raises $4.5 million. In 1998, the Morning Party drew
4,500 people and raised about $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo Signorile, author of ``Life Outside''
(HarperCollins, 1997), a book critical of the circuit party
phenomenon, said that because of the cancellation of the Morning
Party, ``it will become more difficult for other groups _ in Miami,
in Chicago, in Los Angeles _ to continue to host these circuit
parties now that GMHC, the leading sponsor, has pulled away,
because these groups around the country are also receiving this
kind of pressure from within the gay community.''
</P>
<P>
   Others doubted that the charity's action would slow the
expansion of circuit parties, which can raise hundreds of thousand
of dollars a night and whose tickets can cost $100 or more. Alan
Brown, developer of a Web site called Electric Dreams, which
reports on the circuit party scene, said: ``I don't see it having
any effect. It's just a symbol. But now the critics, like
Michelangelo Signorile, have consumed their sacrificial lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gay Men's Health Crisis raised more than $31 million,
but in 1998 it raised less than $23 million, according to a senior
official at the charity who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
official said GMHC was considering a variety of smaller
fund-raising parties, probably on Fire Island, but no firm plans
had been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Morning Party has been held on Fire Island beaches for 16
years, usually in August, in cooperation with a federal park
agency, the Fire Island National Seashore. Officials of the agency
could not be reached for comment, but some doubted whether a
for-profit gay organization, indeed any gay group other than GMHC,
could hold a similar social event.
</P>
<P>
   ``GMHC has such a good working relationship with the parks
people that I don't see that happening,'' said Duncan Osborne, a
contributing editor of LGNY, a Manhattan gay publication, who has
written about the Morning Party and the circuit party scene.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Grossman, a physician who organizes the medical tent for
the party, said the Morning Party would be impossible to replace.
``It raised a lot of money and costs almost nothing to run,'' he
said. ``It raised something like 90 cents on the dollar, which is
unheard of.'' Minimum ticket prices for the party were raised in
1998 to $100 from $75, but some contributors pay as much as $10,000
a ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to figure out some way of raising funds from the
Fire Island community _ some of the richest gays in the city _ and
right now I don't see how,'' Grossman said.

 ISLANDER'S ZDENO CHARA, A TALL DRINK ON ICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Zdeno Chara is constantly asked if he is a basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is understandable. At 6 feet 9 inches and 255
pounds, Chara looks like he would be a better fit on a basketball
court, not in a hockey rink. So in a soft voice he answers, ``No,
I'm a hockey player for the Islanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chara had opportunities to play basketball in his native
Slovakia, but turned them down so that he could follow his first
love: hockey. As a rookie with the Islanders last season, he became
the tallest player in National Hockey League history, appearing in
the season's final 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   Chara's size, nearly 7-feet tall on skates, turns heads. But
size no longer defines his game. In his second season with the
Islanders, and at age 21, Chara is establishing himself as one the
team's best blueliners and as one of the league's most feared
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After starting this season in the minors, Chara returned in late
November and stunned his coaches with the extent of his
improvement. A heavyweight who dominates the defensive zone, he has
learned to mix thumping body checks and gloves-off toughness with
smart defensive positioning and a nimble skating style that belies
his size. These were technical skills he was lacking when the team
demoted him in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put too much pressure on myself,'' said Chara, who signed a
three-year contract with the Islanders last season. ``I was
thinking about making the NH. and was too worried about everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just mentally I wasn't ready, but physically I was in my best
shape ever. It was a game in my head. I was thinking, thinking,
thinking. I was thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minors, where he played for the Lowell Lock Monsters of
the American Hockey League, the left-handed shooting Chara received
the tutoring and the ice time _ about 30 minutes a game _ that he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' coaching staff recognized Chara's progress after
a couple of months, and the team recalled him when Kenny Jonsson
and Rich Pilon went down with injuries. The result was a more
confident, polished player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, no one is glad they are sent down.'' Chara said
recently. ``But it was good for me. I got my confidence back and I
felt really, really good. Now, I'm trying to play like I did in
Lowell, play good defense and not try to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Chara has three assists in 13 games this season and is not
counted on for scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, said
that no matter how much Chara improves, he will never be a truly
great skater because of his size. But his off-ice work ethic has
endeared him to the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Chara is among the team's most dedicated workers in the weight
room. He has added 15 pounds to his gangly frame. Footwork drills
have dramatically improved his skating and agility. In fact, Chara
trained so hard and so often coaches ordered him to slow down, to
take more time to recover from the workouts.
</P>
<P>
   He says that his father, Zdenek Chara, a Czechoslovakian
wrestler who competed in the 1976 Olympic games, taught him to work
hard and persevere, whether on the ice or at the car wash in Prince
George, B.C. where Chara worked two years ago while playing in the
Western Hockey League for juniors. He said his boss was happy to
finally find someone who could dry the tops of vans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me what to do, how to do it and how to do it
better,'' Chara said of his father, who still competes
professionally in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Chara spends a lot of time with Ziggy Palffy, a Slovak, and
Robert Reichl, a Czech, because they can speak the same language,
although he has improved his English by reading books and watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, Chara's strength in the corners and his
board-rattling checks intimidate opposing players. But off of the
ice he dedicates hours of his time to working in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he was in the Islanders' front office on personal
business when he saw interns stuffing envelopes addressed to season
ticket-holders. He pulled up a chair and began folding, and
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the side he chooses to show opposing players. Chara
has learned to better pick his spots, though, when it comes to
fighting. But as he showed earlier this week at Florida, where he
took on the Panthers' enforcer Peter Worrell, he does not hesitate
when it is time to get nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to run him and see what happens,'' said Islander
defenseman Scott Lachance, who is one of several partners Chara has
been paired with this season. ``But most of the guys end up on the
ice because he's tall, but he's strong. Once people try to test him
they realize that he's solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chara's improved game has his coaches raving about him, and has
other team's general managers coveting him.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury projected him as a solid fifth or sixth defenseman, but
now, the coach believes he could crack the top four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a week goes by that a team doesn't inquire about
him,'' Milbury said. ``I have no intention of moving him. It's
known now; there's no point in calling.''

NBA PLAYERS MAKE CONCESSIONS IN A FINAL PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a week before National Basketball Association owners
convene to vote on whether to cancel the season, the players' union
Thursday prepared a final proposal that included a major
concession: putting a cap on players' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said that
compromise _ and several others _ should persuade commissioner
David Stern and the owners to renew talks before the league's Jan.
7 deadline for scrapping the season.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout is in its 185th day. Even if an agreement were
reached right now, the earliest the season could begin would be the
last week of January, which would allow a maximum of 45-50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, David and I are both in deep water right now,''
Hunter said Thursday night. ``The players have lost over $400
million in salaries, and the league is looking at even more
financial ruin. It can't be about David Stern saving face right
now. It has to be win, win for both of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he and I are going to get back to shore, we're going to
have to bail each other out. Because I'll tell you right now: He
ain't going back without me.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, Hunter said, have proposed a $15 million cap for
high-salaried players with more than 10 years experience. The union
had proposed to cap players' salaries with fewer than than 10 years
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hunter said, the union has lowered its revenue percentages
in the final three years of any new deal, to 55 percent for the
2001-2 season. The NBA's offer is at 53 percent for that season.
Each percentage point represents $20 million, meaning they are $40
million apart on dividing about $2 billion a season in total
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Hunter said, a backup tax on the escrow package that would
be installed over the last three years of the six-year proposal has
been accepted by the players.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter added that the proposal does not contain a change in the
rookie wage scale. The players are still united in the notion of
unlimited free agency after four years for a player, while the
league has said it wants teams to have the fifth year at an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relief we have given them is the relief they wanted on the
high-end players,'' Hunter said Thursday night. ``We're less than
$3 million apart on that issue and between $500,000 and $1 million
on several other issues. You're going to tell me they're going to
blow up the season with this much on the table?''
</P>
<P>
   In their final offer last Wednesday, the owners proposed that no
player could earn more than $12.25 million in the first year of a
new deal.
</P>
<P>
   The league's office had not seen a copy of the players'
proposal. In another legal skirmish, lawyers on each side could not
agree on how the proposal would be exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kessler, chief outside counsel for the union, called
Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer, to request a
meeting at which the proposal would be presented. After Mishkin
informed him that he would forward the proposal to the league's
labor relations committee and that the owners would not agree to a
meeting until they have viewed the proposal, Kessler called back to
inform Mishkin he would not be forwarding the proposal, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me no one in the NBA may meet with us to receive the
proposal and discuss it,'' Kessler said. ``We have to submit it in
writing, they have to evaluate the proposal. If they thought it was
good enough and it met their standards to have a meeting, they
might meet with us. That's not how two sides who respect each other
bargain. It's too late for parlor games. It's time to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishkin replied: ``He's overlooking the critical point. We made
our final offer. They rejected it. Out of courtesy and respect, we
will submit their final proposal. This isn't about playing games.
We have a serious economic difference and this is no way to go
about solving it. We're too far along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal we have put out is not perfect for the players,
but it's a compromise we're willing to make to reach a deal,''
Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides last met last Sunday in Denver. Stern is due back
in New York on Sunday while Hunter, who is spending New Year's in
Philadelphia with family, is scheduled to return Saturday. Neither
the league nor the union predicted a weekend meeting.

<P>
   Scarcely a year to go, and still no one can be confident that
the stroke of midnight next Dec. 31 will not release a plague of
little green bugs to usher in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to
stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine
and vindaloo curry, the national dish.
</P>
<P>
   Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as
power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along
with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the
numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth
living (all those computer games of Christmas past).
</P>
<P>
   Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons
will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues,
stock markets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced
recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way.
A working-group of ``informatics'' experts, known as Y2K chiefs,
has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have
been instructed to ``address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics
experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock
ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the people who really get things done _ ``the trumpets
which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire...the
unacknowledged legislators of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to
make the world safe for computerized civilization as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock.
</P>
<P>
   Smart alecks have come up with their silly ideas, such as
telling your computer or microchip that 2000 is really 1972, the
most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the
problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be to say, ``All right, computers, listen
up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was
actually born around 6 B.C., so we've really passed the dreaded
2000 mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his
trick, which was to skip the ten days after Oct. 4, 1582 in order
to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty:
why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about
the date than to being told the truth?
</P>
<P>
   So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the
world, and, of course, to those they write about:
</P>
<P>
   Your face would stop a clock,
</P>
<P>
   For it's so passing fair
</P>
<P>
   That time itself would like to stop
</P>
<P>
   And linger there.
</P>
<P>
   Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution
to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the
world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many
respects people are really getting ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be
quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to
arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12
months (no little green gremlins need apply). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scarcely a year to go, and still no one can be confident that
the stroke of midnight next Dec. 31 will not release a plague of
little green bugs to usher in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Panic is rising. Every household in Britain has been told to
stock up with two weeks' supplies, presumably of spam, margarine
and vindaloo curry, the national dish.
</P>
<P>
   Some people foresee the lights going out all over the world, as
power stations crash. Others say aircraft will go demented, along
with cars, trains, traffic lights, hospital equipment and the
numberless other bits of high-techery that make modern life worth
living (all those computer games of Christmas past).
</P>
<P>
   Launch-on-warning missiles will be released, nuclear weapons
will start spontaneously to fizz and, if any life at all continues,
stock markets will go into sullen decline, as a bug-induced
recession of apocalyptic proportions takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the bugs are not going to have it all their own way.
A working-group of ``informatics'' experts, known as Y2K chiefs,
has just been convened at the United Nations in New York. They have
been instructed to ``address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Reassured? Of course not. It is nerds and geeks and informatics
experts who got us into this fix in the first place. With the clock
ticking, it is no good looking to them to get us out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the people who really get things done _ ``the trumpets
which sing to battle and feel not what they inspire...the
unacknowledged legislators of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Shelley's poets are now the only ones likely to be able to
make the world safe for computerized civilization as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   And how? Well, by stopping the ticking of the damned clock.
</P>
<P>
   Smart alecks have come up with their silly ideas, such as
telling your computer or microchip that 2000 is really 1972, the
most recent year to have matching dates and days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   If it worked, that would buy 28 years in which to solve the
problem, or at least address the difficulties, and facilitate a
useful exchange of experiences.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be to say, ``All right, computers, listen
up: the calendar has been wrong from the start. Jesus Christ was
actually born around 6 B.C., so we've really passed the dreaded
2000 mark and you didn't even notice. It wasn't so bad after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could do a Pope Gregory, or at least a variation of his
trick, which was to skip the ten days after Oct. 4, 1582 in order
to tidy up the Julian calendar, which had been losing a day a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go forward or back, you meet this difficulty:
why should computers respond any more readily to being fooled about
the date than to being told the truth?
</P>
<P>
   So over to the poets, those unacknowledged legislators of the
world, and, of course, to those they write about:
</P>
<P>
   Your face would stop a clock,
</P>
<P>
   For it's so passing fair
</P>
<P>
   That time itself would like to stop
</P>
<P>
   And linger there.
</P>
<P>
   Forget other proposals, the stopped clock is the only solution
to the millennium-bug problem. A pause will do everybody good: the
world has been in a dreadful rush for far too long, and in many
respects people are really getting ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Properly equipped, the poets can avert something that might be
quite unpleasant. Only one thing is missing: the face they need to
arrest the ticking. Let the search begin. The world has just 12
months (no little green gremlins need apply). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   With every day that passes, matters get worse. The country is
drifting along in a state of neglect. Legislative programs are
unheard of. Reformist debate has stopped. The political atmosphere
is as poisonous as it has been since the 1960s. Iraq is bombed, and
half of America _ as well as much of the world _ wonders at the
president's motives.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia collapses, when markets stumble, when China gets
aggressive, when the next terrorist atrocity occurs, the world
still hopes America will take the lead. But how can it, when Bill
Clinton is about to go on trial before the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants this horror _ and horror is not too strong a word
_ to end. Had Clinton resigned in August, when he was forced to
admit that he had lied to his family, his colleagues and the
American people, he could have finished it there.
</P>
<P>
   He could still do so; and would do so, if he were capable of
shame or had any sense of honor. But Clinton is even less inclined
to resign today than he was before his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to impeach was so partisan that it has rallied even
wavering Democrats behind him, and has hitched the polls a few
points higher in his favor. Where even the intimation of
impeachment shattered Nixon, it has strengthened Bill Clinton. He
will cling on to the last.
</P>
<P>
   How then can the paralysis be broken? At this point, only in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The first would be a quick trial in the Senate, which would
probably end in acquittal but would not rule out criminal
proceedings once Clinton had left office.
</P>
<P>
   The second would be a motion of censure: constitutionally
doubtful, but not objectionable, as long as it did not include
immunity from future prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are vital here. The first is speed, to get America
back to work. But more important is the second: that the president
should be made to face the consequences of his perjury before the
grand jury. He must be made to feel the weight of the damage he has
done.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, blame for the damage should also be laid at other
doors. America has been so convulsed by this scandal, and the
public so revolted, because the process of bringing Clinton to book
has been tainted at every stage.
</P>
<P>
   The president was dogged by an independent counsel whose powers
were excessive and whose tactics were sometimes suspect. The
Supreme Court caused much of the paralysis by ruling that the Paula
Jones suit against a sitting president should proceed. That suit
itself was encouraged by the president's political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The press _ including The Economist _ leapt into the Monica
story with both feet. As a result, although the machinery of
impeachment was gleefully cranked up, it soon felt wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of shame and sadness that now engulfs many thoughtful
Americans comes not so much from sympathy for this president _
whose lying defiance deserves none _ as from worry at the
precedents that have been set for political vendettas against
elected presidents in future.
</P>
<P>
   As the new year dawns, there is some hope that the damage done
will not be lasting. In the Senate, at least, there is a desperate
urge for civility to undo the grandstanding rudeness shown by
Republicans in the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate performs its duties with dispatch, and above all
with bipartisanship, some of the wounds may start to heal; though
it may take months, and even a trouncing in next year's elections,
before the Republican zealots in Congress start to grasp the havoc
they have caused.
</P>
<P>
   On a point of detail (though a large one) Congress should
review, and consider abolishing in its present form, the office of
the independent counsel when the statute comes up for renewal this
year.
</P>
<P>
   At present, an attorney-general has little choice but to appoint
such a counsel when there seems to be evidence of executive-branch
wrongdoing. But his brief is open-ended, his funding and his
subpoena powers almost limitless.
</P>
<P>
   The present statute, a reaction against the powerless
prosecutors of the Watergate era, did not envisage a Ken Starr
figure let loose on the White House. The office has diminished the
importance of Congress (as was seen most clearly in Watergate) in
checking the excesses of the president and his men.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, too, has not emerged without bruising. As
soon as a pretext arises (though America might well hope one would
not arise soon), the court should revisit its ruling that sitting
presidents are liable to prosecution in civil suits.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, like the House Republicans in turn, have sometimes
seemed blustered into hard-line positions by their distaste for the
president's stonewalling. If calmer tempers can prevail, the three
main branches of government may be able to deal with each other
reasonably again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that may take years. Although every arm of government, not
merely the president, has behaved in ways they are now beginning to
regret, dangerous precedents have been set.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is a weakened and unattractive office,
impeachment has become a purely partisan instrument, and marginal
groups in Congress will now feel they have the power to overturn
the mandate of the people.
</P>
<P>
   It is high time everyone drew back, reviewed the damage, and
began to restore some of the rules and conventions that have kept
America free of such traumas in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But the first essential is the brisk, fair and appropriate
punishment of the man who, many months ago, might have spared his
country all this agony by behaving as an honorable president really
should. &QL;

<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, CALIF. - In a sealed room in sprawling Camp
Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is
mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   A CD-ROM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises
in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant
orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire
to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Pendleton program is one example of how America is
changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can
handle a post-Cold-War world in which charging tank divisions are
less common than the chaos of ``low-intensity conflicts,'' the
jargon for peacemaking and peace-enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, the decisions taken by a 19-year-old
crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16
rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for
the foreign policy of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its
larger cousins of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, is helping
to shape these new training techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM
simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of
12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority
previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things the Marines learn, such as how to stay under
cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the
counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight
from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section
leaders seem to relish it.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the new training system is to enable American
soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ``three-block war.'' The
phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be
distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of
a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and
fighting guerrillas in a third.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in
Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue
operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners,
especially the ``Ranger ambush'' in which a combined force of
Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for
18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Marines were not involved in that debacle, it is
with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting
new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class
leadership of small units.
</P>
<P>
   The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military
instruments, such as the ``non-lethal munitions'' that will help to
give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an
adversary than just trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers,
the arsenal of weapons on show included beanbag projectiles fired
from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from
devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights
that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which
explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or
goo up a suspected guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the
Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner
weapons than these.
</P>
<P>
   In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers
of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their
control will be able _ it is hoped _ to defeat much bigger armies
of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on
precision-aiming devices, and helped by eye-in-the-sky satellites
and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range
missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be
able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he
could, they are probably out of range.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA
will by no means be confined to beanbags and gluey foam.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the
point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for
firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the
old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder,
gentler Marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of the RMA are determined to make sure that
America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not
only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills
needed to use these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy
or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will?
Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RMA, America and
its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be
fired with equal accuracy from still farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officers, especially older ones, have their
misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to
destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number
of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers,
may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and
at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be
there, to occupy some vital hilltop or essential building, and they
will have to be prepared to take the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, your soldiers must face the risk of being wounded or
killed. Clever and brave guerrillas, fighting in places where they
are hard to detect _ forests or mountains or city side-streets _
have to be pursued by soldiers who are not only expertly trained
for such warfare but are also willing to engage the enemy at close
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Any adversary, when defeated, leaves behind a region which has
to be occupied by your own side, to make sure he does not start the
war all over again; and your occupying force is bound to suffer
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   An army that believes it can avoid standing in harm's way is,
say the skeptics, liable to prove perilously fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The coming century is going to provide plenty of crises in which
deadly force, working in both directions, cannot be avoided. &QL;

<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON, CALIF. - In a sealed room in sprawling Camp
Pendleton, a Marine Corps base in California, a young corporal is
mastering the use of the most formidable weapon in his arsenal: his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   A CD-ROM-based simulator takes him through a variety of crises
in which he must make split-second decisions and issue instant
orders to cope with anything from a sudden burst of enemy gunfire
to the approach of a band of thirsty refugees or a roving CNN crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp Pendleton program is one example of how America is
changing the way it trains its armed forces, so that they can
handle a post-Cold-War world in which charging tank divisions are
less common than the chaos of ``low-intensity conflicts,'' the
jargon for peacemaking and peace-enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, the decisions taken by a 19-year-old
crouching behind a bush with his finger on the trigger of an M-16
rifle or a laser-aimed missile can have enormous consequences for
the foreign policy of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, smaller in size and less bureaucratic than its
larger cousins of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, is helping
to shape these new training techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day, still-experimental course, of which the CD-ROM
simulator is one component, aims to give the young leaders of
12-man sections the decision-making skills and killing authority
previously reserved for company or even battalion commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things the Marines learn, such as how to stay under
cover, are standard military fare. Others, including the
counselling skills taught by psychologists, seem to come straight
from the world of New Age management gurus; but the young section
leaders seem to relish it.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the new training system is to enable American
soldiers of the 21st century to handle the ``three-block war.'' The
phrase describes an operation in which they would simultaneously be
distributing food and medicine to frantic civilians in one part of
a city, quelling rioters and maintaining order in another, and
fighting guerrillas in a third.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have already seen variations of the three-block war in
Haiti, Somalia and Bosnia. Memories of the ill-fated rescue
operation in Somalia in 1993 still haunt the military planners,
especially the ``Ranger ambush'' in which a combined force of
Rangers and Delta Force commandos was trapped by Somali gunmen for
18 hours; 18 men were killed and 73 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Marines were not involved in that debacle, it is
with an eye on the lessons of Somalia that the corps is now putting
new emphasis on urban-warfare tactics and the need for first-class
leadership of small units.
</P>
<P>
   The new training goes hand-in-hand with the use of new military
instruments, such as the ``non-lethal munitions'' that will help to
give American troops a wider range of options when dealing with an
adversary than just trying to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   At one demonstration held for Camp Pendleton's senior officers,
the arsenal of weapons on show included beanbag projectiles fired
from shotguns and grenade-launchers, blinding pepper sprayed from
devices the size of fire-extinguishers, ultra-powerful flashlights
that can find and dazzle potential snipers, and grenades which
explode into a mess of adhesive foam that can block a doorway or
goo up a suspected guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   But what Americans peering into the future of warfare call the
Revolution in Military Affairs, the RMA, also employs sterner
weapons than these.
</P>
<P>
   In future wars of the Bosnia sort, for instance, small numbers
of highly trained men with sophisticated weapons under their
control will be able _ it is hoped _ to defeat much bigger armies
of the conventional sort with little or no loss to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden on a hillside miles from the enemy, their fingers on
precision-aiming devices, and helped by eye-in-the-sky satellites
and reconnaissance aircraft, they will be able to steer long-range
missiles on to the enemy's tanks or guns; and the enemy will not be
able to fire back, because he cannot see them and, even if he
could, they are probably out of range.
</P>
<P>
   In such a fight, the weapons used by the warriors of the RMA
will by no means be confined to beanbags and gluey foam.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the equipment on display in Camp Pendleton makes the
point. Most of them have two barrels and two triggers: one for
firing non-lethal projectiles, the other for delivering the
old-fashioned, deadly kind. A switch of the trigger and the kinder,
gentler Marines of the 21st century instantly become lethal.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of the RMA are determined to make sure that
America and its allies remain ahead of the rest of the world not
only in the military technology they possess but also in the skills
needed to use these weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when an adversary manages to manufacture, buy
or steal a collection of similar weapons, as he doubtless will?
Why, by then, say the confident optimists of the RMA, America and
its trusted allies will be deploying even newer devices that can be
fired with equal accuracy from still farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officers, especially older ones, have their
misgivings. They say that a system of war built upon a wish to
destroy the enemy without yourself suffering any significant number
of casualties is inherently dangerous. Remember that 1993 disaster
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   New kinds of weapons, instructed by satellites and computers,
may be able to win future firefights of this sort more swiftly and
at less cost to your own men; but the men will still need to be

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Nature abhors a vacuum. So do American entrepreneurs.
Consider a firm called Autopsy/Post Services (1-800-AUTOPSY),
founded in 1988 by Vidal Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency with which autopsies are performed in America has
been falling steadily for over three decades, and Herrera has made
his mark by leaping in to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera charges $2,000 for a complete autopsy, more if the body
has been exhumed or if extra tests are ordered. Many of his
customers suspect foul play or malpractice. Others have medical
questions that a hospital or insurance company would not pay to
have answered.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera expects to perform roughly 800 autopsies this year; he
has turned away thousands of others across the United States, and
in other countries, because he could not handle them from his Los
Angeles base.
</P>
<P>
   That problem will soon be over; in January, Autopsy/Post
Services will begin selling franchises in 72 American cities and 16
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The success of 1-800-AUTOPSY aside, public-health experts are
alarmed by the falling number of conventional autopsies. In 1960,
roughly one in two deaths in Chicago area hospitals was followed up
with an autopsy; that rate is now about one in ten. Federal data
collected since 1972 show the same trend. Indeed, experts note that
autopsy rates are falling around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies can be used to determine the effectiveness of surgical
procedures and drug treatments. They provide accurate vital
statistics, teach medical students, uncover new diseases and spot
old ones that may be spreading. All the while, they sniff out
incompetent medical care and the odd murder that might have passed
for a slip in the bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   George Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA), points out that medical conditions such as
toxic shock syndrome and congenital heart disease (as well as many
others) were discovered by autopsy. Toxic shock has now been pretty
much stamped out; congenital heart disease can be treated
successfully with surgery.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is perhaps the only way for the dead to speak to the
living. Why are Americans listening less?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is cost. An autopsy can run up a bill from several
hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the methodology.
In the days before the health-care system began slimming down, most
insurance policies covered the procedure. If not, hospitals
politely picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. As HMOs, insurance companies and hospitals struggle
to distribute scarce resources, they tend to favor the living over
the dead. (State and local governments have the right to demand an
autopsy in any case where foul play is suspected or the cause of
death is unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy, like organ donation, is a difficult subject to broach
with grieving families (though the public good associated with both
can help the grieving process).
</P>
<P>
   The attending physician is the logical person to suggest a
post-mortem exam; yet all too often a doctor's primary concern is
covering his own gluteus maximus. An autopsy may prove a doctor
wrong, or even negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors with better intentions may simply believe that more
sophisticated laboratory tests and imaging technology have made the
autopsy redundant. Alas, they have not.
</P>
<P>
   A study by researchers at Louisiana State University Medical
Center used autopsies to determine that doctors missed 44 percent
of cancerous tumors while patients were alive. Another study at the
University of Pittsburgh found a 45 percent discordance between
what clinical doctors diagnosed as the cause of death and what an
autopsy later showed it to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the JAMA ran an issue around the theme: ``Declaring war
on the non-autopsy.'' So far, it has been more of a slow retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Journal took up the torch once again. An
editorial proposed a minimum autopsy rate as a condition for
hospital accreditation and/or Medicare reimbursement. Meanwhile
Herrera, looking ahead to a bulge of dying baby-boomers, foresees
endless opportunities. &QL;

<P>
   It is easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one.
</P>
<P>
   So America and Britain discovered when they called off their
four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on Dec. 19, only to find the
Iraqis taking repeated potshots at their pilots ten days later amid
a row over the ``no-fly zones'' that cover half the country.
</P>
<P>
   So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive
American and British governments have enforced the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Has the latest
episode brought a conclusion any closer?
</P>
<P>
   The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the
work of UNSCOM, the United Nations body charged with disposing of
Iraq's deadliest weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced
that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the
bombing began, would not be allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a
significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programs. General
Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi
missile factories had been put out of operation ``for at least a
year,'' while his British counterpart proudly described the
destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and
chemical stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks,
ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might
otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as UNSCOM's
inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks,
insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had
already been emptied of men and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   One serving UNSCOM inspector questioned the usefulness of the
bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew
where to find Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the
inspectors know.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ``illegal and
senseless'' and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that
has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had
earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol).
</P>
<P>
   Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming
the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their
embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain
that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to
cooperate with the U.N. and thus be rehabilitated into the world.
</P>
<P>
   America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone
else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their
bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi
opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols
of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a
diplomatic offensive to bring the world around to their point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing.
Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can
survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97
million earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325
cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2
million).
</P>
<P>
   America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to
refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work.
Although smugglers do get around the sanctions, they do so chiefly
through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or
through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world
to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success.
Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully
for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in
history, with no hope of a reprieve. All along Hussein has tried to
protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although frustrating UNSCOM was his favorite means of attracting
attention, he is already testing new methods of challenging
America's stranglehold. The current spate of attacks on aircraft in
the no-fly zone, or his renewed threat to end the U.N.'s
humanitarian program, could both bring about a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no country has broken ranks and openly defied the
sanctions, although several _ especially the Arab states _ have
called for their lifting.
</P>
<P>
   But with UNSCOM out of action, it will become ever harder for
the Americans to argue that the unending embargo is designed to
enforce the internationally accepted aim of arms control, rather
than to serve America's and Britain's interest in keeping Hussein
(together with the unfortunate Iraqi people) contained in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has complained that Arab foreign ministers delayed a
meeting to discuss the situation at the behest of such good
American allies as Saudi Arabia. They are unlikely to delay
forever. &QL;

<P>
   It is easier to start a fight with Iraq than to end one.
</P>
<P>
   So America and Britain discovered when they called off their
four-day bombing campaign against Iraq on Dec. 19, only to find the
Iraqis taking repeated potshots at their pilots ten days later amid
a row over the ``no-fly zones'' that cover half the country.
</P>
<P>
   So, indeed, the past eight years have shown, as successive
American and British governments have enforced the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Has the latest
episode brought a conclusion any closer?
</P>
<P>
   The bombing did put an end, at least for the time being, to the
work of UNSCOM, the United Nations body charged with disposing of
Iraq's deadliest weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the American and British attack, Iraq announced
that the arms inspectors, who had fled the country hours before the
bombing began, would not be allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear, insisted American officials, their bombs had made a
significant dent in Saddam Hussein's weapons programs. General
Henry Shelton, America's top soldier, announced that nine Iraqi
missile factories had been put out of operation ``for at least a
year,'' while his British counterpart proudly described the
destruction of special aircraft designed to spray biological and
chemical stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The two powers also claimed to have blitzed barracks,
ministries, presidential palaces and various factories that might
otherwise, they said, have been put to nefarious purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iraqis are dab hands at hiding their assets, as UNSCOM's
inspectors have long complained. They shrugged off the attacks,
insisting, quite credibly, that most of the destroyed buildings had
already been emptied of men and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   One serving UNSCOM inspector questioned the usefulness of the
bombing; he might also have asked why, if America and Britain knew
where to find Hussein's secret weapons, they had not let the
inspectors know.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the world was equally unimpressed. Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin called the strikes ``illegal and
senseless'' and briefly recalled his ambassadors from America and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   France protested by pulling its aircraft out of the force that
has been patrolling the no-fly zone over southern Iraq (it had
earlier withdrawn from the northern patrol).
</P>
<P>
   Arabs took to the streets throughout the Middle East, storming
the American embassy in Damascus and demonstrating in Rabat. Their
embarrassed governments protested more mutedly, but did complain
that the bombing had undermined any hope of persuading Iraq to
cooperate with the U.N. and thus be rehabilitated into the world.
</P>
<P>
   America and Britain retort that they are as keen as everyone
else to sort out the whole mess. After they called off their
bombers, they produced a new five-point strategy for dealing with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   They will keep up their threat of force, encourage the Iraqi
opposition, try to get inspections under way again, step up patrols
of the Gulf against sanctions-busting smugglers and launch a
diplomatic offensive to bring the world around to their point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic as all this sounds, it amounts to almost nothing.
Hussein has weathered many bombings, and doubtless thinks he can
survive a few more. The Iraqi opposition is laughable, and the $97
million earmarked for it by America even more so (each of the 325
cruise missiles fired at Iraq during the bombing campaign cost $1.2
million).
</P>
<P>
   America's only plan to get the inspectors back into Iraq is to
refuse to lift sanctions until they have finished their work.
Although smugglers do get around the sanctions, they do so chiefly
through Iran and Syria, where America has little influence, or
through Turkey, where it winks at the infractions.
</P>
<P>
   And America is already trying to persuade the rest of the world
to swallow its Iraqi policy, with ever-dwindling success.
Essentially, America and Britain plan to let Iraq stew.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis complain that they have been left to stew painfully
for eight years under the most all-encompassing sanctions in

protest and prod until the international consensus on sanctions

   ROCKIN' AND ROLLIN' AND DINING
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Want a table at Rao's, the 10-table East Harlem
restaurant that's almost impossible to get into if you're not a
regular? It helps if you are the man who is on national television
broadcasting the New Year's Eve celebration from Times Square, the
way you've done for, oh . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up there in the 20s,'' said DICK CLARK, trying to
remember how many years he has presided over the changing of the
calendar (it's 27). ``I'm just honored they keep asking me back,''
he said. (This year's ``Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve'' ran
Thursday night on WABC-TV.)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Clark managed to secure the power table at
Rao's _ the first booth near the bar _ which he shared with CHUCK
BARRIS, the creator of that 1970s television oddball, ``The Gong
Show.'' In the booths behind him were BOB GUCCIONE Jr., the
publisher of Gear magazine, and STEPHEN BALDWIN, the actor, who
dined with childhood buddies from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was asked if he had made his New Year's resolutions. ``I
don't make them anymore,'' he said. ``I used to always have three
of them every year: to lose weight, to be a better person and _ I
forget what the third one was. So you see, I never could remember
them, so I just don't make them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL WISHES FOR A TV FRIEND
</P>
<P>
   As one of his friends admits, ``Jack is not quite online yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But since having quadruple bypass surgery three weeks ago, JACK
PAAR, the late-night television pioneer, has discovered the simple
joys of E-mail _ at least the printed-out version.
</P>
<P>
   REGIS PHILBIN and CHARLES GRODIN, Paar's friends, have been
gathering electronic get-well cards for him as he recovers at his
home in Greenwich, Conn. On the Web site for Philbin's talk show,
``Live! With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' hundreds of fans have clicked
on a picture of Paar and written him short notes since the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really cheering his spirits,'' said MICHAEL MACARI
JR., president of Eaglevision, a media production company in
Stamford, Conn., that is helping Paar, 81, compile his archives.
``We've probably given him four or five hundred so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Paar, who began the ``Tonight'' show in 1957, also got a more
conventional get-well wish last week _ on the telephone _ from
JOHNNY CARSON, who took over the talk show when Paar left it in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Friends report that Paar's quietly ferocious wit has survived
the surgery intact. As he was being taken out of the hospital, he
nodded toward the heart surgeon and said to his wife, ``Miriam,
dear, please tip the man.''
</P>
<P>
   ZERO-HOUR FOODIES
</P>
<P>
   Porcini mushrooms at the last minute for that New Year's Eve
dinner-party risotto? Maybe some caviar, or just a couple of plain
old T-bones for that quiet get-together with friends?
</P>
<P>
   Balducci's, the gourmet store in Greenwich Village, had a line
snaking down Sixth Avenue by 10:30 a.m. Thursday just to get
inside. At Citarella on the Upper West Side, a line of more than a
dozen people stretched out the door by 12:30 p.m. (``They must be
giving something away,'' one passer-by said.) And inside Zabar's,
employees announced an express line ``only if you want caviar or
foie gras.'' Another express line formed for presliced Nova.
Otherwise the wait was more than 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody had the same idea,'' said ALAN BUTZBACH,
vice president for operations at Balducci's. ``But you can't blame
people. You live in the city, you know. How big is your
refrigerator?  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Butzbach said Balducci's kept the lines outside to reduce the
crush inside. ``They don't really mind waiting on the line for 5 or
10 minutes,'' he said of customers, ``so they can get in and not be
crowded.''

VAN HORN SAYS PLAYERS SHOULD PUT DEAL TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn called for a shift in the union's stance
Thursday, saying that Billy Hunter, the union's executive director,
and his 19-member negotiating committee should let the league's
400-plus players vote on the owners' latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, an unlikely dissident because his agent is David Falk,
became the third player to publicly challenge Hunter's decision to
let the fate of the union rest solely in the hands of the 19
players on the negotiating committee. The Nets forward said the
only way to get a read on the sentiments of the union membership
was to put what the league termed its final offer on a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we should have a vote,'' said Van Horn, who
followed Kevin Willis and his Nets teammate Jayson Williams in
requesting such a measure. ``Even though you have 19 guys
representing the players, it may not necessarily be accurate or
representative of how the other guys feel. And if 65 to 70 percent
of the players want to play and feel that the deal is satisfactory,
you have to take that into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn's statement is surprising because the National
Basketball Association Commissioner David Stern and many others
believe that Falk has been manipulating the negotiating committee
through his clients Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. And
Williams, who called for a secret ballot on Tuesday only to be
rebuffed viciously by Ewing the next day, said he was kept off the
negotiating committee because he was not represented by Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter remains steadfast in not putting the offer to a vote by
saying that nearly 250 players empowered the negotiating committee
to do its bidding at an October meeting in Las Vegas, Nev. But with
Stern's deadline of Jan. 7 just days away, Van Horn said that
should be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're at a juncture now where we need to take all of
the necessary action that we can to get this thing done,'' said Van
Horn, who attended the mass union meetings in Las Vegas and New
York. ``I think most players want to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a vote would be close,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While Van Horn's words may signify that Stern's strategy of
twice mailing the owners' proposals directly to the players is
beginning to crack the previously impenetrable solidarity of the
union, Van Horn said they should not be taken as a full endorsement
of the owners' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a vote, I really couldn't tell you which way I
would go right now,'' he said. ``But the owners' proposal is pretty
good. This is actually the first proposal that I've seen that I
think is acceptable. I think it is as close to a fair deal as we're
going to get.'' &QL;

 NETS MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SALE INVOLVING THE DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nets' president, Michael Rowe, denied a report Thursday that
stated that the Nets had made informal offers to buy the New Jersey
Devils from the hockey team's owner, John McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowe said the Nets would be interested in acquiring the
National Hockey League franchise if it were placed on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team was available for sale, would we be interested?''
Rowe asked. ``We likely would, but its nothing we've ever
approached them about.''
</P>
<P>
   An article in Thursday's editions of The Newark Star-Ledger
reported that officials familiar with the relationship between the
two teams said ``several informal offers'' had been made by the
Nets, including one that called for an outright purchase of the
club. But Rowe called it ``all speculation'' because the Devils are
not yet for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there's never been an offer made to the
Devils,'' said Rowe, speaking on behalf of the Nets' ownership
group. ``We've expressed an interest in them coming to Newark with
us, and they've expressed an interest in us going to Hoboken with
them. But that's all at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are not yet for sale, but if McMullen became the
principal owner of Washington Redskins of the National Football
League, he would be forced to relinquish ownership of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   NFL bylaws prohibit the league's owners from being the principal
owners of another professional sports franchise in a different
market that competes with an NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen, who has talked about moving the Devils from the
Meadowlands to Hoboken, and Charles Dolan, the chairman of
Cablevision Systems and the owner of Madison Square Garden, the
Knicks and the Rangers, have submitted a joint proposal for the
Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As one of five groups whose offer is being considered by the
holders of the Cooke estate, McMullen and Dolan could find out as
early as next week whether their bid was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe McMullen will become the principal owner
if the offer from his group is accepted. In that case, the Devils
would be placed on the market, and the Nets would probably attempt
to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who currently share the Continental Arena with the
Devils, would perhaps have more incentive than anyone to buy the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The club's new ownership group, headed by Lewis Katz and the
noted philanthropist Ray Chambers, is intent on moving the Nets to
a new, state-of-the-art facility in Newark and having the Devils as
a second tenant would practically assure them of being able to
complete the move.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Connecticut Council of Small Towns faxed
the alarm to its 85 members late last week, contending that Gov.
John Rowland was about to cut tens of millions of dollars in aid to
municipalities in the two-year state budget he is to present in
early February.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin suggested that the cost of building a football
stadium for the New England Patriots was already coming home to
roost, and begged mayors and selectmen to band together to ``fend
off the governor's budget ax.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office scoffed at the message, asserting that
budget decisions would not be made until late January. But the fax,
labeled ``Breaking News,'' exposed a growing sense of foreboding
among those who depend on state aid. Until the stadium came along,
the towns, schools and a wide variety of social service programs
stood to benefit from the windfall produced by a sizzling economy.
Now, advocates for these causes fear that a huge tab for the
stadium could mean lean times elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which legislator is doing the figuring, the stadium
will cost the state at least $100 million and perhaps as much as $1
billion over the life of the 30-year lease, which the state
Legislature overwhelmingly approved during a special session two
weeks ago. It is partly that uncertainty that has local
governments, children's groups and others fretting about how
tightly the state has tied its hands with what many people consider
a generous offer to lure the National Football League team from the
Boston region to downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Dannel Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, said the decision on the
Patriots had been made so hastily that residents of his city and
the towns near the New York border were left wondering what _ if
any _ benefits the huge investment would have for them. ``In this
part of the state, the impact of the stadium is at the very least
not understood, but is looked at with some fear and trepidation on
the state's ability to fund other programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the stadium is a pet project of both the governor,
who is a Republican, and the Legislature's leaders, who are
Democrats, Malloy and others who need favors in Hartford are
reluctant to attack the deal, which they consider water over the
dam. ``It's an issue to be managed around, at this point,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is the delicate issue of what taxpayers really gave up to
get the Patriots that will help drive the state's political
dialogue beginning on Wednesday, when the Legislature will open its
annual session and Rowland will be inaugurated for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are already looking for ways to use the issue to
their advantage. Janice Gruendel, executive director of Connecticut
Voices for Children, which focuses on issues like day care and
health insurance, said the season's hot new term was ``stadium
guilt'' _ a hope among some advocates that lawmakers would be more
generous to social service programs as a way of compensating for
what many see as a huge gift to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators were not all equally comfortable voting for the
stadium, and when they voted for it, they knew the state had other
needs,'' Ms. Gruendel said. ``We believe the state has the capacity
to make the same dollar choice for kids and families that it did
for football.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state's lieutenant governor, M. Jodi Rell, who was the
governor's running mate, said she recognized that the
administration's critics would try to use the stadium issue against
Rowland. But she said the stadium and other programs had
``absolutely no correlation, and should not be confused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be an easy target, but it should not be a license for
people to complain that their particular project is not being
funded,'' she said. ``It could be said about any other project. If
someone didn't get a sewer project, did they point their finger and
say, `It's because you funded the University of Connecticut'?''
</P>
<P>
   Although Connecticut will pay for most of the stadium by selling
bonds, legislative leaders have agreed to use $100 million of this
year's budget surplus as a down payment on the $375 million
construction cost. In addition, the Legislature's Office of Fiscal
Analysis estimates that interest on the bonds will cost $212
million over 30 years. A 10 percent tax on Patriots tickets will
help pay the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Miller, principal analyst at the Office of Fiscal
Analysis, said the real cost might be in the other projects that
cannot be undertaken because of the heavy debt that the stadium
will put on the books of the state, whose credit rating is already
below average because of its debt load. ``If they have to do less
bonding for other purposes because of the stadium, that means the
stadium will be taking up money that could have been used for
schools, prisons or whatever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the state's surplus from this year's budget range
from $350 million to $500 million, and many state supplicants had
hoped that money would go toward their wish lists. For instance,
the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which represents
cities and towns, has issued a study concluding that its members
will need $2.8 billion over the next 25 years to improve
waste-water treatment plants in order to meet new requirements
intended to clean up Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, John Weichsel, the town manager of
Southington, said he also hoped that the economic boom would allow
the state to upgrade its schools, pipes and roads. ``If we're ever
going to improve these things, this is the time to take a quantum
leap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sullivan, the Senate president pro tempore and a strong
supporter of the stadium, said new programs would be financed if
they made sense, but not to make up for money going to the
Patriots. ``I don't have stadium guilt,'' he said. ``I have stadium
pride.''

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 HOFSTRA IS SEEKING CONFERENCE SUPREMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<P>
   Their visibility has soared. Their answering machines have been
crammed with congratulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jay Wright and the Hofstra Flying Dutchmen have basked for
a week in their upset of Georgia Tech and a victory over
Pennsylvania in the ECAC Holiday Festival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've put ourselves in a position to do great things and now
we have to demand a higher level of play from each other,'' Wright
said this week after practice in Hempstead, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra (7-4, 1-0) resumes play Friday at New Hampshire. It is
far from Madison Square Garden, where the Dutchmen's breakthrough
took place, but it is the next step toward an America East
Conference championship. A regular-season title would guarantee a
home game for Hofstra if it advanced to the final of the conference
tournament. A victory in the final would mean a berth in late
February in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, which remains the ultimate goal, Wright said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra has not been to the tournament since the 1976-77 season.
Wright, who served under Rollie Massimino at Villanova and
Nevada-Las Vegas, has guided Hofstra closer with every recruiting
class. The Long Island university hired Wright four-and-a-half
years ago partly because of his reputation as a recruiter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His selling approach is anything but slick. He cannot woo
athletes with extensive television coverage, so he gushes about a
family atmosphere and the school's $15 million, 5,000-seat arena,
scheduled to open in January 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He told his first prospects, Tim Beckett and Duane Posey, now
seniors, that he would build a winner. He promised point guard
Craig Claxton, who is now a junior, that he would get him more
scorers to feed. He told the sophomores Norman Richardson and
Roberto Gittens that he had Claxton to feed them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been trust, but now that trust has materialized
in the form of a championship and a victory over Georgia Tech,''
the 37-year-old Wright said. ``There's physical proof now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claxton led the team in scoring at 16.3 points a game and
assists at 7.2 last season, and was named the America East player
of the year. The Flying Dutchmen had a 19-12 record, and tied for
third in the conference at 11-7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This season, Claxton is averaging 10.3 points and 5.5 assists,
but his burden has been lightened by the maturation of the
sophomores. Richardson (13.9 points) was named the most valuable
player of the Holiday Festival after scoring 39 points in two
games, and Gittens (9.5 points, 6.1 rebounds) has become a steady
producer at the other forward. Both fit in well in Wright's motion
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The final ingredient of Hofstra's rise was not planned. Guard
Jason Hernandez (8.5 points) transferred from New Hampshire after
making the conference all-freshman team in 1996-97. Hernandez,
married with a 15-month-old daughter, is from Oyster Bay, N.Y., and
wanted to play near home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a leadership role that most of us on the team
don't have,'' Richardson said. ``A lot of us are quiet. He's that
guy that gets us fired up by talking to us, motivating us. With
that and his basketball skills, he's just made the team that much
better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said, ``If they're diving on the floor and they're
getting after rebounds, you know that's their way of screaming and
yelling.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Dutchmen got noticed last weekend with their victory
over Georgia Tech. Their goal is holding that attention.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of asking me, `Why Hofstra?''' Claxton said, ``now a
lot of people can see why Hofstra.'' &QL;

COLUMN: IMMINENT MILLENNIUM FATIGUE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Welcome to the last New Year's Day column of the
dying millennium. Exciting, huh?
</P>
<P>
   You may have already had your last New Year's morning cup of
coffee in this millennium. You may be watching the last Rose Bowl
game of the fading millennium, perhaps while contemplating what to
do (this gets tricky) on the last first weekend of the new year in
the old millennium. Don't get too comfortable, because you will
soon face the final opening workweek of _ you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   If you find all this rather dreary fare, you ain't seen nothin'
yet, to borrow from Al Jolson.
</P>
<P>
   The fin-de-siecle factory is just getting cranked up. Five will
get you 10 that by mid-March you will have heard enough millennial
references to last for _who can resist? _ 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good moment to become perhaps the first columnist of
the last year of the old millennium to note that we are not really
in the last year of the old millennium. The new millennium will not
arrive for another two years, on Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everyone is ignoring that fact, and it is pointless
by now to resist the obvious fascination with all those zeroes
tumbling into place. It is a bit like watching a car's odometer at
the 99999.9-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   So brace yourself for a yearlong deluge of millennial musings,
many of them predictable, including thoughts on what to call the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Should the 00s be the Oughts, the Naughts, the Oughties, the
Naughties, the Zeroes, the Zips, the Ohs, the Oh-Ohs, the Ooze, or
even the Pre-Teens?
</P>
<P>
   What, then, to call the coming century? The year 2000 is
commonly pronounced two thousand; 2001 is two thousand and one. But
where is the logic? No one refers to 1999 as one thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine. It is nineteen ninety-nine. Similarly,
should we not speak of the years twenty hundred, twenty-oh-one,
twenty-oh-two and so on? We have had 1,000 years to work this one
out, and still time is ticking without a solution in earshot. And
it is but one facet of the millennial machinery, which has steadily
kicked into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, this newspaper published 303 articles with
references to ``millennium,'' ``millenium,'' ``millennial'' or
``millenial.'' The number then kept growing, to 914 in 1998. To put
that in perspective, the inescapable Monica appeared last year in
exactly 1,000 articles. Who knows? Maybe the millennium is about to
leave even Ms. Lewinsky in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Another yardstick is the Manhattan phone book. The 1998-99
directory has 85 listings for businesses starting with variations
of ``millennium.'' The 1994-95 book had a mere 16. The current
directory has 21 listings for companies called ``Twenty-First
Century.'' Four years ago, there were nine.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, ``twentieth century'' is fading, though not
right away at 20th Century Fox. ``At this time, there are no plans
to change,'' said a spokeswoman, Flo Grace. But the Twentieth
Century Fund, the public policy research institute on the Upper
East Side, decided it could no longer swim against the tide of
history. It became the Century Foundation a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a group of holdouts, and I was one of the laggards
who wanted no change,'' said Richard Leone, the foundation's
president. ``But then some asked what would people have thought if
we had ever kept to a name like `Nineteenth Century Fund'? We bent
to the times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By changing it to the Century Foundation,'' Leone added,
``nobody has to deal with this problem again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Instead, all of us can turn, as you know we will,
to drawing up lists of ``the tops'' from the old millennium: best
idea, best explorer, best invention, best book. On and on it will
go, though you may want to be suspicious of any lineup that leaves
out ``Heat Wave'' by Martha and the Vandellas as best rock song of
the last 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there will be a cascade of ``predictions for the next
millennium,'' which a couple of New Yorkers, David Kristof and Todd
Nickerson, have compiled in a book by that very name.
</P>
<P>
   In it, some 250 prominent figures forecast everything from a
planet at peace to global nuclear holocaust. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur C. Clarke, the writer of ``2001'' fame, predicts ``proof
of intelligent life elsewhere'' will be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   That's encouraging. It presupposes that, prattle about the
millennium notwithstanding, intelligent life has been found here.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As the Mississippi State Bulldogs ended a recent
practice session and began turning their thoughts toward an evening
of lavish Cotton Bowl entertainment, strength coach Mike Grant
stepped up with a brief announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid news, he said. The weight equipment had arrived, and
now everyone could start busily toning themselves up for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled, the players started milling around Grant, then
suddenly began to chant, ``Hell no ... we won't go! Hell no ... we
won't go!''
</P>
<P>
   Standing a few feet away, viewing the episode, was the
impresario of this frothy little entourage, Bulldogs coach Jackie
Wayne Sherrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, smiling, ``I think I kind of agree with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm?
</P>
<P>
   This, presumably, is the same guy who, after a crushing loss
during his rebuilding phase at Texas A&AMP;M said, ``Everybody better
get their licks in now ... because the worm's gonna turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The same guy who, before his last meeting with Texas in 1992,
had a bull castrated on the practice field, then rolled into Austin
and beat the Longhorns _ for the seventh consecutive time _ by
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   And then announced, ``I've whipped these people enough. I don't
ever have to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The same guy who, departing A&AMP;M in a cloud of NCAA controversy
10 years ago, said, ``At least nobody's telling Aggie jokes
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The same guy? Yeah, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's mellowed a lot,'' said Lynn Amedee, who is once
again Sherrill's offensive coordinator, just as he was in 1985-87,
when the Aggies made three trips to the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jackie is more at peace with himself now,'' Amedee
said. ``He's been to the big time, and I don't think he feels he
has to prove anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as rough on people as he used to be, and I think he
has a lot better relationship with the media. In the early years at
A&AMP;M, he was kind of a hard guy to get to know. Sometimes, you
weren't sure what he was thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been someone you like to coach for _ I was
figuring I was out of it when he called me \Rin '96\S and talked me
into coming back. And players have always liked playing for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has softened a lot. He gives people a lot more freedom
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. While the Aggies of the '80s often seemed like a huge,
menacing commando squad out to destroy the world, the ``Hell no, we
won't go'' 'Dogs are just having fun with the strength coach.
</P>
<P>
   The star running back has a Batman tattoo on his arm and the
other coordinator _ Joe Lee Dunn _ is a man who arises at 4 a.m. to
munch popcorn and view film, shaves on infrequent whims, wears
socks only on special occasions, and has a contract that says he
runs the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrill, once the master of button-down discipline, now shows
up for news conferences wearing exotic sting-ray boots. When
freshman quarterback Wayne Madkin moped for days after the loss to
Tennessee, Sherrill walked up, pushed Madkin's face back into a
smile, and said, ``The game's over _ forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the infamous castration incident came up this week,
Sherrill _ who withstood a withering storm of adverse publicity at
the time _ was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I thought of doing it again this year,'' he told a
stunned media gathering, then laughed and quickly added, ``Uh, just
kidding. What I was really going to do was bring a bull out to the
practice field, with a pair of shears, and let the photographers
shoot a picture or film it. But I decided against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, he added, ``A few years ago, I couldn't have laughed
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has also cried. Asked for a Cotton Bowl memory,
Sherrill recalled the death of a close friend on the day of an A&AMP;M
victory over Auburn. When he finished the story, he was in tears.
</P>
<P>
   But the trademark of Sherrill's motivational technique is not
tears, but laughter _ a reflection of his lifelong love of clowns.
Or, as Madkin puts it, ``He does some really strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the time, for instance, when the startled Bulldogs
looked up to discover a large green leprechaun wandering the
practice field. A quick check of the premises confirmed their worst
fears: it was Coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Sherrill said, laughing, ``at my age \R55\S, I
don't look that good in a leprechaun suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago when I was at Alabama we played Florida State; I
used to put on a loincloth and a headdress and do a war dance. The
players loved it, but I was a lot younger then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to do something to break up the routine every
once in a while. I think I've got these guys to the point now where
they don't know what I might do on Thursday or Friday, and that's
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go through a whole season just being dead serious
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Kevin Sluder has fond memories of Harpo the
Clown, a distinguished visitor at an Mississippi State practice
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Sherrill just brought him in one day, and it definitely
lightened up the mood for the week,'' Sluder said. ``It was fun,
and we kinda hoped he'd be back this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I heard he blew out a knee and had to have surgery. I
guess being a clown isn't as easy as it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clown routine has been a Sherrill favorite for
years _ he has spent countless hours entertaining at children's
hospitals _ there have been other, more recent influences on his
life, such as his seven-year marriage to his third wife, Peggy.
</P>
<P>
   And it is obvious that nothing the Bulldogs have accomplished
has thrilled him more than the first time he saw an entire stadium
full of people stand in a lengthy ovation for daughter Bonnie, 19,
after she delivered a dazzling rendition of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   She is actually Peggy's daughter by a previous marriage, but,
Sherrill said, ``In our family, there are no stepchildren _ it's a
word we never use. Bonnie is my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also a student at _ how shall we say this? _ the
University of Texas. In fact, she works in the office of Mack
Brown, whose brother Watson is a former Sherrill assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's kind of a bribe,'' Sherrill said. ``She has a
great singing voice _ she can do opera and C&AMP;W, whatever you want _
and she's like a cross between Whitney Houston and, well, just pick
one. But we didn't want her going up to New York \Rto study\S fresh
out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we talked her into UT, and we talked Mack into giving her a
job. She's not a spy, honest. In fact, we're all losing her next
year because she's going to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done the national anthem at three games. People just
stood and cheered, and cheered ...''
</P>
<P>
   When Sherrill arrived in Starkville, Miss., in '91, the MSU
faithful were agog with dreams of stomping Ole Miss into mush, or
even winning a title. And athletic director Larry Templeton was
fielding criticism as a man who would risk NCAA probation to win.
And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Templeton said, ``it was a great
hire for Mississippi State. He's been great for the program, a
great friend to the players and the community ... and I have never
really seen that person that was so often described in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had said back then that Mississippi State would ever
win a championship, people would have laughed. If you had said that
by 1998 Auburn would have gone through three coaches and we would
still have ours, they wouldn't have believed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a building program under way to expand our stadium,
and we sold 15,000 Cotton Bowl tickets in 14 hours. The last time
we played in a bowl this big was in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel? Great.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Jackie Wayne Sherrill is back ... the jovial jokester
slapping Bevo's nose. Just another big game, you see, nothing
special. And if anyone is buying that, they don't play for
Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he wants this one, make no mistake about that,'' Sluder
said, laughing. ``I think he's really a Texan at heart _ he has
great respect for this state and the people in it, and I think it
is kind of a yardstick for him. This isn't just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   And when someone made a remark about hostile territory,
Sherrill, treated to a Wednesday reunion with many of his old
players, just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the game Friday,'' he said, ``and you will discover
there are a lot of Aggies who aren't in New Orleans. And they won't
be wearing orange.''

<P>
   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia _ Liberated at last from a life of
revolution, two Khmer Rouge leaders came to this beach resort
Thursday with their families, their leisure wear and their
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   But their holiday was a drab one, spent mostly behind the dirty
brown curtains of their tiny hotel rooms, trapped inside by their
fear of a small group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, His Excellency wants to relax,'' an aide, Long
Norin, said, explaining the strange behavior of the former Khmer
Rouge head of state, Khieu Samphan, 67, who came here with Nuon
Chea, 71, the chief ideologue of the Khmer Rouge revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Even the men's two grown daughters and one teen-age
granddaughter spent the sunny afternoon in their darkened room
watching a Thai television station.
</P>
<P>
   After about six hours of this _ during which a waiter brought
seafood lunches to the two leaders' rooms _ and after reporters
assured an aide that they would be polite, the two men emerged,
said a few innocuous words and took a brief tour of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine; I just need to rest a little bit,'' Khieu Samphan
said as he walked past a plastic Santa Claus pasted to the hotel's
glass door. ``I have already said what I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rowdy news conference Tuesday, the two men had pleaded to
``let bygones be bygones'' but were overwhelmed by aggressive
questions about their roles as leaders of a brutal government that
caused more than 1 million deaths from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to start a riot!'' Nuon Chea exclaimed as
security men bundled him past reporters after the Tuesday news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was calmer Thursday at the three-story Seaside Hotel,
100 yards from the beach, where the hum of air conditioners was
almost the only sound in the empty courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun began to sink, sparkling off the sea, the old men
napped or watched television in their darkened rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The duty manager, Son Cha, said it was a little unusual but not
unheard-of that the group had spent the entire sunny afternoon
without going out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like to go out because they don't know how many
people like them and how many people don't like them,'' he said.
``But all the people don't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Son Cha noted that they had not tipped the bellboy when they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Dy Mary, 18, a receptionist, said she did not know too much
about her famous guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard their names in school, but I wasn't born yet when
those things happened,'' she said. ``I'm not angry at them because
they didn't do anything to me.'' She said her parents had told her
that the Khmer Rouge years had been difficult but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We welcome anyone to our hotel as long as they
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge tour of the city took a little more than an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In four vans escorted by two trucks of soldiers armed with
automatic weapons and rocket launchers, they drove past the beach,
through the pothole-riddled town center, into the port, out past
the beach again and back to their hotel and their $30 rooms adorned
with red plastic tulips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of changes,'' Khieu Samphan said of the
city. ``It makes me understand a lot of issues better, especially
visiting places I haven't seen in a long time.'' He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m. the holiday makers had eaten again, returned to their
rooms and turned on their tiny television sets in the silent and
half-empty hotel, awaiting the new year without celebration.
</P>
<P>
   A security man assigned by the government to accompany them said
they had had a better time on Wednesday when they toured the
capital, Phnom Penh, after being welcomed by Prime Minister Hun Sen
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their defections last Friday marked the collapse of the last
group of Khmer Rouge holdouts. But their official welcome and the
apparent decision by Hun Sen not to turn them over for trial has
raised questions about justice and impunity after one of history's
great atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the group drove past landmarks that had been
damaged by the Khmer Rouge, the wife of Nuon Chea, a talkative
woman, exclaimed, ``Oh, we shouldn't have done that,'' said the
security man, who insisted that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   He said Khieu Samphan replied, ``Oh, all that was done by
Comrade Son Sen,'' another top leader who was killed in June 1997
in a rift with the Khmer Rouge founder, Pol Pot, who himself died
in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The security man, who had become quite friendly with his
charges, said he then told the Khmer Rouge leaders, ``Cambodia
would have developed fast in 1975 if you had not killed so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ieng Sary, another high-ranking defector who was in the
car with them, replied, ``We made mistakes by going the Communist
route.''
</P>
<P>
   The guard said he himself then made a pun, playing on the word
``Communist,'' saying, ``Not all `kumunus' is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kumunus'' is the word in the Khmer language for ``revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He said everybody laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The guard said that like virtually all Cambodians of his
generation he had lost several family members in the years his new
friends had ruled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Did it not bother him to be joking with some of the top
architects of that bloodshed?
</P>
<P>
   The security man answered with another joke. ``Let bygones be
bygones,'' he said, and laughed.

TCU EARNS RESPECT WITH UPSET VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ In the space of three sun-splashed hours in the
Sun Bowl, the Southern California Trojans went from supremely
confident to stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' USC flanker and kick returner Jay
Soward said after the Horned Frogs' stunning 28-19 victory. ``It's
mind-boggling. We lost to TCU. We're better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, some of the Horned Frogs said, was a big reason
why TCU pulled off the upset. The mighty Trojans, with their
storied history and Pac-10 pedigree, didn't take their lowly WAC
opponents seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team like USC disrespected us, and at the end we had the
final word,'' TCU cornerback Andre Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett admitted that perhaps his team did take
the Horned Frogs lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say maybe we did,'' Hackett said. ``We just
weren't ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a plausible explanation for the Horned Frogs'
domination in the first half, when they took a 21-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hackett said there was another reason.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was not respect. It was speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem is the speed they have is not something you
can simulate in practice, especially speed on the turf,'' Hackett
said. ``The option, the way they run it, the way they execute, is
tough to stop. After halftime I thought we had a handle on it, but
21 points was too much to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs rushed for 314 yards, including 185 by Basil
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of us not respecting TCU,'' Chris Claiborne,
USC's Butkus Award-winning linebacker, said. ``We definitely
respected them. It's just a matter of getting it done on the field,
and we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also had trouble running themselves. They finished
with minus-23 yards rushing, the worst day in school history.
Tailback Chad Morton, who averaged 96.7 yards per game, was held to
21 on 11 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they were stopping it,'' USC quarterback
Carson Palmer said. ``I was completely surprised. They completely
shut us down, and made us throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans lost because they couldn't run, and they couldn't
stop the run. The respect issue, they said, was in the Horned
Frogs' minds, not on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have had a small man's complex, I think,''
Claiborne said. ``The point spread, them coming from TCU and us
being a powerhouse. They handed us our food, and we had to eat
it.''

SNAKE HUNTING

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Seven times this season, Jake ``The Snake''
Plummer has rallied his team to victory in the fourth quarter, and
he has delivered the Cardinals into the playoffs for the first time
since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes you feel no matter the situation, he's going to get
the job done,'' Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down Plummer, who is second in the NFC in total passing
yards behind Steve Young, is another story. Although the Cardinals'
rushing attack with Adrian Murrell runs hot and cold, Plummer
thrives off his ability to create in and out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most dangerous time is when I'm out of the pocket
and making guys miss and getting out of there when you think you've
got a sack,'' Plummer said. ``Defensive guys and coordinators will
agree that any guy that has the ability to do that is dangerous.
It's frustrating for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could find themselves in a quandary. Although Deion
Sanders is expected to play despite a toe injury, a bad pass rush
defense will play without injured sack leader Kavika Pittman. And
the Cowboys haven't forgotten Plummer's slice-and-dice job on a
depleted secondary Nov. 15 after Sanders left with an injured toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can \Rcontain Plummer\S,'' Cowboys safety
George Teague said. ``Before right now, I would have said yeah, but
the way he is playing now, he's gotten a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey: ``You always are trying to keep
things mixed up on him and then sit back. You just want to try to
keep him off balance if you can. When he gets in a rhythm, he's
like most quarterbacks, they're tough when they get in a rhythm.''

IRVIN WOULD LIKE ANOTHER SHUTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Michael Irvin does not lie awake at night
thinking about what happened the last time he faced the Arizona
Cardinals, when his consecutive games streak of catching at least
one pass ended at 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's gone out of my head,'' Irvin said. ``If I get the same
result and we get the same result then I'm fine. I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys took a 35-28 victory over the Cardinals with no
catches from Irvin, and no balls thrown to him until just over two
minutes remained in the game at Arizona on Nov. 15. Cardinals Pro
Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams shadowed Irvin for much of the day
and occasionally had help from a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studying the film, Aeneas did a great job and they had a great
scheme,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals do not expect another shutout. Irvin has more
career touchdown receptions against the Cardinals (eight) than he
has against any other club. Irvin did not get in the end zone in
the first Cowboys-Cardinals game on Sept. 6, but he burned Williams
for nine receptions for 119 yards, including a long of 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is pretty hard to shut out; I don't think we'll shut
him out again,'' Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said. ``Michael is a
top quality receiver who will be in the Hall of Fame. You try to
control a guy like that and not let him be a dominant force.
Michael is going to make plays.'' TICKET INFORMATION As of 4 p.m.
yesterday, approximately 4,000 tickets remained for tomorrow's
Cowboys-Cardinals game. If the remaining tickets are not sold by 5
p.m. today, the game will not be seen on local television.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, ranging in price from $52 to $72, can still be
purchased at all Kroger, Fiesta and Foley's Ticketmaster locations.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can purchase tickets by phone by calling Ticketmaster at
(214) 373-8000 or (972) 647-5700. Tickets can also be ordered by

<P>
   Tickets purchased by phone through Ticketmaster can be picked up
at the Gate 8 box office at Texas Stadium today from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m. Photo I.D. is required to pick up tickets. INJURY REPORT
Strong safety Darren Woodson gave the Cowboys a scare near the end
of practice when he fell untouched while running. Turns out, he had
reaggravated his sprained left ankle. He walked off the field under
his own power and left practice early as a precaution. He said he
was feeling much better after practice. ``I just tweaked it a
little bit,'' he said. ``I'll be all right.'' ... Tight end David
LaFleur completed his third consecutive day of practice and appears
ready to make a start tomorrow for the first time since spraining
his right knee against the Saints on Dec. 16. Third time a charm
This is the fifth time that the Cowboys will have played a division
opponent three times in one season. In 1972 they were 1-2 against
the Redskins, with a loss in the NFC Championship Game. In 1980
they were 1-2 against the Eagles with a loss in the NFC
Championship Game. In 1992 they were 2-1 against the Eagles, with a
win in the divisional playoffs. And in 1995 they were 2-1 against
the Eagles, with a win in the divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Super Bowl era, there have been 12 playoff games between
division opponents in which one team had swept the other in the
regular season. The team that swept won seven games. The team that
was swept won five. The Cowboys-Cardinals game will be the 13th
such game. Here is a rundown of the previous 12.

TENNESSEE'S WILSON HITS AS HARD AS HE DID IN THE RING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ He coulda been a contender. Instead, he's the
defensive leader of the nation's top-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   Al Wilson is Tennessee's senior middle linebacker. When the
Volunteers take the field Monday night against No. 2 Florida State
in the Fiesta Bowl, they'll look to Wilson for inspiration and
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to tell you how good he is; he's going to go
out and show you,'' Tennessee defensive coordinator John Chavis
said of Wilson. ``Playing football means a lot to him. He has a
passion for the game, a hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson thinks that desire was inflamed as a youngster in
Jackson, Tenn. Wilson's first sport, his first love, was boxing.
And, according to his first coach, Wilson could have a future in
the squared circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al had more talent than anybody I've ever had,'' said Rayford
Collins, the 35-year director of the Jackson Boxing Club.
``Somebody with his skills you see maybe once every thousand
boxers. He could have been another Evander Holyfield. Even at that
age, his hand-eye coordination was so slick he could avoid getting
hit anytime he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al had stuck with boxing he could have been an Olympic
gold-medal winner.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was 14, after three years of boxing, Wilson saw two
of his friends die because of injuries suffered in the ring. He
quit boxing and started playing football. Wilson found his boxing
training transferred easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing meant a lot to me, and I was pretty good at it,''
Wilson said. ``It gave me the attitude and the mentality to give my
all in whatever I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Wilson played a supporting role to All-America
linebacker Leonard Little. This season, he moved from the outside
to the middle. A 6-foot, 226-pounder, he has become the epicenter
of the Volunteers' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he's the leader of the team,'' said junior outside
linebacker Raynoch Thompson. ``He plays with a passion, shows a lot
of emotion. I'm upset because this is going to be my last game
playing with him. It's been a great gift playing with a guy like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries _ separated shoulder and pulled groin muscle
_ Wilson missed three games this season. He played most of the
season even though his shoulder was often reinjured after a hard
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al is not going to let nicks and bruises stop him,'' Thompson
said. ``He's like the Energizer Bunny; he just keeps going and
going. He's inspired me, seeing him go out and play in pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson downplays his leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself one of the veterans on the defense,'' said
Wilson, who had 77 tackles this season. ``We have a lot of leaders
on defense. I've been here for a while and know what's going on.
I'm just a guy who goes out and plays football. I'm not a guy to go
out and say I'm a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he lets his play do the talking. In Tennessee's pivotal
game, a 20-17 victory over Florida, Wilson wrecked the Gators'
offense by forcing three fumbles that the Volunteers recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is known among his teammates for his split personality.
Off the field, he's quiet, religious, a guy who likes to hang out,
tell jokes and laugh it up. Then, at game time, he turns into a
tackling terror; his defensive teammates often keep one eye on the
ball carrier and one on Wilson so they don't absorb one of his hard
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love football. I go out to play, and I go out to win,''
Wilson said. ``I believe when you step between the white lines,
it's time to go to war, time to take care of our business. When I
go out on the field, I've got the mentality that I want to make
every play on defense.''

LIGHTING AGGIES' FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ At some point before kickoff in the Sugar Bowl
tonight, Texas A&AMP;M tight end Dan Campbell will address his
teammates one final time. Campbell isn't sure what he'll say, but
he knows his words will drip with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give some crappy speech I've planned. That's
not how you get people motivated,'' Campbell said. ``People want to
hear things from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies know they will hang on every word uttered by the
fifth-year senior from Glen Rose, who has emerged as the spiritual
leader for a group of overachievers with a chance to tie the
school's season record for victories. By knocking off Ohio State
(10-1), the No. 3 team in The Associated Press poll, the
eighth-ranked Aggies (11-2) would notch their 12th win of the
season and their third as a double-digit underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates point to Campbell's work ethic and persuasive voice as
a big reason why a team that ``easily could have been 6-5,'' in the
estimation of coach R.C. Slocum, will carry a swagger into the
Superdome as a 121/2 point underdog against the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   When teammates' concentration levels dip during practice, it is
Campbell who thrusts his 6-foot-5, 262-pound frame into the fray to
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get in someone's face and say, `This is bullcorn. Let's
get it together,' '' tailback Dante Hall said. ``A lot of guys
might be feeling it. Dan comes out and says it. He'll get you fired
up.''
</P>
<P>
   When a teammate is down, Campbell is quick with a smile and some
encouraging words. When he makes a mistake, there is never an
alibi. Listen to teammates and they'll tell you that Campbell is an
embodiment of the warrior tattoo he wears on his right shoulder, a
replica of a tribal symbol etched on the faces of braves who
distinguished themselves in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely the outspoken leader of this team,'' strong
safety Rich Coady said. ``He's not afraid to say what he thinks,
and it's something this team rallies around. Guys feed off that,
especially the younger guys. As far as us doing what we've done, I
think a lot of it has to go to people like Dan Campbell. He's
almost like another coach out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, in fact, described Campbell as a ``player-coach'' for
the 1998 Aggies. Campbell's season statistics show only seven
catches for 68 yards, but Slocum shudders to think where the Aggies
would be without his locker room influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has been one of those real inspirational, heart and soul
guys. That fieriness and emotional play, that's what allowed him to
be a good leader,'' Slocum said. ``If you had a team full of guys
like that, you wouldn't lose many games.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not by accident that Campbell, a player who never earned
all-conference credentials during his college career, plays as big
a role in directing the Aggies' fortunes as linebacker Dat Nguyen,
winner of the 1998 Lombardi and Bednarik awards. Campbell began
asserting himself in the wake of a 51-15 loss to Texas that ended
the 1996 season because he ``never wanted to go 6-6 again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely cannot stand to lose. That day, I decided I was
going to do what I could do to be a leader on this team, and it's
kind of grown from there,'' said Campbell, who addresses the team
on a daily basis but saves his emotional appeals for big games.
</P>
<P>
   The last one he gave was before the Aggies' 36-33 victory over
then-unbeaten Kansas State in the Big 12 title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting there and I decided, `It's time for me to
say something,' '' Campbell said. ``So I called everybody into the
shower and told them that ... I loved them, that I'd do anything
for them. That I was going to give 110 percent of myself and
expected them to do the same. I told them that for big games,
you've got to have big plays. And we had a lot of big plays in that
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies also won, earning a trip to the Sugar Bowl. To knock
off the favored Buckeyes, A&AMP;M figures to need some extra emotional
ammunition. Campbell will be the guy to light the fuse. Nguyen said
he'll be listening, as always.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's a huge part of our success,'' Nguyen said. ``He's one of
those guys that, if you went to war, he'd protect us before he
protects himself. When he talks, everybody will listen because he's
been there. I respect him and everybody does. He was born to be a
leader, it seems like.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also is a hidden reason why an A&AMP;M team that is 5-1 in
games decided by a touchdown or less is in position to win its 12th
game of an improbable, yet unforgettable, season.

INJURED COYOTES WILL TEST STARS TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Go ahead, admit it _ tonight's showdown
between the Stars and Phoenix Coyotes has lost a little bit of its
luster.
</P>
<P>
   With the Coyotes' top line of Jeremy Roenick (concussion), Keith
Tkachuk (broken rib) and Dallas Drake (suspension) not expected to
play, the battle between the NHL's two winningest teams isn't quite
the New Year's Day bowl-stealer it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell that to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it could be an even tougher game without them,''
Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said of the Coyotes' injured trio.
``Last year, when we had all of our injuries, we played some of our
best hockey of the season because everybody stepped it up a notch.
I'm sure they'll be the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest injury twist only adds another layer to the quietly
rumbling rivalry that is building between the Stars and Coyotes
this season. Longtime divisional rivals who have squared off 78
times since 1979, the Stars and Coyotes will meet six times this
season. So far, they have split two games in Dallas _ a 2-1 Stars
victory on Oct. 11 and a 2-0 victory by Phoenix on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Since that meeting in early November, the Stars and Coyotes have
soared to the top of the NHL standings, with the Stars (22-5-6)
ranking first and the Coyotes (21-7-4) second in winning
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to stoke any rivalry, but a little sticking point
in the NHL playoff scenario has both sides watching the standings
even closer. Because division winners receive the top three seeds
in each respective conference, the second-place team in the Pacific
Division can be seeded only as high as No. 4 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs started today, the Coyotes would be seeded
behind the Northwest Division leading Colorado Avalanche, despite
having nine fewer losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stupid rule, but it's a rule we have to play by,''
Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``I mean, we're not thinking
about the playoffs right now, it's too early. But we know it's a
four-point game, and it could be big at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, Sydor means that the Stars can not only take two
standings points with a victory, but also can take two potential
points away from the Coyotes. Conversely, a loss would mean Phoenix
is two steps closer to catching the Stars for first in the Pacific
Division. And that speaks nothing to the psychological implications
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we play against the Red Wings or Dallas, we've got to
compete with those guys,'' Coyotes winger Jim Cummins said of an
up-and-coming Phoenix team which is still trying to prove it
belongs among the NHL elite. ``And not only compete, but beat those
guys, so that when we do meet in the playoffs, we can play them
with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said the Coyotes have much to
gain from a victory tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the job done against them \Rwithout our injured
players\S, it will mean a lot to the team,'' Tverdovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hitchcock is in on the mental edge of the game. The Coyotes
boast the league's second best home record at 11-2-1 and recently
had an 11-game home winning streak snapped by the Los Angeles
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, we're disappointed that LA beat Phoenix,''
Hitchcock said. ``They hadn't lost in so many home games, and we
wanted to be the team to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of logic that ensures this isn't just another
game, even if Roenick, Tkachuk and Drake are sidelined. The Coyotes
still have one of the most talented, free skating group of
defenseman in the league and have talented young forwards in Daniel
Briere and Brad Isbister. They'll be getting the Stars on the
second night of back-to-back games and there still is that matter
of a certain ``source'' quoted in the ``Arizona Republic'' a month
ago. The nameless accuser questioned the Stars' chemistry and said
one of the Stars players said he felt like taking a swing at
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't forgotten that,'' said center Brian Skrudland, one
of the many Stars players who called the rumors bunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I heard one of the Coyotes players was thinking of
taking a swing at Schoenfeld,'' he added sarcastically. ``Go ahead
and print that.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the rivalry begin.

BIG PLAYS SACK UP THE SUN FOR FROGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ A huddle of defensive players had formed on
TCU's sideline, waiting for a final word from cornerback Andre
Bruce before going in for another series midway through the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He had a simple message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said that somebody needed to make a play,'' Horned
Frogs safety Curtis Fuller said. ``We needed a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, TCU got a couple.
</P>
<P>
   TCU got back-to-back sacks of Southern California signal caller
Carson Palmer and then a stop for no gain to wrest back control of
a game that until then seemed to be turning USC's way.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by that defensive series, TCU held on for a 28-19
victory against USC in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single play usually turns a game,'' Frogs defensive end
London Dunlap said. ``What that play is, you never know. I hope my
play had a little of that game-turning impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A little, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's seemingly invincible 28-3 lead had dissolved into a very
vulnerable 28-19 margin. Southern California had scored on
back-to-back-to-back series, and were passing at will on TCU's
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   So when TCU faltered again, necessitating another Frogs punt and
giving USC another chance, Palmer said he felt TCU dangling
dangerously close to collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could feel it,'' Palmer said. ``I thought we were going to
march right down the field and score. I got sacked a couple of
times and the momentum completely dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap leveled him for a 2-yard loss, then combined with Raymone
Lacey to yank Palmer down for a 6-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   So USC needed 18 yards, and went to where yards had been easy to
come by _ by throwing on Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer dumped a little screen pass to R. Jay Soward. He needed
only to get by Bruce for a big gain. Instead, Bruce leveled him for
no gain.
</P>
<P>
   He had followed his advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I said that, Curtis Fuller looked at me and said `You
make a play,' '' Bruce said. ``He was right. USC had been going
after me all game, and gotten some big plays. It was my turn to
make a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU's defense had plenty of big plays until then, holding USC to
its worst rushing day in school history (negative-23 yards),
holding USC to a single field goal in the first half and mainly
holding USC at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Then the plays started to come, Palmer started to get warm, and
TCU looked to be close to folding.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I felt it slipping away,'' Frogs defensive
tackle J.W. Wilson admitted. ``Andre was right, though. We just
needed to make a play. He said it was in our hands and we grabbed
it back.''

BIG WIN COULD SIGNIFY THE START OF A PURPLE REIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The game was over and, being blushingly new at
these things, the Family Frog _ TCU players, coaches and fans alike
_ didn't seem to know whether to leave the field quietly or just
stand there and shout.
</P>
<P>
   So they wandered from one pair of hugging arms to another.
Coaches hugging players. Fans hugging coaches. Cheerleaders hugging
tuba players, as if this was some giant Hollywood dream that none
of them ever wanted to end.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen months ago, as the athletic director was reminding
someone, the TCU football program had stood on this very spot. It
had lost to Texas-El Paso in this same stadium to fall to 0-10 for
the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have believed,'' Eric Hyman asked yesterday, ``that
we would have been back in this same place for the Sun Bowl just
one year later, beating Southern Cal?''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Southern Cal. Standing on the field, hugging and
celebrating, some of the Family Frog stole peeks at the scoreboard
again, just to make sure it was still real _ TCU 28, Southern Cal
19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Cal, Notre Dame _ it was teams like that that we all
watched when we were growing up,'' quarterback Patrick Batteaux
said. ``This is big stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is big stuff. Regardless of how it happened, regardless of
how the blase Trojans viewed the matchup, regardless of whether the
6-5 Frogs even deserved to be in a bowl game in the first place,
the fact is that TCU toppled one of college football's
card-carrying giants here yesterday. And did it in convincing
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that TCU won a bowl game (1957), its coach, Dennis
Franchione, was in first grade.
</P>
<P>
   So now he shivered, his teeth chattering as he talked, because
people wearing black shirts had dumped a New Year's Eve toast of
Gatorade on him because, rumor had it, this is what players do to
coaches when they win a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to forgive the Frogs, but no one left behind a 1957
bowl celebration manual.
</P>
<P>
   So now they signed autographs for strangers, and they posed for
pictures _ even Franchione _ with guys who were wearing togas and
spiked purple hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the bar real fast,'' said TCU's first-year
chancellor, Dr. Michael Ferrari. ``It raises it all for the whole
university, not only in athletics but in everything else we're
going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really says that we can compete at any level, with any
major university in the country, on the field and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold that thought for a moment. Not to spoil the party or
anything, but USC came out yesterday and looked bored.
Half-interested. Even when Batteaux and TCU bolted to a 21-0 lead,
you almost expected to see the Trojans, wearing sombreros, sunning
on the Sun Bowl bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard all kinds of things,'' said Basil Mitchell, whose
185 rushing yards earned him the game's MVP trophy. ``Some people
said that they weren't even practicing for us. We didn't know. We
really didn't care. We knew how hard we were working, and that was
all that mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had given it to us _ a few of them _ all week long,
saying stuff like, `Y'all don't even belong here,' '' TCU safety
Curtis Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, 16-point favorites, did indeed practice,
eyewitnesses confirmed. But they seemed to be baffled by what
Franchione and Batteaux were trying to do with the quarterback
option. USC had faced only one other option team during the 1998
regular season _ Notre Dame _ and the Irish had played that game
without their No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Franchione and his staff had finished studying the
Trojans game film, the light bulb was on. ``There was a script
there for us to win,'' the head coach said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, it seemed, gravely underestimated TCU's speed,
especially in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we scored on them on the first possession,'' safety
Fuller said, ``you could see them saying, `Omigosh. What's going
on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Until some dashing young team with a Malibu tan proves to me
otherwise, I'm going to remain convinced that all Pac-10 teams _
and most Big 10 ones _ have eyes only for their great-granddaddy,
the Rose Bowl. When the Trojan horse was gutted and examined here
yesterday, only about 1,500 fans poured out. The Trojan players
seemed to react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our players that the pressure was on Southern Cal,''
Franchione said. ``I told them that if we could get to the fourth
quarter and were close, tied or ahead, that the pressure would
really be on them, not us. They were the ones that were supposed to
win, and win convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   As quarterback Batteaux put it, ``We didn't have anything to
lose. We played free, loose. The pressure was all on USC.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Frogs, this was, indeed, big stuff. A 6-5 team, the Sun
Bowl's chosen one of the Western Athletic Conference litter, didn't
have to look a gift Trojan horse in the mouth when it was tendered
the postseason invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the game provided, according to Franchione, ``a great
boost for us in so many ways. Great for the university. Great for
the goals we want to set for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And great for our fans. Even they had to learn to believe in
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end yesterday, the east side of the stadium was awash in
proud purple. TCU fans, watching the final seconds expire, didn't
know whether to storm the field or just stand there and wipe away
the happy tears from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The long road back from 1-10 finally ended yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to hug the tuba player. Let history record that this
was big stuff.

SYDOR PLEASE TEAMMATES, BUT NOT HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk says teammate Darryl Sydor
is playing so well, he should garner consideration for the award
given to the NHL's top defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch Syd every game, he's been great,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``Darryl Sydor is geting better and better every year, and I
think it's time the league has to start looking at him as a
potential Norris Trophy winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor doesn't agree. While the 26-year-old leads the NHL in
defensemen scoring with 27 points before last night's game, he said
he's more concerned that his plus-minus is at minus-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the stat, and I believe mine should be better,''
Sydor said of the statistic that measures goals scored when a
player is on the ice in an even-strength situation. ``I've been on
the ice for far too many goals against.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor's minus-5 is the worst on the Stars. Even more alarming,
it comes on the heels of last season's plus-17 and a career-best
plus-37 in 1996-97. SKRUDLAND RETURNS Stars center Brian Skrudland,
who missed two games with a strained back, returned to the lineup
last night and played on a line with Dave Reid and Guy Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Severyn still is sidelined by a back injury. Dan Keczmer
and Sergey Gusev were healthy scratches. WILSON PLAYS Bruins winger
Landon Wilson played last night for the fourth time in his career
against the Stars _ a somewhat special moment because he is the son
of Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Landon, 23, was called up recently from the Bruins minor-league
team In Providence, R.I. and played his second game of the season.
ROENICK RESTLESS Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick told the
``Arizona Republic'' Wednesday that he would like to play in
tonight's game against the Stars in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they let me,'' he said. ``They told me no, but you know
me, I'll keep digging.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld said he did not expect Roenick in
the lineup. When told about Roenick's desire to play, Schoenfeld
quipped: ``It sounds like he's suffering from post-concussion
syndrome.'' TICKETS AVAILABLE The Stars last night played host to
their 13th consecutive sellout of 16,928.
</P>
<P>
   They will on Monday open single-game ticket sales to games in
March and April. Tickets range from $14-$50. Call 214-GO-STARS.
NEXT FIVE Today at Phoenix, 8 p.m. Wednesday vs. Vancouver, 7:30

CUE THE QUARTERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The week leading up to today's 63rd Southwestern Bell
Cotton Bowl kickoff has brought us snippets of a more relaxed and
personable Jackie Sherrill at Mississippi State. It has also
brought the ever-bubbly Mack Brown, who has been rewarded for a
magical first season at Texas with a new 10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Compliments and expressions of admiration for innovative and
productive schemes have abounded from the teams' respective
offensive and defensive co-ordinators. Players and coaches have
extolled the virtues of the Longhorns' Heisman Trophy-winning
running back, Ricky Williams, and his hard-hitting counterpart,
James Johnson, the leading rusher in the Southeastern Conference
despite injuries that limited his production during the final three
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   All things appearing to be equal, despite Texas' status as a
touchdown favorite at this morning's 10:15 kickoff, center stage
belongs to Opie Taylor and Chris Rock look-alikes _ quarterbacks
Major Applewhite of Texas and Wayne Madkin of Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the key to today's game in the opinions of many _
Sherrill included.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two teams are similar in a lot of phases, and I really
feel it's going to be a good matchup,'' Sherrill pointed out.
``We're not going to stop Ricky Williams because no one else has.
The difference in the game is going to be which quarterback plays
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have had remarkable redshirt-freshman seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile Madkin unseated a senior, started the last nine games
and led the Bulldogs late when Johnson nursed a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``His development has been much like Major's,'' Brown said.
``When they are that young, you can take a guy and build on what he
does. He's a much better player at the end of the year than he was
at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite stepped in for injured fifth-year senior Richard
Walton and the Longhorns' passing attack blossomed. He set freshman
school passing records with 2,453 yards and 18 touchdowns _ both
No. 2 on the school's all-time list. Receivers Wane McGarity and
Kwame Cavil became Texas' most productive receiving tandem ever
(109 receptions for 1,862 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Combined with Williams' 2,124 yards rushing, the quarterback Big
12 coaches voted freshman of the year and the Bomb Squad turned the
Longhorns' offense into one of the nation's most balanced and
potent attacks that ranked 11th nationally in both total offense
(470.6) and scoring (36.3).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to make fun of Major,'' McGarity said. ``He's
short, a baby-faced freshman, red-haired and he looks like Opie.
But the guy performs. He's not a rookie anymore. Everyone's tried
to rattle Major. The way he's responded is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything the remarkably poised Applewhite has learned will be
tested by the Bulldogs' jumping-around, chaos-creating defensive
scheme led by all-out pass rushing defensive end Edward Smith (12
sacks).
</P>
<P>
   ``Major will get a chance to see probably more than he's ever
seen this year in one game,'' Sherrill predicted, tipping the
Bulldogs' defensive game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They base their defense on confusion and they have been known
to blitz a lot,'' Applewhite said. ``But both the Ryan brothers
\RRex, former defensive coordinator at Oklahoma and Rob, defensive
coordinator at Oklahoma State\S love to blitz. OU blitzed the whole
game. And I think \Rplaying those two teams\S gave me a good
preview of what it's going to be like in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas defeated Oklahoma, 34-3, and won a shootout with Oklahoma
State, 37-34.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he's given up worrying about Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA \Rwhen he relieved Walton\S wasn't a problem because he
didn't think he was going to play,'' Brown said. ``We all worried
about how he would perform at Kansas State. And though it didn't
work out for us overall, he did OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we all worried about Oklahoma, and I thought he did well
against every blitz known to man. We worried about Texas A&AMP;M, and,
gosh, on the \Rwinning\S drive he was about as good as you can be.
So, I don't think he'll be any different \Rtoday\S. He's got some
gray in that red hair now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are counting on adding a few more strands today.

BELIEF IN THEMSELVES GIVES FROGS A DAY IN THE SUN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ TCU coach Dennis Franchione paused for a
second, a crowd bustling behind him at Sun Bowl Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, he looked so much like a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   His hands jammed into his pockets, his gaze focusing on shoes,
his eyes dancing mischievously, his smile flashing uncontrollably
as he talked of TCU's 28-19 upset of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione had a little boy-like faith to go along with his
little boy-like look, saying he believed all along that TCU's Sun
Bowl victory against USC to be inevitable instead of improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we always believed we could win. I really do,''
Franchione said. ``We were like `The Little Engine That Could.' The
more people told them they couldn't do it, the more they believed
they could.''
</P>
<P>
   The little team that could did so again.
</P>
<P>
   They did so by rushing for more yards than the program with the
running back tradition, by playing better defense than the program
with the Butkus Award winner, by getting bigger plays than the
program that had built a season around them, by getting their first
bowl victory since 1957 against one of the winningest bowl programs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' Trojans R. Jay Soward said. ``It's
mind boggling. We lost to TCU. We're better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Frogs proved they were better than them.
</P>
<P>
   They say they did it by simply believing that they could do what
everybody told them they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody think we were going to win this game?'' Frogs
tailback Basil Mitchell said. ``We heard it all week, and we
finally figured we could either just give up or prove them wrong.
We decided to prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He rushed for 185 yards, second-best in Sun Bowl history,
including scoring TCU's first two touchdowns en route to earning
game MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   TCU rushed for 314 yards while USC had a school-worst minus-23
yards on the ground. USC seemed befuddled as much by TCU's
defensive line as by its option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask coach \RFranchione\S if I can come and study
his option game,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``It's something
that's foreign to our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   USC covered Mitchell to prevent him from burning them, so Frogs
signal caller Patrick Batteaux simply took over. Batteaux finished
with 94 yards and two touchdowns, his last coming right after
halftime and giving TCU a 28-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   USC (8-5) made adjustments, basically shutting down the Horned
Frogs option attack in the second half and peppering their
secondary with long passes. Trojans quarterback Carson Palmer threw
for two touchdowns to pull the Trojans to within 28-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (7-5) were challenged, but didn't fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ever doubted whether or not we were going to
win this game,'' Frogs defensive end Kam Hunt said. ``You don't
come from where we came from and get to where we got to by
doubting.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU finished 1-10 last season, the single victory coming in Week
11 of a long, long season. Players feared another long season.
After all, a new coach was coming in and though nobody would say
so, it looked like a long rebuilding project.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Horned Frogs finished with six victories more than
last season. The Sun Bowl victory ended their season with a 7-5
mark. Only Louisville had a similar turnaround, going from 1-10
last season to 7-5 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs wrote the script that nobody thought was possible, and
then yesterday, they added the ending that nobody except for maybe
the Frogs themselves dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   You see, they know how the story of the Little Engine That Could
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't quit until you get to the top, until you've achieved
what you set out to achieve,'' Mitchell said. ``The obstacles just
make it that much sweeter.''

   IRVING, Texas _ The prospects of Cowboys cornerback Deion
Sanders playing in tomorrow's NFC wild-card playoff game against
the Arizona Cardinals increased yesterday after his most
encouraging workout since straining his left big toe 61/2 games
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Sanders do rehabilitation work on the practice
field under the watchful eyes of Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer for the
third consecutive day, but he participated in some drills with the
first-team defense _ even flashing glimpses of his old brilliance
by breaking up a couple of passes.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, Sanders said his toe felt fine, but wanted to
see how it felt last night and today to the workout. As for his
playing status, he reverted to the biblical passage he has been
pointing to all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always encouraged,'' said Sanders, who left practice
early. ``Remember what I said, with God all things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is still listed as doubtful for the game on the team's
injury report. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said the team wants to see
how he feels today and at game time tomorrow before making a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith is slated to start at Sanders' right cornerback
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some work on the field and moved around better than I'd
seen him in a while,'' Gailey said. ``It will be a game-time
decision as to what he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Gailey tried his best to downplay the magnitude of
Sanders' progress, partly because ``you can't get excited, because
if you do that, you get too disappointed if he's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's talking about having to make a decision about Sanders
just a few days after all but ruling him out of the game seems to
indicate progress. The fact that he is still listed as doubtful
shouldn't be looked at as a negative either _ considering that
Cowboys guard Everett McIver went from ``doubtful'' to the starting
lineup against Seattle last month.
</P>
<P>
   Maurer was also pleased with Sanders' work yesterday and said it
was all part of the plan that they established when Sanders
returned from being evaluated in Palm Beach, Fla., by foot
specialist Dr. Bill Hamilton on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to show that he can do the functional drills in a team
atmosphere,'' Maurer said. ``He did almost everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' return would certainly be a boost for the Cowboys'
defense against the Cardinals. The Cowboys have been a different
team since his absence.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ranked seventh in the league overall and 13th
against the pass during the first nine games with Sanders on the
field. Since his injury against the Cardinals on Nov. 15, the
Cowboys have dropped to 19th overall and 22nd against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can see him out there practicing, it's
encouraging,'' strong safety Darren Woodson said. ``We learned to
play without him. And we've gotten better. We have to go into this
game prepared to play without him. But we are a better team with
him.''

CLOUTIER EARNS PRAISE, IF NOT VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ During the Rangers' unsettling 3-1 loss to the Coyotes
in Phoenix on Wednesday night, it was easy to overlook Dan
Cloutier, the rookie goaltender. Playing in the place of the
first-stringer, Mike Richter, and making his first start since the
night before Thanksgiving, Cloutier stopped 23 of 26 shots. His
best efforts came in the first period, when the Rangers were
overwhelmed but emerged with a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Richter was expected in the nets Thursday night when the Rangers
played the Colorado Avalanche in the third game of a four-game
trip. But Patrick Roy, the star goalie of Colorado, was not
expected to play because of a sprained left knee. Craig Billington
was to play instead.
</P>
<P>
   After the game in Phoenix, Rangers Coach John Muckler harshly
criticized his team for its lack of intensity after three days off.
He spoke specifically of John MacLean failing to score on a
breakaway, of Kevin Stevens missing an open net and of Todd Harvey
turning over the puck, which helped create the final goal for the
Coyotes, at the 12-minute mark of the third period. But Muckler had
words of praise for Cloutier, who has made seven starts among his
nine appearances and has a record of 2-3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played real well,'' Muckler said. ``He gave us a chance to
win. And we didn't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cloutier's challenges were from close range against a
Phoenix team playing without its top line of Jeremy Roenick, Keith
Tkachuk and Dallas Drake. The first two are injured; Drake is under
suspension. Despite the missing stars, the Coyotes cycled the puck
in the Rangers' end and often seemed a step quicker and more
aggressive than the visitors. Cloutier stopped Rick Tocchet from
right in front a few times, although Tocchet later scored the
winning goal on one of his five shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready mentally,'' Cloutier said. ``I played the way I am
capable of playing. Obviously, I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not lobbying for more work, although he would not turn it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you'd like to play every night,'' Cloutier said.
``You feel more comfortable when you play night in and night out. I
think it's important for me to be well prepared because I don't
know when I'm going to play. I take it one day at a time and tell
myself, in my mind, `Maybe I will get a start soon. Just be ready.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we didn't have the results, but it's another game
and more experience for me. Every time I get a chance to play, I'm
pretty thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier, 22, is 6 feet 1 inch and 192 pounds and a first-round
choice from the 1994 draft. Because he is a top prospect with a
growing reputation, Cloutier's name is often heard in trade rumors.
The Rangers last summer signed Richter to a four-year contract for
more than $5 million a season. So, the theory goes, why not trade
Cloutier in a package for a sharpshooting wing, one of the team's
many shortcomings?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's defeat was the third in four games for the
Rangers, and the sixth in their last eight. Although the score was
close, the domination by the Coyotes, particularly in the first
period, was reminiscent of last season, when the Rangers seemed to
lose their spirit and failed to make the playoffs for the first
time since 1993. The loss in Arizona left them three games below
.500 with the midseason mark just two weeks away. If the playoffs
were to begin today, the Rangers would not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   They will finish the trip on Saturday night in St. Louis. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A PRIVATE LINE FOR THE ROSE BOWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the other college bowls succumbed first, to the likes of
Fedex, Nokia, USF&AMP;G, Jeep, CompUSA, Tostitos, Carquest,
Chick-fil-A, Culligan, Toyota and Insight.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rose Bowl seemed immune to having a corporate name
attached to it, playing the role of the anti-Poulan Weed Eater
Independence Bowl. Not anymore. As viewers will see at 4:30 p.m.
Friday, the good old Rose Bowl is now the Rose Bowl Presented by
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T affixed itself to the Rose Bowl as part of ABC's
seven-year, $500 million deal to carry the four Bowl Championship
Series games. For the last few years, ABC carried only the Rose and
Sugar Bowls and CBS the Fiesta and Orange. But with ABC's money
came the right to market sponsorships for the bowls. And only the
Rose lacked a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of choice,'' said Jack French, the Rose
Bowl's chief executive officer. ``The requirement was to let a
sponsor put up the money to raise payouts to the teams by 30 or 40
percent.'' French said that joining the legion of the sponsored is
the cost of doing business these days. ``If you don't make dust,
you eat dust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Rose Bowl payouts to Michigan and Washington
State, and their conferences, the Big 10 and Pacific 10, totaled
$18.5 million. This year, UCLA, Wisconsin and their conferences
will share $24.8 million, a 34 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mandel, a spokesman for ABC Sports, said: ``We wanted to
tread lightly and while we had the right to pick a sponsor, in
reality, we wouldn't choose a sponsor without the Rose Bowl's
agreement. We were on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is paying an estimated $9.5 million for its sponsorship fee
and commitment to buy commercial time, said Lesa Ukman, editor of
IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago-based publication. The sum is
similar to what Nokia, Tostitos and Fedex are paying for the Sugar,
Fiesta and Orange Bowls, although AT&AMP;T does not have a title
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is being treated like a title sponsor, even though
they're only the presenting sponsor, because they're borrowing the
prestige of the Rose Bowl,'' Ukman said.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual feature of the sponsorship will be the absence of
AT&AMP;T's name or logo on the Rose Bowl field. But French said
electronic insertion technology will place AT&AMP;T icons on the field,
which will be visible to viewers, not the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being done very tastefully,'' French said about AT&AMP;T's
involvement. ``It's different enough from title sponsorships
because we kept our name first.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, the Hall of Fame Bowl saw its name replaced by a
sponsor's, the Outback Steakhouse restaurant chain, when the game
was renamed the Outback Bowl. Unlike AT&AMP;T, Outback will have its
name on the field and on signs in Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa, Fla.
The game, between Penn State and Kentucky, will be played Friday at
11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The College Hall of Fame was disappointed to lose its name on
the game, but this is a big business,'' said Jim McVay, executive
director of the Outback Bowl. ``Schools demand more dollars and you
have to find the money.'' Cash from Outback helps provide about $2
million each for Penn State, Kentucky, and the Big 10 and
Southeastern Conferences.
</P>
<P>
   McVay is more than happy to be with a second-tier bowl with a
solid matchup, especially with attention focused on the Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch, a prospective No. 1 pro draft pick. And
Outback _ renowned for sponsoring John Madden's bus _ is happy to
reinforce its college sports spending with a bowl game in its
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``College sports affect our loyalty and bonding with
consumers,'' said Nancy Schneid, Outback's vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose and Outback bowls are two of 23 bowls in a gridiron
orgy that began Dec. 19 with the Las Vegas Bowl and will end Monday
night with the Fiesta. Yes, it seems like a glut, and we would
surely survive without half of them, but somebody's watching. About
1.1 million households tuned in to the Dec. 23 Ford Motor City Bowl
and 3.7 million watched Purdue upset Kansas State in the Builders
Square Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings tend to be a function of matchups, timing or competitive
games. The Motor City Bowl's rating fell 63 percent, the
Insight.com Bowl jumped 29 percent, and the Alamo Bowl rose 26
percent. A blowout in the Micron PC Bowl (formerly the Blockbuster
Bowl, formerly the Carquest Bowl) caused a 32 percent ratings drop.
</P>
<P>
   Will the BCS' decision to create an annual matchup of the two
top-ranked teams cause viewers to forsake the other three top
bowls? The Rose has done well whether or not its outcome affected
national rankings. But the Sugar, Orange and Fiesta Bowl ratings
have gyrated, depending on their broader significance. The Fiesta's
Tennessee-Florida State game should do very well this year because
this is its turn in the four-game rotation to play host to the
national championship. But will the other games matter to viewers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bowls put together matchups that make sense,'' Mandel
said. ``It's like a rock concert where the finale is the high point
but the songs until then are pretty good, too.''  &QL;

SOWARD LEANS TOWARD STAYING AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward told his father that
he would return to school following the Trojans' 28-19 loss to
Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl, but as is usually the case with
Soward, the final word will come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's staying... but I still need to talk to him,''
Rodney Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   R. Jay Soward told reporters Thursday that he wasn't sure if he
would return to USC for his senior season, although he tried to
fool everyone by flatly stating that he would turn pro. It was a
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a couple days, he'll change his mind,'' USC
linebacker Chris Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had six receptions for 64 yards, and one carry for 1 yard
against TCU.
</P>
<P>
   Although Soward told his father he wants to return, Rodney
Soward appeared less certain about what he will advise his son to
do. This is a departure from Tuesday, when he said he hoped his son
would return.
</P>
<P>
   Among Rodney Soward's concerns is that his son will be USC's
only veteran receiver next season, allowing teams to double-team R.
Jay every game. The elder Soward would also like his son's role to
expand beyond running deep pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   Soward must make his final decision by Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne press conference set: USC linebacker Chris Claiborne
said he will hold his press conference Tuesday to make his official
announcement whether he will turn pro. Claiborne was having a hard
time masking his intentions following the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main thing is you only get drafted once and you may not be
able to make up that money if you drop down (the next year),''
Claiborne said. ``(Soward) might not be worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. 985: Tailback Chad Morton's seemingly sure bid to gain 1,000
yards was halted by TCU. Morton was held to 18 yards rushing, and
fell 15 short of 1,000 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: USC not only lost but got beaten up during the
game. Linebackers David Gibson and Darryl Knight suffered
concussions, while defensive tackle Ennis Davis left the game with
a sprained left knee. Safety Ife Ohalete sprained his right ankle
and linebacker Mark Cusano sprained his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl drought: TCU coach Dennis Franchione was asked how it felt
to be the first coach to win a bowl game at the school in 41 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no significance to me. I haven't been here for 41
years,'' Franchione said. ``I can't carry that 41 years on my
shoulders. Maybe if I'd lost seven or eight bowl games, it would.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet revenge: TCU wide receiver Michael Crawford grew up a USC
fan in Orange County, and still owns several USC sweatshirts. So he
was obviously elated by the Horned Frogs' victory. ``I always
wanted to play for these guys but beating these guys was even
better,'' Crawford said.

USC STUNNED BY TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ After a week of receiving red carpet treatment from
the Sun Bowl, USC got run out of town Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Christian University ran the option left. The Horned Frogs
ran it right. They ran it up the middle. And they ran it for 314
yards, en route to a stunning 28-19 victory over the Trojans before
46,612 at Sun Bowl Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As for USC, the Trojans did their best job running after the
game, sprinting off the field so fast, the teams didn't have much
of a postgame handshake.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans certainly didn't do much running during the game.
While TCU picked apart USC's defense like no other opponent this
season, the Trojans' offense amassed minus-23 yards net rushing,
the lowest total in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't ready to go,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``They're offense's speed and quickness surprised us. I thought our
football team was startled in the first half. TCU, they took it to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   A bowl game many feared would be a dud _ because TCU was 6-5 and
a 16-point underdog _ turned out to be one but for the wrong
reasons. TCU built a 21-0 lead as USC seemed completely confused
defending the option and stretched it to 28-3 before the Trojans
mounted a futile comeback.
</P>
<P>
   TCU (7-5) won its first bowl game since 1957, and tied a school
record for most points in a bowl game. The Horned Frogs' team
rushing total was a bowl record and tailback Basil Mitchell's 185
yards ranked second in Sun Bowl history for an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it was a pretty good game for the Trojans
(8-5).
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing nature of the performance, before a national
television audience, quickly ripped open wounds that had seemingly
healed during a respectable regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point in playing is to win. It's not about
individual stats or awards and all that. And we've got guys, some
guys, out there for themselves,'' cornerback Daylon McCutcheon
said. ``They're not ready to step up and give it to the game.
That's going to kill you. Some people came in and took it as a
vacation instead of playing a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect guys to have fun but there's a point where you
overdo it and I didn't think the guys did, but I guess they did,
because they weren't ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon was dumbfounded how his teammates could completely
fall apart after spending nearly a month to prepare for TCU's
option offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys going out there and forgetting what they were
supposed to do,'' McCutcheon said. ``We should have had one guy on
the quarterback, and we'd have two and then somebody would be left
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost predictably, TCU's players felt they received little
respect from USC. ``I think they took us very lightly. We felt like
they didn't respect us a little bit,'' cornerback Greg Walls said.
</P>
<P>
   But more surprising, USC admitted that it either overlooked TCU
or failed to properly motivate itself for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to go back and look and say maybe we did (take
them lightly),'' Hackett said. ``But we didn't think so at the
time. Maybe we have to do the bowl experience differently. This may
inspire us.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were even more emphatic about their failure to
prepare for TCU as hard as they did against Notre Dame in their
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson learned today is no matter who the opponent is,
respect them,'' wide receiver R. Jay Soward said. ``Don't be a
cheerleader during the week. We talked a lot during the week. I
talked a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, though, he said, ``It's mind boggling to me that
we lost to TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   Although TCU quarterback Patrick Batteaux passed just six times,
he dissected the Trojans' defense by tossing the ball to the
tailback at just the right moment, or keeping it and running for
part of his 94 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they're going to run,'' linebacker Chris Claiborne
said. ``I told everyone he wouldn't pass. It's just about making
the play. We didn't set the tone of the game on defense. I think it
given the offense the feeling like, `Oh no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   USC did try to make a comeback, mainly behind freshman
quarterback Carson Palmer, who was sacked six times but passed for
280 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer connected with Billy Miller on a 23-yard pass in the
third quarter, then led the Trojans on a 61-yard drive to cut the
lead to 28-16 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Abrams kicked a 46-yard field goal, and the Trojans defense
made a nice stand to hold TCU. The Trojans then had the ball at
their own 42-yard line, but Palmer was sacked twice and the drive
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would go back on the field and score again but I
got sacked a couple times and you could feel us lose the
momentum,'' Palmer said. ``We knew they would come after us. I had
a lot of time, but I couldn't get it to the receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU took over and ran more than six minutes off the clock,
effectively sealing the fate of the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was just too much to ask to make up such a
large deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 21-0 and the offense couldn't do anything and
(TCU) scored every time they touched the rock,'' Miller said. ``It
was crazy and like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps a nightmare.
