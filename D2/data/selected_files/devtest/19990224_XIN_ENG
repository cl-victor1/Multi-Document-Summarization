<HEADLINE> WTO to Set Up Reference Center in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) will set up a reference center in Dhaka, capital of
Bangladesh, to keep Bangladesh and other least developed countries
(LDCs) posted about the activities of the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Renato Ruggiero, WTO director general,
who arrived here Monday on a two-day visit, while replying to a
question at a press conference here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
A WTO mission would visit Bangladesh next month to evaluate
Dhaka's customs system, and another mission would follow soon to
organize a national workshop on capacity building, the WTO
executive said.
</P>
<P>
On zero-tariff access into the markets of the industrialized
nations, Ruggiero reiterated his support for the plea and said,
"LDCs deserve the access... I don't see any resistance against the
idea of allowing zero-tariff access for them."
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue made some progress both politically and
economically at the international level, and hoped that the matter
would get a concrete shape during the next WTO ministerial meeting
to be held in the United States later this year.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the WTO should not be seen as a "rich
man's club", but it would definitely serve the interest of the
LDCs.
</P>
<P>
"We can't solve all our problems through trade," he said,
adding that the WTO was moving ahead with an integrated approach
with other major international agencies like the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Development
Program for capacity building of the LDCs in education, health and
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs need technical assistance and resources for increasing
their capacity and professional skill in various fields to survive
in the competitive and globalized trade regime, and towards that
end, the WTO would support the Debt Relief Program for the LDCs,
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises to Work Together With Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday met with the congressional leaders of both Democratic and
Republican parties in the White House for the first time in 19
months, promising to work together despite the partisan bitterness
generated by the failed impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
"We all took an oath and I think we intend to follow it,"
Clinton said, when asked by reporters if they could set aside
differences. "We owe it to the American people and I'm looking
forward to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was joined in the Oval Office by House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott -- all of whom voted to impeach or convict the
president. Also present were House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who both voted
against impeachment, along with White House chief of staff John
Podesta.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the Kosovo peace talks, Clinton said "a lot of
progress'' had been achieved but that ``there are still some
important disagreements."
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with the leaders to hash out legislative priorities
from Social Security to education and to review administration
policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
All sides said that they are looking for consensus on domestic
issues as the president and Congress try to put the impeachment
process behind them.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Albanian Delegates Accept Contact Group Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of
ethnic Kosovo Albanians gave a positive response to the proposals
Tuesday afternoon on settling the Kosovo conflict presented by the
six-nation Contact Group, said diplomatic sources close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
But the Albanian delegates have asked for a 15-day pause to
consult the militants of Kosovo Liberation Army in the field, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the Kosovo talks held here is still uncertain
after the deadline fixed by the Contact Group for the Serbs and
Albanians to strike a deal passed at 15:00 local time.
</P>
<P>
But Western diplomats seemed determined not to let the talks
turn out to be a failure and are planning another conference
elsewhere in France in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the deadline expired, the Serb delegates said
they accepted the political wing of the peace plan, but only
conditionally, because some changes had been made in the text of
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
A clause saying that the voice of the ethnic Albanian people
should be heard after a three-year period has been newly added
into the text, which hint at a self-determination referendum by
Albanians in Kosovo, said the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegation was apparently divided on the last day
of negotiations between the moderates and hard-liners representing
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which sticks to its demand for
independence for Kosovo by demanding a referendum three years
later.
</P>
<P>
But Western countries and Russia seem determined to make the
talks at least a half success and to push the two sides to commit
themselves to a partial agreement already reached.
</P>
<P>
A partial agreement would mean a ceasefire, but comes short of
sending NATO troops to Kosovo and the disarming of the KLA,
described as the two toughest turfs in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats estimate that it would be a major concession
by the Serbs if they agree to substantial autonomy in the Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: 9,000 People Displaced in Latest Kosovo Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Around 9,000 people have fled
their homes as a result of the latest fighting in Kosovo, the
United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst wave of displacement in Kosovo this year,"
spokesman Kris Janowski told a news briefing in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He said fighting on Monday around the village of Vucitrn, about
25 km northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, has prompted
about 4,000 people to flee.
</P>
<P>
"In scattered bits of fighting and skirmishes over the weekend,
we estimate that another 4,000 to 5,000 people were displaced. The
overall figure now stands at 9,000 in a mere three days or so," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting broke out between Kosovo Liberation Army and
Serb forces north of Pristina on Monday, the eve of the deadline
set for reaching a peace deal for the Serb province, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said most of the displaced people have gone to
villages not affected by the fighting, which are already
overcrowded with displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Targets 8 Percent Annual Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt targets an annual economic
growth rate of 8 percent in the early years of next century,
Minister of Economy Youssef Boutros Ghali said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ghali made the remarks at a seminar organized by the Danish
embassy in Cairo on investment and trade relations between Egypt
and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the goal will be attained through
three-proned approaches aimed at propping up the economy.
</P>
<P>
It requires an increase in savings rate to at least 25 percent
compared to the current 18 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
A second condition is to promote export which Ghali said is a
vital cornerstone in ensuring growth of Egypt's economy to create
more job opportunities and improve the people's standard of living.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year of 1997-1998, Egypt's exports rose by 8
percent to 5.331 billion U.S. dollars. But its imports stood at
16.552 billion dollars, with a trade deficit of 11.221 billion
dollars. The country has been taking steps to promote exports by
opening new markets.
</P>
<P>
The third approach is to develop human resources through
relentless efforts to increase the percentage of skilled workers
in various spheres, Ghali said, stressing that all three
approaches must go in tandem.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Egypt's Investment Authority Ibrahim Fawzi told the
seminar that the government is exerting efforts to offer all kinds
of facilities to foreign and Egyptian investors without exception.
</P>
<P>
These include incentives such as tax exemptions, elimination of
red tape and guarantees to transfer profits and capital without
restrictions, Fawzi said.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekistan Blames Religious Extremists for Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov
said Tuesday that religious extremists were behind last week's
bombings in Tashkent that killed 15 people and wounding more than
100 others.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out other explanations, but we already know the
secondary organizers of the acts of terrorism, therefore this
scenario is the main one," Karimov told a press conference in
Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said about 30 suspects have been arrested in
connection with the blasts, but the chief organizers remain at
large.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said the six explosions on February 16, were meant to
kill him, noting that the most powerful explosive device exploded
outside the entrance of the government building in which he was
supposed to attend a conference.
</P>
<P>
The other blasts were meant as distractions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us not only to find the persons directly
involved in the acts of terrorism but to analyze the motive forces
behind them. We must find out who carried out the act, who
financed it, and who is interested in undermining stability in
Uzbekistan," Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to state that foreign intelligence services were
behind the recent acts of terrorism in Tashkent but said the
terrorist acts were organized "not without foreign assistance,"
Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Serbs Ready to Discuss Int'l Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Serb
delegation attending the peace talks on Kosovo said Tuesday
afternoon that Belgrade is from now on ready to discuss an
international presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have rejected the deployment of a NATO-led force in
Kosovo, as has been proposed by the Western countries, to
guarantee the implementation of a political agreement on
substantial autonomy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But Belgrade said it was ready to consider the deployment of a
U.N.-auspiced force.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian delegation made the proposal soon after the Kosovo
Albanian delegation accepted a peace plan presented by the Contact
Group belatedly.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that the Serb delegates addressed a
second letter to the foreign ministers of the Contact Group,
declaring that they are ready to discuss ``the extension and
character of an international presence in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
has already deployed 8,000 verifiers of a ceasefire agreement
signed in October 1998 by Belgrade and the ethnic Albanian
separatists.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegates also said that they accepted the political
wing of the peace plan presented by the Contact Group, on the
condition that the future autonomous status of Kosovo be defined
clearly.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs said that a new clause hinting at a referendum by
ethnic Albanians after a three-year period has been newly added
into the text of the peace proposal, which they cannot accept.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges Fair Trial of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Tuesday expressed
full support of the European Union's position that Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan should be given a fair trial attended by
international observers.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, government spokesman Christos
Stylianides welcomed Monday's statement by EU foreign ministers
which called on Turkey to solve the Kurdish issue through
political means.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides hailed "the EU's strict opposition to the death
penalty and the expectation that Turkey will resolve its problems
by political means with full respect for human rights, the rule of
law in a democratic society and in full accordance with Turkey's
commitments as a member of the Council of Europe."
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers issued the statement after discussing the
Ocalan issue in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, whom Turkey accused of being responsible for the
14-year Kurdish independence fightings in Turkey which claimed
37,000 lives, was arrested by Turkish commandos on last Tuesday
in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He was now held captive in a jail on the Imrali Island
near Turkey's western province of Bursa pending trial.

</P>
<P>
All sides said that they are looking for consensus on domestic
issues as the president and Congress try to put the impeachment
process behind them.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Democratic Governors Association on Monday
night, Clinton offered a vigorous defense of his administration's
continued involvement in the peace processes in the Northern
Ireland, the Middle East, Africa and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
David Leavy, spokesman for Clinton's National Security Council,
said the meeting with leaders of Congress would provide an
opportunity to bring the lawmakers up to date on the status of the
Kosovo talks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was the first time in 19 months that Clinton
had met with the Republican leaders in Congress. With many
Republican lawmakers still smarting from their failed effort to
drive Clinton from office, the session was being seen as a chance
to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president wanted to
focus on his fiscal 2000 proposals to overhaul Social Security and
Medicare, improve education, and pass a patients' bill of rights
and a minimum wage hike.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, The U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and
obstruction of justice, thus concluding a 13-month drama starting
by disclosure of the president's relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Still Pondering Steel Deal With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that it has
not yet made a final decision to reduce steel shipments to the
United States by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
"For us it will be a very difficult decision, one which will
hit Russian producers very hard," First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov told reporters on a tentative agreement reached a few
days ago with the U.S. in Rome so as to avert U.S. punitive
actions on Russian steel products.
</P>
<P>
Washington accuses Russia of dumping steel in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide whether to reduce steel exports to the U.S.,
or to agree to a serious increase in tariffs on steel exported to
the U.S., which also affects the interests of Russian producers,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Maslyukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, quoting a high-ranking government representative,
said a tentative agreement coordinated by the two sides is
expected to be signed before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will be signed even though it goes against
Russia's interests," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Experts in the Economics Ministry said reduced access of
Russian steel to the U.S. market, as stipulated in the agreement,
will hurt the export opportunities of the country's leading
metallurgical enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, the compromise will at least save part of the American
market for Russia rather than a total blockade, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Russian Ministry of Trade and the U.S.
Department of Commerce began at the end of 1998, when the
introduction of high anti-dumping duties on Russian steel became
imminent.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for sharp cuts in Russian steel exports, the U.S.
promised to close all anti-dumping investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Economics Ministry reports that in 1998, Russian
steel exports to the United States increased by almost 60 percent
than in 1997. About 25 percent of Russian steel exports went to
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Starts Major Offensive on Eritrea: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- "The Ethiopian regime has
launched a large-scale offensive on the Mereb-Setit front Tuesday.
 The ground attack started at 4:30 a.m. this morning," Eritrea's
Foreign Ministry announced in a news release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The release send by the Eritrean Embassy in Kenya to Xinhua
here said Tuesday's attack was "preceded by intensive, though
ineffective, all-day long air-bombardment on the Mereb-Setit front
and Tsorona flanked by Ethiopian Mig fighters planes Monday."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said that the Mereb-setit front
had been relatively quiet from ground fighting for the past two
weeks since Ethiopia's large-scale attacks on February 6 and 7
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had suffered huge losses with "four brigades being
routed", the release declared.
</P>
<P>
It said, Ethiopian bombings near Eritrean trenches on the
Mereb-Setit front at 5:30 a.m. this morning had been "ineffective"
and it happened after the U.S. State Department issued a statement
Monday, expressing "deep regret on the use of air power by
Ethiopia in the current conflict".
</P>
<P>
Washington urged the Ethiopian government to "resume the
moratorium immediately" on air raids brokered by the U. S. last
June.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Ethiopian air force and heavy artillery
units attacked Eritrean position on all three fronts Sunday and
Monday. Fighting between the Horn of Africa neighbors resumed on
February 6 after an eight-month lull.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse
confirmed that fighting was taking place on Tuesday morning, as
Ethiopia tried to regain contested territory which Eritrea
occupied during the first round of the border war in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries fought over the Badme region, a scrubby 400
square km triangle of sparsely-populated land where both sides
claim sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia with Addis' blessing
in May 1993, after a referendum and until last year the two
countries were considered allies.

<HEADLINE> Cote d'Ivoire Withdraws Passports for UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador of Cote d'Ivoire to
Angola Etienne Ezo confirmed here Tuesday that his government has
withdrawn the passports it issued to the members of the Angola's
rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Ezo pointed out that the government of Cote d'Ivoire has
revoked the passports carried by the followers of Jonas Savimbi,
the tough-line leader of the National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) as an act of implementing the United Nations
Security Council resolution of sanctions on the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that his government has notified its
overseas missions and various domestic ports and border
check-points of the withdrawal decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Ezo noted that entire withdrawal needs time because
Cote d'Ivoire issued a lot of passports to the UNITA members due
to specific historical factors.
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War period, Cote d'Ivoire was one of UNITA'S
major supporters in Africa. And the then president Henri Konan
Bedie was an old friend of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in August, 1997,
 demanding that all its members should close the representative
office of the UNITA on their land and they should not grant visa
to the UNITA leaders so as to curb their activities outside
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French Ambassador to Luanda, Andre Cira also said
after meeting with Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda Monday
that France might announce within days the expulsion of Isaia
Samakuva, one of the UNITA leaders.
</P>
<P>
Cira noted that Samakuva, Savimbi's representative to Europe,
has been listed and will be expelled according to the U.N.
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> South Africa's First Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's first
locally designed and manufactured satellite blasted off Tuesday
from an air force base in California, the United States, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was launched at 12:29 p.m. South African time
(10:29 GMT), after 14 failed attempts since January 14 due to poor
weather conditions, said the designer, the Stellenbosch
University, one of South Africa's top- rating universities. African satellite-
an American air force satellite and a Danish
satellite into space.
</P>
<P>
The satellite carried a global positioning system of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United
States, in return for being launched by NASA, a spokesman of the
university said.
</P>
<P>
He said the satellite, named Sunsat, will be freed from its
launch vehicle after one orbit. The satellite's batteries would
be charged whenever the solar panels were exposed to the sun.
</P>
<P>
With a full orbit every 100 minutes, the satellite's batteries
would be charged and discharged about 14 times a day.
</P>
<P>
The Sunsat team at the university's engineering department
expect to receive pictures of the earth's surface, taken by the
satellite's on-board cameras. The data will be used in
environmental research.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Adjusts Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
adjusted certain exchange control limits, including raising the
amount individuals may invest offshore from 400,000 Rand (66,667
U.S. Dollars) to 500,000 Rand (83,333 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the limit on South African institutional investors in their
offshore investments through asset swaps, which is 15 percent of
their total assets, remained unchanged, said the South African
Reserve Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is not any changes in policy on exchange controls. It is
just some adjustments in existing ceilings," South African Press
Association quoted the central bank's governor, Chris Stals, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Stals told the National Assembly's financial committee that
travel allowances for individuals over the age of 12 years would
be raised from 100,000 Rand (16,667 Dollars) to 120,000 Rand
(20,000 Dollars), and allowances for people studying abroad by the
same amount.
</P>
<P>
People would also be able to pay for goods ordered over the
Internet with their credit cards, but this would be limited to
20,000 Rand (3,333 Dollars) a transaction. They would still be
liable for the necessary customs and excise duty.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors would continue to be allowed to invest
offshore up to five percent of the net inflow of funds arising
from their cash transactions from the previous calender year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the asset swap limit had not been raised, Stals
said there was a risk of South Africa losing foreign exchange, as
it was very difficult to ensure that foreign investors did not
immediately sell the South African assets they had swapped in the
local market.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief said although the Reserve Bank had
approved assets swaps totalling 130 billion Rand (21.7 billion
Dollars), companies had taken up only 60 billion Rand (10 billion
Dollars) of this, and it was thus thought unnecessary to alter the
15 percent limit.
</P>
<P>
As people were shying away from emerging markets, it is
difficult to find investors willing to swap foreign investments
for local ones, Stals said.
</P>
<P>
He said over the last two and a half years, individuals in
South Africa had transferred 3.5 billion Rand (583 million
Dollars) offshore, which was minimal when compared with what had
flowed through the bond and equities markets.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urged to Be Tougher on Money-laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Narcotics
Control Board has urged Cyprus to combat money-laundering by
tightening censorship over off-shore banks.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the board about the 1998 drug-combating said
Cyprus has adopted a comprehensive and effective drug control
legislation in line with the international drug control treaties,
the Cyprus News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The board "recommends that the government of Cyprus continue
its efforts to study the extent and patterns of and trends in
drug abuse."
</P>
<P>
The report said that "success as an international offshore
center has made Cyprus vulnerable to international
money-laundering activities."
</P>
<P>
But "the board took note of the action taken by the government
against money-laundering, including the adoption of a legislation
and the establishment of a unit or an advisory authority for
combating money-laundering," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It calls on the Central Bank of Cyprus to carry out its own
inquiries in order to ascertain the legitimacy of off-shore
operators.
</P>
<P>
The board is an independent body responsible for monitoring and
implementing international conventions on Narcotics.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Sets up Detention Center for Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A detention center set up
inside the Central Prison in Nicosia was handed to the police on
Tuesday to temporarily host illegal immigrants, Cyprus's Justice
and Public Order Minister Nicos Koshis said.
</P>
<P>
Koshis said the center has been designed according to
international regulations "so that their stay can be as
comfortable as possible, even if they're here temporarily."
</P>
<P>
The construction of the center costs 90,000 Cyprus pounds
(180,000 U.S. dollars), while another 24,000 pounds (48,000
dollars) will be spent to buy furnishings and 11,000 pounds
(22,000 dollars) to install a closed circuit TV system.
</P>
<P>
However, Koshis expressed the hope that the problem of illegal
immigrants arriving in Cyprus will be solved.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years there has been an increase in the number
of people arriving Cyprus illegally, due to the island's close
proximity of Arab countries. They usually set off for other
countries but are dumped on the island's shores.

<HEADLINE> Germany Warns of EU Crisis and Danger for Euro if </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Dramatic and blunt talks are
expected at a European Union budget reform summit Friday in Bonn
amid fears over a fall in the euro's value if the bloc fails to
"get its act together," senior German officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We must make very clear what the consequences would be if
failing to achieve an agreement," said a senior official speaking
on the condition of anonymity, the Deutsche Pressagentur (dpa)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the 15 European Union (E.U.) states will meet to put
still widely diverging positions - "including all sacred cows" -
on the budget reform negotiating table, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Decisions will not be made at the one-day summit. Instead, the
meeting will allow Germany, which holds the rotating E.U.
presidency, to compile a list of contrasting budget demands.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will then make a marathon tour of
all E.U. capitals from March 15-19 in a bid to hammer out
compromises.
</P>
<P>
Final decisions on the E.U.'s so-called Agenda 2000 - a package
of budget, farm spending and structural aid reforms - will then be
made at a Berlin summit on March 24-25, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Berlin is serious - Berlin is a decision summit," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
A decision by E.U. leaders in Berlin is crucial given that
current Union financial arrangements expire at the end of 1999.
Leaders will have to decide who will pay what for the period 2000
to 2006.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to reach a solution would lead to a European crisis
which would make things worse for all of us," warned one of the
officials.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no resolution we will see a fall in the value of
the euro on (international) markets because markets will
immediately say the Europeans are incapable of getting their act
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Launched last month, the euro has already fallen more than 5
per cent against the dollar. In Frankfurt it fell again Tuesday
and was trading at 1.0979-1.0984 dollars.
</P>
<P>
A further substantial drop in the euro would put pressure on
the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, the officials
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Bonn summit was purposely being kept small and leaders
were only allowed to bring a single advisor, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to talk turkey... this is very
necessary," said an official who predicted "a dramatic element" at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Talks will be held at a government guest house, perched on a
mountain-top on the Rhine River, far from the media centre in a
bid to create a more intimate atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The tangled money issues to be resolved by next month roughly
pit the wealthy, northern E.U. states against the poorer southern
members plus Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest annual net E.U. paymaster, contributing
22 billion marks (13 billion dollars) more to Brussels each year
than it gets back. Other net contributors are the Netherlands,
Sweden, and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland receive large annual net
payment flows from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Bonn wants its annual bill cut but refuses to say by how much.
The officials said demands by the conservative German opposition
for a 7 billion mark cut were too high.
</P>
<P>
All member states would have to make compromises in order reach
an accord and Germany's would be to demand a smaller budget cut
than it deserved and remain a net contributor, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder planned put everything up for debate at the Bonn
summit, they said. "We will talk with the British about their
rebate and the Spanish on cohesion funds."
</P>
<P>
Britain has received a large annual E.U. budget rebate since
1984. Spain received a whopping 55 per cent of the E.U.'s 30
billion mark cohesion fund from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
Asked what a successful Agenda 2000 accord would look like at
the end of the Berlin summit, one of the officials grinned and
said:
</P>
<P>
"Success is when we reach an accord and none of the partners in
Europe are satisfied."

<HEADLINE> Serbs, Kosovo Albanians to Have More Talks from March 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Serbs and
Kosovo Albanians will meet again in France on March 15 to
implement a draft agreement on politically settling the conflict
in Kosovo, announced the Contact Group late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, France,
Britain, Germany and Italy decided to summon the Serbs and
Albanians once again to come to France on March 15 to sign a
political agreement on granting substantial autonomy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
``The parties are engaged to participate in France, from March
15, a conference carrying all the aspects of implementing the
political framework for substantial autonomy of Kosovo,'' French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said quoting a communique of the Contact Group at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the efforts made by all the countries
involved had led to a consensus on a high degree self-rule of
Kosovo, especially on the mechanisms guaranteeing free and fair
elections of democratic government bodies, the protection of human
rights and the rights of the all ethnic groups, and the
establishment of a balanced judicial system in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegates accepted on Tuesday the political wing of a
peace plan by the Contact Group and said they are ready to discuss
an international presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanian delegates also accepted the peace plan but
said they would consult the militants of the Kosovo Liberation
Army in the field before signing it.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Slams Multinationals, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine on Tuesday attacked multinationals and the wealthy for
using loopholes to evade taxes and vowed Germany's centre-left
government would restore tax justice.
</P>
<P>
"It is the working people who carry the main burden of
financing the state," said Lafontaine in a speech to the German
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, multinational corporations and the rich
were evading their responsibility to finance the country through
tax tricks and had been steadily moving their tax rates toward
"zero".
</P>
<P>
"It is and remains the goal of this... government that we want
to restore tax justice," said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
Opposition conservatives accused Lafontaine of purposely hiding
the real level of tax paid by German business and people with
higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
"You are trying to divide German society and boost jealousy in
order to get support for your policy of redistributing wealth,"
said Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democratic alliance budget
policy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Warning against swift wage rises, Lafontaine said wages must
not be allowed to rise faster than productivity.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine predicted German unemployment would fall by between
150,000 and 200,000 during the current year. There are presently
4.2 million jobless in Germany, or 10.9 per cent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
Germany's 1999 federal budget totals 488 billion marks (290
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The biggest chunk of money goes for unemployment and social
welfare benefits - 173 billion marks - an increase of almost 12
per cent over what the former conservative government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl approved for last year.
</P>
<P>
Second biggest recipient is the defence ministry with 47.3
billion marks, a 0.9 per cent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The budget is expected to be passed in its current form despite
the fact that Chacellor Gerhard Schroeder's government has lost
its majority in parliament's upper chamber. The Bundestag, or
lower chamber, is allowed to override the upper house on budget
matters.

<HEADLINE> Assassins of Cleric Captured: Iraqi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said here on Tuesday that some killers of top
Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader have been
captured.
</P>
<P>
"The interrogation is underway and the result will be
announced to the public as soon as it is finished," the minister
said at a news conference before ending his three-day official
visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He did not give further details.
</P>
<P>
He said the accusation of the Iraqi government's involvement in
the slaying is part of a U.S. game designed to create strife in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader and his two sons were killed last Friday night in his
native town of Najaf in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The cleric, appointed by the government as Grand Ayatollah in
1992, has been enjoying high respect among Shiite Muslims, who
account for 65 percent of the country's 22 million population.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader's growing outspokenness and independence had been
irritating to the Iraqi government dominated by the monority Sunni
Muslims represented by President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf denied media reports that riots and clashes had erupted
in the suburbs of Baghdad and southern provinces populated by
Shiite Muslims after al-Sader's death.
</P>
<P>
"There are never riots in Iraq and the reports are used to
serve the interest of the U.S.," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf arrived here Sunday as part of his regional tour, which
has taken him to Yemen and Syria, to explain Iraq's policy on the
current standoff with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched four nights of air strike on Iraq
in mid-December, citing Iraq's non-cooperation with the
U.N. weapon inspectors, who were authorized to oversee Iraq's
elimination of weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council met on Tuesday morning behind closed doors to be briefed
by the U.N. Secretariat on the U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Macedonia, whose mandate will expire on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council will also consider a report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who recommended the extension
of the mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP), for a further period of six months, until August 31.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided in 1992 to send UNPREDEP into
Macedonia to deter threats and prevent clashes from spreading into
other parts of the Balkan region, including the tasks of
monitoring and reporting on illicit arms flows and other
activities that are prohibited under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said, "It is a matter of satisfaction
that, until now, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not
been adversely affected by the conflict in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the bilateral relations of the former Yoguslav
Republic of Macedonia with some of its neighbors have
strengthened," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Although smuggling incidents have been observed, UNPREDEP has
so far not detected any direct evidence of arms smuggling across
the borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with
Albanian or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP currently comprises 1050 people, including military
observers and civilian police, who are mainly from the United
States and European countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A key part of UK's Internet
suffered a severe and surprising blow when a transatlantic cable
breakage took over 24 hours to fix.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Academic Network (Janet), the largest computer
network in Britain, was unable to route e-mails and other
information to and from American over the weekends after a cable
deep below the Atlantic failed.
</P>
<P>
"For a large part of Britain's Internet users it meant that
what they had been assured could never happen, had happened," The
Daily Telegraph said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
It had been widely believed that the Internet, designed to
withstand nuclear attack, would be impervious to failure. However,
the new incident shows that the Internet is not robust enough.
</P>
<P>
Teleglobe International, the telecoms company operating the
cable which Janet uses, said that service had been restored by
late afternoon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Normally, Internet traffic would be re-directed via another
cable but Teleglobe said this did not happen because the volume of
traffic was too high.

BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- European interior ministers
pledged Tuesday to intensify cooperation in fighting Kurdish
extremist violence while criticizing Greece's information policy
in the Abdullah Ocalan case.
</P>
<P>
"Europe cannot be allowed to become a battleground for the
conflict between Turkey and the Kurdish people," said the European
Commissioner for police, immigration, refugees, Anita Gradin,
after a Bonn meeting of interior ministers from nine European
Union (E.U.) states and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily said the E.U. had agreed
to upgrade efforts to prevent Kurdish violence through improved
exchange intelligence and more police cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Schily said the wave of violent Kurdish protests after the
arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkish agents in Kenya
last week had taken all E.U. states by surprise.
</P>
<P>
There was criticism of Greece for having withheld information
that it was sheltering Ocalan at its Nairobi embassy.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek information policy was a big problem for Austria,"
said Austrian interior minister, Karl Schloegl.
</P>
<P>
Schloegl said Greek President Constantinos Stefanopoulos had
been in Vienna for a state visit on the day Ocalan was captured
and that the Greek embassy had still gone ahead with hosting an
open house party for the president.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that even among the most important state
institutions in Greece the lines of communication did not function
well," said Schloegl.
</P>
<P>
Schily said police had detained 2,300 protesters at
demonstrations after Ocalan's capture. Arrest warrants had been
issued for 134 of those detained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish demonstrators attacked 10 diplomatic objects in
Germany, including Israel's consulate in Berlin were Israeli
security guards shot dead three Kurds who stormed the building.

<HEADLINE> Germany Says Kurdish Extremists Remain Threat to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Kurdish Workers
Party remains a serious danger in Europe and far greater efforts
will be needed to crush its logistics, German Interior Minister
Otto Schily said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The willingness to carry out violence by the Kurdish Workers
Party (PKK)... remains a threat to Germany and the European
Union," said Schily in a speech to the German parliament.
</P>
<P>
Germany banned the PKK in 1993 but the group remains active in
the country with a growing membership estimated by domestic
intelligence at 11,000, backed by some 50,000 supporters. There
are about 600,000 Kurds living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We must increase efforts to smash the logistics of the PKK,"
said Schily.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, it remained difficult to estimate the
level of danger posed by the PKK and pledged to increase exchange
of intelligence on the PKK with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Schily said police had detained 2,300 protesters following the
wave of demonstrations after the arrest of PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan by Turkish agents in Kenya last week. Arrest warrants had
been issued for 134 of those detained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish demonstrators had attacked 10 diplomatic objects in
Germany, including Israel's consulate in Berlin were Israeli
security guards shot dead three Kurds who stormed the building.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Schily later met with interior
ministers from nine European Union (E.U.) countries and
Switzerland to discuss ways of attacking PKK structures in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The German interior ministry said the meeting was being held at
a secret location due to security concerns.

<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Water-levels of rivers across
Switzerland sank late Monday because of colder weather, lessening
threats of floods, according to a Swiss news agency report on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Rhine in the country's northern city of Basle is
still closed for shipping due to the high water-level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the lowlands, precipitation came mostly in the
form of snow, which interrupted the continued feeding of the
rivers.
</P>
<P>
The extensive rainfalls on the weekend had led to floodings
especially in northeastern Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In many locations, fire brigades were called in to pump out
basements and appartments and numerous roads had to be closed.

NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings left Accra Tuesday for Washington DC for a four-day
state visit to the U.S. at the invitation of American President
Bill Clinton to strengthen bilateral ties, the Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
the visit reciprocates the historic tour undertaken by President
Clinton in March last year to Ghana and other African countries,
and it is within the context of the increasingly warm relations
between Ghana and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
 It said President Rawlings and his delegation will discuss
with their American counterparts bilateral and multi-lateral
issues of mutual interest,
</P>
<P>
including trade, agriculture, education, energy, security in the
 west African sub-region, the United Nations, problems associated
with the globalization of the world economy and the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
 The statement said a trade agreement is expected to be signed
between the two countries which is designed to set the guidelines
for enhanced mutually beneficial trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
 President Rawlings will address the council on foreign
relations in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings was accompanied by a 14-member delegation, including
the First Lady, Nana Konadu and Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho.
</P>
<P>
Also on the trip are deputy Finance Minister Victor Selormey,
John Abu, Minister of Trade and Industry, and Mohamed Ibn
Chambas, Deputy Minister of Education.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the delegation will also seek to
draw attention of the American authorities, especially the U.S.
Senate, to the important contribution that the African Growth and
Opportunities Act could make in redefining the relationship
between the U.S. and Africa with emphasis on trade and rapid
economic growth in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 It said the U.S. is an important trading partner for Ghana
and a great source of technical assistance, aid and investment
funds.

<HEADLINE> Britain Working on Cyprus Issue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Cyprus David Madden said here Tuesday that Britain is working for
a settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain is pushing for implementation of the U.N.
resolution 1218 on Cyprus which backs Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's efforts for the reduction of tensions and a comprehensive
settlement on the island.
</P>
<P>
Madden made the remarks after meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the purposes of his meeting with Clerides is
"to talk through some of the issues in 1218 and to see what
progress could be made."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Resolution 1218, adopted in December 1998,
sets out "various objectives and things the Security Council
wants to see" and Britain is discussing the resolution "with all
the parties."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Madden said that "obviously, security will be a very important
part of the future settlement. It's up to the two sides here to
talk about the security arrangements which will make them feel
comfortable in a settlement."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Britain supports the deployment of a multinational
force on the island, Madden said this is "one of the ideas on the
table and is being discussed."

Chissano ended a brief visit to Kigali Tuesday after consultations
with his hosts on issues that concern the region, the Rwanda News
Agency (RNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit, Chissano held talks with his Rwandan
counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu and Rwandan Vice-President Major
General Paul Kagame, the RNA said.
</P>
<P>
''I came here with personal interest to be briefed by President
 Bizimungu about the situation in Congo (K) and to seek his
views,'' Chissano was quoted as saying before taking off for
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
''I would like to make it clear that I'm not fulfilling the
mission of anyone,'' the Mozambican president emphasized,
explaining that as Vice- Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), he took the decision personally so
that ''I'll be able to play a more positive, more effective role
whenever I'm called to play that role.''
</P>
<P>
It has not been clearly stated that Chissano was taking the
trip for Zambian President Frederic Chiluba who has been mediating
for an end to the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) without success.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, in his capacity as SADC Vice-Chairman, said that
within the sub-regional organization, efforts are being made to
see how some member states fighting for Congolese President
Laurent Kabila would withdraw their troops, after Congo's internal
problems are solved and the concerns of neighbors are addressed.

<P>
Chissano who was accompanied by his defense minister Angular
Mazula, and foreign minister Loenardo Santos during the visit.
From Kinshasa, the Mozambican president will go to Angola.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 23 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
formally set out a timetable for Britain to join Europe's single
currency Tuesday, but gave no date for scrapping the pound.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to parliament, Blair said the launch of the euro had
gone well and those who predicted disaster had been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted the UK would join a successful European single
currency if it meets the economic conditions it has set out.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is clear: Britain should join a successful
single currency provided the economic conditions are met," Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain had to begin preparing now if it was to retain
the option of joining the single currency. And he promised to seek
approval from parliament to spend money on preparing public sector
computer systems for the changeover.
</P>
<P>
Using the occasion, Blair also urged Europe to speed up
economic reform, saying he shared the worries of people in Britain
who were worried about what kind of euro zone they might be
joining.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real question. We must be sure the EU is moving
forwards, not backwards. There are real problems in the EU and
Britain can play a part in the solution," Blair said.

<P>
ABUJA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The final results from the
Saturday polls in Nigeria showed that the People's Democratic
Party (PDP) has won a majority in the National Assembly which will
take over law-making from the military regime.
</P>
<P>
According to the results announced by the Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) Tuesday, the PDP has secured more
seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives than
those taken by the other two parties.
</P>
<P>
The PDP won 206 seats in the 360-member House and 59 seats of
the 109- member Senate while the All People's Party (APP) and the
Alliance for Democracy (AD), bound by an electoral agreement,
secured 142 house seats and 44 senate seats altogether.

<P>
The INEC said that a by-election would be held on March 6 to

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Close Regional Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Tuesday called for close relations among the Persian Gulf
states on the basis of confidence-building and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Confidence-building and mutual respect are the main parameters
in developing friendly relations among the regional states,
Khatami said in talks with visiting Kuwaiti Information Minister
Yusef Mohammad al-Sumait.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that the regional states will reinforce
their relations on the basis of mutual respect and work for a
better future, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Building confidence will bring about a new horizon in the
region, he said, stressing that an atmosphere should be created
in the region, under which no country can even think about
possible invasion of any other one.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also called for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from the region, saying that the region belongs to
the regional states and presence of foreign forces should be
brought to an end.
</P>
<P>
"The problem now facing us is the ideas of aggression which
unfortunately exist in the region," he said, adding that the
causes of tension would be uprooted through meditation,
solidarity and confidence-building.
</P>
<P>
Terming relations between Iran and Kuwait as "excellent,"
Khatami called for further development of bilateral ties to set a
pattern for other regional states.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran and Kuwait can cooperate in
economic areas, carry out joint venture projects and participate
in reconstruction programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the slump in oil prices, which has dealt a serious
blow to the oil producing countries, Khatami expressed hope that
the member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will realize the current crucial situation and do what
they can to protect their national assets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Sumait said Kuwait is willing to develop relations
with Tehran and Crown Prince Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah will visit Iran soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kuwaiti delegation accompanying him has held
useful talks with Iranian scholars and cultural figures, hoping
this will serve to promote cultural relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Khatami's proposal for dialogue among
civilizations, he said Khatami's cultural tenet will help boost
friendly relations between the nations and governments.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap Reaches Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 23 (Xinhua) - The latest figures released by
the Office of National Statistics Tuesday show britain's trade gap
with the rest of the world reached a record high last year.
</P>
<P>
The gap, the difference between the value of exports and
imports, widened to reach a record 33 billion US dollars in 1998,
the biggest for nine years.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that the figures also give a strong
hint of how much worse the situation is likely to get this year.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed the main reason for the gap is simple:
the long-term influence of the strength of sterling, which has
been enjoying a powerful appreciation for the past two-and-a-half
years.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the trend was still pointing to a worsening trade
deficit in goods. The weak economic growth in the euro-zone
countries also contributed to the gap, it added.
</P>
<P>
Philip Shaw, economist at Investec bank, said: "The trade
deficit was worse than expected. It really shows how tough the
going is for the external sector in the UK."
</P>
<P>
However, the growing gap in trade in goods has been partly
compensated for by a growing UK surplus in trade in services such
as insurance, travel and tourism, accountancy and consulting.
</P>
<P>
The overall UK balance of payments deficit in goods and
services combined was less than half that of the trade gap in
goods, at 11.1 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> WWF Launches New Campaign for Europe's Large Carnivores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The international conservation
body WWF has launched the Campaign for Europe's Carnivores to
protect the continent's flagship carnivores such lynxes, wolves
and brown bears.
</P>
<P>
"While the perilous plight of Asia's tigers is widely known,
the threats facing Europe's own top predators have received much
less publicity," said the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in a
press release on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Iberian lynx of Spain and Portugal, the world's most
endangered cat species, faces imminent extinction, while wolves
face a hostile reception when they return to parts of western
Europe that eradicated them a century ago," the WWF said.
</P>
<P>
The new campaign aims to challenge ancient prejudices and help
fund projects that support the peaceful coexistence of people and
predators, according to the WWF.
</P>
<P>
Habitat destruction and the loss of prey species have
contributed to the decline of large carnivores in Europe. Today,
they occupy fragmented landscapes, dominated by humans.
</P>
<P>
The WWF estimated that the Iberian lynx is now confined to
about 10 isolated pockets of Spain and Portugal where the world
population has slumped to less than 800.
</P>
<P>
"If current trends continue, the Iberian lynx will probably
disappear in the first half of the 21st century," warned a Spanish
lynx expert. "This would be a huge embarrassment for Europe, since
it would represent the world's first well-documented extinction of
a wild field species."

<HEADLINE> Romania: National Oil Company Is Active on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bucharest-based National
Oil Company Petrom aims to strengthen its position on the external
market through fresh cooperation undertakings.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, Petrom will open
two stations of oil products distribution in Kasakhstan, while the
research works will begin this year on the Jusaly area, after the
company got the licence for exploring a surface covering 34,000
sq.km in that Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The licence is granted for 25 years, five years of explorations
aimed at finding hydrocarbons resources, followed by 20 years of
production. In all these years Petrom has the right to exploit,
export and sell the hydrocarbons on the local market, and is to
pay dividends to the concessionary country.
</P>
<P>
A joint-venture contract was signed between Petrom and Hungary
KFT, while two oil products distribution stations are due to be
established also in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Petrom will start drilling works in Turkey, having
TPAO Turkish state-run company as a beneficiary. The crude is to
be sold on the local market. Fresh drilling works will be resumed
in the United Arab Emirates, through the ''Fortuna'' and
''Orizont'' platforms, already operating in the area.
</P>
<P>
A Petrom representation was opened in Chisinau, the Republic of
Moldova, where the whole sales are to start in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, Petrom intends to contribute to the
investment in the Constanta-Trieste oil pipeline, to cross
Romania's territory, under the memorandum to be signed with the
Italian ENI group.
</P>
<P>
Petrom wants to enter also other markets such as that in
Israel, to start the activity in Kuwait and Adzerbajan, where a
Petrom subsidiary was opened in February 1998.

<HEADLINE> NATO Urges Conflicting Kosovo Parties to Make Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The NATO chief urged on
Tuesday the conflicting parties in Kosovo to work constructively
in the next two and a half weeks to bring about peace after their
Rambouillet negotiation achieved substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement read out by his spokesman, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana appealed to the parties to accept
rapidly the Contact Group Peace Plan in its entirety including the
military aspects.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief urged the parties to accept the peace accord at
the very latest by the time of the implementation conference in
France on March 15.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the western military alliance remains ready
to use whatever means necessary to bring about a peaceful solution
to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He urged both the Serbs and Kosovars to respect the cease-fire
deal, refrain from all provocations and carry out all of the
provisions of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions on
the Yugoslav province and ensure the safety of the international
verifiers of the cease-fire in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo peace talks at Rambouillet was to resume on March 15
after a "substantial progress" was announced by the joint chairmen
of the talks earlier on Tuesday after the extended deadline for
the talks expired again.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
NATO would keep up the military pressure by keeping warplanes
intended for air strikes in place for any escalation of violence
and all-out provocation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO presence in Kosovo would not go away.
NATO troops will be in Kosovo either to implement the peace deal
to finally be signed by both sides or to use whatever means
necessary to bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
"A peace deal without implementation is not a peace deal," said
the official who added, however, that NATO never talked about an
intervention by ground troops.

MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China on Tuesday
signed five business deals at the end of the third session of the
commission for preparing regular meetings between the premiers of
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The session, co-chaired by Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi and

</P>
<P>
The deals include two contracts on real estate purchases, two
on assembling of television sets in Russia from Chinese parts and

<P>
Both Wu and Maslyukov, in their remarks, expressed satisfaction
with the development of bilateral strategic partnership, while
pointing out the vast potentials in economic and trade
cooperation.

They urged steps to reverse the situation whereby bilateral
economic ties lag behind political ties, such as improvement of

The two sides also exchanged views on cooperation in oil,
natural gas and high technologies.

<HEADLINE> France Expels UNITA's European Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The French Foreign Ministry
issued a statement Tuesday demanding the immediate departure of
Isaia Samakuva, the European representative of the National Union
for the Total Independence in Angola (UNITA), from the country.
</P>
<P>
Francois Rivasseua, the spokesman for the French Foreign
Ministry, said the move is in response to relevant U.N. Security
Council resolution on sanctions on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA representative in Paris must leave the French
territory Tuesday and never return or reside in the country, the
Angola News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Angolan government accused France of "making it
easy for UNITA terrorists" and allowing them carrying out
activities on the French territory. French Ambassador to Angola,
Andre Cira, said here Monday that his government is considering
the expulsion of Samakuva from France.
</P>
<P>
Since the UNITA has refused to comply with the Lusaka Protocol,
the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in August 1997,
requesting the closure of UNITA's offices in all member countries
and prohibiting visa permits to UNITA leadership in a bid to limit
their activities in foreign countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Public Accounts
Committee in Parliament probing the Ministry of Agriculture,
Animal Industry and Fisheries has uncovered a number of
irregularities which led to the loss of large sums of money during
the 1996/97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The committee, chaired by Herman Kakooza, noted that up to the
beginning of 1999 the ministry has not taken serious steps to
recover the funds, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
A total of 170 million Shillings (170,000 U.S. Dollars), which
had been borrowed from projects to partly cover travel expenses
for the ministry officers abroad, had not been paid back up to
now, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Other anomalies include failure by the ministry staff, who
benefited from the sale of government vehicles, to return about
130 number plates which belong to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the ministry did not recover the 40 million
Shillings (40,000 Dollars) meant for the clonal coffee nurseries
under the district farm institutes and that salaries of staff in
some districts had not been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
David Obong, permanent secretary in the ministry, said that a
firm that had been hired by the government had not remitted funds
totaling to 6. 2 million Shillings (6,200 Dollars) from the sale
of the ministry's property.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The panel set up by the
United Nations Security Council to make assessment on Iraq's
disarmament held its first meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, the panel's Chairman Celso Amorim of
Brazil said :" The panel will not take policy decisions. It will
make recommendations from a technical point of view."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the panel might travel to Iraq, Amorim said that
was not excluded, but it would require Iraq's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The panel was named on February 12 and due to report to the
Security Council by April 15.
</P>
<P>
UN weapons inspection in Iraq had come to a standstill after
the U.S.-led military air strikes against the country last
December, which followed the release of a report from the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The report said that Iraq has
filed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament panel is one of the three panels that the
Council decided on January 30 to establish. All three panels are
led by Amorim and due to present their recommendations by April
15.
</P>
<P>
The other two panels are on humanitarian situation in Iraq and
prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property and archives.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was formally arrested
Tuesday on charges of treason and crimes against the sovereignty
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory interrogation over Ocalan, who was detained a
week ago, was carried out by the Ankara State Security Court and
concluded in the same day, according to the semi-official Anatolia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The investigation files, lawsuit dossiers and court files
against the PKK and Ocalan will be sent to the court soon.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured last Tuesday by Turkish commandos in Kenya,
where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, and was
brought to a jail on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's
western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit declined to disclose what
countries had helped Turkey to capture Ocalan, but he said that
the United States had provided full support in Turkey's struggle
against the PKK terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan will be tried on the prison island on charges of waging
a nearly 15-year-old war for Kurdish independence in southeastern
Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000 lives in conflicts since
August 1984.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday asked all the parties to refrain from any
action which could jeopardize the achievements of the Rambouillet
negotiations, and to fully comply with the relevant Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the
15-member Security Council, Robert Fowler of Canada, said,
"Members of the Council underlined that it was essential for all
the parties to refrain from any action which could jeopardize the
achievements of the Rambouillet negotiations, and to fully comply
with their commitments of October 1998 and the relevant Security
Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council noted with satisfaction that, with the
Rambouillet agreements, a political framework for substantial
autonomy has been set out," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council was briefed on
Tuesday morning by permanent representatives of France and the
United Kingdom on the development of the the Kosovo peace talks in
Rambouillet, near Paris in France.
</P>
<P>
The six-member Contact Group decided on Tuesday to suspend the
Kosovo peace talks until March 15, saying that despite "major
progress" they have not been able to get either Serbs or Kosovo
Albanians to sign a deal.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council took note of the conclusions
of the Co-Chairmen of the Rambouillet Conference at the end of two
weeks of intensive efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on
substantial autonomy for Kosovo, which respects the national
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council noted the commitment of the parties to
attend a conference covering all aspects of the implementation of
these agreements, in France on March 15," said the statement,
"Members of the Council encouraged the parties to work
constructively to this end."
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians, who make
up some 90 percent of the Serbian province's population of 2
million, have been fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
Major powers sponsoring the Rambouillet peace talks said an
agreement had been reached on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, but
arrangements for implementing the accord would be left to a
conference opening in France on March 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council, Robert Fowler of Canada, told reporters on
Tuesday that the Council just ended "a preliminary round of
discussion" on the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Macedonia, and the
15-member body is expected to take up the issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There was a preliminary round of discussion, and the members
of the Council will take this matter up again tomorrow," Fowler
said in a statement read to the press here at the end of the
closed-door consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met on Tuesday morning behind closed doors
to be briefed by the U.N. Secretariat on the U.N. peacekeeping
mission in Macedonia, whose mandate will expire on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council will also consider a report by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who recommended the extension
of the mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP), for a further period of six months, until August 31.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided in 1992 to send UNPREDEP into
Macedonia to deter threats and prevent clashes from spreading into
other parts of the Balkan region, including the tasks of
monitoring and reporting on illicit arms flows and other
activities that are prohibited under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Annan said, "It is a matter of satisfaction
that, until now, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not
been adversely affected by the conflict in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the bilateral relations of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia with some of its neighbors have
strengthened," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Although smuggling incidents have been observed, UNPREDEP has
so far not detected any direct evidence of arms smuggling across
the borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with
Albanian or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP currently comprises 1050 people, including military
observers and civilian police, who are mainly from the United
States and European countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Tuesday lashed out at Greece for supporting Abdullah
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the accusation on his way back to Turkey from the
Phillipines after a two-day official visit, the Anatolia News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with an official Philippine TV on
Monday, Demirel said Turkey has delivered a strongly-worded
warning to Greece to stop aiding separatists against the
territorial and national integrity of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey "reserves the right to self-defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has traditionally adopted a supportive attitude toward
all elements who are opposing Turkey," Demirel added.
</P>
<P>
Greece serves as a sanctuary for PKK members seeking shelter
and provides training facilities and logistics to the terrorists,
Demirel accused.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured last Tuesday by Turkish special agents in
Kenya, where he had been hiding in the Greek Embassy in Nairobi,
and was now held captive in a jail on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea
near Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to stand trial for leading PKK guerrillas in
waging a 15-year war for Kurdish autonomy in south Turkey that has
claimed over 37,000 lives, civilians and militants on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have been long-time rivals over territory
disputes, minority issues and the issue of Cyprus.

UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A book by a former U.N.
weapons inspector in Iraq said the CIA's involvement in the probe
of Iraq's chemical and biological program was more extensive,
The New York Times said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times, the book, "Endgame" written by
former American weapons inspector Scott Ritter who quitted the
U.N. post last summer, said the U.S. spies began working on the
teams only a year after the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Ritter wrote that the spies worked closely
with the U.N. teams and that a coup attempt against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein in June 1996 coincided with the presence
of nine CIA officials on one of the teams.
</P>
<P>
Ritter did not provide documentation for all of his conclusions
and speculated that the CIA might have orchestrated the timing of
the coup attempt, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The book supports accusations by Iraq that the U.N. teams
included American spies almost from the start of inspections, The
New York times said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter resigned in part to protest what he said was the Clinton
administration 's interference with the work of the inspection
teams.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Poll Finds Many Think Courts Unfair to Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Many Americans think the
nation's courts do not provide equal justice for racial
minorities, said the president of the American Bar Association
(ABA) Tuesday as the lawyer group released findings of a poll it
commissioned.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious problem... we cannot afford to ignore,"
said lawyer Philip Anderson of Little Rock, Arkansas State. "We
are concerned that the current perception of bias will eventually
erode confidence in our system of justice."
</P>
<P>
Of 1,000 people surveyed by telephone in August, 47 percent
said they strongly disagreed with a statement that "the courts
treat all ethnic and racial groups the same." Only 39 percent
agreed with the statement, and 14 percent voiced no view.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether courts treat men and women alike, 55 percent said
yes, 30 percent said no, and 15 percent expressed no view.
</P>
<P>
Anderson noted that another recent ABA poll indicated great
disagreement between white and black lawyers over the justice
system's racial fairness.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the 350,000-member ABA "will intensify our
efforts to eradicate gender and racial bias in our courts."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Remains Solid, Greenspan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that the country's economic
performance should remain solid this year, but he also cautioned
that dangers ranging from a potential stock market drop to
possible inflation pressures could threaten the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the Fed's semiannual economic report to Congress,
Greenspan said before the Senate Banking Committee that "our
economy's performance should remain solid this year, though likely
with a slower pace of economic expansion and a slightly higher
rate of overall inflation than last year."
</P>
<P>
"In many respects, the fundamental underpinnings of the recent
U.S. economic performance are strong," he said. "But after eight
years of expansion, the economy appears stretched in a number of
dimensions, implying considerable upside and downside risks to the
economic outlook."
</P>
<P>
He warned of threats that could either push the economy toward
recession, requiring lower interest rates to stimulate buying
demand, or reignite inflation, requiring higher rates to cool
demand.
</P>
<P>
"Monetary policy must be ready to move quickly in either
direction should we perceive imbalances and distortions developing
that could undermine the economic expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief's balanced assessment of risks to what has become
the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history strongly signals
that the central bank plans no changes in interest rates, either
up or down, in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Noting once again that "equity prices are high enough to raise
questions about whether shares are overvalued," Greenspan said a
"downward correction to stock prices" would threaten the household
consumption spending and business investment that has propelled
growth at an above-average rate topping 4 percent for three
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Plus world financial turbulence, most recently demonstrated
with the sharp devaluation of Brazil's currency last month,
continues to pose the danger of "knockoff effects in financial
markets and the economies of Brazil's important trading partners,
including the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, fading growth in key U.S. industrial trading partners
could further depress demand for U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greenspan said the big rise in the U.S. trade
deficit, to a record 169 billion U.S. dollars last year, has had
some positive effects. It's cushioned the weakness in U.S. trading
partners and acted as a safety valve for strong U.S. demand, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In their forecast for the economy, Fed policy-makers are
projecting inflation between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this year,
up from 1.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
They expect growth in the gross domestic product between 2.5
percent and 3 percent, down from 4 percent last year. The
unemployment rate should remain between 4.25 percent and 4.5
percent, about at the 29-year low where it is now.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Official Dismisses Iraqi Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Tuesday
rebuffed fresh threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein against
Riyadh and Kuwait, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do not give attention to these threats because they came
from an insensible person who doesn't care about the interests of
his country, and of the Arab and Islamic nations," Saudi Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Aviation Prince Sultan
Ibn Abdul-Aziz told a news conference in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official response from Saudi Arabia toward
the latest remarks by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said on February 14 that Iraq is capable of attacking
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Baghda has accused the two countries of
harboring air bases used by U.S. and British warplanes to enforce
the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan declined to talk about the recurring
confrontations between Iraq and the U.S.-allied forces in the
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, saying that "we are
not a party in this matter."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official also rejected the idea of ousting the Iraqi
regime from outside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the defense cooperation between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
Prince Sultan said that the two Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states are maintaining coordination within the framework of the
Peninsula Shield project, alluding to the joint GCC military
forces stationed in northern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance set up in
1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Destroys Nine Ethiopian Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news release faxed to Xinhua by the Eritrean embassy in
Nairobi said: " Ethiopia has also opened a feeble attack on the
Tsorona front around 10 a. m. Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia began heavy shelling at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday as a prelude
to the ground attack, the news release said, adding that Antonov
bombers were also

briefly employed in an effort to soften Eritrean positions.
</P>
<P>
At round 7:00 a.m., Ethiopian mechanized units began waves of
ground assault but were repulsed with heavy losses and two T-55
Ethiopian tanks were destroyed in the process, said the news
release.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Ethiopia subsequently summoned air-support around
8:30 a.m. but the Mig-23 fighter planes turned back due to
resistance from the Eritrean forces.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry noted that the U.S. State
Department issued a statement Monday, expressing "deep regret on
the use of air power by Ethiopia" and urged the Ethiopian
government "to resume the moratorium immediately".
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said that Ethiopia violated the moratorium on February
7 and had used its aircraft against civilian targets, bombing the
villages of Deda Lalai, Adi Quala and Mai Aini in Zalambesa area
and the sparsely populated areas in Assab Region bordering the Red
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two people were reportedly killed while many others were
wounded in those attacks, the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the Horn of Africa neighbors resumed on
February 6 after an nine-month lull.

<HEADLINE> Arms Found in Lesotho Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An arms' cache has been
discovered in a dam outside Maseru, capital of Lesotho, the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) said Tuesday in
Maseru.
</P>
<P>
After an intensive search, a team of divers from the South
African navy discovered two boxes containing five mortar bombs at
a soil conservation dam on Monday, South African Press Association
quoted a SADC spokesperson as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mortar bombs were of Russian origin, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Defense Force allegedly told the SADC that the
ammunition, dating back to 1945, was supplied by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The search by a team of 20 South African specialist divers
began last weekend after a Basotho fisherman found a machine gun
in the dam.
</P>
<P>
The dam is situated opposite the Makoanyane military barracks,
where mutineer Lesotho soldiers barricaded themselves during their
clashes with the South African-led SADC troops last year.
</P>
<P>
The SADC troops were sent in last September to quell the unrest
in the tiny mountain kingdom following the country's general
election in May.

<HEADLINE> UNDP, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Launch System for Products  and Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and Dun &AMP; Bradstreet on Tuesday
announced the introduction of the first global coding system
intended to classify over 8,000 products and services and to
streamline their procurement and marketing, especially via the
internet.
</P>
<P>
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet is the world's leading provider of business
credit, marketing and purchasing information.
</P>
<P>
The system is the result of a merger of the UN's Common
Coding System with Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's Standard Products and
Services Codes.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is the largest provider of grants for technical assistance
in developing countries, with a mandate to help developing
countries eradicate poverty, protect the environment, and improve
government and national institutions and opportunities for people.
</P>
<P>
The new system combines an early classification methodology for
products and services developed by UNDP's Inter-Agency procurement
Services Office for the purchasing needs of the United Nations,
with a more flexible system pioneered by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
In the new system, each product or service is assigned a
digital code for identification, varying from two to eight digits.
</P>
<P>
"With the classification system we are introducing today, and
with access to information technology, small and medium-sized
companies in developing countries will be able to compete more
effectively in the global marketplace, and in countries that
they simply could not reach before," said James Gustave Speth,
Administrator of UNDP.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, there has not been a global product code standard
that could help a company better manage its supply chain by
identifying what products it buys, in what quantities and from
whom," said Andre Dahan, President of DUN &AMP; Abradstreet, US.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants More Children Covered by Medicaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday started a national campaign to enroll millions more
children in Medicaid, using household products and a toll-free
phone number to encourage parents to seek federal health benefits
for them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, along with the first lady and officers from the
National Governors' Association, announced the "Insure Kids Now"
campaign, which seeks to educate families on eligibility for
Medicaid and the new Children's Health Insurance Program.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has stated a goal of enrolling 5
million of the estimated 10 million eligible children in Medicaid
within five years. Last year, Clinton directed several federal
agencies to find better ways to identify eligible children and
sign them up.
</P>
<P>
Federal government officials planned to disseminate word about
Medicaid through radio ads in 45 states and public-service
announcements on several networks. Those ads are to begin running
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Also, a number of companies have agreed to print the toll-free
number on products from toothbrushes to grocery bags and child
safety seats to make it readily available to parents, said Clinton
health policy adviser Christopher Jennings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposed budget for fiscal 2000 includes 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars to assist states in this children's health outreach
initiative.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Tries to Conserve Forest Genetic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Agricultural
Research Organization decided to take steps to conserve the
country's forest genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting here Tuesday, Deputy Director General of
the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization, Aberra Debello
said a laboratory and office will soon be built to preserve the
country's indigenous trees.
</P>
<P>
"The closed natural forests of Ethiopia are shrinking at an
alarming rate as a result of over-exploitation and expansion of
arable land," Aberra said, adding that the conservation initiative
should be considered as a " rescue operation to save the remaining
genetic resources of forests."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the genetic resource conservation will in a
long term be instrumental in rehabilitating natural forests when
growing conditions are more conducive.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's landmass covered by closed forests which was 16
percent in 1950s has now dwindled to less than 2.5 percent. It is
estimated that the country's forest loss ranges between 80,000 and
200,000 hectares per year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Pay Uganda $12 Million Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will pay 720 million
Shillings (about 12 million U.S. Dollars) owed to Uganda after the
assets of the East African Community were divided up following
its disintegration in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's East African and Regional Co-operation Minister
Nicholas Biwott Tuesday told the new Ugandan High Commissioner
Francis Butagira that the payment would be "very soon". It would
come from the Consolidated Fund.
</P>
<P>
Some 420 million Shillings (about 7 million Dollars) was paid
earlier and used to build Uganda's Kapchorwa-Sironko Swam road.
</P>
<P>
When the community broke up in 1977, Kenya was said to owe
Uganda 19 million Dollars, of which seven million Dollars has
been released.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said all the bottlenecks to reviving the regional body
were being ironed out, adding that Uganda was an important
trading partner and that Kenya would continue to buy electricity
and certain other goods from Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Visiting Iraqi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Sahhaf who
arrived in Amman Tuesday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sahhaf conveyed to Abdullah a letter from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on bilateral relations and matters
of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh, Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf's visit came at a time when Jordan is embarking on a
fast track to improve relations with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,
Baghdad's arch foes in the Arab world after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait which triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The visit apparently put Jordan into a diplomatic dilemma in
keeping a delicate balance between its relations with Iraq and
with Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Iraq is the sole source of crude oil and oil
products for Jordan after Saudi Arabia suspended its oil supplies
to the kingdom as Jordan sided with Iraq in its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Sahhaf's visit, Khatib reiterated Jordan's policy on
Iraq, including an end to the sufferings of the Iraqi people
under international sanctions, support for the sovereignty of
Iraq and noninterference in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Khatib's statement seemed to be aimed at soothing Iraq that
Jordan would not sacrifice Baghdad to improve relations with
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and other Gulf states mended as Jordan
distanced itself in recent years from Saddam's regime and
strengthened ties with the United States.

<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu said that since the
normalization of bilateral relationship between the two countries
and the two parties, Sino-Vietnamese ties have seen steady
development.
</P>
<P>
Phieu made the remarks when he granted an interview to China's
Economic Daily resident correspondent here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On his upcoming visit to China, Phieu said that it has become a
fine tradition that leaders of the two countries regularly conduct
their meetings. "I think that the upcoming high-level meeting is
of significant importance as it takes place at the time when both
countries have been making preparations to enter the third
millennium with new opportunities and challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
In that context and after nearly one decade of restoring
bilateral friendship and cooperation, it is time for the two sides
to discuss and reach agreement on a new stable and long-term
cooperation framework, which will serve as orientations for
comprehensive cooperation between the two countries in the future,
Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Party leader said that he is very happy to pay a
visit to China at a time when the Chinese people are making active
preparations to celebrate their 50th national day and take back
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China,
particularly during the past 20-year reform process and
implementation of its opening policy, the Chinese people have made
significant achievements, he said. He said that he would take this
occasion to study China's valuable experiences gained during its
process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu will pay an official goodwill visit to China at
the invitation of Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist
Party of China and Chinese president.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Priority to Developing Key Energy Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to meet basic energy
demands in the coming century China has announced it will give
equal priority to the exploitation of energy resources and energy
saving while also stepping up energy reserves.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the State Development Planning
Commission said today the country's energy development will focus
on power generation, essentially based on coal, along with the
vigorous expansion of petroleum, gas and nuclear power and other
new and renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will launch a series of strategic drives in
the next century to achieve its energy objectives. In the coal
sector, the focus of production will be shifted westward and
efforts will be made to expand the Shenfu and Dongsheng coal
fields and improve coal transportation.
</P>
<P>
The country will speed up the construction of terraced
hydroelectric power stations in river valleys and the construction
of power stations near coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In developing the petroleum industry, prominence will be given
to oil and gas exploitation in western China and in the country's
offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
In this way, a network of energy-supply bases will be
introduced nationwide, with the provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Heilongjiang and Guizhou and western Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region as the major coal suppliers. The Daqing and Shengli
oilfields will remain the country's main oil suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will become bases for
supplying hydropower nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Along with the development of conventional energy resources,
the country will still focus on the development of geothermal,
wind, solar and tidal energy, so as to better control and optimize
energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Energy experts predict that China will achieve a balance
between supply and demand in energy resources early in the 21st
century, but net imports of oil will show no rapid increases.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that in the early part of the next century, the
total annual consumption of the country's unrenewable energy
resources will hit the equivalent of 1.38 billion tons of standard
coal (about two billion tons of raw coal), with the output of coal
reaching 1.45 billion tons a year.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's annual production of oil and gas will
top 150 million tons and 25 billion cubic meters, respectively.
Also by that time, the country's major power grids will be
interconnected nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The experts are confident that China's energy production and
reserves will effectively guarantee social and economic
development in the century to come.

refugees, a senior official from the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scoren Jessen-Peterson, assistant high commissioner for
refugees of UNHCR, said here at a press conference that he will
proceed to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar Thursday to
discuss with the Taliban ways and means for the plight and return
of the Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world community is disinterested to provide
funds for Afghanistan due to human rights violations and
restrictions on women education.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson said he will urge the Taliban leadership to
take measures for conducive environment for the refugees so that
they could return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson arrived here Sunday from Tehran on the second
leg of a week-long tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Jessen-Peterson met with senior
Pakistani officials in Islamabad and Peshwar, capital of North
West Frontier Province, and discussed with them matters relating
to the Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with the Pakistani government officials and other
senior U.N. officials here, Jessen-Peterson focused on a number of
issues relating to the estimated 1.2 million Afghan refugees, who
are still living in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 1.4 million Afghan refugees
living in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jessen-Peterson told reporters that during his stay in Kandahar
he would also discuss with the Taliban the security situation for
the U.N. staff. "We want concerted steps to be taken for the
security of the U.N. staff," he added.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. agencies withdrew their international staff from
Afghanistan last August, following the murder of an Italian U.N.
official in Kabul and earlier killing of two staff members of
UNHCR and World Food Program in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR sees its return to Afghanistan as vital for monitoring
the repatriation and reintegration of Afghan refugees.

<HEADLINE> Residents in Bangladeshi Enclaves Inside India Suffer From Border Fence: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 inhabitants of some
30 Bangladeshi enclaves inside Indian territory are suffering from
the barbed-wire fences along the border in northwest Bangladesh,
the Associated Press of Bangladesh (APB) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 71 kilometers of the 228-kilometer-long frontier with
India in the district of Kurigram, 256 kilometers northwest of
here, have been fenced off by India, the news agency quoted local
residents and officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The issue of building up border fences has become an irritant
between the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the Border Security Forces
(BSF) of India, the border guards of the two countries. Skirmishes
recently left three BSF personnel killed and one BDR member
injured.
</P>
<P>
The worst sufferers of the fences have been the 50,000
Bangladeshis living in the enclaves across the Kurigram border,
and the Indians living in some 12 Indian enclaves inside
Bangladeshi territory, the APB said.
</P>
<P>
The enclave-dwellers - both Bangladeshis and Indians - now have
to get permission from foreign authorities to visit their own
country.
</P>
<P>
"Getting permission is a long and troublesome affair," one of
the sufferers said. If anyone is caught while crossing the border
without permission, he would be severely dealt with by the border
guards.
</P>
<P>
"We are now foreigners in our own land," a distraught
Bangladeshi living in one of those enclaves said.
</P>
<P>
India began putting up the fences along the Bhurungamari border
in Kurigram in 1994, and made two more attempts in 1995 and 1997,
despite strong objections from the Bangladeshi side, according to
the APB.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Easing Loan Reserve Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to ease its
bank loan provisioning rules so that the cash-strapped real sector
is able to get loans from local financial institutions, Deputy
Finance Minister Pisit Lee-artham said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry was looking at a series of proposals from
the central bank to encourage lending from commercial banks and to
speed up Thailand's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was likely to approve the removal of a one percent
reserve requirement for general loans once the detailed review of
the central bank's proposals was completed.
</P>
<P>
The move would free bank reserve funds of up to five billion
baht (138.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, central bank governor Chatumongol Sonakul
said regulators could ease rules on bank provisioning requirements
for restructured loans as an incentive for financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Currently, banks are allowed to free-up loss provisions and
reclassify a non-performing loan only after borrowers make at
least three months' payments under a restructured contract.
</P>
<P>
Now non-performing loans will be allowed to be reversed and
provisions be freed up as soon as a restructuring contract is
signed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai banks have responded to government pressure to
lower their lending rates to prompt investment, bringing rates
down to 30-year lows of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that corporate debt restructuring is a top
priority for economic recovery. Without restructuring, financial
institutions will remain unwilling and unable to issue new loans,
squeezing retail and corporate clients alike.
</P>
<P>
They said falling interest rates and new bankruptcy and
foreclosure laws, which are to be enacted soon, should help speed
corporate debt restructuring and lower non-performing loans held
by local banks.

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese college grads are
adding Internet abilities to their resumes and consider it a good
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Youth Daily" reported that over 80 percent of
China's major colleges have their own local area network (LAN) to
prove more opportunities for their students.
</P>
<P>
One English major at Beijing's Languages and Culture University
said that he spends twenty hours a week on the Internet and
considers it the best way to get the information he needs.
</P>
<P>
A survey of Qinghua University students found that 88.1 percent
of those surveyed have been using the Internet for a year and a
half and nearly 70 percent have got information via the Internet.
Some college seniors, the paper said, consider the Internet a
lifestyle as well as a special way to look for jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong provincial government has begun rejecting
applications from people who cannot use the Internet and it plans
to establish its own LAN and will allow only those who can use the
network to do ordinary government work, according to the report.

ADDIS ABABA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim Tuesday appointed
Hocine Djoudi as the 7th member of the International Panel of
Eminent Personalities to probe the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda and the
Surrounding Events (IPEP).
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued here Wednesday said Hocine Djoudi
is presently member of the Algerian Council of the Nation (Senate)
and Vice President of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the
council.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Djoudi had been Algerian
ambassador to Spain, Portugal, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland and
France. He also served as the Algerian Permanent Representative
to the United Nations from 1984 to 1990 during which period he
served as the President of the U.N. Security Council in May 1988
and August 1989 respectively.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Ozone Hole's Center Over South Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese scientists
have found that the center of the ozone hole in the earth's
atmosphere includes the space above the southwestern part of the
South Pole.
</P>
<P>
Zou Han, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of
Atmospheric Physics, and his research group discovered that
changes in the ozone content above the southwestern part of the
South Pole were no different from those at the center of the hole.
</P>
<P>
They had the lowest ozone content in October, Zou says, and the
ozone content above the southeastern part of the South Pole
changes regularly, "Therefore, the ozone hole does not include the
pole's southeastern part."
</P>
<P>
Zou attributes the deviation at the center to the uneven
distribution of land and ocean in the polar region and says that
this causes irregular fluctuations in the atmosphere above the
Pole, resulting in the deviation.
</P>
<P>
The ozone hole above the South Pole was detected by British
scientists in 1985. Scientists later found that the hole is
expanding.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Confident of Leading WTO Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Deputy Prime
Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said
Wednesday that he is still leading the run for the top post of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with New Zealand International Trade
Minister Lockwood Smith, Supachai said he remained confident of
his chances to win the top job.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to earlier reports that he was
considering abandoning his bid because of lack of support from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said heads of delegations attending a WTO meeting
Monday agreed to set a new selection date on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The world trade body has already missed two self-imposed
deadlines in December and mid-February to choose a new chief to
replace current Director-General Renato Ruggiero, whose four-year
term expires on April 30, as members failed to reach a consensus
on any of the four candidates in the run.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is backed by most of Asian members, including
Japan, and some European members, including Britain, is said to be
the front runner.
</P>
<P>
But New Zealand's Mike Moore, former prime minister and labor
activist, has gained support from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates are Hassan Abouyoub, Morocco's
ambassador in charge of trade negotiations, who is popular with
France and some African countries, and Roy MacLaren, Canadian High
Commissioner in London.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Decision to Legalize Pirate Radioes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli parliament
decision to legalize pirate radio stations, set up by extremist
settlers, could cause more violence between the Palestinians and
Israelis, said a senior Palestinian official on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian chief negotiator, told the Voice of
Palestine that he can not understand why the Israeli government
and Knesset (parliament) decided to legalize those pirate radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government decision to issue licenses for
extremist settlers' radio stations, such as Arutz 7 (channel 7),
is dangerous and a legitimacy to violence and disorder," Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset on Tuesday passed a law by a vote of 40-29,
legalizing any pirate station that has been operating for five
years. The two main stations meeting these criteria are the
settlers' Arutz 7 and Shas's Radio 2000.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the law was approved, Meretz lawmakers Haim
Oren and Yossi Sarid petitioned the High Court against it,
claiming that the law rewarded "persistent criminals."
</P>
<P>
Labor Party lawmakers Eitan Cabel filed a separate petition
against the law while Israel's existing 14 regional radio stations
announced they plan to file a petition next week.
</P>
<P>
The Meretz petition argued that the new law discriminates
against legal radio stations, which had to pay hefty fees and put
up large financial guarantees in order to obtain their licenses.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the petition charged Arutz 7 broadcasts
political propaganda that serves the interests of settlers and
the National Religious Party (NRP).
</P>
<P>
The station, the petition said, therefore does not fulfill the
requirements of the Broadcasting Law, which demands fair coverage
for all political viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu absented himself
from the vote Tuesday, most of the lawmakers from the government
coalition parties voted in favor of the bill, sponsored by NRP.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said Tuesday that the new
law violates the principle of equality before the law and damages
efforts to educate the public to respect and obey the law.

<HEADLINE> Mine Awareness Day Observed in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Mine Awareness Day was
observed Wednesday here, aiming to enhance the awareness and the
knowledge of the public about landmines and unexploded ordnance
and to ban the use of landmines.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk,
representative of the U.N. general secretary Lakhan Mehrotra, and
diplomats from various embassies as well as about 200 handicapped
people.
</P>
<P>
Ieng Mouly, chairman of the Cambodian Mine Action Center
(CMAC), announced at the ceremony that the rate of mine accidents
has dropped to 50 to 100 per month from 300 to 500 per month since
1992.
</P>
<P>
After the annual ceremony, several thousand people including
mine victims marched through the streets to appeal to the whole
world to ban the use, production and trade of landmines.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia started to observe the annual event in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia signed the convention against the use, stockpiling,
production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in Ottawa on
December 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CMAC has to date cleared 90,000 landmines and destroyed up
to 500,000 unexploded ordnance (UXO) and also collected some 200
million pieces of mines, bullet shells and other shrapnel during
the mine clearing activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the CMAC, the more than two decades of civil war
and strife in Cambodia have caused more than 13,000 deaths and up
to 100,000 amputees in mines-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained here show that landmines were first laid in
1967. The number of landmines increased drastically during the
bloody civil war in 1979 with most of them planted along the
Cambodia-Thai borders and in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Demand Tough Law on Endangered Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 Canadian
scientists have addressed a letter to Prime Minister Jean
Chretien urging him to strengthen the government's planned
endangered-species bill.
</P>
<P>
The letter, released Wednesday with the signatures of 631
scientists, shows that many of Canada's researchers believe that
Ottawa's approach to endangered species is seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
Although the government introduced a bill in 1996, known as C-
65, it died on the order paper when the election was called in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say they fear that mistakes will be repeated
when the government introduces a new version of the bill this
spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
The earlier bill did not require the government to protect much
of the woodlands, swamps or forests where endangered species make
their homes. This is a fundamental problem, the scientists say,
because the loss of habitat is believed to be the reason that 80
percent of the endangered species, such as the piping plover, may
be going the way of eelgrass limpet, a mollusk that has not been
seen since 1929.
</P>
<P>
The bill protected fewer than half of Canada's 307 species at
risk because it protects the habitat only of aquatic species and
species that live on federal land.
</P>
<P>
In their letter, the scientists also express concern about the
politicizing of the process of identifying and listing species
that need the government's protection.
</P>
<P>
There are times when protecting a species may not be popular
with a government department, such as Fisheries and Oceans. The
department could press the scientists not to put it on the list.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists, by their expertise and independence, are better
situated than politicians to judge the state of a species. Canada'
s endangered species are too imperiled, too close to extinction
and too precious to be held hostage to lobbyists, political
manipulation or simple ignorance," the scientists' letter says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Parcel Service (
UPS), the largest package delivery company in the world, enjoyed
double digit growth last year despite the economic downturn in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
UPS international operations outside the United States saw its
volume climb 10.5 percent over 1997, with Asia Pacific volume
rising 12.1 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues totaled 3.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 10.3 percent
compared with 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 while operating
profits jumped to 56 million U.S. dollars for the year, a 123
million U.S. dollars improvement over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kai-ming Liu, newly appointed UPS managing director for Hong
Kong, revealed the company's annual results at a press conference
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that UPS, which was named the world's most admired
delivery company, opened its two million U.S. dollar facility at
the Hong Kong new airport express center in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
On 1999 plans and industry outlook for Hong Kong, Liu said
express delivery will grow faster than other areas in
transportation.
</P>
<P>
To address the customers' need, UPS will unveil innovative
products later in the year, leveraging leading-edge technology
which will set itself apart from the pack.
</P>
<P>
He described UPS cooperation with the Chinese mainland as
pleasant and expressed his great interest in further expanding its
business there.
</P>
<P>
UPS has run a joint venture on express delivery with Beijing
and opened representative offices in Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it signed a new agreement with the China National
Foreign Trade Transportation Company last month to expand its
scope of joint activities on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"This allows us to extend the UPS network with branded
operation in 21 key China cities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"UPS will continue to invest and develop new technologies to
help our customers improve business efficiency," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks to Maintain Deposit Rates at Five Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks have
agreed to maintain fixed-deposit rates at five percent per year
even though lending rates will fall to single-digit levels next
week, Chairman of the Thai Bankers' Association (TBA) Banthoon
Lamsam affirmed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current saving rates of 4.5 percent would also be
maintained, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the country's central bank, asked
that commercial banks maintain their saving rates to the current
levels in a bid to prevent possible capital outflows.
</P>
<P>
As a result, commercial banks will stop further lowering their
lending rates after the next round of cuts takes effect early next
week, Banthoon said.
</P>
<P>
The BOT guided local lending rates to decline to 10 percent or
lower in the first quarter of this year to help stimulate economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in 30 years that lending rates in
Thailand fall to a single-digit level, with Thai Farmers Bank
having the lowest rate of 9.5 percent as of next Monday, followed
by 9.75 percent of Bangkok Bank, the TBA chief said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hailed the TBA's decision, saying that lower
interest rates would help reduce non-performing loans of
commercial banks and speed up the on-going corporate debt
restructuring scheme, especially when the bankruptcy and
foreclosure bills, to be enacted soon, take effect.
</P>
<P>
Corporate debt restructuring is vital to revitalize the Thai
economy because banks, fearing of non-performing loans, will not
be willing to lend to companies which want to expand their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The new bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, on the other hand,
will increase the authority of creditors to enforce claims on
delinquent borrowers and negotiate restructuring deals with them.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President's Office Refutes Report About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The President's Office of
Uganda has refuted a press report which said that President Yoweri
Museveni never stayed much at State House Entebbe even after
millions of tax-payers' Shillings were spent in rehabilitating it.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the office Wednesday afternoon said
that the editorial carried in the Monitor newspaper is the epitome
of the continued trend by some circles in the press to either
deliberately misinform the public or give the public unresearched
and false information.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper further alleges that Museveni has been
taking state visitors to Rwakitura in Mbarara district, the total
cost of whose visits is enough to rehabilitate Entebbe State House
and build another state lodge.
</P>
<P>
It is a pure lie to say that he never stayed much at State
House Entebbe because Museveni worked and resided there for eight
years before moving to Kampala, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that no big rehabilitation work has been done to the
State House Entebbe since President Museveni entered it in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The President's Office demanded the Monitor take the trouble to
check their allegations to avoid giving the public false
information.
</P>
<P>
The editorial in the paper was described as a result of pure
imagination.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor is one of key independent dailies published in
capital Kampala. Compared to the government-sponsored New Vision
newspaper, the Monitor carries more criticism at the government
and the ruling elite.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects Call for Overhauling Farm Banking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday rejected a call by the Bankers Association of the
Philippines to overhaul a law requiring banks to set aside 25
percent of their loanable funds for agricultural credit.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the law is a vital
tool in bankrolling government programs to modernize the farm
sector and ensure food security.
</P>
<P>
The law cannot be withdrawn "for the moment since it would
conflict with the priority of the administration to provide more
financing to the agriculture sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, all banking institutions are required to set
aside 10 percent of their loanable funds for agrarian reform and
15 percent for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has approved the issuance
of 1.25-billion-U.S. dollar worth of long-term tax-exempt
agricultural bonds to encourage the banks to buy the bonds in
assisting the farm sector.
</P>
<P>
Barican added the proceeds from the sale of these bonds will be
used exclusively to finance the development of the agriculture and
agrarian sectors.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The State Council has approved
the Action Plan for Education Invigoration for the 21st Century
made by the Ministry of Education and instructed its various
departments and local governments at all levels to strictly
implement it.

Science and technology are the keys for achieving the
modernization of China while education serves as the solid

In the 21st century, China's overall national strength and
international competitiveness will more and more rely on the
development of education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The State Council points out that China has achieved a lot in
the reform and development of education since the reform and
opening, but stressed that the current education level does not
meet the demands of modernization.

The CPC Central Committee has asserted that "it's an issue of
vital importance to our socialist cause to nurture large numbers
of quality professionals." The State Council has urged the society
to make education a priority for ensuring the nation moves forward

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Proposing Minimum Wage Abolition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday it has not made any proposal to scrap the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters that the
minimum wage is set by law so any amendment or revision will have
to be done by Congress.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that neither the Presidential Palace or the
Department of Labor and Employment has proposed the abolition of
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in response to reports about the alleged
proposals on the minimum wage scrapping.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that a government task force, conducting a
comprehensive review of the 25-year-old Labor Code, has been
mandated to propose measures to improve labor-management relations
and expand the social accord.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, who heads the task
force, assured Congress that his group will submit proposals to
amend the Labor Code since the changes can only be done through
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said he was surprised that the alleged proposals were
already reported in the media when his group has yet to hold its
first meeting.

<HEADLINE> Visitors to HK in January Surge 10.9 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong
Kong in January this year reached 826,770, representing an
increase of 10.9 percent over the same month last year mainly due
to the growing competitiveness of Hong Kong as a travel
destination.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
Wednesday show that almost all markets registered growth in the
month.
</P>
<P>
In the shorthaul markets, the list was topped by Indonesia,
with arrivals up by 115.9 percent. Arrivals from the Republic of
Korea rose by 65.3 percent as the Korean Won and the general
economy stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from the Chinese mainland were up by 22.1 percent for
the month, due to the favorable outbound policies and the
shortened visa/permit processing time.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from the Philippines and Malaysia rose by 20.6 percent
and 10.4 percent respectively. Most encouraging was the 11.2
percent increase in the number of Japanese visitors in January.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show good growth in the longhaul markets.
</P>
<P>
Travelers from Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Canada and the
United States also registered respective increases of 19.7 percent,
18.9 percent, 12.4 percent, 11.9 percent and 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The markets to register a decline in arrivals in January were
Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands, Britain and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Many of these falls can be attributed to increased competition
within the region and from other areas, as well as a softening of
growth following periods of increase, the HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
Average hotel occupancy in January reflected the increase in
arrivals, registering a total of 78 percent, against 67 percent
for January 1998, it added.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, said that she was
delighted to see such a marked improvement in arrivals for January
this year.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are still challenges ahead and we cannot afford
to be complacent about this upturn. The HKTA will continue to work
closely with the Hong Kong travel industry to ensure that we are
even more competitive, and can offer even more attractive reasons
for our overseas visitors to come to Hong Kong," she said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Trade Gap Reduced to 714M Dollars in Seven Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade gap has
been reduced to 714 million U.S. dollars during the first seven
months (July to January) of the current fiscal year as against
1.135 billion dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that the
reduction in the country's ever-widening trade gap was mainly
achieved due to the efforts by the government to arrest
non-essential imports.
</P>
<P>
The total imports during the first seven months of the 1998-99
fiscal year amounted to 5.07 billion dollars as against 6.26
billion dollars recorded in the same period last year, registering
a decline of almost 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the exports in the period also showed a decline of
11.8 percent compared to the same period of the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of current fiscal, the exports
totaled 4.36 billion dollars as against 4.94 billion dollars in
the corresponding period of the last year.
</P>
<P>
The officials described the slide in exports due to world-wide
recession and a substantial decline in the value prices.
</P>
<P>
They also held the economic sanctions imposed on Pakistan after
its nuclear tests in May last year a major cause adversely
affecting efforts to boost the country's exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the world-wide recession, many countries were
forced to devalue their currency which led to the decline in value
prices, thereby affecting Pakistan's competitiveness in the global
market, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
But, they hoped, as a result of improvement in the country's
economic milieu, following successful negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club, the exports are
likely to show signs of resilience.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Strives to Boost Its Coffee Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
launched a massive campaign in a bid to boost coffee exports, the
Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Wednesday quoted Rwandan Coffee Board
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to chairman of the coffee board OCIR Cafe, Anastase
Nzirasanaho, "Coffee exports account far 50 percent of the
Rwandan exports. "
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, coffee has$been the leading export of Rwanda,
Nzirasanaho said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Rwanda is aiming to export 15,000 tons of coffee
in 1999. Rwanda exported 13,000 tons of coffee in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has embarked on sensitizing coffee
farmers to form cooperatives which would allow them to obtain
loans from banks, said the coffee board chairman.
</P>
<P>
"Through cooperatives, coffee farmers will be able to acquire
credits, defend their interests, and marketing will become
easier,'' Nzirasanaho said lately in an interview with the RNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Rwandan government will also provide
agricultural technicians to coffee farmers regrouped in
cooperatives who will help take carduction, is the removal of the coffee export
tax which was paid
by farmers. Coffee export tax, estimated at 16 percent,troduce hybrid
coffee like Catura, Catimor and Harrar coffee which are resistant
to diseases and which are highly productive." Nzirasanaho said.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government aims at increasing coffee exports
production in quantity and quality," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> India's Infrastructure Growth Plummets to 1.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Growth in six infrastructure
industries in India including power, railway and petroleum had
plummeted to 1.9 percent during April-November in the current
fiscal year 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999) from 4.2
percent in the corresponding period of 1997-98, an economic survey
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dependence on budgetary allocations has been partly
responsible for the delay in the implementation of projects due to
paucity of funds and procedural constraints, the economic survey,
which was tabled to Parliament, said.
</P>
<P>
The survey asked the government to formulate attractive
investment and tariff policies to boost private investment in the
infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
It also called for adoption of innovative financing
arrangements by non-traditional lenders like banks to provide
adequate resources to the infrastructure sector.

<HEADLINE> Local Court Denies Voting Rights to Koreans in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 24 -- The High Court of Osaka, western Japan,
on Wednesday maintained a lower court ruling denying voting rights
in local elections to permanent Korean residents in Japan, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The High Court turned down an appeal by 43 permanent Korean
residents against an Osaka District Court ruling in May 1997,
which said that the Japanese Constitution does not necessarily
guarantee suffrage in local elections to foreign permanent
residents in the country.
</P>
<P>
The district court ruling said that although providing foreign
residents with local-level voting rights is constitutional, it is
possible that the legislature could reject such rights.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled in a similar case in February 1995 that
giving non-Japanese with permanent residence in Japan the right to
vote in prefectural and municipal elections is "not banned" in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The court also said it is up to national policy to determine
what measures should be taken over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Koreans in Japan, who number around 600,000 and form the
largest group of non-Japanese permanent residents, have no right
to vote or be elected even if they were born in Japan, and there
are growing calls for them to be given the right to vote in local
elections.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Austria Wednesday hailed the
visit by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Pakistan
and the outcome of his meetings with his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Austrian Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Benita
Ferroro Waldner said Austria, being a member of the European
Union, strongly welcomes the recent talks between the two prime
ministers and the Lahore Declaration issued after the summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is a positive symbol of maybe a long process of coming
together of these two countries," she said at a new conference
here.
</P>
<P>
She also called on Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Austria as host to CTBT and the organization there, appeals
and waits to see Pakistan sign CTBT as quickly as possible," she
noted. "It will be a positive step towards mitigation of tensions
in the region."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in a statement, Waldner said Pakistan is strategically
a very important country which is located at the crossroads of
Central Asia and subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, it has a special and great responsibility for
peace and security in the region and beyond that," she said. "This
is true for all the efforts, for instance, restoration of peace in
Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Waldner said the growing importance of Pakistan lies in its
economy.
</P>
<P>
Arriving here Wednesday, Waldner said her five-day visit to
Pakistan is aimed at accelerating bilateral economic and
commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
She said a few projects covering areas like steel production,
oil and gas exploitation and tourism were discussed in her
meetings with Pakistani officials.

<HEADLINE> British Court Postpones Pinochet Extradition Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A London court on Wednesday
postponed the extradition hearing for former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet while it awaits a House of Lords ruling on
whether he enjoys immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"We have set a new date of March 22," a spokeswoman for Bow
Street magistrates' court said.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ended a 12-day
hearing early this month on whether Pinochet enjoys immunity from
prosecution as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
The law lords had set aside a previous ruling that Pinochet did
not have immunity from prosecution because one member of the
former panel had strong links with Amnesty International, the
human group which strongly supports the trial of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
A press officer for the House of Lords told Xinhua on Wednesday
that she had not been informed when the Law Lords would make the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in a London hospital last October on
a warrant from a Spanish judge, who accused him of involvement in
the disappearances and deaths of over 3,000 people during his 17-
year-rule, which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
If the House of Lords rules in favor of Pinochet this time, the
retired general will be free to go back to Chile.

<HEADLINE> New Iranian Intelligence Minister Promises Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- New Iranian Intelligence
Minister Ali Yunesi on Wednesday promised to conduct reforms to
the Intelligence Ministry soon after he won a vote of confidence
from the Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
"Reforms will definitely be made," Yunesi told reporters after
the parliament approved his nomination by a vote of 197-9 with 18
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
He said that maintaining rule of law and values, and providing
accurate security information to relevant institutions would be
among his major tasks, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami appointed Yunesi earlier this month
to replace former Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi
after he was forced to resign for the alleged involvement of some
intelligence agents in the political killings of five dissidents
and intellectuals later last year.
</P>
<P>
The issue shocked the Iranian society and triggered a serious
political quarrel between pro-Khatami moderates and the
conservatives who control most of the country's state organs.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi said that 10 people have been arrested and some 20 to 30
agents been questioned on the killings, adding that some director
generals are among those arrested.
</P>
<P>
Among the four people who have recently been arrested, three
are employees of the Intelligence Ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi told the parliament that he would safeguard the power of
the ministry, saying he was "opposed to any disrespect, revealing
and defamation."
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry would be a secure and reliable
shelter for the people.
</P>
<P>
By hatching various plots, the enemies are attempting to
downgrade the country's information system, the new minister said,
adding that a powerful and competent information system is needed
to curb these conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi, who is believed to be a moderate cleric, also
expressed his belief that his ministry will play a key role in
safeguarding national interests abroad by working with the Foreign
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Australia to Restart Joint War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Australia
will resume their series of bilateral military exercises disrupted
last year due to financial constraints, Malaysian Defense Minister
Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Malaysia regretted the cancellation of the bilateral
exercises program for 1998. This is due to the downturn in our
economy. However, we are happy to say that the three exercises
planned for this year will be carried out," he told reporters
after receiving his Australian counterpart John Moore here.
</P>
<P>
He said the maneuvers involving military units from both
countries were codenamed "Harringaroo" in Pulau Pinang (in
Malaysia), "Kakadu" in Darwin and "Magpie" in Perth (both in
Australia).
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar said such exercises were significant as they
provided Malaysian soldiers the experience to operate in a
different theater.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia also appreciated the assistance and
understanding displayed by Australia during the economic downturn
that had enabled other bilateral activities to be carried out with
minimum disruption.
</P>
<P>
Last year, military exercises under the Five Power Defense
Arrangement (FPDA) were also affected by the regional economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
FPDA groups Britain, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and New
Zealand and member countries hold regular large scale maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Abang Abu Bakar said defense cooperation with Australia had
existed since pre-World War Two days and it had since been
enhanced by the formation of the FPDA in 1971 and the
Malaysia-Australia Joint Defense Program in 1992.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh said Wednesday that India has not taken any decision
so far on signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions in the Lower House of Parliament here,
Jaswant said that there was not an iota of truth in press reports
that India has agreed to sign CTBT in its present form.
</P>
<P>
"The government's stand continues to be what it has been," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Indo-U.S. talks over nuclear issues, Jaswant said
that India would not be guided by anybody in defining its nuclear
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
"We shall define our own nuclear deterrent on the basis of our
own assessment. It will not accept any suggestion from outside as
to what the minimum deterrent should be. It will be according to
altering security requirements based on our own assessment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States has accepted India's status as
a nuclear power, he said, "India is a nuclear power and this is a
fact and the fact cannot be disinvented."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Overseas Investment, Loans to Fall in Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's overseas investment and
loans in fiscal 1998 are predicted to fall by 23.4 percent from
the previous year to 1,603.8 billion yen (about 13.3 billion U.S.
dollars) due to recession in Japan and Asian economies, the Export-
Import Bank of Japan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in four years for Japan's investment
and loans overseas to fall.
</P>
<P>
Investment and loans by small and medium-sized manufacturers
capitalized at 1 billion yen (about 8.3 million dollars) or less
will be halved for the second year in a row, amounting to one-
fourth of those made in fiscal 1996, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1998, which ends on March 31 this year, the amount of
overseas investment and loans by Japanese manufacturers, which
account for 45 percent of the total, will drop 12.5 percent to 721
billion yen (about 5.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Investment and loans to China will be halved to about 70
billion yen (about 57.8 million dollars). Those to member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
which have been suffering from economic hardships stemming from
the Asian financial crisis, will fall 47 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecasts that Japan's manufacturers will not be
active in making overseas investment and loans over the next three
years.

<P>
MACAO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao will destroy large
quantities of pirated compact discs in public next week to show
the government's resolution of cracking down on piracy.
</P>
<P>
More than one million pieces of pirated CDs will be smashed
next Wednesday under the wheels of a heavy truck, according to
Rosa Silva Chan, director of the Macao Economic Department.
</P>
<P>
The move is to show the government's determined action to
combat against pirated CDs and make the public become more aware
about protecting intellectual property rights, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government has never relaxed the crackdown on CD piracy in
recent years, even during public holidays, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Macao marine police seized some 1.
74 million pieces of pirated CDs in 1998. In the first two months

<HEADLINE> India's Fiscal Deficit to Overshoot 5.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The fiscal deficit in the
current 1998-99 year (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999) is to
overshoot targeted 5.6 percent, said a pre-budget economic survey
tabled to Parliament here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey warned that the high unsustainable fiscal
deficit threatens the country's macroeconomic stability and asked
the government to make determined efforts to mobilize tax revenues
while containing and prioritizing public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
High fiscal deficits increased the risk that a country faced,
as it translated into higher financing costs which could deter
investment particularly in infrastructure sectors where borrowing
requirements were typically huge, it said.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey suggested that a Constitutional limit be
introduced for fiscal deficit, cuts in subsidy and expenditure and
downsizing of government.
</P>
<P>
Along with fiscal deficit, revenue deficit has also soared.
Revenue deficit as a percentage of gross fiscal deficit had
increased from an average of about 32 percent from 1985-86 to
1989-90 to 53 percent in 1998-99. This trend was reflective of the
fact that borrowings were increasingly being used to finance
current expenditure, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Millennium Bug Macao Banks Active in Removing Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Banks and government departments
in Macao have taken an active part in getting rid of the
millennium bug in their computer systems, according to sources
with a software company which takes charge of relevant debugging.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, most banking institutions and
government departments in Macao have made constant efforts to test
and improve their computer operations since the problem was raised.
</P>
<P>
Early programmers used only the last two digits to represent
year numbers. However, disorder will occur as the year 2000 comes
because computers may take it as the year 1900.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no certainty that Macao's banking system will
not go wrong in the future, the possibility that the millennium
bug shows its effect can be reduced to the minimum, technicians
with the software company said.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, most government departments use only separate
computers to deal with paperwork. In this sense, some additional
software is fairly enough to prevent the effect of the bug.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the owners of some small firms in Macao do
not have due awareness about the bug's harm.

<HEADLINE> India's Industry Growth Likely at 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- India's industry growth rate
is likely to grow by 4.7 percent in the current fiscal year
1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999), down from 5.9 percent in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The economic survey issued here Wednesday said that the growth
rate of industrial production had substantially decelerated to 3.5
percent in April-December this year compared to 6.7 percent in the
corresponding period last year. While mining suffered an absolute
decline to a negative 1.1 percent in April-December from 5.5
percent last year, growth in manufacturing sector for the period
fell to 3.7 percent from 6.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was also tabled in Parliament here Wednesday,
attributed the slowdown in industrial production to slackening of
demand due to falling export growth, decline in rural demand,
price competition from imports and slow take-off of actual
investment in infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Drying up of sources of funds due to continuing sluggishness in
capital markets and infrastructural bottlenecks had also affected
the growth.
</P>
<P>
Capital goods sector recorded a 9.8 percent growth in the first
nine months of the current year compared to 6.7 percent last year.
The expected increase in agricultural production in the current
year was also likely to have beneficial effects on demand for
consumer goods. Compared to a negative growth of 1.0 percent in
1997-98, the agriculture sector is expected to grow at 5.3 percent
in the current year, the economic survey said.
</P>
<P>
Trends in foreign direct investment (FDI) showed a deceleration
with the amount of FDI approved during January-October 1998
falling to 244.5 billion rupees (5.78 billion U.S. dollars)
compared to 466.58 billion rupees (12.12 billion U.S. dollars) in
the previous year, the economic survey said.

<HEADLINE> Man Held in Omagh Probe to Face Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A man held by police
investigating the Omagh bombing is due to appear before Dublin's
anti-terrorist court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the unnamed suspect would appear at the special
criminal court to face a number of charges in connection with the
bombing, a BBC television report said.
</P>
<P>
The man is the first person to be charged in connection with
the worst-ever bomb attack in Northern Ireland, which happened in
the town of Omagh last August, leaving 29 people dead and more
than 200 injured.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA, an extremist group which fights for the
independence of Northern Ireland, admitted setting off the car
bomb that killed shoppers and workers on the main street of the
town.
</P>
<P>
The man was among at least 11 people who were arrested in
carefully coordinated raids on both sides of the Northern Irish
border on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA is opposed to peace efforts that last year
produced a landmark accord between the province's main Protestant
and Catholic parties.
</P>
<P>
The dissident group believes that the deal cements British rule
over the disputed province.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Tax Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite much effort in the collection of arrears debt, the
South African Revenue Service (SARS) is still unable to stop the
growth of debtors, SARS told the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Excluding penalties and interest, the total tax debt rose 2.3
billion Rand (383 million Dollars) or 16 percent, SARS said.
</P>
<P>
Penalties and interest included, nearly 7.7 billion Rand (1.3
billion Dollars) was owed in value added tax (VAT) arrears, an
alarming increase of 31 percent over end-March last year.
</P>
<P>
The debt for company and personal income tax had stayed almost
the same at 7.6 billion Rand (1.3 billion Dollars), while in PAYE
(pay-as-you-earn) debt had increased to nearly 2.8 billion Rand
(467 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The staggering rise in VAT debt was receiving priority
attention, Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said. Analysts said
about three percent of the VAT rate was tied up in the debt.
</P>
<P>
SARS said the non-payment of VAT debt had escalated as the
economic conditions worsened and interest rates rose last year.
Companies were using the VAT they owed to finance businesses,
believing that the 19 percent interest charged by the service on
outstanding debt was better than the rate charged by banks.
</P>
<P>
SARS was intensifying its capacity to prosecute tax defaulters
and had in the past year broadened the tax base by identifying
over 170,000 businesses who were not registered for taxes, it
said.
</P>
<P>
An evaluation of businesses between October 1997 and December
1998 showed a default percentage of 17 percent for VAT, 26 percent
for income tax and 20 percent for PAYE.

<P>
PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major items in
leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After 18 days of talks in Rambouillet, and despite the
intention of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to fight
with Belgrade, the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians would resume talks
on March 15 on an agreement on the principles of solution. The
threat of NATO to strike Serbia is provisionally avoided.
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair presented on Tuesday a
plan to accelerate Britain's preparation to join the European
single currency. While reiterating his support of principle to the
euro, Blair refrained from committing fully to the currency and
said that this was just a change of speed and not of policy.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Serbs and Kosovar Albanians came nearer to an agreement to
solve the crisis in Kosovo on Tuesday in the last hours of the
Rambouillet conference and agreed to continue their talks. The
partial consent by Belgrade to the project of agreement repelled
the perspective of NATO air strikes against Serbian targets. The
Rambouillet talks have launched the process of negotiations on
Kosovo, but failed to achieve results.

<HEADLINE> S.African President to Meet Ugandan Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is to meet an envoy of Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Wednesday afternoon, a presidential spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is expected to focus on peace initiatives in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), will be held at 3:30
p.m. in Pretoria, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refused to comment on the meeting's agenda, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, accompanied by Foreign Minister
Theo Ben- Gurirab and senior officials, are also set to attend the
meeting, Nujoma's office has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would fly to South Africa from Windhoek just
after noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the current chair of the 14-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC), has played a major role in a
number of unsuccessful attempts to broker peace in the DRC since
war broke out there last August. South Africa calls for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the DRC later were feared to grow into a
regional warfare as Namibia, along with Zimbabwe and Angola, sent
troops to the DRC in August to help embattled DRC President
Laurent Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda,

on the other hand, were accused of supporting the rebels against
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Kosovo Peace Deal Achieved "90 Percent" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday defended
the partial peace agreement reached between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, saying the two sides had agreed on "90
percent" of the details of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"What we now have is an agreement on both sides to substantial
self-government for Kosovo and we have achieved consensus on
around 90 percent of a document which runs to well over 30 pages
setting out the details of a self-governing Kosovo," Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who co-chaired the talks held in France, was speaking
after 17 days of prolonged negotiations ended on Tuesday without a
final settlement, although the participants agreed to return to
the negotiation table in France on March 15.
</P>
<P>
"I may not be where I wanted us to be but I think we are much
further forward than I dared predict when we started the exercise,
" the Foreign Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Cook insisted that substantial progress had been made and said
the agreement was "a good deal for both sides."
</P>
<P>
"We have done a lot here even if we have not done enough. We
will use the next three weeks to convince the Serbs and to
convince the Albanians that the agreement is a good bargain for
both sides," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The major powers have welcomed the progress made at the Kosovo
peace talks in Paris, but both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians have
stressed that many obstacles still stand in the way of a
definitive peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended on Tuesday with the announcement of an interim
peace agreement which would give Kosovo substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Neither side signed the accord, and there was no agreement on
military implementation of the plan, which is to be backed up by a
NATO-led peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
admitted full agreement had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
She said the ethnic Albanians had agreed in principle to sign
the political accord in two weeks, but the Serbs had not agreed to
the political deal, and "had not engaged at all" on the deployment
of 30,000 NATO-led ground troops.

<HEADLINE> Australia Has Talked to Other Countries About East Timor Issue: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia has held talks with
the United States, European Union, Japan and Portugal over recent
developments in the East Timor issue, Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has also held talks over the issue with certain
international institutions, Downer told reporters after chairing
the 4th Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum in Bali on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many problems must be settled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the talks was to form a "contact group" that
would talk about the problem, including the possibility of
providing general assistance to East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony for 400 years, Downer was quoted by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on the
sidelines of the forum that Jakarta will not prohibit any country
from providing assistance to East Timor if the province decides to
separate from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia has been so relaxed about the East Timor
issue because Jakarta is happy with its option to grant East Timor
independence if its proposal for a wide-ranging autonomy for the
province is rejected.
</P>
<P>
"We are only awaiting whatever option (East Timor) will select.
(There is) no problem with the option. In the past, we were too
persistent (about) this East Timor question, but we are now
relaxed. No more problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community could help East Timor if it is no
longer a part of Indonesia, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Australia's plan to open a consulate in the East Timorese
capital of Dili, Alatas said it is too early for the country to
open it.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the United Nations never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Indonesian government announced a major shift
in its policy on East Timor, offering independence if the
territory rejects Indonesia's offer of special, broad autonomy
package.

<HEADLINE> 3 More Dead in Fresh Riots in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Three more people died, dozens
were injured and hundreds of buildings damaged as fresh riots
broke out in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the death toll to eight after five people died
Tuesday when homemade bombs exploded in Batu Merah Dalam village
in Ambon.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency quoted Witnesses as saying that the victims,
some of whom sustained bullet wounds in the legs, chest and head,
were taken by their families to the mountains or to nearby
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The situation has become worsen after a series of explosions
rocked the area between 3 a.m. and 10 a.m. local time Wednesday,
prompting people to flee their homes amid sounds of gunfire,
Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Prominent political and religious leaders in the city have made
efforts to settle the unrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the security apparatus has put the situation in Batu
Merah Dalam village under control, although some explosions could
still be heard at about 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and several other islands in Maluku province have been
the scene of violent clashes between Muslims and Christians groups
since mid-January which have left at least 127 people dead and
caused massive damage.
</P>
<P>
The violence was initially sparked by a dispute between a
Muslim migrant and a local Christian driver of a public minibus on
January 19.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Denies Involvement in Kurdish Leader Ocalan's Transfer Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday denied
its involvement in the transfer of captured Kurdish leader
Abdullah Ocalan on a plane purportedly bearing a Malaysian flag.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was not involved in the operation and had no knowledge
of Ocalan's repatriation from Kenya to Turkey using a Falcon 900B
executive jet, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told reporters
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister questioned the motive of a foreign media report
alleging that the Turkish markings on the plane which carried
Ocalan out of Nairobi were replaced with a Malaysian flag.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign media report was a fabrication which could
raise doubts whereas Malaysia maintained a foreign policy of
non-interference in the affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The information and pictures we obtained from Turkey's Foreign
Ministry show that the Falcon 900B executive jet used belongs to a
Turk corporate figure and is colored white with a single red
stripe underneath," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry is also taking appropriate measures to
ensure the safety of Malaysian diplomatic missions abroad, Syed
Hamid said, reminding all levels of Malaysians not to be taken in
by foreign smear campaign against the country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Proposes Means to Check Digital Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Wednesday
proposed that an office be set up here by Motion Pictures
Association of America (MPAA) to help in the country's efforts to
curb digital piracy of film and musical works.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry
Secretary-General Pahamin A. Rajab made the proposal Wednesday as
the MPAA's feedback was alleged to have resulted in criticism by
the Washington-based International Intellectual Property Alliance
(IIPA) that Malaysia had not done enough to check digital piracy
of musical and film works on CD, VCD and CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry spearheads
Malaysia's fight against all forms of piracy of intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that the MPAA did not bother to communicate with the
ministry, Pahamin told reporters "I'm inviting the MPAA to open an
office in the country so that we can have rapport and collaborate
in tackling the menace. Our doors are always open."
</P>
<P>
He said the MPAA should have emulated Business Software
Alliance (BSA) and Recording Industry of Malaysia (RIM) for
constantly being in liaison with his ministry to check software
and music piracy.
</P>
<P>
The MPAA should appreciate that by not having its
representative here could cause a major handicap for the ministry
in enforcing anti-piracy measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would also require representatives of
holders of intellectual property rights to authenticate
copyrighted works during raids on premises suspected of selling
pirated products.
</P>
<P>
Pahamin said "without the copyright holder representatives
tagging along during such raids, enforcement officers would not be
able to discern the original from pirated copy."
</P>
<P>
Pahamin said Malaysia is among the very few countries doggedly
determined to wipe out piracy of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
Pahamin himself heads a ministry special task force to deal
with the problem in an integrated approach with the police,
customs as well as music and film producers.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth in Baltic Nations to Slow Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth rate in
nations around the Baltic Sea is predicted to slow down to 1.4
percent this year from 2.8 percent in 1998, according to the
latest report released by a Swedish bank.
</P>
<P>
Russia's economy will be the worst among the 10 nations
including Norway, with its growth rate estimated at minus nine
percent compared with minus 4.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the Russian economy will make the economic
growth of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania drop by nearly 1-2.5
percent to around 2-3 percent, since they have close economic ties
with Russia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said Poland will have a better economic situation
compared with its Baltic neighbors, with its growth rate at four
percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany is predicted to achieve an economic recovery in the
second half of 1999 with its growth rate for the whole year
forecast to reach 1.7 percent, down by 1.1 percent from 1998,
while Finland and Sweden are expected to gain a 2.9-percent and
five-percent growth rate respectively.

<HEADLINE> Air Strikes against Serbs in Kosovo Still Possible but Little Likelihood: French DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard made the point while giving a lecture at the Institute
of Defense and Strategic Studies of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If the Serb forces were to take violent actions
against Albanians in Kosovo, apart from legitimate defense, this
would be a basis for the launching of the strikes."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a statement by major powers that an
agreement had been reached Tuesday on substantial autonomy for
Kosovo after marathon talks between Serbs and majority ethnic
Albanians, Richard said the agreement reached last night meant the
major obstacles were overcome.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report that both sides distanced themselves
from the accord, Richard said although the deal was only partial
resolution, it had reduced the immediate danger of military
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Belgrade has been convinced that if they
continue to resist the principle on Kosovo problems, they would
face military consequences.
</P>
<P>
Richard admitted that the Kosovo problem is a domestic issue in
legal terms.
</P>
<P>
He Said members of the Contact Group agree the issue is not
about giving independence to majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
but about giving them specified autonomy within the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It is not now to develop a smaller ethnic state, he stressed.
Possible shift to Kosovo independence will lead to more confusion
in Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Euro-Asiatic security relations, Richard said: "Even if
security problems are now increasingly viewed in
'social-economic' terms because of the crisis afflicting your
region, we must not allow a simplistic division of roles to
develop between the USA on the one hand and Japan and Europe on
the other, leaving to the latter the task of making purely
economic contributions to regional stability, while the USA would
avoid its obligations on the pretext that it is taking on the bulk
of the military security."
</P>
<P>
"European solidarity in the security field cannot be reduced
merely to providing economic or humanitarian aid, just as the
American contribution to regional stability and security cannot be
limited to the presence of the 7th fleet," he commented.
</P>
<P>
Richard is in Singapore on a two-day reciprocal visit at the
invitation of Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for
Defense Tony Tan who visited France in October Last year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Attacks Japan Over Its Failure to Help Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime
Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer Wednesday lashed out at
Japan, saying it was not doing enough to help Indonesia and that
its failure to rebuild its economy was impacting on Australia, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The visiting deputy prime minister also warned a delegation of
Indonesian government ministers that they, as well as Australia,
must resist the forces of darkness at home which wanted to reverse
progress on trade liberalization, AAP said in a dispatch sent from
Bali, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Despite its position as the world's second largest economy,
Japan was "the economy doing the least to help Indonesia's
recovery at this time", Fischer was quoted as telling the
Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The ... deep recession if not depression in Japan continues to
add to the burden of the situation with regard to regional
recovery through Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It impacts on Australia, it's our largest trading partner."
</P>
<P>
Australia welcomed the steps that Japan was taking to shore up
its sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
"But we remain very, very concerned about the fact that Japan
is in this very difficult circumstance and showing little ability
to get back to zero which in itself would make a huge contribution
if that was to happen in this year or next," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it is extremely unlikely that that will happen."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Economic Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita described
his country's economic crisis as a nightmare, but hoped that by
2002 or 2003 the situation could be turned around so that
pre-crisis growth rates of five to seven percent could be
restored, AAP said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) has ruled that the tenure of the next
elected president of Nigeria would be four years which is in
consonance with the provision of the 1979 constitution.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata told a press conference in
capital Abuja on Tuesday that the incumbent president would have a
four-year first term with an option for a second term.

<P>
He noted that the president cannot hold the office beyond two
terms, according to a Daily Times report Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
Akpata noted that only the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and
the All People's Party (APP) would be recognized by the INEC
during the presidential poll on February 27.
</P>

The ballot papers will bear the logo of each of the three
parties, he said, adding any vote given to the Alliance for
Democracy (AD) would be nullified as "invalid vote".

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
oscillated in a tight range Wednesday to close weaker, after
struggling to maintain a morning break through the 64 U.S. cents
level.

U.S. cents in Sydney Tuesday.

The weakness in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar was

<HEADLINE> Khatami Redefines Role of Information Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Having wrestled the Information
(Intelligence) Ministry from conservative control, President
Mohammad Khatami on Wednesday seemed trying to redefine its role
in defending Iran's Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
"Iran needs a strong information system, not a horrifying
police mechanism," Khatami said before the Majlis, or parliament,
as it was to start debate on his proposed new Information Minister
Ali Yunesi.
</P>
<P>
"This is the requirement of religious values and the condition
of our society," Khatami said. The government favors "light and
brains" not "arms and fists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami named Yunesi in place of former Intelligence Minister
Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, who was forced to resign for the
involvement of some of his agents in political murders inside the
country.
</P>
<P>
Five dissidents and intellectuals were mysteriously killed last
year, and a thorough investigation ordered by Khatami shed light
on the role of security agents in the surreptitious operations to
stymie growing liberalism.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi won a vote of confidence 197:9 with 18 abstentions in
the 270-seat Majlis. This marked Khatami's success in taking over
one of the most important state organs previously dominated by the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Khatami told the parliament that "if our country possesses a
powerful information system it would not need to impose means of
intimidation over the society."
</P>
<P>
Sound information and proper interpretation on national
security and interests would shelter everyone and help shape up
the country's policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Supreme National Security Council, Khatami said
the importance of security should not be underestimated, otherwise
numerous dangers would threaten the country both from within and
outside.
</P>
<P>
He described the political killings of dissidents in the
country as "one of the darkest and most evil points in the history
of the system."
</P>
<P>
The revelation had sent shock waves across the Iranian society
and triggered a serious political quarrel between the pro-Khatami
moderates and the conservatives, which dominate most of the state
power.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
arrived here Wednesday for a four-day official visit to Russia at
the invitation of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
During the visit -- his first to Russia since taking office as
premier last March, Zhu is scheduled to meet with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and hold talks with Primakov for the
fourth regular meeting between the prime ministers of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The premiers' discussions will be centered on expanding trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries and seeking
common development.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu and his entourage, including his wife Lao An,
Deputy Secretary-General Shi Xiushi of the State Council and Vice
Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan, were greeted at the Vnukovo-2
Airport by Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov,
Russian Ambassador to China Igor Rochachev, Chinese State
Councilor Wu Yi, and Chinese Ambassador to Russia Wu Tao.
</P>
<P>
Wu was among the other members of Zhu's entourage, including
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Shi Guangsheng, Minister in charge of the Commission of Science,
Technology and Industry for National Defense Liu Jibin and
Minister of Railway Fu Zhihuan, who arrived here Monday to make
final preparations for the Chinese premier's Russia visit.
</P>

During Zhu's trip, which will also take him to St. Petersburg,
Russia's second largest city, the Chinese premier will meet with
Russian Federation Council Speaker Yegor Stroyev and Russian
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
While China and Russia have maintained a rapid growth of
relations in recent years, bilateral trade volume has dropped due
to repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and other factors.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, Sino-Russian trade
fell to 5.48 billion U.S. dollars last year, down by 10.5 percent
from the 1997 level.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have expressed confidence that the regular meeting
of the prime ministers will promote the growth of economic and
trade cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister On China's Stand on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua ) -- China opposes military action
against Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, because that will be a
gross infringement upon the Charter of the United Nations and the
principles of the international laws.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the remark when
conferring with Slobodan Unkovic, Yugoslavian ambassador to China,
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang expounded China's stand on the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Military action is detrimental to the final solution to the
problem and would also cut the peace negotiations which have
already seen certain development in halfway," he said, adding that
the action could bring disastrous outcome to the stability and
people's life in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that China has concerned
about the peace talks on Kosovo issue held in Rambouillet of
France and noticed the progress in the process made by relevant
parties through patient dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Chinese government always advocates that the
Kosovo issue is an internal affair of Yugoslavia and the problem
can be solved only through peaceful negotiations on the basis of
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
while ensuring the lawful rights and interests of all ethnic
groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "such method is the only effective and right path
to resolve the problem and is conductive to the regional peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
He told the ambassador that "We called on the international
community and all relevant sides in Yugoslavia to continue seeking
ways for a political solution with sense and patience for the sake
of all ethnic groups in Kosovo and the regional peace and
stability."
</P>
<P>
Unkovic said that the Yugoslavian government highly values
China's principle stand on the Kosovo issue and that the
Yugoslavian government will continue its efforts to find a
political solution to the problem through dialogues.

<HEADLINE> Australian Promises to Fund Indonesian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia would provide up
to 15 million Australian dollars (9.45 million U.S. dollars) in
June to help Indonesia run its first democratic elections in more
than 40 years, visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the June 7 general elections would be
a watershed for Australia's nearest Asian neighbor and, if they
were conducted correctly, could make Indonesia the world's third
largest democracy, the Australian Associated Press reported in a
dispatch sent from Bali, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Downer urged the international community to fully get behind
the electoral process as a political solution was crucial to
solving the economic crisis also gripping the country with a
population of 205 million.
</P>
<P>
Australia regards Indonesia as one of the four most important
countries to Australia, the other three are the United States,
Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government regards the elections in June in
Indonesia as an important watershed, not only in Indonesia's
political development which it clearly is, but for Indonesia's
economy as well," Downer told reporters outside the
Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and the European Union were also
likely to help fund the elections.
</P>
<P>
"If these elections succeed I think we can expect a fairly
rapid return of business confidence in the Indonesian economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian ministers at the forum also pinned their hopes on a
successful election as key to a return to the economic prosperity
of the past.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's top economic minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said
Indonesia was lagging behind other Asian nations affected by the
economic crisis because of the political situation.
</P>
<P>
"We are banking very much on the elections and on the process
of the elections for economic recovery," he told the forum.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia remains Australia's tenth largest trading partner
despite the crisis, with bilateral trade worth about 3.52 billion
U.S. dollars in calendar 1998.

<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday urged the country's nutritionists and dietitians
to assist the government in the war against hunger and
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 44th Annual Convention of the
Nutritionist-Dietitians' Association of the Philippines, the
president asked for recommendations on policies and legislative
measures to wipe out these scourges stalking many poor children.
</P>
<P>
Nutrition and dietetics are important components of his
administration's food security program, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited latest surveys by a government food research institute
showing that eight of 100 pre-school kids are underweight while
close to 1.4 million children of pre-school and school age suffer
from health problem due to severe vitamin deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
To address this threat to the future, Estrada underscored the
need to produce not only sufficient food, but also the right kind
of food that will supply the nutritional needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's food security program also aims to
create more jobs and productive opportunities in the agricultural
and fisheries sectors.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling weakens Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling weakened
against U. S. Dollar Tuesday with the Central Bank's Monday mean
rate of 63.30 Shillings rising to 65.61 Shillings against the
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Sources within the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said that the
bank would let the Shilling find its level without intervention,
quoted Wednesday by the Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Shilling dropped from 61 Shillings against the
Dollar to 66 Shillings just within two hours of trading after the
news of the government reshuffle that led to the exit of Finance
Minister Simeon Nyachae.
</P>
<P>
Last week's Shilling drop was the worst since the current
government was elected in December 1997, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts argued that the Shilling's decline was due to
investor anxiety in the money market caused by the political
change.
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts here said that the local currency might
remain under pressure until the market adjusted to the changes.
It might take up to one month before getting to where Nyachae
left it.

<HEADLINE> Africa Suffers Increasing Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) - The African continent is
suffering an increased abuse of illicit drugs, with its big cities
and seaports being used to transit heroin from Asia as well as
cocaine from South America to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Wednesday quoted the 1998 report of the
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) as saying that
instead of smuggling from India, the making of psychotropic drug,
or methaqualone, is getting popular in eastern and southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
As an example, a machine to process drugs on a large scale was
seized at the Dar es Salaam port in Tanzania in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report, globally launched Tuesday, said that a major
problem in several African countries is "glue sniffing" of
volatile solvents by street children.
</P>
<P>
The Board has welcomed the accession of Mozambique to all the
three international drug control treaties and urged the
governments of Angola, Central African Republic, the Comoros,
Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea and others to accede to
the treaties.
</P>
<P>
However, the report points out that several countries in Africa
still lack adequate legislation to implement the provisions of the
treaties as well as the administrative capacity to give full
effect to their national laws and regulations.

<HEADLINE> New Iranian Intelligence Minister Wins Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ali Yunesi on Wednesday won a
vote of confidence from the Iranian Majlis (parliament) to be the
new intelligence minister in the government of President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Following two hours of debate at the Majlis open session, 197
deputies voted for and nine against Yunesi, and 18 others
abstained, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami last Wednesday introduced Yunesi as his new
intelligence minister to the Majlis for approval.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi was appointed to take over the Intelligence Ministry
after former Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi
resigned on February 8 under pressure from the moderates for the
involvement of some intelligence agents in political killings.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife
were stabbed to death and at least three dissident writers were
found dead after their mysterious missing late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Ministry admitted that some of its own
"willful" were behind the murders. The admittance triggered a
serious political quarrel between the two rival factions.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Khatami moderate groups put strong pressures on
Najababadi by calling for his resignation and a fundamental
change in the country's intelligence and security systems.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives also launched counterattacks by
claiming that some of Khatami's sworn supporters were behind the
political murders.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi, born in 1955 in the city of Nahavand, western province
of Hamadan, was one of the three members of the special committee
appointed by Khatami to probe into the political killings.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi once served in the Palestinian and Lebanese guerrilla
camps before the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979.
</P>
<P>
After the revolution, he served as head of Tehran's branch of
the revolutionary court, head of second branch of army's
revolutionary court, head of army revolutionary court, public
prosecutor of Tehran for four years (1988-91) and head of the
judicial organization of the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Drought Threatens Vietnam's Northern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Hot weather has brought severe
water shortages to more than one million people in Vietnam's
northern provinces, Vietnam's English newspaper "the Saigon Times
Daily" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's Irrigation and Water Resource Management
Department, incomplete figures show that by mid-February over 1.73
million people had been thirsty for water, with one million in
Nghe An province and 12,000 in highland areas of Lai Chau province
in the worst situation.
</P>
<P>
By mid-January, average rainfall in the northern region had
reached 40 mm to 80 mm. Nevertheless, water flows into rivers and
reservoirs remained scanty, bringing about water shortage of 15
percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, major reservoirs in north Vietnam are three meters
to six meters lower than the normal levels and even 10 meters to
20 meters lower in some reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Water supply for the 1998-1999 winter-spring paddy crop and
people's daily consumption will fall short, according to Vietnam's
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 368,500 hectares (ha) of 2.52
million ha of winter-spring paddy will be short of water,
including 200,000 ha of the total 1.42 million ha in the southern
Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
However, 520,570 ha of the total cultivation area of 658,473 ha
in 15 major northern provinces has been irrigated as the Hoa Binh
and Thac Ba hydroelectric plants have steadily discharged water
into the Red River, ensuring normal water flows into the Red River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Weather Bureau forecast sparse rains for the
period until the end of March. If this happens, most Vietnam's
northern provinces, the northern part of central Vietnam and that
of central highlands will be hard hit by the drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
spending 80 million U.S. dollars this year for the construction of
more classrooms and the purchase of textbooks and desks for the
public schools, government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund is used on the construction of over 8,000 classrooms
and the acquisition of 7.8 million textbooks and nearly 400,000
desks for the school year 1999-2000, the officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project is in line with the government's policy to make
quality basic education more accessible to the poor, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
They said the Department of Education, Culture and Sports has
taken measures to stamp out official corruption to save public
funds for pro-poor projects and programs.
</P>
<P>
These anti-graft and cost-cutting steps include a two-year
moratorium on purchase of supplementary teaching materials and the
prohibition on public school administrators and teachers from
using funds to pay for non-official seminars and conferences.
</P>
<P>
The government is eliminating this kind of misuse of money and
trying to bring more useful materials in schools, the officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Have New Adoption Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's long-awaited
draft law of adoption was completed by the Ministry of Social
Welfare, labor and Veteran Affairs recently, waiting the Council
of Ministers for discussion before it is passed to National
Assembly for eventual adoption.
</P>
<P>
The draft law is much more strict than the old one as the
government does not want Cambodian infants and children to be
taken abroad for adoption and subsequently ill-treated by their
adopted or foster parents.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Child Welfare Department, more
than 700 Cambodian children have been adopted by families from the
United States, France, Australia and Canada since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The new law will require foreign families who want to adopt
Cambodian children to posses letters from their respective
governments permitting them to seek adoption of the children.
</P>
<P>
The letter must also certify the competence and financial
capability of the families such as properties, occupation, marital
status and other essential information.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that Cambodia's draft law of adoption was
similar to that in Philippines, India, Vietnam and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry official said that there has been rampant
trafficking of Cambodian children abroad, especially to Thailand
and Vietnam from where they are smuggled abroad.

ABU DHABI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Middle East countries are
expected to become a 1-billion-U.S.-dollar-per-year market of
diamond studded jewelry, according to a press release from the
Dubai World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
"In a market with relatively high per capita disposable
incomes and also a penchant for gold, the demand for diamond
studded jewelry is steadily growing," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The International Jewelry Exhibition to be held in Dubai from
April 6 to 10 will be an ideal platform to further expand the
market in the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of diamond and stones-studded jewelry products,
including cut and uncut gem stones, gold, platinum, silver
jewelry, pearls, antique and costume jewelry and gem-sets are to
be put on display.
</P>
<P>
The event also provides an attractive opportunity to meet high
profile customers, individual buyers as well as major suppliers of
jewelry in the region.
</P>
<P>
This year's show bears a greater importance because jewelry
dealers are looking for new markets to counter the Asian economic
crisis, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Jewelry dealers from some European, Asian and Middle East
countries have shown their intentions to attend the event.

<HEADLINE> UNDP to Help Tanzania Solve Urgent Water Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has pledged 150,000 U.S. Dollars to
assist Tanzania's Ministry of Water to carry out an emergency
water supply program.
</P>
<P>
The financial support will be used for drilling seven bore
holes in the capital Dar es Salaam and the eastern Coast Region,
and for auxiliary equipment or facilities, the official newspaper
Daily News Wednesday quoted a UNDP statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, UNDP released 28 million Shillings (about 40,000 U.S
Dollars) to the ministry for drilling and test pumping of seven
bore holes at various sites in Dar es Salaam the the Coast Region.
</P>
<P>
Location of drilling sites has been accomplished and drilling
is expected to start within a week.
</P>
<P>
Following a prolonged drought starting last October, Tanzania's
Ministry of Water plans to drill 250 new wells, finish 23 wells
under construction and rehabilitate 200 existing wells as a
measure of solving the water problem in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa said that the water
projects need a cost of 3.8 billion Shillings (about 5.5 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
When all these water wells are completed, a total of 22.5
million gallons of water will be produced per day, compared with
current level of 18 million gallons, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia May Reopen Consulate on East Timor: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has given Australia
permission to reopen its consulate in the disputed territory of
East Timor as the future of the territory is being negotiated,
visiting Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Wednesday in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also announced that Australia was prepared
to provide generous assistance to East Timor, a province Indonesia
has announced it might release if an offer of autonomy within the
republic is rejected by the East Timorese, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported in a dispatch sent from Bali.
</P>
<P>
As concern increases over the possibility of civil war between
pro- and anti-Indonesian groups in the territory, Downer said
Australia would organize a contact group of interested nations
which could help with the transition to autonomy or independence,
the wire service said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a long meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas, Downer said Indonesia was considering very widespread
consultation of the East Timorese people over whether they
accepted or rejected the offer of autonomy as a final solution.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has given permission for Australia to reopen its
consulate in the East Timorese capital of Dili. The consulate was
closed in 1971 when the it was still a colony of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government is prepared in principle to allow us
to proceed with the opening of our consulate," Downer told
reporters outside the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum
meeting in Bali.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country and
declared it as the 27th province in 1976. The move was recognized
by Australia but not by the United Nations, which still regards
Portugal as the administering authority.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia was also asking a number of countries
around the world, including the United States, Japan, Portugal and
the European Union, to set up a contact group on East Timor to
talk about relevant issues and perhaps coordinate assistance.
</P>
<P>
"That contact group will be a new component of the diplomacy of
dealing with East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer is due to visit Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Thursday in Jakarta and then jailed East Timorese resistance
leader Jose Xanana Gusmao to further discuss East Timor issue.

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Digital video disc (DVD)
players, the latest generation of video devices, will enter the
Chinese market on a large scale next month, according to Science
Times.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zhiqiang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of

by the end of this year. He says that the Institute has done
research on how to keep production costs of DVDs down so that the
ordinary Chinese can afford to buy them.
</P>
<P>
DVDs are designed to play movies much like VCRs but the digital
format provides a crisper sound and clearer picture.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian, Australian Foreign Ministers Discuss East Timor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas had an almost two-hour meeting with his Australian
counterpart Alexander Downer in Bali on Tuesday night to discuss
efforts to seek a solution to the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Antara News Agency after the meeting,
Alatas said that he and Downer discussed the latest developments
concerning efforts to seek a solution to the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that Australia has paid special attention in the
effort for seeking a settlement for Indonesia's youngest province.
Therefore, it will be proper for him to brief his Australian
counterpart on that issue.
</P>
<P>
Australia, in seeking a solution to the East Timor issue,
preferred an option offered by the Indonesian government for a
wide-ranging autonomy for the province, Alatas was quoted by
Antara Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Australia has also proposed that such wide-ranging
autonomy should run for 10 to 15 years, after which the East
Timorese people should be given an opportunity to choose -- to
remain with Indonesia or to be independent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"That is the Australian position. Thus, there is no shift in
its position. So as the Indonesian position has also been very
clear -- to provide broad autonomy for East Timor as a final
solution. And if the majority of the East Timor people reject it,
there will be a second option, under which the Indonesian
government would propose to the People's Consultative Assembly the
release of East Timor from the Unitary State of Indonesia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as the 27th province, but the United Nations never
recognized the move.

KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Wife of Kampala City's
embattled Mayor Nasser Sebaggala, Nava Nabagesera, has vowed to
spearhead the fight against poverty and dirt in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Nabagesera, also the deputy speaker of Kampala city council,
said Tuesday that she's charting out a new approach on both
private and public issues, the Monitor newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the biggest problem in Uganda is poverty, not
even the referendum and she has resolved to carry out
socio-economic work for the poor.
</P>
<P>
She will use her NGO, Nabawa Development Association, to uplift
living standards of the urban poor in all the divisions of the
city, she added.
</P>
<P>
Nabagesera attributed the widespread sanitation problems in the
city to poverty. So poverty should be alleviated before solving
other problems.
</P>
<P>
She was brought to limelight after her husband was detained in
the United States last July for lying to Customs officers and
using forged checks. He was convicted last year and is said to be
sentenced Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam Steel Corporation (VSC),
Vietnam's state steel maker, intends to increase production this
year despite losses estimated at 40 billion Vietnamese Dong (about
2.9 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, Vietnam's English daily Vietnam
News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
VSC has about 105,000 tons of iron ingots and 159,000 tons of
construction steel stockpiled as a result of the regional economic
turmoil's impact on Vietnam's heavy industries, particularly
steel.
</P>
<P>
VSC joint-ventures have produced 600,000 tons of construction
steel of all types and have the capacity to make 1.7 million tons
a year but most work at just 60 percent of design capacity because
of over supply.
</P>
<P>
But Vietnamese experts said that domestic demand for steel
products will recover this year and might increase by five to
seven percent, about 2.5 million tons, against last year.
</P>
<P>
VSC's schedule is to produce 1,250 tons of rolled iron (up 7.3
percent), 30,000 tons of tubing (up 3.45 percent) and 40,000 tons
of plated sheet iron of all types (up 14.29 percent).
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese state steel company is also planning to import
750,000 tons of steel and 800,000 tons of iron ingots.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Deputy Minister of the Industrial Ministry
Nhuyen Xuan Chuan as saying that by 2000 Vietnam will make a
variety of new steel products -- including iron ingots and sheet
iron -- to limit imports.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Meeting with Lakers to Finalize Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman reportedly is
meeting with the Los Angeles Lakers tonight to finally sign with
the team.
</P>
<P>
One day after the randy rebounder held one of the most bizarre
news conferences in sports history, ESPN, citing unidentified
sources close to the situation, is reporting tonight that Rodman
had a meeting with Lakers officials at which he would sign a
contract paying him $468,000 for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
Rodman will make approximately $12,000 per game for the Lakers'
remaining 39 games. According to the report, the contract has an
option for a second year only if Rodman gets injured.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Lakers would announce Rodman's signing
after tonight's game at Vancouver in order to avoid making a
roster move before the game. The Lakers' official announcement
said they hope to sign Rodman "very soon."
</P>
<P>
Should all of this occur, Rodman would make his Lakers debut
Friday against Clippers.
</P>
<P>
Rodman made $9 million last season, when he helped the Chicago
Bulls win their third straight championship. But he also hurt the
team with his unpredictable mood swings and by ignoring team rules.
</P>
<P>
Superstar center Shaquille O'Neal does want Rodman alongside
him on the front line.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis Rodman will give us an added spark," O'Neal said after
Monday's loss at Denver. "He will get some rebounds and will be a
boost to the team. We still have a long way to go."

LOS ANGELES, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A study released Tuesday
suggested that U.S. schools should spend more money on training
teachers to use computers and Internet as teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
While the nation's 87,000 schools have about six million
computers and about 80 percent of the schools have Internet access,
just 20 percent of the teachers polled felt they could use the
technology in their classrooms, according to the study by the CEO
Forum on Education and Technology, a group of 20 business and
education leaders that examined the education data.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately this is about whether your child is experiencing
the fruits of the information technology revolution," said Alan G.
Spoon, president of The Washington Post Co. and co-chair of the
CEO Forum.
</P>
<P>
The forum recommends that schools spend more money on training
teachers and that teacher training in technology be mandatory by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Right now, 25 states require computer classes for teachers
seeking a license, but only two states -- North Carolina and
Vermont -- require potential teachers to prove they can use the
technology.

<HEADLINE> Drug Problem Held Hostage: Interpol Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Interpol official Paul Higdon
said a political situation, viewed by many as a serious problem,
has held hostage the universally recognized problem of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Higdon, director of Criminal Intelligence Directorate of
Interpol, made the remarks here Tuesday at the opening ceremony of
the Fourth International Heroin Conference sponsored by Interpol
(International Criminal Police Organization).
</P>
<P>
Higdon's criticism is believed to be aimed at countries
boycotting the conference.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said Interpol respects their decisions because it
is a judgment that each and every country must make on its own and
based on its own values.
</P>
<P>
He regretted their non-participation, saying that he feels
there is more to gain through dialogue than through boycott.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar, as one of the major heroin producing countries
in the world, is opening its door to the delegates and to the
press to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Interpol has been criticized for providing
Myanmar, a member country since 1954, a platform from which it
could speak out on the subject.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the delegates of the countries represented at
the conference to optimize their use on Interpol facilities.
</P>
<P>
He added that the conference will review the world situation
and attempt to identify new tactics and strategies to be adopted
for galvanizing cooperation and mutual assistance within the
framework of Interpol.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference, which last until Friday, is being
attended by a total of 74 delegates from 21 members of Interpol
out of 177 including Australia, Brunei, China, Japan, host
Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Singapore, South
Africa, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on specific topics of concern to law
enforcement agencies like heroin production and trafficking,
trafficking routes, criminal groups, payment systems, essential
chemicals and precursors.

<HEADLINE> PM Shipley Concerned at Drug Abuse in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny
Shipley Wednesday renewed her call for government agencies and the

community to work together to limit the terrible damage caused by
illegal
drug use.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, including parents, teachers and principals, the
Police
border control agencies, life skills and health educators and
services
treating drug addiction, have a role to play," Shipley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Shipley's statement is a response to the recent reports that an

Ecstasy-type drug put four South Auckland schoolgirls in hospital
and
almost killed one of them. The four Mangere College pupils took
the drug
which had been dissolved in a soft drink. One 15-year-old is now
still in
intensive care after collapsing in front of schoolmates. Two are
under
observation, and another has been discharged.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked my Ministers of Education, Police, Health and
Customs to
update me on the programs we have underway to educate our children
about
the harms of drug abuse and what we are doing to limit access to
all
illegal drugs," the prime minister said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
She said she was pleased to have the opportunity at the weekend
to
talk to Australian Prime Minister John Howard about "strategies
for
combating drug abuse" and they had agreed to "work together on
this
issue."
</P>
<P>
"My government wants security for New Zealanders, and as part
of that
we will continue to take a tough line against drug abuse," Shipley

concluded.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Apples Exported To Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province, one of China's
leading apple producers, started exporting apples to Europe
recently, when a Spanish company bought 160 tons of apples, worth
1.3 million yuan, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The experiment by the Huasheng Fruit Company was possible
because local farmers began growing better fruit and sending
representatives to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The company spent 200 million yuan on an up-to-date
photoelectric grading and separating system and built an air-
conditioned warehouse that can hold 15,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Apples have become the leading money earner for Shaanxi,
bringing in 8 billion yuan (963.8 million US dollars) a year to
the loess plateau province, which has 533,000 hectares of land
planted in apple trees, making it China's second largest apple-
grower, after Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale apple tree planting here began in the mid-1980s. It
has fundamentally changed the life of farmers who for generations
relied on small-scale barren land grain production.

<HEADLINE> Record Congestion of Ships at Chittagong Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- There is now a record of
congestion of ships at the Chittagong port, the largest port in
Bangladesh, due to repeated prolong hartals (destructive strikes)
staged by opposition parties, said reports reaching here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ninety ships with about 300,000 tons of imported cargo have now
been stuck up at the port, according to Chittagong Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the number of ships calling at the port has come down
significantly because of the congestion.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry and
the Bangladesh Steamer Agents Association expressed grave concern
at the "increasing hartal culture" which has created a lot of
problems to the normal operations at the port.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the leaders of all political parties to shun
the politics of hartals in the greater economic interests of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Bangladesh's opposition
alliance has staged three country-wide hartals -- a
down-to-midnight hartal on January 26, a 60-hour hartal on
February 9-11 and a 66-hour country-wide hartal from February
23-25 -- to protest against the government's rejection of their
four-point demand for joining the country's municipal elections.

<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have detected only
seven white-flag dolphins in the Yangtze River since last December,
two fewer than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin is the most endangered dolphin species
in the world, with fewer than 100 living on the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Today's Science and Technology Daily quoted scientists as
saying that the dolphin population is far below the number
required for the species to continue, and they have called on the
public and government to increase protection efforts and curb
pollution and other human activities that may harm the dolphin.
</P>
<P>
The dolphin population has been decreasing by nearly 100 every
five years since 1986.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring conducted by local governments along the Yangtze
in November 1997 detected only 21 white-flag dolphins.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Developing Super Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
researching methods of developing a super steel which will be
stronger and have a longer service life in order to minimize the
steel industry's consumption of energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
This search for a super steel was included in the state's basic
research program for the next five years, which began at the end
of last year. More than 14 million yuan (1.7 million U.S. dollars
will be invested in this research program in the first two years.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to double the strength and service life of carbon
steel, alloy steel, and low-alloy steel, which make up 70 percent
of China's steel production, said Zhao Pei, associate chief
engineer of the Institute of Iron and Steel.
</P>
<P>
"One ton of the super steel will be equivalent to several tons
of current steels," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China's annual demand for steel will
exceed 200 million tons by the middle of the 21st century, and
this could prove to be a tremendous burden on China's economy,
energy resources, environment and transportation, as it will
require an increase in annual steel production from the current
100 million tons to more than twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
At present, the steel industry consumes about 10 percent of
China's energy.
</P>
<P>
The development of a steel could economize the use of elements
including vanadium, titanium, and rare-earth, said Zhao.

<HEADLINE> Thai Companies to Receive Loans from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's manufacturers and
other businesses are likely to benefit from Japanese loans
totaling 1.35 billion U.S. dollars this year, a Finance Ministry
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Export-Import Bank (JEXIM) is expected to provide 500
million dollars to the Industrial Finance Cooperation of Thailand,
250 million dollars to Krung Thai Bank, the government-owned
commercial bank, and 600 million dollars in a co-financing
arrangement with the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The loan, expected to be yen-denominated, will focus on the
assistance to Thai exporters and small- and medium-sized
manufacturers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Details of interest rates, repayment terms and targeted
borrowers were being discussed by JEXIM and the Finance Ministry
and were expected to be finalized this year.
</P>
<P>
The loans are part of Japan's 30-billion-dollar bail-out fund
for regional economies.
</P>
<P>
Despite Thailand's forecast of a one percent growth for the
country's gross domestic product this year, JEXIM predicted that
the Thai economy will contract slightly before bottoming out in
2000.
</P>
<P>
JEXIM also said that exports of Thailand were unlikely to
increase significantly in the short term, despite heavy support
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Except for domestic obstacle of high levels of non-performing
loans, uncertain global economic prospects would also hinder Thai
export performance, JEXIM added.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Takes Toll on Thailand's Landmine Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The economic crisis took a
toll on Thailand's plan to clear anti-personnel landmines from its
border with Cambodia as budget allocations were affected, a
military source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money shortage had prompted the country to solicit
financial and technical assistance from international donors, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government and the army expected to remove all mines
from the border within three years and the country is expected to
become a full party to the global ban on anti-personnel landmines
on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities want to see the entire country, including
border areas with Myanmar, Laos and Malaysia, free of mines within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
Almost 800 square kilometers in 18 border provinces in Thailand
are littered with mines. The most dangerous part is the
Thai-Cambodian border, where 205 square kilometers had been mined,
with only 28 square kilometers being cleared due to technical and
budgetary limitations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Thailand and Cambodia signed an agreement to
foster cooperation in mine clearance in the northeastern province
of Si Sa Ket.
</P>
<P>
United Nations experts also vowed to offer aid to the project
and said the world body would be a co-ordinator to seek assistance
from other governments and international organizations.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Warring Sides of Kosovo to Seize Chance of Peacemaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) issued a
statement Tuesday, urging the warring sides of Kosovo to make most
of their extra time to reach a comprehensive agreement when their
talks resume on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) noted that the six-nation Contact Group
on the former Yugoslavia allowed the signing of agreement before
March 15, according to the statement issued by Germany, which is
holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian authority and the ethnic Albanians failed to sign
on any agreement by the deadline on 1400 GMT Tuesday after their
17 days of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides reached agreement on
substantial autonomy for Kosovo and the Contact Group has called
on them to return to the negotiating table in France to discuss
civil and military implementation of self-rule, including the
controversial deployment of NATO troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement appealed to the two sides to abandon all the
actions that might ruin the results of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
It said that the leadership of the two sides will take "
personal responsibility" if an agreement cannot be signed.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Promulgates Ordinance to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam promulgated an ordinance
on Tuesday to boost its tourism industry, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now realizes that tourism must be reorganized as a key
industry that generates employment and heightens the country's
world image, said General Director of Vietnam's National
Administration of Tourism Vo Thi Thang at a press conference in
Hanoi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thang said that Vietnam's tourism grew sharply in the 1990s
with the arrival of non-Vietnamese visitors. But the growth has
proved unsubstainable because of poor service, unfair competition
and administrative red tape that dissuade many first-time visitors
from returning.
</P>
<P>
She said that 1.6 million foreigners visited Vietnam last year,
a drop of 100,000 compared with 1997. However, domestic tourism
numbers continued to rise -- to almost 10 million -- about one
million more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thang said the need to improve tourist facilities is embodied
in the new ordinance governing tourism development.

<HEADLINE> Quebec City Demands Compensation from IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Quebec City has officially
demanded a 12 million Canadian dollars compensation from the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The city of Quebec is demanding that the IOC pay a substantial
compensation taking in account the cost of 12 million Canadian
dollars for its candidacy," the City Hall statement said.
</P>
<P>
Quebec lost its bid for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games to Salt
Lake City in the United States, whose bidding committee lavished
cash, gifts and trips to some IOC members before the vote.
</P>
<P>
The IOC temporarily expelled six members pending final decision
in March but this move was not enough to appease the Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
"Quebec City is appealing to the honour of the IOC and its
members," Mayor Jean-Paul L'Allier said in a letter sent to IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch. "Confidence is no longer there:
we have to reestablish it."
</P>
<P>
The City Hall said the compensation package would be used to
finance a sports foundation for young Quebec athletes.

<HEADLINE> Dengue Fever Kills 2 Die, Infects 129 in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever has claimed two
lives so far this year and 129 others have contracted the disease
in Jakarta, the Jakarta Post Wednesday quoted an official of the
city health agency as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Lindawati, the agency's public relations officer, said people
should be on alert because the number of people being infected
with dengue fever was on the increase.
</P>
<P>
She cited as an example that on February 10 the number of
infected people was 77, but four days later it jumped to 108. On
Tuesday the number reached 129.
</P>
<P>
"We should be careful because there is a possibility that the
number will continue increasing. Based on past experience,
outbreaks always take place in the period between March and
April," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lindawati was confident that the number of people infected with
the disease would not be as big as last year's if people actively
participated in the one-month eradication program which started on
January 28. Activities in the program include keeping houses and
neighborhoods clean.
</P>
<P>
Head of the City Council Commission E for social welfare
Soeparmo urged the health agency to be on high alert against the
possibility of an outbreak next month.
</P>
<P>
Last year's outbreak in Jakarta was said to be one of the most
serious cases in recent history in which 133 deaths and 15,427
sufferers were recorded.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back. The cholera-like disease causes vomiting
and diarrhea.

BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Laotian Prime Minister
Sisavath Keobounphanh will visit Thailand next week to strengthen
bilateral relations, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sisavath will bring a 26-member delegation on his March 4-6
trip, Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Kitti Wasinondh was quoted
Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
During Sisavath's visit, Thailand and Laos will sign three
significant documents, including an agreement on visa exemption
for official passport-holders, an extradition treaty and a treaty
on road transport.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said that topping the agenda would be talks to expedite
efforts to resolve conflicts in border areas, including
demarcation of the land and water boundary and cooperation in drug
suppression.
</P>
<P>
He said officials on both sides would discuss the progress of
the draft framework to improve security cooperation along the
border that the two countries agreed to achieve in 2003. Thailand
has completed the draft and forwarded it to Laos for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said the officials would also discuss the economic
cooperation master plan in four areas, namely electricity,
telecommunications and transport, agriculture, and investment and
were expected to discuss the establishment of special investment
zones in the border area.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Companies Urged to Invest More Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Companies in this national
capital are being asked to make greater investments abroad and to
explore the processing and service sectors this year.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a recent meeting on overseas companies,
Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Mao explained that the global economy has
passed the days when it was dominated by international trade, and
has entered an era dominated by direct corporate investment and
multinational operations.
</P>
<P>
"More investment can be made overseas on the basis of
increasing exports and using more overseas investment," said the
vice-mayor, who also believes that more investment abroad, listed
as a major task for Beijing's foreign trade and economic
cooperation work in 1999, will help avoid trade barriers and
enlarge export volume.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged corporate leaders to contract more foreign
projects, increase labor cooperation, and obtain a greater market
share by improving their services.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 270 companies abroad in some 60
countries and regions involving a total investment of 190 million
U.S. dollars, of which Beijing's companies account for 140 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These companies specialize in areas ranging from resource
exploration, real estate, high-tech industries and international
trade to traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese cuisine
restaurants.

COLOMBO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Parliament had to
be adjourned following a row over the appointment of a new
secretary general Tuesday, according to the Island reports
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
When Speaker K. B. Ratnayake read out the appointment letter of
new Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Kitulgoda from the
president, opposition MP Harin Corea raised a point of order that
there was a stranger in the House.
</P>
<P>
The speaker ruled that there was neither a point of order nor a
stranger in the House.
</P>
<P>
A rumpus then followed between government MPs and opposition
MPs who were shouting at each other.
</P>
<P>
At that stage the speaker declared that the House stood
adjourned. But as the Sergeant at Arms attempted to remove the
Mace there were clashes between a fully represented opposition and
a depleted government ranks.
</P>
<P>
Kitulgoda who earlier functioned as secretary of the Judicial
Services Commission is the fifth secretary general of Parliament
to be appointed since the country gained independence in 1948.

SHANGHAI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, has opened more than 3,200
recreational centers specially for the aged over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
These centers offer many entertainment and sports activities
such as chess games, singing and painting.
</P>
<P>
With over 18 percent of its population -- 2.69 million people --
above the age of 60, Shanghai is the first aging municipality in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal People's Congress has approved a series of
regulations designed to ensure that the elderly enjoy personal
safety, marriage freedom, property guarantees, the right to be
supported by their children, and the right to both use and rent
their houses.
</P>
<P>
Various social departments and institutions have joined in
efforts to provide better services for senior citizens, and
related organizations have issued priority cards enabling people
over the age of 70 to enjoy free or preferential treatment when
traveling by bus, visiting local doctors and shopping.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Shanghai set the goal of establishing at
least one recreational center in each neighborhood, and the

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces to Summon Prabowo For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto said the ABRI headquarters planned to
summon Lt. Gen. (ret) Prabowo Subianto for a clarification of the
meeting on May 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I will call him (Prabowo) immediately to ask for his
clarification of the May 14 meeting to let the public know whether
it had anything to do with the rioting or not", Wiranto told the
House of Representatives Commission I for defense and security on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was necessary to summon Prabowo, former chief of both the
Army's Strategic Reserve Forces (Kostrad) and the Army's Special
Force (Kopassus), because there was an indication that the May 14
meeting was associated with the May 13-15 riots in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A joint fact-finding team was established by the government to
investigate the riots in which 1,200 were killed, many of them
trapped in burning malls. The team has urged the government to
conduct further investigations into the riots, including the May
14 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged that dozens of women were also
sexually violated, but denied the team's conclusion that the riots
were organized.
</P>
<P>
"There is a plan (to summon Prabowo), he is not above the law,"
Wiranto was quoted by national newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged Wiranto to summon Prabowo as soon as
possible. Legislators said the public were confused over
allegations that Prabowo was closely linked with the May riots,
despite the denials he sent through friends from Jordan, where he
is now staying.
</P>
<P>
Gozali Abbas of the United Development Party raised questions
about Prabowo's whereabouts. "We do not know whether he has
escaped Indonesia. Many newspapers have reported he is in Germany
and many others reported he is in Jordan. Why does he stay
overseas while facing many problems at home?"

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Kosovo Agreement "Significant Step Forward" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
called on Tuesday the partial peace agreement reached on Kosovo "a
significant step forward" in the search for peace in Kosovo and
urged the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to sign a full peace deal
next month.
</P>
<P>
"The peace talks ... are a significant step forward in the
search for a fair and lasting peace in Kosovo," Clinton said in a
statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
His statement came after the Contact Group, composed of Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, announced
that an agreement had been reached on substantial autonomy for
Kosovo and a conference on implementing the accord would be held
in France beginning on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians said they wanted two weeks to consult with
their people and their fighters in the hills while the Serbs said
they accepted the idea of autonomy but ruled out the possibility
of full independence for Kosovo. They gave no sign of accepting
NATO troops on their territory for the implementation of a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Neither side signed the accord and they are expected to resume
negotiations on March 15 to discuss the critical issue of
political and military implementation of self-rule.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the Kosovar Albanian people will strongly
support what their negotiators have done, because the agreement
represents the opportunity for a better life after years of
repression and fear," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs should be prepared to return to the negotiations on
March 15 with a commitment to sign the full agreement, "Clinton
said, noting NATO remained poised to use military force if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
partial peace agreement was a step in the right direction even if
it failed to resolve key issues.
</P>
<P>
"What we're after is peace and stability in that region," he
said, "And we think that what they've agreed to today takes a step
in the right direction."

<HEADLINE> Former Tibetan Serfs Now Live Good Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- "We are now living in a paradise
compared with our wretched life when we were serfs," said Lhaba
Logyai of southwestern China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Lhaba Logyai, together with four family members, were serfs
before that system was abolished in 1959. In the past, they worked
at hard labor every day, and more than 60 serfs lived in a
courtyard of only 150 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The farm where Lhaba once worked had over 3,000 serfs, most of
them serfs since they were not able to pay rent. They worked hard
everyday on an empty stomach, having nothing at all of their own
at that time.
</P>
<P>
However, now they all are living a happy life. Lhaba Logyai
and his family have about 1.8 hectares of farmland, six cows, one
horse, one mule, nine sheep, a color TV, a sewing machine and two
bicycles. Their yield of grains and oil products last year was 9,
500 kilograms, and their stored grains exceeded 10,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The life of women in old Tibet was extremely hard. They had no
human rights, and their social status was the lowest among the
serfs. They were treated only as a kind of machine that could
speak.
</P>
<P>
"My aunt used to weave carpets on the farm, and she lost her
eyesight because of overwork. The owner promised to pay for all
her labor when he ordered her back home, but it never came true,"
recalled Lhaba Logyai.
</P>
<P>
"It was the democratic reform in the Tibet Autonomous Region in
1959 that turned women from wretched creatures that anyone could
bully as they liked into masters of their own fate," said Yexe
Yangzom, a Tibetan deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Yexe, who used to be a serf, went to the Beijing-based Capital
Medical Sciences University in 1965, as part of the first
generation of Tibetan women to become college students. She is now
a doctor at the Tibetan People's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"It is our motherland and the abolition of the serf system in
Tibet that brought us a new, happy life," Yexe said.
</P>
<P>
Things are totally different from the way they were before 1959.
Women in Tibet nowadays have not only basic human rights, but also
rights regarding political affairs, just as men do.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of all Tibetan women will take part in the
election for deputies to the local people's congress, and the
proportion of female officials throughout the autonomous region
has been on the rise for 40 consecutive years. At the end of Last
year women accounted for nearly 11 percent of all government
officials in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> 9 Killed in Philippine Army, Rebels Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
troops cracked down hard on the New People's Army (NPA) rebels
this week, killing nine of them and wounding seven others in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, the Philippine Star newspaper
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The encounters occurred in two Mindanao provinces as the Armed
Forces of the Philippines declared an "all-out offensive" against
the NPA rebels nationwide, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Military officers were quoted as saying that the army soldiers
stumbled on a group of 10 rebels in Alegria in the province of
Surigao del Norte, touching off a brief fire fight in which nine
of the rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were on their way to conduct "teach-in" lectures and
collect taxes from Alegria residents when they clashed with the
soldiers, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A similar encounter in Godod town in the province of Zamboanga
del Norte between army soldiers and NPA guerrillas left seven
rebels wounded, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces have recently intensified its search for the
NPA rebels responsible for last week's abduction of an army
general and his aide, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The military's all-out campaign against NPA rebels aims to
"avert the rash of abductions and other terroristic activities,"
the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur, EU Seek Closer Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 23 (Xinhua)-- Participants from the
first business forum from Latin America's Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) and the European Union (EU) Tuesday agreed to establish
a closer commercial union and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the move for the creation of a trans-
Atlantic free trade bloc was the main achievement of a EU-Mercosur
Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
At the Mercosur-EU forum, some 200 South American and European
businessmen, as well as Brazilian Ministers from the economic
sectors were present.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, while
the EU is made up by 15 European countries, which include, among
others, Germany, Britain, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, some delegates said that the two blocks
should join in a gigantic trans-Atlantic free zone.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the super-bloc are to begin in June, during a
Latin American and EU summit in Rio, officials from both blocs
said.
</P>
<P>
The union would be the world's biggest free trade area, larger
than the U.S.-proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
Its total gross national product would be nine trillion U.S.
dollars, of which about 1.2 trillion dollars would come from
Mercosur. And its population would be 580 million, higher than
the roughly 400 million of the North America Free Trade Area (
NAFTA), made up of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Mercosur and the EU stressed that the new
bloc would not interfere with ongoing talks for the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
The FTAA project has stalled since the U.S. Congress denied
President Bill Clinton's fast-track authority to negotiate with
Latin American countries. Meantime, Mercosur has grown bigger,
incorporating Chile and Bolivia as associate members.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tennis
Federation (Pelti) has assured the world's tennis governing body
ITF that security will be of priority when it plays the
Philippines in the Davis Cup, and insists the matches be played in
Jakarta as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see to it that the safety of players will be guaranteed
right away from their arrival at the airport until the completion
of the games. That's why we have appealed to the ITF to give us
the go-ahead," Pelti vice-general secretary Benny Mailili said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had sent the letter a week before in response to the
ITF recommendation over the venue change, following a request from
the Philippines, who feared the security threat in Indonesia,
Benny was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possible uncompromising attitude from their
opponents, Benny said that they would leave the matter to the ITF
to decide.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the Philippines will meet in the second round
stage of the Davis Cup Group Two of the Asia-Oceania zone on April
2-4 after beating their respective opponents.
</P>
<P>
The matches will be played on a rebound ace court, which Benny
said would benefit the hosting team because, "the Philippines
doesn't have such courts. Playing on a rebound ace is not as easy
as on other courts."

BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar will
declare war on amphetamines during Myanmar Prime Minister Than
Shwe's visit to Thailand from March 8 to 9, according to a senior
Thai Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is expected to urge Gen Than
Shwe to agree on a concrete timeframe for beating the production
and trafficking of the deadly stimulant, the official was quoted
Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Military and drug enforcement agencies of the two countries

</P>
<P>
Gen Than Shwe is due to have talks with Chuan Leekpai on March
9, after touring a royal crop substitution project in northern
Thailand on the first day of his visit.
</P>
<P>
Chuan Leekpai will urge cooperation on the grounds that
amphetamines are endangering Thai school-children as well as
adults, the official said. Chuan Leekpai is deeply concerned as
some 30 million amphetamines tablets seized last year were
considered only the tip of iceberg, the official added.

The two leaders will also discuss border development and
economic and agricultural cooperation, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Upgrade Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans an extensive
upgrading of air traffic control systems to reduce traffic hazards
and accidents, says a senior civil aviation official.
</P>
<P>
Aviation authorities will build 10 major traffic management
centers from the current 37 small centers, Chen Xuhua, director of
the Air Traffic Management Bureau of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), was quoted by today's China Daily
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The expansion, which is forecast to be completed by 2010, will
entail an estimated investment of 10 billion yuan, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Three centers -- in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou -- are
under way now. The fourth will be in Wuhan, capital city of
central China's Hubei Province. Locations of the other six centers
have not yet been decided.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, 2 billion yuan and 158 million US dollars worth of
loans from the Japanese Government have been invested in projects
relating to communications, navigation systems, radar control
systems, meteorology and flight information, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increased investment in safety projects, Chinese
airlines did not have a single accident because of control factors
in the 1.5 million flights completed last year, Chen revealed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to improvement in infrastructure, CAAC and the
bureau have tried hard to enhance the quality of air traffic
management personnel.
</P>
<P>
As well, the air space and air routes situations have improved,
Chen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- British American Racing (BAR)
team took a calculated gamble with their revised livery for the
1999 Grand Prix season with new design for both cars which carry
advertising for two different brands of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
It was unveiled before a final pre-season test at Silverstone
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"While this design is obviously not our first choice, we
believe it provides value for our sponsors and maintains the first-
class image of the team," said managing director Craig Pollock.
</P>
<P>
BAR originally wanted their cars to run in colours promoting
different cigarette brands of owners British American Tobacco, who
are reportedly pumping 250 million pounds into the team over five
years.
</P>
<P>
But the sport's governing body, the FIA, blocked the plan and
the team recently lost an appeal to the International Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
BAR officials have been ordered to appear before the World
Motor Sport Council on March 12 - five days after drivers Jacques
Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta line up on the grid for the
Australian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
FIA president Max Mosley has accused the team of "putting two
fingers up to the rest of the sport" and they could face a race
ban if found guilty of bringing the sport into disrepute.

HAVANA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's petroleum production

Cuban petroleum is used in sectors such as the cement industry
due to its high content of sulfur.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal edged Sheffield United
2-1 in their unprecedented F.A. Cup replay on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The score was identical to the first game which ended in uproar
after Marc Overmars scored the 76th minute winner from a Nwankwo
Kanu cross on February 13. The Nigerian collected a ball from an
Arsenal throw that United had been expecting to be given because
they had put it out of play to allow an injured player to receive
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The United players and officials were incensed and Wenger
immediately offered to replay the fixture and the English F.A.
quickly agreed.
</P>
<P>
FIFA originally backed that decision as a fine example of fair
play but then decided to investigate further and only gave the go-
ahead late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Overmars, seizing a Stephen Hughes pass in the 15th minute on
Tuesday, scored the first goal for the winners.
</P>
<P>
Compatriot Dennis Bergkamp had the home fans purring with a
goal of sublime quality 20 minutes later that seemed to wrap up
the game for the premier league side.
</P>
<P>
Overmars, booed at ever touch by the visiting fans, started the
move with a 50-meter crossfield pass to Ray Parlour.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder cut the ball back to Bergkamp who, with back to
goal, chipped the ball perfectly over Alan Kelly and into the net.
</P>
<P>
In the closing minute, Lee Morris shot a consolation goal for
the first division team United.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield United could have taken the lead in the 11th minute
when striker Marcelo shot over the bar with just David Seaman to
beat but were generally outclassed by an Arsenal side right at the
top of their form.
</P>
<P>
Kanu came on as a 70th minute substitute but this time, no
doubt much to his relief, stayed clear of controversy.
</P>
<P>
The cup holders will meet Huddersfield Town or Derby County in
the quarter-finals on March 6.

<P>
TIRANA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government Tuesday
welcomed the partial agreement between the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians over Kosovo as an important step towards a peaceful
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian government considers the talks at Rambouillet
only as the first stage of an agreement," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It appreciated efforts made by the international community,
especially the Contact Group, for its active contributions to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government also said it expected NATO and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to make
more effort to help implement the accord.
</P>
<P>
The political accord agreed in Rambouillet will be implemented
only with the enforcement of the military and political
instruments of NATO and OSCE, it said.
</P>
<P>
Mediators said after 17 days of talks at Rambouillet, France
that an agreement had been reached on substantial autonomy for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Serbs nor the ethnic Albanians have signed an
accord, and another round of peace talks are scheduled for March
15 in France.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday with Albanian television, Albanian
Foreign Minister Paskal Milo said that the agreement might not
have been the best for the ethnic Albanians, but was the most
practical and most objective under the circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield, Lewis in Verbal War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Lennox Lewis of Britain and
Evander Holyfield of the United States, two world heavyweight
boxing champions, are fighting by mouth after they meet in the
bout of the undisputed bout on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Holyfield did not practice what he preaches. "He
says he's religious, but he's a hypocrite," Lewis said of the man
he hopes to beat in the eye-popped fight in an already sold-out
Madison Square Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
Lewis was referring to Holyfield's public admission last
October that he has fathered five children out of wedlock with
four women and that he provides financially for them. Holyfield
also has three children with his first wife and one with his
second.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," Holyfield said Tuesday from Houston. "
What he saying is I made some mistakes. If I can be heavyweight
champion of the world and make mistakes, why can't I be a man of
God and make mistakes?
</P>
<P>
"What he's trying to do is psyche himself up," Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Lewis has been regarded as a boxer weaker than
Holyfield and Mike Tyson, especially from the U.S. media and
American fans.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to be the definitive fight for Lennox
Lewis," Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
But Holyfield also claimed: "This has to be my biggest fight
because it's an upcoming fight. It's coming to a point where I'm
about finished."

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Defend Himself at Hearing Without Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson has to defend
himself at a closed-door hearing at the Montgomery County jail
Wednesday without his lawyers or any handlers against allegations
he threw a television set last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The former heavyweight champion became angry and hurled a TV
set when a guard hung up a telephone he was using.
</P>
<P>
Tyson lawyer Paul Kemp said the boxer had become depressed, in
part because a psychiatrist hired by the jail had taken him off an
antidepressant drug that he had been taking for four months.
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials have allowed Tyson to pick up the
medication after the accident.
</P>
<P>
Eric Seleznow, a spokesman for the Montgomery County Correction
Center, said Tyson has no right to use a lawyer during the hearing
before a member of the jail's treatment staff and a guard
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good for Mike," said a Tyson adviser. "Mike's
never good in these situations. He can't defend himself well."
</P>
<P>
Kemp said he met Tyson on Tuesday and gave him advice on how to
respond to the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Tyson faces accusations of disorderly conduct, destroying
property and assaulting a correctional officer who was allegedly
struck with shards of plastic from the television.
</P>
<P>
He could lose some privileges, such as visitation rights and
telephone calls, and any good time served could be discounted.
</P>
<P>
"It's a routine hearing. We have 15 to 20 of them a week,"
Seleznow said. He said he has received up to 200 calls a day from
news organizations around the world about Tyson.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Anti-Pirate Campaign in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. giant Microsoft launched a
campaign in Bulgaria on Tuesday to crack down on pirated software
by offering a reduction of 60 percent on its latest products by
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
Bo Cruise, Microsoft's Balkan director, said this applies to
Microsoft Office '97 (Standard, Professional), Microsoft Windows '
98, Microsoft NT Server 4.0, Microsoft NT Workstation 4.0 and MS-
DOS 6.22. He called for all computer users in Bulgaria to ensure
that their software is not pirate by the end of May, or face legal
action.
</P>
<P>
Each buyer of any of the listed products is entitled to use any
of the earlier versions, Cruise said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cruise, over 90 percent of software in Bulgaria is
pirated.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last train, get on it. There will not be another
train after May 31," said Velizar Sokolov, Bulgarian
representative of the Business Software Publishers Association
which groups software producers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Starting from June, the association, the National Service for
Organized Crime Control, the police, prosecutors and courts will
crack down on users and distributors of pirated software.
Violators of the Copyright Law are liable to fines, confiscation
and up to five years' imprisonment, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen criminal proceedings have been instituted against
software pirates and more than 3,000 CD-ROMs have been seized
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Business Software Publishers Association will inform over 3,
000 Bulgarian companies and the general public of software piracy
and Microsoft's campaign.

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Look to Spend Their Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Beijing intend to
spend a good part of their savings buying property, cars and
durable goods, and on travel this year, indicated a recent survey,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The reason motivating this slowdown of Beijingers' money-saving
habit has to do with the three consecutive cuts in banks' interest
rates last year, the survey conducted by the Beijing-based China
Mainland Market Research Company revealed.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 70 percent of the respondents plan to
draw money from banks this year and put it into housing, cars,
large consumer goods such as air-conditioners and refrigerators,
and travel.
</P>
<P>
If these people stick to their plans, there will be a 25-plus
percent increase in consumer spending this year over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Except for daily consumer goods, housing tops the purchasing
list of most respondents. The level of respondents showing
interest in buying apartments jumped from last year's 6.17 percent
to this year's 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Housing has long been viewed as a potential new engine of
economic growth in Beijing, a city where houses are among the most
expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, there are indeed people, and quite a few of them, who
have their eyes on investments of one kind or another.
</P>
<P>
As indicated by the survey, nearly 62 percent of the
respondents will invest their bank deposits in their children's
education as well as buying bonds and securities. Some even intend
to start up their own companies with the money they saved.
</P>
<P>
"Beijingers today have a strong sense of consumption and
investment. Instead of the old mentality of depositing money for
interest, they have veered gradually to a more active way of
investment and spending," the paper quoted Zhou Jiang, general
manager of the research company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks cut interest rates three times last year in an
effort to stimulate consumer spending and expand domestic demand.
The three cuts averaged about 1.89 percentage points for deposits
compared with the rates at the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Danish Government Proposes Military Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government on
Tuesday outlined plans for drastic cuts in military spending,
which will see the number of armed forces personnel slashed by
more than 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Military spending will be reduced by 3.6 billion Danish crowns
(554 million U.S. dollars) over the next four years according to
the plan. Denmark's current military expenditure stands at 20
billion crowns (3.1 billion dollars) annually, about three percent
of the government's financial budget.
</P>
<P>
The number of troops will be cut by 6,000 to 29,000 while
weapons procurement will also face heavy reductions.
</P>
<P>
The plan immediately encountered strong objections from the
biggest opposition party, the Liberal Party, which claims that the
plan betrays commitments to NATO, of which Denmark is a member.

<HEADLINE> Eight Confirmed Dead in Avalanches in Western Austria </HEADLINE>

VIENNA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people have been
confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared
through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on
Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 people went missing while rescuers are continuing the
searching work.
</P>
<P>
Both avalanches rushed down the Alps to the Galtuer resort
nestling in the Paznauntal valley after 4 pm (1500GMT). The snow
wall, 5 meters high and 800 meters long, tore through ten houses
and buried 50 people.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross sources said 30 people have been dug out with injures
in various conditions.
</P>
<P>
A state spokesman said the heavy snow blocking the mountain
roads makes it hard to get the nearly 10,000 besieged skiers out
of the valley in a short time.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Rebound Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)'s seven
crudes went up slightly last week, the Vienna-based Secretariat
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The average price was up to 9.73 U.S. dollars per barrel from
9.66 U.S. dollars in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
In January, the average price of crude oil was 10.74 dollars
per barrel. However, the average price dropped to less than 10
dollars in February, far lower than OPEC's benchmark price of 21
dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil market analysts said here that the slide is due to the
oversupply in the world market. To make up the loss caused by
price slide, some oil producing countries have been producing and
selling more oil, which has in turn deteriorated the situation.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote Personality Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Schools are being urged to
help students develop better personalities and not just improve
their academic performance, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper quotes Lu Tongzhou, an
official from the Ministry of Education as saying that some
teachers tend to "teach students a lesson" with physical
punishment or sarcastic words when they are found to be backward
in study or school activities.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Education officials are calling for an end to this
and other similar punishment and scolding, which are not uncommon
in today's schools.
</P>
<P>
The undesirable actions of these teachers will entail intensive
psychological education among both teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
Lu said few students are in need of medical treatment. A proper
exchange resulting in a meeting of the minds with their teachers
might be enough to mend the personality upsets.
</P>
<P>
Many children are easily hurt by a single word of criticism,
because they are spoiled by their parents. Some children from
single-parent families are pessimistic because of the lack of
parental love and concern.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of primary and middle school students feel anxious
and uneasy whenever they face examinations, a survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The anxiety is often caused by the teaching methods which focus
too much on high academic scores.
</P>
<P>
College students, who are also asked to pursue high scores, are
increasingly interested in moral and psychological education
programs, according to the National Psychological Counseling
Committee for College Students, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Triumphs at London Indoor Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov continued
his march towards the world number one spot - but not without a
few nervous moments in the London Indoor men's tennis tournament
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian cruised through the opening set of his first-round
encounter with Magnus Gustaffson, hardly breaking sweat as he took
it 6-2 in just 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the Swede came roaring back in the second set, breaking for
a 4-3 lead and then saving three break points in the next game to
consolidate his advantage before levelling the match 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov then had to save break point in the first game of
the decider before finally getting on top, running out a 6-2, 3-6,
6-3 winner in one hour 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Russian will now face Zimbabwe's Byron Black in
the second round knowing he is just three wins away from a place
in Sunday's final and taking over at the top of the rankings from
Pete Sampras, making him only the 15th world number one since the
rankings began in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Petr Korda had earlier marked his return to form with a 6-3, 6-
4 victory over South Africa's Wayne Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
The victory was a welcome boost for the Czech, who has endured
a miserable run since Wimbledon last year when he tested positive
for a banned substance and was subsequently stripped of his prize
money and ranking points.
</P>
<P>
The International Tennis Federation are currently appealing
against the leniency of their own appeals committee which decided
not to ban Korda due to "exceptional circumstances", with a ruling
expected by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
"The last eight months has been an unpleasant situation but I
think it's okay now, I'm just going to concentrate on what I do
best," said Korda, who has plummeted from second in the world at
the start of last year to 75th.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tremendous shock to my tennis. I was always a
fighter on court and suddenly I didn't have the weapons to fight
with."
</P>
<P>
Korda was joined in the second round by Thomas Johansson, Byron
Black, Guillaume Raoux, Dominik Hrbaty and Nicolas Kiefer.

According to the national Rompres news agency, the "Aconcagua"
expedition is Romania's first major attempt of the kind.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Private Sector to Offer Unemployment Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- All urban employees in the
private sector in east China's Zhejiang Province will have
unemployment insurance by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The private sector currently accounts for 66 percent of the
local gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of goods and
services produced.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a major effort to establish a unified
social security system, according to one provincial government
official.
</P>
<P>
Some one million Zhejiang residents currently work for private
businesses, with more redundant workers expected to enter the
sector along with the expanded reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Regulations on Unemployment Insurance for Workers, adopted
by the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee in 1995,
require coverage for all individuals employed by private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 employees in the sector currently account for
10 percent of the total number of insured workers in the province.
</P>
<P>
Some 13,400 people who lost their jobs in the private sector
last year have received compensation payments totaling four
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Insurance Sector Open for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Automobile insurance accounts
for 90 percent of the total volume for Tibet's fledgling insurance
sector, with state-owned hotels, stores and factories accounting
for the remainder.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a recent interview with Xinhua News Agency, Sun
Guoxin, deputy general manager of the Tibet Branch of People's
Insurance (Property) Company of China Ltd.(PICC), said his company
is the only insurance agency active in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the high compensation rate in Tibet has prevented the
entry of more insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
PICC's 1997 premium income hit 45 million yuan, with the
average compensation ratio standing at 70 percent, according to
Sun.
</P>
<P>
The branch, which has 80-odd employees, has actively
experimented with various forms of insurance for private
individuals, as well as coverage for the agricultural and animal
husbandry sectors. However, the high compensation rate led to the
failure of insurance coverage for farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Policyholders in Tibet pay 20 percent less for coverage than
their counterparts in other parts of China, with the differential
covered by central government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that the survival of his branch depends heavily on
financial support from the central government, but he nonetheless
expressed confidence in the vast development potential for the
region's insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Most areas in Tibet, a region which covers 1.2 million sq.km.
and has a population of 2.4 million, remain open for insurance
development, according to Sun.

exemption should they win the 2006 World Cup.

to say yes to losing tax income," said Lafontaine.

Legend Franz Beckenbauer, who heads the German bidding
committee, said: "Now we have fullfilled FIFA's basic requirements.
If we hadn't been granted it (the tax exemption) we could have
immediately buried our bid."

United have denied the claim but Rivaldo's agent Josep Maria

If United do want the player, they would have to fork out an

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
U.N. Security Council for the month of February, Robert Fowler of
Canada, said Tuesday that the Security Council considers that
"much more remains to be done to make peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina
self-sustaining."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, Fowler said, "Members of
the Council, while noting substantial progress in the last months,
considered that much more remained to be done to make peace in
Bosnia-Herzegovina self-sustaining."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "underlined that the authorities in Bosnia
and Herzegovina have to assume greater responsibilities for the
functions now undertaken or coordinated by the international
community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council welcomed the conclusions of the Peace
Implementation Council meeting held in Madrid, Spain, on December
15-16, 1998, said the statement. The Madrid conference has set a
time framework for the peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Council expressed concern that, despite
achievements in the field of minority, significant breakthroughs
are still needed," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They also expressed concern at the continuing difficulties to
form a government in Republika Srpska, which should be settled in
accordance with the Republic Srpska constitution and the Peace
Agreement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council was briefed by
Carlos Westendorp, high representative for implementation of the
Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp, speaking to reporters after his briefing, said that
there are "positive movements" in bringing peace to Bosnia, "but
many things remain to be done."
</P>
<P>
He said he learned with relief that the peace process in
Kosovo, a Serbian province, "is promising," referring to the
reports that warring parties have reached a partial agreement on
substantial autonomy in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the province's population of 2 million.

Otherwise, it will have a negative impact on the peace process
in Bosnia, he said.

But they stopped short there as the ethnic Albanians agreed
only conditionally, saying they wanted two weeks to consult with
their people and their fighters in the hills.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs said they accepted the idea of autonomy but ruled
out the possibility of full independence for Kosovo and gave no
sign of abandoning their refusal to allow NATO troops on their
territory for the implementation of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Neither signed the accord and they are expected to resume
negotiations on March 15 to discuss the critical issues of
political and military implementation of self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart suggested the agreement, while far from the overall
settlement the West sought, represented progress because the
Kosovar Albanians had embraced a document that did not
specifically call for a referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that they will come back in two weeks, having
consulted, ready to sign onto this document which will put
significant pressure on the Serbian side," Lockhart said. "And
it's our hope that in the ensuing weeks, the Serbian side will
understand the pressure they face."
</P>
<P>
This morning President Bill Clinton said the Serbs still faced
the possibility of air strikes. "Whether NATO bombs or not... that
depends upon the actions of the Serbs," Clinton told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important that the Serbs exercise
restraint on the ground and that the Kosovars respond in kind,"
he added. "They have made a lot of progress and they don't need
to let this thing get away from them."

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Rejects Idea of NATO-Russia Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic said Tuesday evening in Paris that Serbia opposes the
idea of a NATO-Russia combined peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We expelled them (Russians) in 1948. Why should we have them
back?" said Milutinovic at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the break-up of military alliance between
Moscow and Belgrade in 1948.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Tuesday evening
that a NATO-Russia combination of peacekeeping force could be
acceptable to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also accused certain Western countries in the
Contact Group, especially the United States, of "playing game"
during the 17 days of talks in Rambouillet by protecting the
Kosovo Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
"There had been great exterior pressure during the talks
against the Serb delegation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said that the Serb side has made great efforts to
help the talks in Rambouillet to achieve something, although it
had been denied direct talks with the Kosovo Albanian delegates.
</P>
<P>
He said that 18 hours from the ending of the talks, the Serb
delegation was presented with an 81-page document for signing, 56
pages of which had not been discussed in the 17 days of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Serb and Kosovo Albanian delegations accepted Tuesday the
principle of a plan to establish substantial autonomy in Kosovo
which was drafted by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to attend another conference to be
started on March 15 in an unspecified site in France.

<HEADLINE> Italy Satisfied With Results of Kosovo Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini on Tuesday evening voiced satisfaction with results of the
Kosovo talks which ended at the French town of Rambouillet Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who was present at Tuesday's meeting at Rambouillet, said
to reporters that the results with a partial accord and hope of a
final deal when negotiations resume in mid-March had "paved the
way for a solution to the Kosovo crisis."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the talks outcome had been a victory for the
European Union's insistence on negotiations rather than threats,
Dini said that "the partial deal between Kosovo ethnic Albanians
and Yugoslavia was a victory for all."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the more energetic approach of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had been "defeated".
</P>
<P>
"The main goal was to prevent the expansion of the conflict and
in particular military action. That objective has been reached,
and that danger has been averted. That is why we are satisfied,"
Dini said.
</P>
<P>
As the six-nation Contact Group's member, Dini also voiced
satisfaction with the "considerable progress that has been made
towards defining the state of autonomy of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He said that the important thing is to avoid provocative action
by either side before the new talks started.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises In February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the
United States scored a solid gain in February, with confidence
about current economic conditions reaching an all-time high, the
Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a report
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index rose 3.2 points in February,
closing at 132.1 and the Present Situation Index climbed from
172.9 in January to a record 178.4 in February, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It was the highest number since the Conference Board began its
consumer confidence survey 32 years ago. The Expectations Index
advanced from 99.6 to 101.2 in February," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers were even more upbeat in February than the month
before," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the board's
Consumer Research Center. "President Clinton's personal problems
and the impeachment trial have had little or no impact on consumer
attitudes. Consumers continue to be most concerned about their
jobs, their salaries and the overall health of the economy."
</P>
<P>
The report said consumers reporting that jobs are "hard to get"
fell to an all-time low of 11.7 percent and consumers labeling
current business conditions as "good" rose to 43.1 percent in
February, up from 39.8 percent in January. Households rating
conditions as "bad" fell to 8.3 percent, down from 9.4 percent in
February and households claiming that jobs are "plentiful"
increased to 48.2 percent in February, up from 46.6 percent in
January.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of consumers expecting business conditions to
get better over the next six months held steady at 15.4 percent,
the report said, adding that the employment outlook rose slightly,
with nearly 14 percent expecting jobs to become more plentiful
between now and this summer, up slightly from January.
</P>
<P>
Some 25.7 percent of consumers expect their incomes to rise in
the coming months, up from 23.9 percent in January, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Comments on Economic Problems in Brazil, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday the risk of Brazil's
financial crisis spreading to the rest of the world may have been
reduced, but said Russia's economic outlook was still troubling.
</P>
<P>
Making comments dealing with the prospects for hard-hit
emerging markets, however, Greenspan told the Senate Banking
Committee that it would not be easy for Brazil to win back
investor confidence after its currency crashed last year.
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian authorities must walk a very narrow, difficult path
of restoring confidence and keeping inflation contained with
monetary policy while dealing with serious fiscal imbalances,"
Greenspan said in his twice-a-year testimony to Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Although the situation in Brazil remains uncertain, there has
been limited contagion to other countries thus far. With the net
exposure smaller, and increasingly held by those who both
recognized the heightened risk and were willing to bear it, some
of the elements that might have contributed to further contagion
may have been significantly reduced," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is struggling to cope with the devaluation of the
currency, the real, and the need to cut spending to bring its
budget deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
Problems in the world's eighth largest economy have heightening
fears that the crisis could spread to the United States and other
industrial nations, although Greenspan said the U.S. economy was
performing admirably.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's economic problems, he said these
problems, centering on the collapse of the currency and a partial
debt default, had been a major contributor to the problems in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He said that by late in the year Russia's "inflation had moved
up to a triple-digit annual rate. Russia's stabilization program
with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has been on hold since
the financial crisis hit, and the economic outlook there remains
troubling."
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and Russia received billions of dollars from the
IMF last year, the latest in a chain of five massive international
rescue deals which started in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the economic situation in Asia was starting to
improve. "Early signs of stabilization and economic recovery" had
appeared in the Asian countries, particularly in Thailand and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said, "As investor confidence has returned, exchange rates
have risen and interest rates have fallen. With persistence and
follow-through on reforms, the future of those economies has
promise."

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. white supremacist
was convicted of capital murder Tuesday for chaining a black man
to a pickup truck and dragging him to his death in one of the
nation's grisliest hate crimes since the civil rights battles.
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated less than two hours before returning their
verdict against John William King, who now faces either life in
prison or execution. The panel of 11 whites and one black began
the separate punishment phase Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
King, a 24-year-old laborer, was the first of three white men
to be tried in the June 7 slaying. The body of the 49-year-old
James Byrd was torn in two -- a head and right arm severed from
his torso _ when he was pulled nearly five kilometers while tied
by his ankles with a 8-meter logging chain.
</P>
<P>
The murder thrust Jasper into a national spotlight as members
of the Ku Klux Klan and New Black Panthers descended on the timber
town of 8,000 people about 160 kilometers northeast of Houston
in Texas State.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Demands Proof on Genocide Suspect Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa urged the
Rwandan ambassador to South Africa Tuesday to give proof for his
claim that Rwandan genocide suspects were using South Africa as a
base for drug and gun- running.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was committed to addressing Rwanda's concerns, but
the police service could not probe untested claims by Rwandan
ambassador Ben Karenzi if he did not provide evidence, Foreign
Affairs Department spokesman Marco Boni said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi said dozens of Rwandan genocide suspects were involved
in drug and gun smuggling in South Africa, and the government
seemed to have done little to change it.
</P>
<P>
He said the proceeds of the criminal operations, which ran into
millions of U.S. Dollars, were used to arm former Rwandan soldiers
fighting for President of the Democratic Republic of Congo Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more genocide suspects were part of South Africa's
illegal alien population, and became "refugees posing as a
victims", Karenzi claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government should set up a framework
with Rwanda to deal with the problem, within which all available
evidence would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi said he had met officials of the South African Foreign
Affairs and Justice Departments, and believed there was a
political will to apprehend the culprits. "But that was not
enough," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a report that the Rwandan government would ask
South Africa to sift through its list of refugees to identify
fugitives and discuss their extradition, South African Home
Affairs spokesman Hennie Meyer said no such request had yet been
received.
</P>
<P>
He said in terms of international conventions, someone who had
acquired refugee status in a country could be delivered to an
international tribunal if he was suspected of having committed
gross human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September last year, there were 505 Rwandan
refugees in South Africa, Meyer said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Central Bank Protects Population's Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank (BNR)
said on Tuesday that it had decided on the measures necessary to
provide continuity in payment operations and to protect the
population's deposits with the Bank for Foreign Trade Bancorex.
</P>
<P>
The BNR made the move after the president of state-owned bank
Bancorex, Vlad Soare, together with other bank board members,
unexpectedly resigned on Monday over alleged differences with
international lenders over the bank's restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
The resignation caused strong repercussions among the
depositors who ran on the bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said, Vlad Soare, who took over as Bancorex chief
in March 1998, made his decision after a spate of statements by
Emanuel Zervoudakis, the International Monetary Fund(IMF)'s chief
negotiator for Romania, currently on a visit to Bucharest to
discuss resuming of loan tranches with the Romanian Government.
</P>
<P>
According to the BNR, the "rapid restructuring of Bancorex,
whose final goal is the bank's privatization by the end of this
year, is the primary objective of the Government."
</P>
<P>
The BNR announced that in the coming days Bancorex high
executives would be appointed, in conformity with the legislation
in force.
</P>
<P>
The bank is the country's third largest bank. It specializes in
foreign trade financing and holds 25 percent of the Romanian
banking market.

LONDON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets
continued to rally Tuesday despite fears that U.S. interest rates
might have to rise to cool the booming U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by handsome earnings from three blue-chip companies,
London's FTSE withstood some brief backpedaling caused by Alan
Greenspan's comments on U.S. stock valuations, to power to its
highest close since July 20.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed up 85.3 points at 6,155.2. Dealers said
Wall Street's resilience also supported activity, although it
failed to break its record high of 6,195.6, set on 8 January.
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction to the government's euro changeover
plan. Prime Minister Tony Blair reiterated its commitment to
joining the single currency on the same day.
</P>
<P>
German stocks surged above the 5,000 level on optimism over the
performance of the corporate sector and hopes that inflation could
be contained in the U.S. The Xetra Dax ended up 124.9 points at
5,012.6.
</P>
<P>
French stocks also made strong gains, although not as
impressive as London and Frankfurt. The Cac 40 index closed up 43
points at 4,207.

<HEADLINE> Power Struggle Turns White-Hot in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Power struggle between Iran's
moderate and conservative factions turns white-hot over the
disputes over the qualifications of candidates for the elections
of local councils slated for next Friday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the conservative-dominated election supervisory board
Ali Mowahedi Savoji on Tuesday night threatened to cancel the
election in Tehran if the pro-moderate Interior Ministry does not
take measure to remove 12 disqualified candidates from the list.
</P>
<P>
The five-member board last week informed the Interior Ministry,
which is responsible for holding elections, that it had rejected
12 prominent moderate candidates, including former Interior
Minister Abdollah Nouri who was sacked by the conservative Majlis
(parliament) in June.
</P>
<P>
However, two members of the board soon announced that the
board had never approved such a decision of disqualifying
candidates. Meanwhile, Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh
also said the board announcement, with only two signatures, was
illegitimate according to relevant law.
</P>
<P>
An arbitration committee appointed jointly by reformist
President Mohammad Khatami and conservative Majlis Speaker Nateq
Nouri rejected Sunday night the decision of the supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
However, Savoji said that the stipulation by the arbitration
committee has nothing to do the decisions of the supervisory
board.
</P>
<P>
The decisions of the board in the qualifications or
disqualifications of the candidates are final and enforceable and
no one has the authority or power to reject them, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the arbitration committee has no power to
scrutinize and assess the qualifications of applying candidates,
it can only interpret and oversee the laws regulating elections.
</P>
<P>
The supervisory board earlier disqualified some 200 candidates
from the moderate factions, a move which disappointed the Iranian
nation, particularly the young generation, who pin hopes on the
moderates for a better future for the country.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the deadlocked dispute, President Khatami
and Majlis Speaker Nouri reached an agreement to set up a
five-member arbitration committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Tajzadeh, 297,500 candidates have been qualified
to run for the elections for city and village councils which will
elect city mayors and village chiefs, the first time since the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The conservative supervisory board's move was seen as an
attempt to dishearten the reformists, who were expected to win the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Though the local councils have only limited powers in the
cleric state, hard-line conservatives, who had already suffered a
blow when reformist President Khatami came to power in 1997, were
afraid that the moderate reformists would try to win more power
for these institutions.

<HEADLINE> UN Regrets Slow Progress in Tajikistan's Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday regretted that progress had remained
slow during the last three months in Tajikistan's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Council reviewed U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's lastest report on the situation in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined the necessity for parties in
the country to speed up the full and sequential implementation of
the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National
Accord in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon parties to intensify their efforts to
create conditions for the holding in 1999 of a constitutional
referendum and presidential elections, as well as the timely
holding of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted with appreciation the work of the
Special Representative of U.N. Secretary-general and of all the
personnel of the United Nations Mission of observers in Tajikistan
(UNMOT) and encouraged them to continue assisting the parties in
the implementation of the General Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the regular contacts between the President
of Tajikistan and the leader of the United Tajik Opposition (UTO)
and the work of the Commission on National Reconciliation aimed at
achieving further progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated its concern that the security situation
in some parts of Tajikistan remained precarious and reiterated the
importance of a full investigation into the murder in July 1998 of
four members of UNMOT.
</P>
<P>
The Council reminded parties that the ability of the
international community to mobilize and to continue assistance
for Tajikistan was linked to the security of the personnel of
UNMOT and international organizations and of humanitarian
workers.
