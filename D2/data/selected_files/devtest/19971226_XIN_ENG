<HEADLINE> 1997 Year of "Joy and Woe": Queen Elizabeth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- In her annual address on
Christmas day, Britain's Queen Elizabeth said 1997 was a year of
"joy and woe" with the death of Princess Diana and the celebration
of her golden wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We all felt the shock and sorrow of Diana's death," the Queen
said in the television message screened around the world and
appearing for the first time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But "joy and sadness are part of all our lives," Queen
Elizabeth said. "Indeed, the poet William Blake tells us that `joy
and woe are woven fine, a clothing for the soul divine, under
every grief and pine runs a joy with silken twine.'"
</P>
<P>
"This interweaving of joy and woe has been very much brought
home to me and my family during the last months," she added.
</P>
<P>
Westminster Abbey in London had been the scene of two events
this year, "one of them almost unbearably sad," the queen said,
referring to the funeral of Diana, who died in an August 31 car
crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The abbey had also been the scene of celebrations in November
of the Queen's 50th wedding anniversary, a service of thanksgiving
which the Queen said was "for Prince Philip and me, tremendously
happy."
</P>
<P>
The Queen also mentioned other important events, such as the
handover of Hong Kong to China, the restoration of Windsor Castle
destroyed by fire five years ago and parliament setup in Scotland
and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Today's speech to the nation and the whole commonwealth lasted
nine minutes and 55 seconds -- the longest royal Christmas message
since George V began the national tradition in 1932.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's Christmas message was also produced differently,
with something of a documentary format, by Independent Television
News (ITN), which has taken over from the state-financed British
Broadcasting Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nepal Spruced Up for Tourism Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Himalayan kingdom of
Nepal is receiving a face-lift and has colorful events in store
for the coming new year -- Visit Nepal Year' 1998 (VNY'98).
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the VNY'98 are to attract 500,000
tourists, make them stay for an average of 12 days and spend at
least 50 U.S. dollars per day.
</P>
<P>
"We've done enough homework to make the stay of the tourists a
pleasant one," said Dipendra Purush Dhakal, secretary of the
Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation in charge of the VNY'98
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
On the home front, the focus is on improving and developing
diverse eco-friendly and value-based tourism products, and on
creating massive awareness toward tourism benefits.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government has set up a high-level VNY'98
Steering Committee under which seven working committees are
implementing activities in diverse fields.
</P>
<P>
Special funds have been allocated for building tourism
infrastructure. Various types of training are being offered for
travel agencies and hotels to improve their service quality, and
hospitality-related training is being organized for customs,
security and immigration staff.
</P>
<P>
Renovation and cleaning campaigns have been launched, and the
issue of inadequate air seats has been addressed.
</P>
<P>
"Our present status of the air seats amounts to 767,000. I
don't see any problem for attracting 500,000 tourists," Dhakal
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has been striving to boost the
people's participation and raise their awareness toward tourism,
which is one of the objectives of the VNY'98, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've produced 109 different tour packages for the VNY'98," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In Kathmandu, the country's capital and a major tourist
destination, preparations are also underway in an orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is widening roads, cleaning the waste,
strengthening traffic control, renovating cultural relics and
removing stray dogs and bulls, Mayor Keshav Sthapit told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
To reduce pollution in Kathmandu, the local government will
regularly monitor the quality of fuel being used and vehicular
emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city is also taking measures to address the problem of safe
drinking water, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
On the international front, Nepal has launched an extensive
promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the Internet, we have CD-ROM that is widely
distributed, we have E-mail addresses. Similarly, the promotional
videos, the cassettes of the folk songs are also distributed all
over," Dhakal said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali embassies and consulates, public relations agencies and
the private sector have also been involved in the campaign to
promote the VNY'98 abroad.
</P>
<P>
"A World of Its Own" is Nepal's international marketing slogan.
The country is indeed unique in many aspects, Dhakal said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal boasts the world's highest peak, Sagarmatha (Known to the
Chinese as Mount Qomolangma and lies on the border of Nepal and
China's Tibet), the world-famous trekking and mountaineering
activities, the deepest gorge (Kali Gandaki), the world-renowned
Gurkha soldiers, the birth place of Lord Buddha (Lumbini) and the
Living Goddess (Kumari), he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal also has rich flora and fauna and cultural heritage. It
is the only country in the world which has seven world heritage
sites within 20 kilometers with Kathmandu as the center. "We have
as many festivals as there are the number of days," he added.
</P>
<P>
The name of Nepal itself manifests uniqueness. "N stands for
nature, e for ethnocity, p for people, a for art, artifacts and
adventure, l for landscape," was his explanation, echoed by many
in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Nepal has received an average of some
300,000 visitors per year. In 1996, tourist receipts amounted to
117 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the government feels that the tourism sector should have
been developed at a quicker pace in view of its potential. So in
April 1996, the VNY'98 project was launched.
</P>
<P>
Citing good preparations and growing awareness among the
public, Dhakal said he was confident that the objectives will be
achieved. "The only problem visible is pollution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers note that with a successful VNY'98, the services will
be systematized and standardized, and the public's awareness will
be promoted to a new level, which in turn will help improve
Nepal's international image and give a fresh impetus to the
fledgling tourism industry, the single most important contributor
to the country's economy after agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Cold Kills 3,000 Calves in New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 calves died in
their corrals in a cold snap that brought one year's snow in one
week into southeast New Mexico, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
The dead cattle belonged to the Robey family B23 Cattle Co.
in New Mexico's Pecos River Valley.
</P>
<P>
The region normally gets about a foot of snow all winter. On
Monday, 14 inches of snow fell and temperatures dropped to 25
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
The Robeys moved their 15,000 calves into 80 corrals and a
rented facility, but the animals were still exposed to the cold.

<HEADLINE> Jurors to Consider Death as Possible Penalty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The same jurors who found
Terry Nichols guilty of conspiracy in the deadly plot to bomb a
federal building in Oklahoma in 1995 but didn't intend to kill
anyone may punish him with death, U.S. District Judge Richard
Matsch has ruled in Denver, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Matsch said that it was impossible to guess what jurors meant
when they convicted Nichols of conspiracy and involuntary
manslaughter, but acquitted him of murder and two other
weapons-related counts, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll go forward," Matsch said Wednesday at a hearing on
defense motions aimed at blocking both the verdict and the
possibility of a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy charge carries the death penalty. Jurors in this
case will now be asked by prosecutors to vote for death, even
though there is no murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
Matsch also refused to block emotional testimony from victims
during the trial's sentencing phase, which begins Monday. Defense
attorney Michael Tigar argued that jurors should be asked whether
they need any more testimony about "the disastrous effect" of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing phase, prosecutors will likely argue the
death penalty is appropriate because of the enormity of the crime,
with the defense countering that it's inappropriate because he was
convicted of a lesser role than Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he will wait until prosecutors present evidence
next week before deciding if the government met its burden under
the law to prove its point. If he decides the government did not
meet its burden, the jury will not be allowed to consider the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The verdict in Nichols' trial came six months after his former
Army buddy, McVeigh, was convicted of murder and conspiracy and
sentenced to die.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 42, was with his family in Herington, Kansas, when
McVeigh detonated the truck bomb in Oklahoma City, on April 19,
1995, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claimed McVeigh and Nichols worked together to
steal and purchase the bomb ingredients.

of 26 schools was accomplished over the past three years, raising
the education coverage up to 67 percent from 43 percent some
years back.

<HEADLINE> China, AL Pledge Efforts to Tighten Sino-Arab Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China and the Arab League (AL)
today attached great importance to cementing the lasting and
stable relationship of comprehensive cooperation between China and
the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
This came during a meeting between Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Secretary General of the Arab
League (AL) Esmat Abdel-Meguid at the league's headquarters in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that it is very important to see the Sino-Arab
relations oriented toward the 21st century strengthened at the
dawn of the new century.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Sino-Arab ties have been developing on a solid
ground, which feature mutual respect and equal treatment in the
first place," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that will help boost the Sino-Arab relations
include the dialog and coordination mechanisms already in place
between China and many Arab countries, their economic
complementarity and mutual support and cooperation in the
international arena, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
China is keen on stepping up coordination and cooperation with
the Arab countries in various arenas like the United Nations, he
said, adding China and the Arab countries will be able to make a
great success in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said he fully agreed with what Qian stated on
Sino-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is on the last leg of his multi-nation Mideast tour,
reiterated China's consistent support to the righteous cause of
the Arab people, the Mideast peace process and the struggle of the
Palestinian people for the restoration of their rights.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief, in his turn, spoke highly of China's
understanding of and support to the righteous cause of the Arab
people. He said Qian's visit to the "Home of Arabs" in itself
showed China's keenness in boosting friendship and cooperation
with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League also highly values the significant Chinese
role in the Asian-Pacific region as well as the world which is
moving toward multi-polarity," said Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised AL's "relentless efforts in protecting the Arab
unity and rights, solving problems between the Arab nation and
other parties, safeguarding regional stability, and pushing
forward the Mideast peace process."
</P>
<P>
"China highly values the role the Arab League is playing in the
regional and international arena, and eager to enhance their
cooperation in various domains," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian has visited Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas on his Mideast tour starting on December 18. Since
his arrival here on Wednesday, he has held talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri and Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.

<HEADLINE> Youth Unemployment up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwean youths in the 15-25
year age group accounted for 61 percent of the economically
active unemployed population, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Annually, only a small fraction of the estimated 300,000
school leavers are absorbed by the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The escalating number of unemployed youths represents the
biggest challenge to the government with no immediate solution in
sight, Ziana said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted figures released by the Central Statistical Office
as saying the unemployment rate estimated at between 25 and 45
percent. The government has often been warned that it is sitting
on an unemployment time bomb which should be defused urgently.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), as the national
worker representative body, blames the country's failure to
effectively solve its unemployment woes on the absence of a
national employment strategy.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Chief Economist Godfrey Kanyenze said the unemployment
problem can be resolved if the government adopts an employment
strategy in the second phase of economic reforms which started
this year.
</P>
<P>
He held that informal sector would be a main labor market,
adding that the cost of creating a job in the formal sector is up
to 10 times more than creating a single job in the informal
sector.
</P>
<P>
Another long term solution to the problem of youth
unemployment would be to introduce an educational system that
meets the demands of the labor market, Kanyenze said.

MAPUTO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa this month have
expatriated about 25,000 Mozambicans who immigrated into the
country through illegal channels, according to an official with
the Mozambican Immigration Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
The official who refused to be identified said most of the
Mozambicans who were sent back by train or trucks were young
people.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican media slammed the South African government for
expelling Mozambicans home, saying that these people have been
dumped penniless at the border, posing a grave threat to the
security of the region.
</P>
<P>
Like people in other countries, many Mozambicans have gone
illegally to South Africa to look for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many people are rushing home for Christmas holidays,
bringing great pressure onto the border posts of Namaacha and
Ressano Garcia in the past month.
</P>
<P>
A total of 62,884 have entered via Namaacha for holidays,
statistics released at the check points of the border post
showed.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua)-- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) says that India still needs higher concessional assistance
from donor countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a report on currency and finance issued Thursday, the RBI
said that large sums of aid had failed to be utilized due to
supply-side constraints.
</P>
<P>
Although the aid pledges from the donors have remained in the
range of the six to seven billion U.S. dollars in recent years,
the low actual authorization improved considerably to about 70
percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Utilization as a proportion to authorization declined from 91
percent during 1995-96 to 70 percent in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Members of the India Development Forum pledged around 6.7
billion dollars in assistance to India in June 1997 for 1997-98 as
against 6.6 billion for 1996-97. Among the bilateral donors, Japan
constituted the largest share with a pledge amount of 1.2 billion
dollars for 1997-98, the RBI said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians today were
advised to be aware of the fact that cholera is caused by
contaminated food and water and they should prevent the spread of
the disease with better sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The advice came from Tadesse Molla, head of the Epidemiology
and AIDS Department in the Ministry of Health, who participated
in a recent urgent meeting sponsored by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local journalists, Tadesse said that
61,543 people were affected by the disease in Djibouti, Kenya,
Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda over the past two months and the
disease has killed over 2,600 people in the five African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said although cholera has not surfaced in Ethiopia so
far, it is feared that it might spread from neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has the capacity to prevent the disease, He said,
adding that Ethiopia has ample stock of medicines for treatment
to fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official added that the Addis Ababa and Adigrat
pharmaceutical factories have also had the capacity to
immediately produce and distribute the required medicines in a
short span of time.

HONG KONG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- People in Hong Kong
celebrated their first Christmas Day after its return to China,
and joined the rich and colorful festivities here as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Many families chose to go hiking or had barbecues on Thursday
in Hong Kong's hilly country parks although they stayed late on
the Christmas eve.
</P>
<P>
Parks and shops were crowded and outside restaurants, lots of
people were queuing up for their seats.
</P>
<P>
On the Christmas eve, many people went for a stroll around the
streets, where buildings are decorated with color light bulbs in
the forms of Santa Claus, Mickey Mouse, Christmas trees and other
pictures related to Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners in Hong Kong and overseas visitors gathered at pubs
along Lan Kwai Fong in the Central District.
</P>
<P>
Christmas always brings boundless joy to children. On Thursday,
a big Christmas party was held by the Provisional Urban Council
(PUC) at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium to entertain children with
jokers' performances and ballets. Children sang their favorite
Christmas carols.
</P>
<P>
That was only a part of a series of activities organized by the
PUC for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
A giant Christmas tree decorated with some 1,000 color light
bulbs was lit up on December 19 at Statue Square by PUC officials
as seasonal greetings to the residents of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China.
</P>
<P>
The Christmas tree, a 20-feet tall Douglas Fir, was shipped
from Canada as a gift of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
While this year's Christmas is being observed as usual, there
is indeed something different.
</P>

for a new way of offering seasonal greetings to their relatives
and friends through the Internet in support of the campaign for a

<HEADLINE> German Charged in Israel With Attempted Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Stefan Josef Smirak, a
German citizen, was charged today by the Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court with an attempt to carry out suicide attack in Israel on
behalf of Lebanon's Hezbollah (Party of God).
</P>
<P>
The court decided to resume the hearing of the case on
January 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Smirak, 26, was arrested by Israeli police and General Security
Service (GSS) officials on his arrival at the Ben Gurion Airport
on November 28.
</P>
<P>
According to GSS officials, Smirak was recruited by Hezbollah
during his visit to Lebanon between August and November this
year. He was sent to a training camp in the Bekka Valley,
where he was taught to use light weapons and operate explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, Smirak said he was sent to Israel to
collect information and to film densely populated areas in Tel
Aviv and Haifa in order to target a site for attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police today asked the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court to
put Smirak under arrest until the end of legal proceedings, but
the court only ordered to place Smirak under arrest until January
4 next year when the hearing resumes.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said today that Hezbollah has totally
rejected the Israeli allegations that it has sent Smirak to
Israel to carry out suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said this is the second time that Hezbollah has
sent an agent into Israel to attempt to conduct a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996, Israeli police and the GSS arrested a
Lebanese citizen carrying a forged British passport in the
Lawrence Hotel in Jerusalem. The man was seriously injured when
the bomb he was preparing exploded in his hotel room.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government today
endorsed the program of restructuring and conversion of the
defense industry with growing spending up to the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Premier and Economics Minister Yakov Urinson told a
briefing today that Russia's defense spending will grow in
absolute figures for 1998-2005.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25.5 billion redenominated rubles will be allocated
for the program till the year 2000. Thirteen billion out of this
sum will be allocated from the federal budget while 12.5 billion
rubles will come from extrabudget funds, including 8.4 billion
private investment, according to Urinson.
</P>
<P>
He said military spending for 1998-2000 will amount to about
3.5 percent of GDP, and later its share of GDP will slightly
shrink to 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The program envisages that the number of defense industry
enterprises in 72 Russian regions will be decreased from some
1,700 to around 600.
</P>
<P>
Urinson said the main purpose of reforming the Russian defense
complex is to "optimize the composition and structure of all eight
industries comprising it."
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, there are three problems to be overcome: the
first, budget debts to the defense industry, the second, the
indebtedness of defense plants to federal and the third, local
budgets and the accumulation of unsold ready goods.
</P>
<P>
After these problems are resolved, the program will go into
operation, apparently, from July 1, 1998, Urinson noted.

<HEADLINE> China, Egypt Stress Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and China expressed
conviction today that their firm political relations will be
translated into an accelerated trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, during a meeting
with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, said that the friendly relationship of cooperation between
the two countries have developed very well ever since the
establishment of their diplomatic ties in 1956.
</P>
<P>
"China enjoys a lofty place in the hearts of the Egyptian
people," El-Ganzouri said, expressing the belief that the strong
political cooperation will be further strengthened through
facilitating stronger economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that Egypt will take the advantage of the
Chinese savvy in the process of building special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries always support each other over a string of
big issues of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also spoke highly of the firm Chinese
support Arab countries have all along received on the Mideast
peace issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian hailed el-Ganzouri's visit to China last April as "a great
success that has given a strong push to the two countries'
friendly cooperation in various domains."
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Sino-Egyptian relationship is faring quite
well. It is our common wish to strengthen friendship, expand
cooperation and achieve mutual development."
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that "both China and Egypt are seeking the way
of development suitable to their respective national conditions
which are the same to each other's." "Therefore, we, as the
developing countries with friendly ties, have a lot to learn from
each other."
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government would like to encourage more
Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Egypt to explore new fields
with potentials of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe, the mutually beneficial cooperation and bilateral
trade will be elevated to a new height to keep pace with the
continuous economic development of our two countries," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in Cairo Wednesday on the last leg of his current
Mideast tour, which has taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and
the Palestinian self-rule areas since December 18.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Secretary General of the Arab
League Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid during his three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> New York City to Continue Fighting Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite a decline in the
murder rate, New York City will go on cracking down on drug
trafficking and other crimes, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary police statistics showed a 22 percent drop to 746
homicides in 1997 as of December 24 from 961 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year was the first time since 1968 to see less than 1,000
murders in the city of 7.3 million population. The highest figure
in the 90s was 2,262 recorded in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Police said the number of rape, robbery, auto theft and other
crime cases has also gone down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide decrease of felonies and a smaller number of
teen-agers in the city population are believed to be among the
factors causing crime decline in New York this year.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said Wednesday that his men
will expand strategies to fight drug trafficking which is a major
cause of crime.
</P>
<P>
They will also pay special attention to crimes related to
youth gangsters now numbering some 2,000 in the city.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Foreign Minister to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia Saturday, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported today.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming visit is very important, especially as it follows
the official visit to Saudi Arabia by Crown Prince Hassan in
September, Tarawneh said in a statement released by the Petra.
</P>
<P>
He will discuss with the Saudi side various issues related to
bilateral ties, regional situations, the Middle East peace process
and the Islamic summit recently held in Iran, Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Jordan and its oil-rich neighbor has
improved in recent years, after Jordan distanced itself from Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf War which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan paid his first unofficial visit to Saudi
Arab early this year in six years and held talks with Saudi King
Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is now Jordan's second largest trading partner
after Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported 130 million Jordanian dinars
(about 184 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to Saudi Arabia
compared to 70 million dinars (about 99 million dollars) in 1995,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Under a trade protocol, the two countries are expected to set
up a free trade zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> French PM Expresses Shock Over Massacre in Chiapas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today said that he was "deeply shocked" by the news of
massacre of villagers in Chiapas, Mexico, and urged the Mexican
government to shed all light on the circumstances of the killings.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said in a communique that the French government
condemned "with the greatest firmness" the resort to violence
which he said would make it more difficult to look for a solution
to the crisis in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
"The French government appeals to the Mexican authorities to
shed all the light on the activities of paramilitary groups which
give themselves up to terror, and to find the perpetrators of the
massacre who should never remain unpunished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that paramilitary groups close to the ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party of Mexico attacked Tuesday with
automatic weapons and axes a small school and a poor church in
Chiapas, killing 45 civilians, including 21 women and 15 children.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Palestine to Join Hands to Change Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan declared here today
that it would join hands with the Palestinians in a collective
effort to change the Israeli monopoly over the Palestinian
market.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to adopt a united attitude toward Israel in
developing Jordanian-Palestinian economic cooperation in the
future, Jawad Anani, Deputy Prime Minister for Development and
Prime Ministry Affairs, told reporters this evening upon his
return from a meeting with the Palestinians held in the past two
days in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that during the meeting, Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) signed two agreements and a memorandum
to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, tourism,
transport, the flow of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
All the cooperation would be carried out in the premise that
both sides treated Israel with a united attitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been trying to maintain its monopoly over the
Palestinian market through closure of Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anani said that a trilateral meeting among the
Palestinians, Israel and Jordan was expected to be held here next
February to discuss the economic issues concerning the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Anani also said that he met with PNA President Yasser
Arafat during his trip and discussed with him the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, especially on the
Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat highly praised the relations between the PNA and Jordan
and welcomed the agreements just signed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian market now absorbs between 2.7 billion and
4 billion U.S. dollars of Israel-made products annually.
</P>
<P>
Palestine is the second largest market for Israeli products
after the European Union. Only 5 percent of Palestinian imports
come from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second country in the Arab world after Egypt that conceived peace
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executions Increase at Unprecedented Pace in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- This year saw 37 executions
in Texas -- half the national total of the Unites States and the
highest number in a single state in a single year since 1930, when
the federal government began an annual count.
</P>
<P>
It equaled the number of Texas inmates put to death from 1982
through 1990. And for the first time since Texas reopened death
row in the mid-1970s, the number of convicted killers executed in
a single year exceeded the number of prisoners who arrived with
new death sentences -- 29 this year, said The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
For years, Texas had reigned as the nation's most active death
penalty state, executing inmates at a steady pace: 12 in 1992, 17
in 1993, 14 in 1994, 19 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In late 1995 the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed to
consider an inmate's challenge to a state law designed to hasten
appeals, resulting in a virtual halt in executions last year.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court eventually upheld the law. Cases blocked by
the challenge moved forward, along with those that would normally
have come due this year.
</P>
<P>
Executions probably will continue at a brisk pace in 1998. At
least a dozen executions are already set for next year and it's
likely the list will include a woman.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Threatens to Resign Over Changes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy today threatened to resign if the Knesset (parliament)
passes the arrangements bill to change the health system.
</P>
<P>
Levy told the Israel Radio that any change of the health system
will cause trouble to ordinary families and that the country's
health care is more important than the cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
He said that five Knesset members of his Gesher (Bridge) Party
have decided to vote against the bill in protest against any
change in the health system.
</P>
<P>
Levy added that he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
today and informed him of his party's decision, which he said is
irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes of Israel's health system, which have been
approved by Knesset Finance Committee, will allow each health fund
to set up its own basket of services, allow insurers to charge
extra sum for a wide variety of services and eliminate long-term
geriatric nursing care from health fund responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, average families will have to pay about 300 U.S.
dollars more annually for visits to doctors, hospital emergency
rooms, outpatient clinics and other services.
</P>
<P>
Public hospitals and community health fund clinics conducted
partial strike today in their last-ditch attempt to prevent the
Knesset from making major changes in the health system.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Missile Attack on Opposition Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian security official
today denied the claim of the Iranian outlawed Mujahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO) that Iran had launched missile attack on
one of its bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said the MKO recently
claimed that the group foiled an Iranian missile attack on
one of its bases in Iraq on December 19.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing the claim, the unnamed Iranian officials said that
the "unfounded" claim has been raised by the MKO at a time
when the improvement of Tehran-Baghdad relations made the group
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the disappointed MKO members did all within their
power to mar "the mighty and successful image of the Islamic
Republic of Iran" among Islamic and regional states, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq agreed to solve the remaining issues between
the two former rivals in order to improve their relations on
the sideline of the eighth Islamic summit held here on
December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
One of the issues which stand in the way of normalization
of relations between the two countries is that both sides
support the other's anti-government groups.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was one of the active groups fighting against
Iran's former Shah regime, but it was announced outlawed in
1981 due to some differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the group members fled into Iraq and launched
various military attacks on the Iranian interests inside and
and outside Iran during the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Political Leaders Recognize Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of some Angolan
political parties today said to reporters that positive
development has been achieved in the implementation of the Lusaka
peace agreement despite some setbacks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Luis dos Passos, president of Partido Renovador Democratico
(PRD), noted that the establishment of the government of national
unity and reconciliation and the office-taking of UNITA
parliamentarians in the National Assembly are "most important
developments" in the Angolan peace process this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, progress has also been made in re-establishing
local governments in the areas occupied by the opposition UNITA,
but it is not so satisfactory, he added.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the long-waited summit between President
Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi should be held
as soon as possible to make the peace process gain "new
momentum".
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Democratic Reflection Party Zau Puna told
reporters that some UNITA generals' incorporation into the
unified national army is also a major achievement in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that there remains many tasks to be done
for the completion of the peace process and urged the two sides
to continue making efforts to bring final peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
When assessing the implementation of the peace agreement this
year, Manuel Francisco, president of the Angolan Liberal Party,
stressed that the next meeting between Dos Santos and Savimbi
should take place immediately, saying that each of their last
four meetings has pushed the peace process forward and
strengthened mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
However, President of Democratic Forum Georges Chikoty warned
against over-optimism over the peace process. He said that the
peace process has not brought about necessary security to the
Angolan people and the country is still stranded between peace
and war.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Freedom Movement Chief Yazdi Released (Update) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of
Iran's Freedom Movement Ebrahim Yazdi was released today after a
10-day imprisonment, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
A judge of the first branch of Tehran's Islamic Revolution
court was quoted as announcing that Yazdi was detained on December
14 on charges of desecrating religious sanctities.
</P>
<P>
"Yazdi was released today upon completion of the necessary
investigation and posting bail pending the final court verdict,"
said the judge.
</P>
<P>
A staff member from Yazdi's office, who declined to mention
name, confirmed his release in a telephone interview with
Xinhua. However, he said that his organization did not understand
why Yazdi was arrested and why he was freed.
</P>
<P>
On December 15, the Freedom Movement issued a statement saying
that Yazdi was summoned by the Islamic Revolution court for
questioning and then put into Tehran's prison of Evin without any
charges. Iran's Judiciary claimed that Yazdi was detained
according to law.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest issue of the Iranian weekly Kayhan Havai
said that Yazdi's arrest was believed to have links with his
alleged role in provoking the disgraced Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montarzeri to question the authority of the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
On November 14, Montazeri, the former designated successor of
the late Iranian supreme leader Imam Khomeini criticized Khamenei
for having too much interference in the government's
affairs. Montazeri's remark triggered a political disturbance in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan Havai said that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
recently blamed Montazeri for his remarks by saying that "about
the naiveness of this person, it is sufficient to say that he
thinks that he can make a revolution with individuals such as
Yazdi."
</P>
<P>
Yazdi and some other political figures had reportedly attended
the gathering last month in which Montazeri made a speech to
question the authority of the Khamenei, the weekly added.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement was founded in 1961 by Mehdi Bazargan,
late Iranian prime minister of the interim government formed in
the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Yazdi was elected as secretary general of the
organization in January 1995 after the demise of Bazargan.
</P>
<P>
However, the organization was not granted formal permission to
carry out activities since the government asked political parties
and organizations to register in 1995.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Forward Principled Standpoints on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Outlining China's stand toward
the Middle East peace process, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today called for implementation of the signed
agreements and eradication of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this afternoon, Qian brought
forward five principled standpoints in support of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace talks should proceed on the basis of the
implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions on the Middle East and
the land-for-peace principle forged at the Madrid peace conference
(in 1991)," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, all the signed agreements should be implemented
seriously and any attempt to hinder the Middle East peace process
be avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, terrorism and violence in all forms must be eradicated
so that the security of the Mideast countries and the normal life
of their peoples can be ensured, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government rejects all kinds of terrorism and
violence no matter where it comes from," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"As the peace process makes headway, regional economic
cooperation should be strengthened so as to help build confidence
and dispel hostility gradually between Arab countries and Israel
on their way toward mutual development and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Qian said, the international community is obliged to
work together with the parties concerned in the Middle East to
realize a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, and
China is ready to make its own efforts to this end.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is deeply concerned with the stalemate in
the Mideast peace process.

<P>
"China, which is not in the position of a mediator in the peace
process, has been expounding its views on the Mideast peace
process to the various parties involved and acquainted with their
ideas and positions," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
China supports the righteous cause of the Palestinian and Arab
people and any progress in the peace process, said Qian, who has
visited four Arab countries and Israel on his current Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Arab countries, Qian said China has
established a friendly cooperative mechanism with all the Arab
countries. He spoke highly of the role the Arab countries play in
the United Nations, the Third World and the Non-Alignment Movement.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the U.N. crippling sanctions imposed on Iraq since
its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 should not continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
He also described the international embargo on Libya as
"inappropriate." The embargo was imposed in 1992 after Libya
refused to hand over two suspects allegedly involved in the
bombing of a U.S. plane which killed 270 people in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Qian's multi-nation tour that has
taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas since December 18.
</P>
<P>
He has held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Prime
Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and
Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel-Meguid since his
arrival on a three-day visit here on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today criticized Israel for refusing to undertake
equal duties as the PNA to fight against terrorism, Israel radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The PNA can not understand why Israel refuses to accept the
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation between the
Palestinians and Israel, PNA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is Israel that has asked the PNA to carry out
security cooperation, but it is again Israel that is asking to
revise the memorandum of understanding.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and Israel, under the auspices of the United States,
reached the memo on security cooperation through hard negotiations
on December 17.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said Wednesday
the memorandum is unacceptable and that he will not sign it.
</P>
<P>
The security document is still something of principle, not a
detailed plan, and has yet to be approved, Netanyahu told the
press.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Addresses Round-table on Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Friday that it is imperative to adopt a Land Code to regulate
the on-going land reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the first meeting of a round-table conference on land
ownership, he said that while the Land Code still under debate
should re-define the federal ownership of the country's land and
ban land sales to foreigners, there is no need to ban private land
ownership and land can be traded, donated or mortgaged.
</P>
<P>
He explained that federal land ownership is indispensable for
national security, border protection, infrastructure development,
transport and communications.
</P>
<P>
Land ownership has been one of the disputes between President
Yeltsin and the State Duma (lower house). While Yeltsin insists
that land be marketable, the Duma has been against the idea.
</P>
<P>
The Duma adopted a Land Code on June 11 this year, which puts
many restrictions on private land ownership. The code was vetoed
by Yeltsin on June 25. However, the Duma managed to override the
presidential veto by a two-thirds majority later on September 24.
</P>
<P>
The round-table conference is being attended by the prime
minister, his two first deputies, speakers of both houses, lower
house party leaders, governors mostly from agricultural regions,
and representatives of major political parties and movements.
</P>
<P>
Presidential press secretary Sergi Yastrzhembsky told the
reporters after the two-hour meeting that while round-table
participants still have different views on land ownership,
consensus has been reached on many issues. They all agree that the
Land Code will be further revised by the Consultative Council and
then signed by President Yeltsin in three months, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- British soccer hooligans could
be barred from going to the World Cup finals in France next
summer, government ministers said here today.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said he had contacted British police,
courts and prosecutors to remind them they had the power to place
restriction orders preventing anyone convicted of football-related
offenses from traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
"For the convicted hooligan, the issue of a restriction order
will mean a visit to the police station -- not the World Cup in
France," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks voiced his support to the call for
convicted soccer hooligans to be stopped from traveling to
matches. Britain's Football Association hailed the plan as a
contribution to safety.
</P>
<P>
England soccer fans have long had a reputation for hooliganism.
In recent years British police have introduced ways of monitoring
the activities of potential troublemakers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's defending
champion Wong Kam Po has not yet got himself ready for winning
again at the coming Second Tour of South China Sea Cycling Race,
his coach said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wong won the title at last year's inaugural race and he also
won Hong Kong's first-ever Chinese National Games gold medal at
the Eighth Games in October this year in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wong's coach Shen Jinkang, a former Chinese national coach,
said Wong had been engaged in long training and competition for
the most part of this year. "He really needs some rest, especially
after his triumph at the National Games," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Although Wong has taken some training sessions, he is not yet
ready to defend his title at the annual tour, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Wong's arch rival, Asian champion Tang Xuezhong from China's
mainland, is not in good shape either. With a waist injury
suffered one month ago during training in Beijing, Tang said it
might be difficult for him to do well at this year's tour.
</P>
<P>
The annual tour is to start here on Saturday, with 10
participating teams from six countries and regions including three
from China's mainland, two each from Macao and Hong Kong and one
each from Chinese Taipei, Mongolia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Three more Hong Kong teams are going to compete in the six-day,
426-kilometer race, but their times are not going to be accounted
for team standings.
</P>
<P>
Among the other racers from China's mainland are Asian and
National Games road race champion Pan Guangchun and National Games
mountain bike champion Feng Yuejin.
</P>
<P>
The tour starts in Hong Kong with two races set for December 27
and 28, both in the northern part of the New Territories. It will
then move to the South China city of Zhuhai for two more races on
December 29 and 30 before the final two races are held on December
31 and January 1 in Macao.

<HEADLINE> UN Embargo Costs Libya 24 Billion Dollars: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Libya has lost over 24 billion
U.S. dollars due to the U.N. embargo imposed five years ago,
according to a report released today by the Libyan Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the sectors of oil, industry and
agriculture are the most affected as their losses have exceeded 15
billion dollars, mainly due to the shortage of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The embargo has obstructed the infrastructure development in
Libya, and led to an increase of up to 200 percent in the prices
of commodities and services, thus affecting the low income groups,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report has asserted a rise in the mortality rate due to the
embargo-motivated deterioration of the health sector, indicating
that the overwhelming majority of the 17,000 patients whose cases
necessitated treatment abroad have died.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the difficulties facing Libya's agricultural sector
on account of the embargo have had their negative repercussions on
the living standard of the Libyan citizens.
</P>
<P>
The report said the agricultural sector's losses amounted to 5
billion dollars and that of the transport sector, 2 billion
dollars, with the Libyan airways company as the prime victim which
has lost 1.9 billion dollars and been forced to close down its
offices in and out of Libya and to dismiss a large portion of its
employees and workers.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the five-year U.N. embargo cost Libyan
industrial sector a total of 5 billion dollars as many production
units have closed down due to shortage of primary materials.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the registered losses of the trade and finance sector
stood at 6 billion dollars in view of the freezing of Libyan
assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector, the country's main source of income, lost 5
billion dollars during the five-year period, because most oil
companies are in short supply of spare parts needed for their
regular operation in oil production and maintenance of oil
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The report was released in the wake of the visit to Libya last
week by a U.N. mission to investigate the consequences of the
sanctions imposed against the north African country.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been subjected to a U.N. flight ban and an embargo on
arms purchase since 1992, as well as the imposition of diplomatic
sanctions in December 1993, due to its failure to hand over two
Libyan citizens suspected of being involved in the bombing of an
U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, which
killed 270 people on board.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Gertrude Mongella, a
world-famous woman activist, said today technologies, skills, and
family planning are essential to women's development.
</P>
<P>
Lack of skills and technologies has made Tanzanian women less
competitive in terms of international standards, she said.
</P>
<P>
For example, "We don't have textiles skills like Chinese
women," she told Xinhua today in an interview at her home in the
northern outskirts of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The other factor that hinders development of women in the
society is the heavy burden of children. In rural areas of
Tanzania, some women have six to seven children, she said.
</P>
<P>
Pregnancy, breast feeding, as well as diseases, have cost
women too much time, she said, appealing to people to exercise
family planning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of violence against women, Mongella said it is a "big
problem for the whole world," whether in Africa or in Europe. She
said the Tanzanian government has done quite a lot in eliminating
such violence.
</P>
<P>
Mongella, who has just returned from Burundi, said situation
there is difficult because of an international economic embargo
on the tiny central African country. "Women are so frightened...
they are suffering," she said. "The only way (for them) is to
unite to stop fighting."
</P>
<P>
The past year was not the best for most of the African women
in many countries because of conflicts, she pointed out. "Despite
that we have continued to pursue our goals in the advancement of
women as agreed upon during the Fourth World Conference on Women
which was held in Beijing in September of 1995."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1945 in Tanzania, Madame Mongella is widely known as
the the secretary general of the 1995 Beijing Fourth World
Women's Conference sponsored by the United Nations, and the
country's ambassador to India by 1995.
</P>
<P>
"I do hope that the solidarity which was created by that
conference will remain strong," she said.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year message sent to the Chinese Women News, Mongella
said: "I hope the coming year will give us more prosperity and
will be another step toward global development with peace."

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The former President of Zambia was arrested by paramilitary
police as part of a government crackdown on opposition leaders
after an attempted coup in October. The arrest of Kenneth D.
Kaunda, the 73-year-old statesman who led the country to
independence in 1964, is likely to heighten political tensions in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of part-time instructors at colleges and
universities has nearly doubled since 1970, and the trend to
hiring part-timers as a cost-saving measure now "threatens the
quality of higher education," according to a report to be
distributed on Saturday at the annual convention of the Modern
Language Association of America in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- As a strong economy continues to drive down the federal
deficit, pressure is building in both parties to recast last
summer's balanced budget deal to make room for additional tax cuts
and domestic spending to gain advantage in the 1998 midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
--The promise of accelerated financial support brought South
Korea's moribund financial markets roaring back to life Friday with
a 7 percent jump in stock prices and the biggest one-day increase
in the nation's currency, the won, which gained nearly 20 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Holiday retail sales came in below expectations for most
retailers for the third year in a raw, despite economic indicators
that pointed toward one of the most promising seasons in years.
</P>
<P>
-- Yeltsin prepared for round-table talks Friday with opposition
and trade-union leaders on a proposed law to permit the free sale
of land. Meanwhile, the Russian government approved plans to close
arms plants or convert them to civilian use. The number of plants
is to fall to 670 from 1,750 by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Dialogue Replaces Confrontation in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said on Friday that dialogue replacing confrontation has been main
achievement for Russia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his last weekly radio address of the year, Yeltsin recalled
that he had once called upon Russians to strive for reconciliation
and that he himself had reached agreements with some adamant
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Now there is less appeal for "confrontation and destruction",
he said. Instead, consulation has become the main stream of the
Russia's reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the economic situation, he noted that although the
government has made tremendous efforts to push forward the
economic reform, life is still very hard for quite a few people.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also urged new Russian businessmen to show more concern
for the society and be more active in charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russians have to learn to respect law and family
values so that the society can become more stable and
safer.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Continuous Environmental Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
pledged that environmental protection will remain as one of
China's long-term basic national policies.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of congratulations marking today's opening of the
national work conference on environmental protection, Li noted
that China faces an arduous task in carrying out environmental
protection due to the nation's large population and relative
shortage of resources.
</P>
<P>
Environmental workers and officials have worked diligently and
fulfilled their duties in protecting the environment by closing
enterprises creating heavily pollution, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection which has important bearing on
implementing the strategy of sustainable development and
ensuring the health and quality of life of the people is one of
China's long-term basic national policies," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the environmental workers will
strive to record new achievements.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection
Agency, said the government is determined to reclaim the nation's
most heavily polluted rivers and lakes by the year 2000, including
the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers, and Taihu, Dianchi and Chaohu
lakes.
</P>
<P>
Xie added that extensive efforts must also be made to solve the
nation's problems related to acid rain and sulphur dioxide.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on workers in the defense industry to be pioneers in
the drive to use science and technology to build the army.
</P>
<P>

China defined new requirements for the defense industry and the
armed forces.

enterprises, and in overcoming all difficulties to reach related
goals," said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: No Gloomy View Toward Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today Middle East peace is a long and
complicated process and the international community should not
take a gloomy view toward it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conclusion of his five-nation tour of the
region, Qian said that many people in the world are becoming
pessimistic about Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but they should
have a full understanding of the protracted and complex nature of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace talks can still produce results as long as all
parties concerned work hard to implemented relevant
U.N. resolutions and the principle of land for peace," he said in
an interview with Chinese reporters.
</P>
<P>
Qian began his tour of the region on December 18 and has
visited Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas
and Egypt. He said the major objective of his visit is to
contribute to restarting the peace wheel.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese government is deeply concerned with the deadlock in
the peace process as a result of policy changes of the incumbent
Israeli government," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, ever since taking office in June 1996,
has adopted policies different from those of its predecessor, Qian
pointed out. However there exists a strong sentiment among the
Israeli people demanding the advancement of the peace process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Israeli people, including the opposition
Labor party, all deem the peace process the sole option for
resolving the Mideast problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Europe, Russia and the United States are making all
kinds of mediating efforts in a bid to reactivating the peace
process; China also feels obliged to express its attitude.
</P>
<P>
"If the world community agrees that the peace process should
continue, it would have a good prospect, even if this does not
mean the Mideast problem can be settled in a short term," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that what brought the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
to the present impasse is the two sides' difference approaches
to the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people, the Arab world and the world community
believe this principle, established at the Madrid peace conference
in 1991, is the important one which enables the peace process to
progress - Peace can only be realized in the Middle East after
Israel returns occupied Arab lands, he said.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Israeli government, on the other hand, opposes
this principle and set forth a security-for-peace formula, Qian
said, it held the view that the Israelis feel unsafe in the face
of rampant terrorist activities and therefore the first and
foremost thing is to crack down on terrorism; there can be peace
only after the Israelis have security.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "I believe peace and security are
inseparable: peace is ultimate security and security can only be
guaranteed with the materialization of peace."
</P>
<P>
"We support demands to stop all terrorist activities in the
world," Qian said, China and the international community are
against terrorist activities in all forms and advocate an
international environment to condemn and fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Qian said a final solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the
Mideast problem should be based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive peace can only came to the Middle East when
Arab countries recover their lost lands and the Palestinian people
restore their rights, realize the desire for national independence
and a Palestinian state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian will leave here this afternoon winding up his three-day
visit to Egypt.

<HEADLINE> China to Encourage Citizens to Buy Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Making people willing to buy
houses and helping middle- and low-income urban families be able
to afford houses are the two key issues concerning China's ongoing
housing reform, an official in charge of the housing reform said
here today.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Li Tieying, who heads the State Council's task
force on housing reform, made the remark at a national forum on
housing reform which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, put forth the
following measures to tackle the two issues:
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerating the rise of the unreasonable low rents and
the shift from rent to cost rent;
</P>
<P>
-- Gradually abolishing the system under which the businesses
and institutions build or buy apartment buildings and then allocate
them to their workers and employees;
</P>
<P>
-- Gradually turning houses into marketable goods;
</P>
<P>
-- Making people understand that houses, like any other goods,
are something one should buy with money;
</P>
<P>
-- Accelerating the pace of establishing public housing
accumulation funds so as to reinforce the people's payment
capability for housing;
</P>
<P>
-- Making people able to get housing mortgage loans from the
bank for their housing purchase;
</P>
<P>
-- Cutting down housing prices by lowering the construction costs of
housing; and
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the housing quality and the real estate management.
</P>
<P>
Establishing public housing accumulation funds will be central
to the housing reform, Li said, adding that reform of the system
of housing investment and construction must be carried out to
support the housing reform.

<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack
Straw said on Friday that known soccer hooligans could be
prevented from travelling to France for the World Cup next Summer.
</P>
<P>
Straw reminded the British police, courts and prosecutors that
they had the power to place restriction orders, keeping anyone
convicted of football-related offences from travelling abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation, and sharing of information
between the French organisers and the participating countries were
the most important factor for the organization of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he would hold a seminar in Britain in February,
bringing together experts from across Europe to share knowledge of
fans-controlling techniques.
</P>
<P>
England soccer fans have had a reputation for troublemaking,
although the problem has faded in recent years after British
police monitored the activities of potential violence.
</P>
<P>
Britain had successfully held the Euro 96 championship last
year, which was closed without any serious problem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Forge Agent-Bank Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (Exim Bank) today signed an agent-bank agreement with the
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will bring interbank cooperation to a new stage
by improving export credits for sellers and promoting exports for
the nation's machine-building sector," according to bank
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The two banks established initial agent-bank ties in 1994 when
Exim Bank was established as a policy bank to support exports of
domestic machinery products and complete sets of equipment. The
Bank of China's advantageous operations at home and abroad have
since provided strong backing for Exim's operations which in many
cases suffered from a lack of branches, settlement capabilities
and difficulties in extending loans and serving lenders.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China has provided some 70 percent of the total 32.6
billion yuan in export seller's credits on behalf of the Exim Bank
since 1994. During the first 11 months of this year, the two banks
signed relending contracts valued at 1.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Exim Bank is also expected to sign similar agreements with
other Chinese commercial banks in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Turkish Extension of Mandate for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 26 (Xinhua)-- Iraq today termed the Turkish
parliamentary decision to extend the mandate of the multi-nation
Northern Watch Operation over Iraq for another six months as "a
hostile act against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Iraq's Foreign Ministry advised the Turkish
government and members of parliament to re-consider their
"irresponsible political stances" towards Turkish-Iraqi relations,
according to the official Iraqi news agency INA today.
</P>
<P>
Northern Watch Operation, formally known as Operation Provide
Comfort, was designed to protect the Kurdish people from possible
attacks by the Iraqi government forces and has been renewed every
six months since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 warplanes, including 27 U.S. jets, are now
deployed in the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to enforce
the flight ban and carry out the monitoring duty.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish people and all fair Turkish political parties know
well that the acts carried out by the American and British troops
against Iraq from the Turkish territories are the reason of the
continuation of the abnormal status in southeastern Turkey and
northern Iraq," the Iraqi spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish obedience to the Anglo-American scheme would never
solve the Kurdish issue inside Turkey, but on the contrary, it
would complicate the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Turkey's Kurdish Workers' Party, which,
outlawed by Ankara, has been waging a separatist war against the
government in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He described the imposition of "no-fly zone" in northern of
Iraq as a "unilateral, illegitimate and illegal" decision adopted
by the U.S. and British governments, adding that it is a malicious
act irrelevant to the Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has expounded this fact several times, but Turkish
officials turned a deaf ear, he said, adding this is a deliberate
ignorance that should be condemned and denounced.
</P>
<P>
Iraq held the Turkish government responsible for the damage and
perils threatening its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq would preserve its right to adopting what it sees proper
to defend its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity in
accordance with the U.N. Charter and international law, he
emphasized.

Hanoi, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a target to
bring down the country's population growth rate from the current
1.88 percent to about 1.5 to 1.6 percent by the year 2000 with the
population to remain under 81 million.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textile Industry Facing Further Cutbacks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China will make further
cutbacks next year in the production capacity of its textile
industry in line with its strategy of restructuring and overall
profitability in the sector.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today at the annual textile industry
conference by Shi Wanpeng, chairman of the China National Textile
Council (CNTC).
</P>
<P>
He said that China will eliminate 10 million spindles within
three years starting in coastal plants. Of that total, 4.8 million
spindles will be removed from production next year.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the CNTC will set up a special work group to oversee
the spindle-reduction drive and announce its results on a monthly
and a quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
China tried to identify outdated spindles as early as 1992, but
achieved little success so far because of local resistance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that indecisiveness can only exacerbate textile
industry problems and force greater sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
The state textile industry has been losing money continuously
since 1993, when the loss stood at 1.9 billion yuan. The loss for
this year is estimated at 8 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Pak Stock Market Remains Volatile During 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's stock market
remained volatile and unpredictable in 1997 due to uncertain
political conditions and turmoil in regional emerging stock and
currency markets, Arif Habib, president of Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE), said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent constitutional crisis in the country,
Arif said in a presidential review for KSE Annual Report of 1997
released in Karachi on Friday that investors' confidence has
suffered a great deal.
</P>
<P>
But he hoped that the clouds of uncertainty will dissipate and
the economy will resume its path toward recovery in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Giving a brief review of the behavior of the market during the
period, Arif said that toward the end of 1996 investors'
confidence had been severely eroded by the political uncertainty
in the country and the poor shape of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index had touched a low of 1339 points by the end
of last year, he said, but the measures taken by the present
government after its takeover in February pushed the index up to
1849 at the end of the third quarter of 1997 and the highest value
recorded during the year was 2027.99.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing KSE president said the priority of the stock
market in 1998 will be the development of a corporate debt market.
</P>
<P>
A national clearing house will be established and treasury
stock operations are also likely to commence next year, he added.

TOKYO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Nagano Olympic organisers
decided on Friday that sumo wrestlers will represent individual
countries at the opening ceremony for the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
The wrestlers will carry the placards introducing the countries
and regions, and perform a ritual to purify the stadium during the

</P>
<P>
The host Japan, the United States, Greece and some countries,
had been assigned wrestlers in advance according to the wrestlers'
sumo rankings and nationalities.
</P>
<P>
It was decided in advance that Takanohana, the top-ranked
yokozuna, would stamp a traditional sumo ring where bouts are
fought to expel evil spirits and purify the Olympic stadium for
the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Takanohana will also carry the placard for Japan, which as the
host will enter the stadium last.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked yokozuna, Hawaiian-born Akebono, was selected
in advance to represent Greece, the home of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
American Musashimaru was picked to lead the U.S. team into the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Both Ireland and Israel, the two countries not generally
associated with Winter sports, were matched up with Takanonami and
Wakanohana, the highest ranking wrestlers.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Today is the 104th anniversary
of the late Chairman Mao Zedong's birth. Thousands gathered before
Chairman Mao Memorial Hall in Beijing to pay tribute to the late,
great man of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
People from all over the country came to show their respect
even though the People's Daily and other major Beijing-based
newspapers ran front-page stories that "Chairman Mao's Memorial
Hall will be re-opened on January 6."
</P>
<P>
Eight farmers, carrying luggage on their backs, stood before
the hall gazing at it for a long time. Dressed in the simple gray
attire of migrant workers, they were on their way back home to
West Kaizhang Village in Shanxi Province from Hebei Province to
celebrate Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"It is a pity the hall is closed," said Guo Qixi, one of the
farmers. "We will come back some other day."
</P>
<P>
He and the other seven farmers rode the train most of Thursday
night to reach Beijing on Mao's anniversary, but were disappointed
that the hall was closed. After paying homage to Mao for a few
hours, the farmers resumed their train trip to Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuejing, a computer salesman from Shanghai, also stood in
the chilly wind. He also made a special trip to Beijing to come to
the hall.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textile Industry Facing Further Cutbacks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government regards rejuvenating the state textile
industry as a top priority for state-enterprise reform in the
belief that all state-owned industries can be rescued if the
biggest money-loser of all can escape red ink and move into the
black.
</P>
<P>
Shi reminded participates at the conference that the outdated
spindles must be destroyed, rather than being moved elsewhere,
adding that no more cotton-spinning frames should be imported.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the State Council will inject more funds
to help the reduction campaign. For every 10,000 spindles cut, the
company will get 3 million yuan in subsidy and soft loans of two
million yuan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has already set aside 1.5 billion yuan
in next year's budget for this purpose. The local governments are
also supposed to contribute money.
</P>
<P>
The central government also will prepare more funds to cover
bad debts next year among state textile companies.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that the key to fewer spindles lies in
assistance for laid-off workers, making sure they have enough
funds for basic survival and adequate pension and medical
insurance.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry will shed 1.2 million workers in three
years, with 600,000 workers scheduled for layoffs next year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The official reminded state textile companies to closely study
the effects on international textile markets from the recent
financial crisis in many Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Next year, he said, China will take more effective measures to
help its textile companies become more competitive on
international markets.

Early this morning, an Italian couple from Milan (Mario and
wife Caterina) were disappointed to learn that the Mao Memorial
Hall was closed. They gestured to guards and, in halting Chinese,
asked when it would be opened.
</P>
<P>
"Mao was a great man," Mario said, pointing to his
Italian-Chinese dictionary for clarity. "Without him, China would
not have been what it is today." This was their third trip to
China and second to the hall, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dongfanghong Book Store, a stone's throw from the Summer Palace
in the western part of Beijing, just opened for business before
the anniversary. The store, named after a popular song dedicated
to Mao, has so far sold more than 3,000 books and other items
bearing Mao's words and some books about Mao.
</P>
<P>
Also commemorating Mao will be a special program in prime time
on China Central Television, and some local TV stations plan a
series of programs about his life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people in Mao's hometown -- Shaoshan in Hunan
Province -- and other areas were holding a variety of activities
to show their respect for the great leader who died 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"In present-day China, particularly in Guangdong, life is quite
different from that of 21 years ago," Professor Wei Shiliu
said. Wei, who was visiting Mao's hall in Beijing today from
Guangdong-based South China Polytechnic University, added: "Mao is
always a national hero in people's hearts."

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices plunged Friday
with the benchmark Nikkei stock index tumbling below the 15,000 line
for fear that more companies may fail over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted 497.50 points or 3.25 percent
from Thursday's close to 14,802.60.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, sank 18.64 points or 1.60 percent to
1,143.59.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 380 million

<HEADLINE> Businessman Killed in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A well known Somali
businessman was shot dead by armed gunmen at a checkpoint near
Wanleweyn district, 90 km southwest of the capital last night.
</P>
<P>
The man, Qasim Sheikh Mohamud, has been killed on his way back
to Mogadishu from the town of Baidoa, reports reaching here today
said.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told the journalists that the gunmen have
indiscriminately fired upon a convoy of two technical vehicles
and a civilian car escorting Mohamud.
</P>
<P>
Mohamud, a former contractor with the U.N. Operation in
Somalia, died in his vehicle as the result of the shooting that
began between his bodyguards and the militiamen who mounted the
attack.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, one of the militiamen from the
attackers belonging to the Eyr Sub-clan of Habar Gidir and two of
the bodyguards of Muhamud from the Suleman Subclan of Habar Gidir
have also died in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen with technical wagons belonging to the subclan of late
Mohamud last night rushed to the scene for possible retaliation
against the attackers, however, flooded waters from the Shabelle
River have blocked the traffic on the Mogadishu-Baidoa road,
preventing them from proceeding ahead.
</P>
<P>
The body of Mohamud was brought to Mogadishu this morning and
buried after the Friday prayers at the national cemeteries yard
near the 21 October parade ground.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the reason for the attack is related
to an earlier incident in which the bodyguards of Mohamud killed
three militiamen belonging to the Eyr Sub-clan in the same area a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the two sides are moving around in the capital
today to contain the hostility from spreading to the capital.
</P>
<P>
Other neutral sub-clans and religious groups in south
Mogadishu are also trying to play a mediatory role in an effort
to stop clashes which might jeopardize the relative peace which
Mogadishu has been enjoying nowadays.

<HEADLINE> Grant Aid to Nepal Down, Loans Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Grant aid to Nepal is going
down while loans are increasing, the ACTIONAID, an England-based
charity,
said in a press release on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The grant component of foreign aid to Nepal has fallen from
74.1 percent of the total aid in 1975-76 to 33.8 percent (about
246 million U.S. dollars) in 1995-96, the press release said,
quoting a study conducted by the ACTIONAID in collaboration with
other organizations.
</P>
<P>
This implies an increasing debt burden on future generations of
Nepalese, the press release added.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed a large gap between commitments and
disbursements by donor countries. Between 1991-92 and 1995-96,
bilateral aid disbursements accounted for less than 50 percent of
the committed amounts, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral aid to Nepal has been declining from 65.4 percent of
the total in 1975-76 to 42.4 percent in 1985-86 and to 24.7
percent (about 61 million dollars) in 1995-96, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
Though the social sector in Nepal has been receiving more
attention from both donors and governments in recent times, the
priority accorded to this sector remains inadequate, the press
release noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1995-96, transport, power and communication received the
highest proportion of foreign assistance (56.4 percent), followed
by agriculture, irrigation and forestry (23.8 percent) and social
services (18.4 percent), the press release said.
</P>
<P>
International non-governmental organizations provide only 5
percent of the total development assistance to Nepal, but the
volume of their aid shows an increasing trend, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
ACTIONAID works with children, families and communities to
improve the quality of life in some of the poorest parts of the
world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Securities Market on-track for Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Following rapid expansion, the
Chinese securities market has provided strong support this year
for the restructuring of state-owned enterprises and intensified
its functions to raise funds and reorganize state assets.
</P>
<P>
Giving top priority to key state-supported enterprises is a
salient feature of the expansion of the Chinese stock market this
year, said Zhang Bingxun, a noted securities expert in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 1,220 key state-owned large enterprises or
enterprise groups, almost 40 percent have been listed on the stock
market so far. The recent listing of some exceedingly large
companies such as the Gezhouba Dam, China Eastern Airlines,
Shanghai Auto are best indications of the prominent role the
market plays in aiding the restructuring of state companies and
basic industries.
</P>
<P>
China listed a total of 185 types of A shares, 15 types B
shares, and another 19 types overseas shares during the
January-November period, raising a total of 147.734 billion yuan
through the stock issues and additional stock placement of the
listed companies, almost 3.3 times the amount for the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
"The stock market, as a major part of the securities market,
has not only raised for the listed companies over 250 billion yuan
in the past seven years, but also rid the companies of their heavy
dependence on bank loans, and enabled them to orient themselves
with the market need," according to Zhang Bingxun.
</P>
<P>
A State Planning Commission official shared Zhang's view by
hailing the securities market as an indispensable part of the
Chinese market economy. "Aside from the stock market, the
corporate bond and convertible bond markets have also provided
backing for the enterprise reform," he said, pointing out the
government's determination to further foster the two kinds of
markets to help with the fund-deficient state companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the national conference on economic restructuring,
China will take effective measures next year to expand its capital
market, and make "new breakthroughs" in the direct fund-raising,
or pooling funds from the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists forecast that thousands of billions of
capital is needed to back the reform of the state enterprises in
its crucial stage and relocate the state assets, which also
signals substantial space for the expansion of the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese enterprises need to go through massive redistribution
of the state assets in the next few years, to pull themselves out
their current financial difficulty, said Xiao Zhuoji, a noted
economist with Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"The redistribution can only materialize through enterprise
acquisition, mergers, and bankruptcy, and the securities market,
where state assets can change hands through stock trading and
transfer of stock rights, will provide ideal backing for the
expansion of the best-performers," added Xiao.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the securities market will not serve only as a
fund-raising place for state companies, it will also serve to
expedite the relocation of the state assets.
</P>
<P>
"The upsurge of the relocation of state assets since the 15th
CPC National Congress has best proved that the trend is
inevitable," stressed Xiao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 133 listed companies have released public
statements between January and September for mergers, acquisition,
and transfer of stock rights, with the total amount soaring to 107
between October and November alone.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda's UPE Program Bears Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Shangzhi)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The successful implementation
of universal primary education (UPE) program in Uganda for the
first academic year has brought enrollment in primary schools
from the original 2.4 million a year ago to 5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Fagil Mandy, Chairman of the UPE Implementation Committee and
Deputy Commissioner for Education has said that a recent poll
showed there were almost no dropouts.
</P>
<P>
The UPE program, was announced last December by the government
in a bid to raise the cultural level of Ugandans to eliminate mass
poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the government provides free primary
education for four children per family in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the program, the government has
increased education budget in spite of national financial
constraints.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure on education leapt from 125.5 billion Uganda
Shillings (about 110 million U.S. dollars) in 1995-1996 financial
year to 193 billion Uganda Shillings in 1997-1998, said a report
by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
International organisations and foreign donors including the
World Bank and some European countries have pledged some 80
million U.S. Dollars in support of the program.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the education quality, there are only three things
needed: the teacher, class rooms and instructional materials
(text books)," said Francis Babu, State Minister for Education.
</P>
<P>
Babu claimed that 2.3 million text books worth of 15 billion
Shillings have been procured and distributed to schools all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government launched a drive to
to recruit 40,000 teachers to meet the big influx of pupils, and
more than 33,700 teachers have been on the list of the teachers
ranks up to date.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry said in a report that more than
40.400 iron sheets and 12,210 bags of cement have been
distributed to 29 of the total 45 districts in the country
between August and November this year for the construction of
class rooms.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision, a leading newspaper in Uganda noted recently
that all in all, UPE has scored some success but a lot still needs
to be done especially in the training and recruitment of
teachers, construction of classrooms and procurement of
furniture.
</P>
<P>
" When we decided to go for UPE there were a lot of doubts but
we decided to go on," said Amarya Mushega, minister of education.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's United National
Independence Party (UNIP) announced here Thursday its withdrawal
from the proposed inter-party dialogue soon after its leader,
former President Kenneth Kaunda was detained by police earlier
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted UNIP Chairman Malimba Masheke
as telling a press briefing that UNIP central committee held
an emergency meeting and made the decision to pull out.
</P>
<P>
"We can not participate in the talks because we feel we are
being held at gun point by the government. In our view this is
not the best circumstances in which we can talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda immediately went on hunger strike after his detention,
his press aide Muhabi Lungu said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, National Congress Party President Hichunga Kambaila
was quoted by the state-run newspaper as saying on Thursday that
the continued arrests of political leaders is not conducive to
the spirit of reconciliation which is being fostered in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Kaunda and Zambia Democratic Congress President
Dean Mung'omba, he added, do not argue well with the continued
efforts in trying to bring about inter-party talks to be attended
by party presidents to discuss the contentious issues facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Kambaila could not say whether the recent detentions
will affect his party's participation in the talks due to be held
on January 10 next year.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda returned home on Monday after a marathon overseas trip
which took him to India, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the United
States and Britain, among other countries.
</P>
<P>
He went abroad on the eve of the October 28 abortive coup in
Zambia to seek international pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
After the coup, some reports said Kaunda would not return home
for fear of being arrested and would instead seek asylum abroad
but he denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary meeting held early this month, 31 parties
drew an agenda for the inter-party dialogue. The agenda includes
most contentious issues like constitution, electoral process and
voters' register and fresh registration.

<HEADLINE> Ecosystem of World Largest Mangrove Forest Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The ecosystem of the world's
largest mangrove forest is being ravaged both by natural
calamities and pilferage of forest resources, press reports here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Called the Sundarbans, the mangrove forest is situated in
Bangladesh's southwest district of Khulna, 140 kilometers
southwest of here. It covers an area of 5,800 square kilometers on
the fringe of the Bay of Bengal and accounts for 44 percent of the
total reserve forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the major sources of timber as well as a charming
tourist resort, the Sundarbans will however soon lose its
significance if the attacks on its flora and fauna go unchecked,
the reports quoted environmentalists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ecologists, officials and local people now see certain
imbalance in the forest and its environs, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
They attributed it to rampant tree felling, hunting, fishing,
unplanned construction of roads and embankments, increased
salinity in rivers, canals and marshes and natural calamities like
cyclones.
</P>
<P>
Protection and proper maintenance of this forest from
destruction even at this stage are being hampered allegedly for
shortage of manpower and infrastructure as well as irregularities
on the part of some foresters, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The existence of the famous Sundari tree has also been
endangered by widespread pest attack on the tree top, some experts
noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country now suffers more natural calamities,
especially cyclones, experts said.
</P>
<P>
They strongly recommend the introduction of "eco-tourism' with
an eco-friendly infrastructure for saving the Sundarbans.

The government has promised to announce the 1998 budget at the
end of this year, which will be one to two months earlier than
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Apex Bank, which gets the government approval to attain
the one dollar to 75 Naira mark at the end of this year, had
began appreciating the value of Naira by at least five Naira in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
It has become a usual thing that Naira appreciates around the
end of a year because of the inflow of big amount of foreign
exchange with the return of many Nigerians from abroad before
Yuletide.
</P>
<P>
The Naira then begins to fall about two months into the new
year when demand for foreign exchange starts rising after the
effect of the returned foreign money waded.
</P>
<P>
Thus market analysts believe the current rate would put some
pressure on the national currency in the new year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sends Delegation to Iraq for More Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian delegation left here
this morning for Baghdad, expecting to reach an agreement under
which Jordan will get a 7 percent increase of oil supply from Iraq
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was the first sent by Jordan to Baghdad since
bilateral ties strained this month due to Iraq's execution of five
Jordanians on charges of smuggling car parts into Iraq. Jordan
expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the group is to secure a 7 percent increase of
oil supply from Iraq next year, a decrease in oil prices as well
as more free-of-charge oil, according to Jordan's Energy and
Mineral Resources Minister Mohammed Saleh Hourani who headed the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The increase was needed due to rising economic activities and
population growth, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is currently importing between 75,000 and 80,000 barrels
of crude every day from Baghdad under a 1997 bilateral trade
protocol signed within the framework of the U.N.-Iraqi
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal signed a year ago, Iraq can export 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months for
humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Food and medicine, among other things, are in severe short
supply in an Iraq reeling from the crippling U.N. sanctions
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. allows Jordan to continue receiving oil supply from
Iraq because the kingdom has no other sources of oil supply.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was to provide Jordan with 4.5 million tonnes of oil and
oil products this year valued at 625 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 300 million dollars worth of oil was provided
free of charge and the rest at 19.10 dollars per barrel, a price
much lower than that on the international market earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In return, Jordan supplied Iraq with food and medicine worth
255 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> No Bird Flu Cases Reported in Hong Kong's Neighbor City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's neighbor city of
Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at
its 200 poultry farms, according to a local official in charge of
animal epidemics.
</P>
<P>
"There is no report of H5N1 cases among chickens so far, so
eating chickens is safe," Zhao Changwang, director of the Shenzhen
Institute of Veterinary Epidemic Prevention, told Shenzhen
citizens today.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the H5N1 virus has not been found in 15,000 chicken
blood samples that were taken randomly throughout Guangdong
Province, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens,
apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong. The virus
is believed to be transmitted through contact with birds or their
feces.
</P>
<P>
Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long
period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent
years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms. Zhao
said that procedures for breeding and transporting poultry are
always under intensive monitoring to avoid an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines
confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among
chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Yu Dahai, director of the Administration of Animal and Plant
Quarantine under the Ministry of Agriculture, said he was
satisfied with the disease control measures adopted by poultry
farms and ports in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such
as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms,
said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 122 Injured During Christmas in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and 44
others hospitalized in the Philippines due to various degrees of
firecrackers-related injuries and stray bullets incidents on
Christmas Day, the Department of Health reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the department's anti-firecracker campaign registry at
the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center (JRRMMC), it said, the
total number of people injured due to firecrackers use and victims
of indiscriminate firing of guns nationwide during this year's
holidays now total 124, including two deaths.
</P>
<P>
The registry covers 34 Metro Manila and regional hospitals, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 44 people who were hospitalized Thursday, the department
said, 39 suffered firecrackers-related injuries while the other
five were victims of stray bullets.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed by stray bullets, it added.
</P>
<P>
Saddened by the reports of firecrackers injuries and stray
bullets wounds and deaths, Health Secretary Carmencita N. Reodica
Friday strongly called on Filipinos to use noise-making devices,
instead of firecrackers and the indiscriminate firing of guns.
</P>
<P>
No one should get hurt by the indiscriminate firing of guns and
irresponsible use of firecrackers, Reodica said.

MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Soviet forward Vladimir
Gutsayev was appointed to take the helm of the national soccer
squad of Georgia, the Georgian soccer federation said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
David Kvinikadez, secretary general of the soccer federation,
said Gutsayev, 45, has trained Georgia's under-21 team for the

</P>

"He has great authority among Georgian players, is a high class
professional and has excellent personal qualities which make it
easy for him to communicate with the players," Kvinikadze said.
</P>
<P>
From 1971 to 1986, Gutsayev played for Dynamo Tbilisi and made
several appearances for the Soviet national side.
</P>
<P>
Gutsayev replaced David Kipiani who resigned in October, a few
days before Georgia's last World Cup qualifier against Poland.

<HEADLINE> Pak Opposition Party to Boycott Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A major opposition party in
Pakistan announced on Friday to boycott the country's presidential
elections scheduled for December 31.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Muslim League (Junejo) (PML-J) has made the decision
because "the ruling party has not kept in mind the 'priorities of
Federation' while nominating its presidential candidate," PML-J
Central Information Secretary Muhy-ud-Din said in a statement
issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This move, he said, was taken to restore the "damaged image of
the Federation."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government's decision to nominate former
justice Rafiq Tarar from the country's largest Punjab Province as
its official presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The government should have opted for somebody from a smaller
province as stated by some leaders of the ruling party Pakistan
Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) before the final decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PML-J official said another reason for boycotting the
elections was that Pakistan People's Party (PPP) during its second
tenure had also been violating the demands of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
It was therefore not possible for PML(J) to vote for PPP while
opposing the PML-N candidate, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Election Commission first rejected the nomination
papers of the PML-N nominee, Rafiq Tarar, on December 18 due to
his alleged remarks against the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
However, the commission included Rafiq in its final list of
presidential candidates after the Lahore High Court overturned the
commission's rejection. Lahore is the provincial capital of
Punjab.
</P>
<P>
The presidential post was vacated after the resignation of
President Farooq Leghari early this month at the climax of
Pakistan's worst ever constitutional crisis.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Unsatisfied with Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Friday in his weekly radio address expressed dissatisfaction with
the country's economic performance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying it is
evident to most people that economic successes are few in the
outgoing year.
</P>
<P>
"The daily life of many of our citizens is still
difficult. People reasonably complain of the slow pace of
reforms," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, "we will correct our mistakes and learn the
lessons" to improve the economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that a main achievement in 1997 is
the dialogues between confrontation sides. In his opinion,
dialogue has replaced stand-off in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Now matters are fought out not in streets but at the
negotiating table. Not political fanatics are debating but those
who know how to work," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president said that there are few
businessmen who "care for social problems of their employees,
create new jobs, do charity".
</P>
<P>
That is why the image of the Russian businessman is not very
attractive for Russians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called on Russian businessmen to learn again how to
live together and share concerns.

<P>
At the end of 1996, Chi Haotian visited the United States. This
year there have been more active military exchanges between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that exchanges of high-level visits between China and
the United States have been frequent, and dialogue channels have
been kept open. The two sides have reached consensus on some
issues and concrete results on others.
</P>
<P>
The China-U.S. agreement on establishing a marine security
consultation mechanism was reached after several rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
Active military exchanges have played an important role in
helping deepen mutual understanding and trust between armed forces
of the two nations and pushed the development of bilateral
relationship on a stable and sound road, Chi pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the United
States this fall, the two countries decided to make joint efforts
to establish a Sino-U.S. constructive strategic partnership, thus
opening new prospects for the development of bilateral military
relations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Exporters to Benefit from Korean Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian exporters would
benefit from a multi-billion dollar bailout package for the ailing
South Korean economy, Federal Treasurer Peter Costello said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen industrialized economies have announced plans to
contribute nearly 8 billion U.S. dollars to South Korea. The
Australian government would contribute nearly 330 million U.S.
dollars to the first tranche of the package, which was expected by
the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is making this loan as part of an international
effort because it's in our interest to stabilize the situation in
Korea," Costello told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"Korea is a very important trading partner for Australia and to
stabilize the financial situation and try to put Korea back on the
path to stability and growth is very much in the interest of our
exporters, and in the interests of the Australian economy."
</P>
<P>
The treasurer said, "On the whole a downturn in Korea, and this
is a very severe downturn in Korea, will have an effect on the
Australian economy and will make it harder for our exporters in
the future years."
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had already announced a
57 billion U.S. dollars bailout after South Korea was engulfed by
the financial turmoil sweeping South-East Asia since July.
</P>
<P>
Costello described the situation in South Korea as "very
serious" and said this was the largest bailout in world history
led by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
In return the South Korean government has promised to
accelerate substantive economic reforms designed to return the
economy to a sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
"If they can accomplish the changes and return their economy to
stability it's got long-term growth potential, and long-term
growth potential is good for Australia," he said.

information processing system for Tibetan culture.
</P>
<P>
The system is expected to be connected with the Internet after
it is patented.
</P>

folk epic, compiling of the lunar calendar used by Tibetan people,
Tibetan medicines, administration of Tibetan-Han bilingual
schools and basic data of the economic growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language will become the first Chinese ethnic
language that has an international standard code which enables it

<HEADLINE> More Than 640000 Guns Surrendered in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 640,000 guns have
been surrendered under the national buyback scheme instituted in
reaction to the Port Arthur massacre 20-month ago, local newspaper
Daily Telegraph reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the final figure of 643,238, released nearly
three months after the October 1 deadline, constituted enough guns
to arm 11 Australian armies.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 315 million Australian dollars (208 million U.S.
dollars) had been paid to the former owners of the surrendered
weapons, leaving the federal government with an expected 170
million Australian Dollars (112 million U.S. dollars) surplus from
the 0.2 percentage point increase in the Medicare levy that funded
the buyback scheme, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales (NSW) Shooters Party, John Tingle was
quoted as saying the buyback had been a total failure, with vast
numbers of shooters flouting new laws which include a fine and up
to 10 years' jail for possession of banned firearms.
</P>
<P>
But NSW Police Minister Paul Whelan said he was happy with the
outcome, which showed the community's attitude to guns had shifted
markedly since the Port Arthur massacre which caused 35 peoples
killed.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Pessimistic Over U.S. Mediating Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has cast doubt over the chances of U.S. mediation between the
Palestinians and Israelis to overcome the crisis in the Mideast
peace peace.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Al Ahram newspaper to mark the new year,
Mubarak wished the meetings U.S. President Bill Clinton expects to
hold with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in January
would lead to positive results.
</P>
<P>
But in fact, "we should not count much on the results of such
meeting despite President Clinton's attempts to push forward the
peace process," the paper quoted Mubarak as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposed summits came as rounds of shuttle diplomacy by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to bring Netanyahu and
Arafat closer with each other early this month foundered.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he also disagreed with a delegation from the
U.S. Congress that "spoke about chances of peace if Israel pulled
out from a small part of the West Bank" during a visit to Egypt
last week.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal should be from a large part and it is not a matter
of small or large percentages, but (rather) the rights of the
Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The area of the West Bank and Gaza does not exceed 23 percent
of the Palestinian territories," he told the Arabic-language
paper, it is difficult for the Palestinian people to accept such a
status.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has deadlocked since March over the
Israeli construction of Jewish settlement in Arab land and its
long overdue withdrawal from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the current situation on the Palestinian peace
track is very complicated and it could get tougher, as the Likud
government has failed to honor the U.S.-sponsored agreements
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that the Israeli government and the Likud did
not even respect the accords the Likud itself had previously
concluded with the Palestinians," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Seizing land will never provide security but will lead to "just
the opposite," he warned, adding that failure to reach a lasting
peace agreement will trigger off exchanged violence.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd to hold on to the wrong principle of gaining both
land and peace," he emphasized, referring to Israel's stance on
ceding a small percentage of occupied land in the West Bank in
return for peace with the Palestinians.

<P>
But in fact, "we should not count much on the results of such
meeting despite President Clinton's attempts to push forward the
peace process," the paper quoted Mubarak as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposed summits came as rounds of shuttle diplomacy by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to bring Netanyahu and
Arafat closer with each other early this month foundered.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he also disagreed with a delegation from the
U.S. Congress that "spoke about chances of peace if Israel pulled
out from a small part of the West Bank" during a visit to Egypt
last week.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal should be from a large part and it is not a matter
of small or large percentages, but (rather) the rights of the
Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The area of the West Bank and Gaza does not exceed 23 percent
of the Palestinian territories," he told the Arabic-language
paper, it is difficult for the Palestinian people to accept such a
status.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has deadlocked since March over the
Israeli construction of Jewish settlement in Arab land and its
long overdue withdrawal from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the current situation on the Palestinian peace
track is very complicated and it could get tougher, as the Likud
government has failed to honor the U.S.-sponsored agreements
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that the Israeli government and the Likud did
not even respect the accords the Likud itself had previously
concluded with the Palestinians," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Seizing land will never provide security but will lead to "just
the opposite," he warned, adding that failure to reach a lasting
peace agreement will trigger off exchanged violence.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd to hold on to the wrong principle of gaining both
land and peace," he emphasized, referring to Israel's stance on
ceding a small percentage of occupied land in the West Bank in
return for peace with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> China's Military Diplomacy Unprecedentedly Active in 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Featuring high-level military
contacts, more military contacts with important nations, more
China tours by foreign military leaders and increasing
multi-nation military diplomatic exchanges, China's military
diplomacy has been unprecedentedly active in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was the viewpoint of Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, State Councillor and Minister of
National Defense, in an article today in the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) earnestly
implemented an independent foreign policy of peace and a national
defense policy which is defensive in nature, Chi said in his
article.
</P>
<P>
Describing the world's accelerating multi-polarization and deep
readjustments in the relations between big powers, Chi reaffirmed
that the need for peace and cooperation and the promotion of
development has been the mainstream of the times, as international
security continues its momentum toward overall detente.
</P>
<P>
However, regional conflicts occur from time to time because of
post-Cold War issues such as nationality, religion, territory and
resources which make the world unstable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Military readjustments in various countries, Chi wrote, are
continuing to deepen and the world's rapid high-technology
development is triggering a series of deep reforms in military
areas.
</P>
<P>
Most nations of the world are forming a new security
perspective which stands for mutual respect and benefit on equal
footing, and increasing trust through dialogue and consultations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that following the formation and development of
this new perspective, various countries are paying increasing
attention to their military diplomacy, which is playing a more
important role in improving international relations and security.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Chi wrote, the PLA has played host to 150
military delegations from 67 countries, including 23 groups led by
deputy prime ministers and defense ministers, a 64 percent
increase over that of 1996, and 50 groups headed by commanders of
foreign armed forces, chiefs of general staff or deputy defense
ministers.

<HEADLINE> 48 more Kenyans Die of Severe Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 48 more Kenyans died
of severe malaria in the last two days in Wajir District in
Northeastern Province, bringing the death toll to 217 in the past
two weeks in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation today quoted the provincial medical officer,
Abdi Hassan, as confirming the deaths and saying that health
conditions in Wajir had deteriorated for lack of medical
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Abdi Hassan said that dysentery and malaria were largely
responsible for the deaths, adding that actual deaths might be
higher as some areas were cut of due to heavy rains in the past
two months.
</P>
<P>
A urgent response team of experts have been sent to the
province by Kenyan Ministry of Health and World Health
Organization and other international medical organizations to
investigate the disease.
</P>
<P>
Although tests have identified the disease as severe malaria,
Kenyan Director of Medical Service, James Mwanzia, said on
Wednesday that conclusive tests would be carried out both locally
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The disease manifests itself in vomitting, diarrhoea and
bleeding.

<HEADLINE> China to Report Major Cities' Air Quality to Whole Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to issue a weekly
report of air quality in some major cities through a number of
national media beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
The air reports of 13 major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai
and Wuhan have been carried in local media since May. East China's
Hangzhou was added to the list today.
</P>
<P>
The China Environmental News will be the first national media
to give air reports for all 13 cities early next year, followed by
the Central People's Broadcasting Station.
</P>
<P>
Some other large national media are also planning to carry the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report will give the cities' air quality to the public
through an atmospheric pollution index, which includes three
items: sulfur dioxide, chemical compounds of oxygen and nitrogen,
and the amount of suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yangzu, deputy-director of the National Environmental
Protection Agency, said that to publicize air quality is an
important measure for the government in tightening environmental
management and enhancing pollution-control efforts to protect the
public's health.
</P>
<P>
"It will also enable the public to supervise the government's
anti-pollution efforts," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Sources reveal that 10 cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Hangzhou and Chongqing will issue a daily air-quality report next
year.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian maxi Brindabella
took the lead shortly after the start of the 53rd Sydney-to-Hobart
yacht race on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brindabella broke clear shortly after a congested start at 1.00
p.m.local time (0200 GMT) and led from two of the best
international yachts in the 115-strong fleet, Swedish maxi
Nicorette and Hong Kong-registered pocket maxi Exile.
</P>
<P>
George Snow's Brindabella started as a firm favourite to win
the 630 nautical mile race south along Australia's east coast.
</P>
<P>
Brindabella has failed to live up to her considerable
reputation in recent years, twice finishing only second across the
Hobart finish line and twice withdrawing with broken gear in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
Brindabella and the other leading boats will attempt to break
the race record of two days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10

record, boats must finish by 3.07 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Monday.

<P>
MACAO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A top Macao security official
called 1997 a "quite black year" as the number of murdering cases
rose remarkably this year, the Macao Daily News reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least 25 people were murdered in 1997 in Macao, up seven
people from the figure last year. The newspaper said it was the
worst year in seven years in terms murdering cases.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Baptista, director of the Judicial Police Department,
described the security situation in 1997 in that way earlier this
month. He also admitted that violent crimes increased this year.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 cases of gold shop armed robbery have been recorded
since May this year, involving an estimated 14 million patacas
(1.75 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition, there were about 150 cases of arson, some 70
percent of which involved setting fire to vehicles. More than 200
cars and motorcycles were either burnt or damaged.
</P>
<P>
Macao security officials said earlier this year that although
there were problems with the security, the situation was not so
serious as being reported by some media. Officials complained
media reports as being "exaggerated."

<HEADLINE> Israel Air Force Recruits Women into Combat Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in
history the Israel Air Force (IAF) permitted female soldiers to be
assigned to its combat units, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that some 30 IAF female recruits are slated to
participate in next summer's anti-aircraft defense course after
basic training and those who pass the test will be assigned to
Patriot and Hawk missile batteries.
</P>
<P>
But such batteries are usually stationary and far from a war
front. The mobile Chaparral missile and other anti-aircraft units
are still closed to women.
</P>
<P>
"Girls should be treated no differently from boys, and if they
can go to the pilots' course there is no reason not to integrate
them in the anti-aircraft units," Gilad Ramot, Israel Air Defense
Commander, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
These women recruits will be required to undergo basic combat
training, but in a separate platoon from the men. And the demands
will be identical to those of the combat course that men go
through and will include weapons training and combat
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
However, some physical demands may be modified, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Adi Bershdetzki, head of the IAF planning branch, said women
who volunteer for service at anti-aircraft batteries will be
required to serve until they are 34. Those who want to become
officers will have to do an extra three years of duty "just like
the boys," he added.

<HEADLINE> United Opposition in Philippines Breaks up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nationalist People's
Coalition (NPC) in the Philippines announced here Friday that it
has decided to stay out of the united opposition in the country --
the Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (LAMMP)-- for good.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, Senate President Ernesto
Maceda, NPC president, said the overwhelming majority of the NPC
Central Committee have supported his initiative to back out of its
merger with the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino and the Partido ng
Masang Pilipino (PMP).
</P>
<P>
The NPC, along with Laban and PMP, merged months ago to present
a united opposition before the voting public in the 1998
elections. The product of such a merger is the LAMMP.
</P>
<P>
But Maceda said recently that the NPC was suspending any
participation in the LAMMP political affairs as his party was left
out in the negotiations between Vice-President Joseph Estrada, PMP
chairman, and Senator Edgardo Angara, Laban chairman, over teaming
up in the May 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Estrada and Angara convinced the
latter to give up his presidential ambition to be the
Vice-President's running mate in the 1998 elections, to give LAMMP
a greater chance of winning in the polls.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Maceda justified his decision to take his
party out of LAMMP, saying "it is absolutely necessary to keep the
NPC separate from LAMMP to protect our local candidates who, even
now, are being elbowed out by Senator Edgardo Angara's proteges at
the provincial, city and municipal levels."
</P>
<P>
"Senator Nikki Coseteng, 20 NPC congressmen and four NPC
governors have agreed to fully support" his leadership of the
Senate and his decision to keep the NPC intact, Maceda said.
</P>
<P>
But Maceda's critics are claiming the senate president is
merely using the negotiations between Estrada and Angara as an
excuse to leave the united opposition, and move to the ruling
Lakas-NUCD (National Union for Christian Democrats).
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Maceda was being eyed as the ruling
party's mayoralty candidate for the city of Manila in the local
elections in 1998. Some Lakas leaders also said they have a
standing offer for Maceda to be the campaign manager of Speaker
Jose de Venecia, the ruling party's presidential candidate.

TIANJIN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest port city
in north China, had attracted 517 million US dollars of
overseas investment for its agriculture during the first 11 months
of this year, a year-on-year increase of 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
By now, the city has established 2,759 foreign-funded enterprises in
rural areas, involving 3.4 billion US dollars. Influx of overseas
fund has contributed greatly to the city's rural economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has a rural population of some four million

that before the country's reform and opening up drive began in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Improved investment environment has in turn lured more
overseas investors, especially multinational corporations.
Motorola, for example, is building a large electronics business in
the city, with more than 700 million US dollars of
investment.

<P>
JINAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers with the Shandong
Provincial Academy of Sciences have developed a technology
to gasify straws for cooking.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has made great efforts to spread the
the technology in its rural areas. A total of 50 straw
gasification demonstration centers have been built in a dozen
counties of the province, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Mutun Village, in Yanzhou City, has invested 500,000 yuan in
building a straw gasification station.
</P>
<P>
The station produces 400 cu m of gas per hour and can send it
to as far as 600 m away. Due to its construction, some 100
households in the village have no longer depended on burning
straws for cooking, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong Provincial Government has planned to add 100 new
straw gasification demonstration stations annually in the coming
years and strive to have 350 such stations by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The technology has also been listed by the State Commission of

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Abolishing Credit Quota Represents Major Banking Reform Step (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The latest reform measure of
the Chinese government on its commercial banks was hailed by the
People's Daily today as a major step in accelerating and deepening
the country's financial reform.
</P>
<P>
China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBC),
announced on Thursday that starting January 1, the credit quota
ceiling system governing state-owned commercial banks will be
abandoned, while a new system of balance and risk management will
gradually be put in place.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried in today's People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, said this is a critical effort in furthering
the country's financial reform as well as a major transition in
macro-economic controls.
</P>
<P>
"This reform effort will help promote the establishment of a
modern financial enterprise system by state-owned commercial banks
and will exert a significant impact on the construction of a
socialist market economy," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The credit quota system, which China has been pursuing, has
played an active role in controlling the money supply, channeling
funds to key state construction projects and promoting industrial
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
However, the article said that since the mid-1980s China's
economic and financial systems have experienced substantial
changes. The unitary state banking system has gradually been
replaced by a variety of financial institutions. The capital
market has also developed rapidly in the 1990s with more and more
enterprises going to securities markets to raise funds. In
addition, with the expansion of China's opening drive, the changes
in foreign currency assets have had an increasingly significant
impact on domestic money supply.
</P>
<P>
Under these conditions, solely monitoring the credit volume of
state-owned banks instead of monitoring the money supply in a
comprehensive way will not objectively reflect the monetary
payment ability of the whole society, making it impossible to
reach macro-economic control targets. These changes in economic
and financial fields require corresponding reforms in the credit
management system.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Abolishing Credit Quota Represents Major Banking Reform Step (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary said the time is ripe to phase out the credit
quota ceiling system on state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1993, related decisions made by the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council empowered
the central bank to regulate money supply with monetary policy
tools such as interest rates and open market operations instead of
mainly relying on credit quota management.
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal in an active and safe way, the PBC made
long-term and earnest preparations in conjunction with related
departments and financial institutions, and strengthened
statistical analysis and study of money supply. Since the third
quarter of 1994, the PBC has been publishing the money-supply
condition on a quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, interest rates have been adjusted and
new monetary measures have been initiated; the transition from
direct monetary control to indirect monetary control has been
stepped up. The PBC has gradually abolished credit quota
controls on cooperative monetary institutions, share-holding
commercial banks and other commercial banks. By 1997 the credit
quota ceiling system only governed state-owned commercial banks
and the three policy-oriented banks.
</P>
<P>
To date, China's policy-oriented financing and commercial
financing businesses have been separated, related financial laws
have been gradually implemented, state-owned commercial banks
further strengthened self-discipline and internal control,
macro-economic controls have resulted in a "soft landing", and the
trend of the national economy has been developing well. All these
have provided necessary conditions for reform.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that after the scrapping of the credit
quota system, all commercial banks should actively organize funds
to support economic development, it should not affect the support
for enterprises' reasonable loan demands, and should not affect
the implementation of the state's policies on industrial and
regional development.
</P>
<P>
The commentary expressed confidence in that, with concerted
efforts of related departments, the latest reform measure will
surely be carried out successfully, and the monetary regulation
will surely show new improvement.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Reduce Number of Military Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government plans to
reduce the country's number of commissioned military officers
while increasing that of noncommissioned officers.
</P>
<P>
Under the program announced by the Defense Ministry, a big
increase will be in the number of noncommissioned officers
recruited under a voluntary military service system.
</P>
<P>
Designed to prepare Poland for its entry into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1999, the restructuring is
expected to turn the military into a more professional force.
</P>
<P>
Once complete, the program will bring down the proportion of
commissioned officers among the overall military staff from the
current 48 percent to eventual 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportion of noncommissioned officers will go
up from 19 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
And by 2004, the number of professional soldiers in the Polish
military is projected to go up from 83,000 to 90,000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the program's first stage, Defense Minister
Janusz Onyszkiewicz said earlier, the military will be downsized
to 180,000, and at least 200 of the more than 400 generals will
retire.

<HEADLINE> Birds Garden Established in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Hearing a whistle of a trainer,
more than 70 peacocks fly to the tourists to dance from their
habitat far away. And with another whistle, they go back.
</P>
<P>
That is a birds performance in the Birds Garden in the National
Forest Park in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The garden, covering an area of 1.7 hectares, has around 3,000
birds in 100 species from all over the world. Some rare species
are from Australia and Africa, according to Lin Zengyan, manager
of the garden.
</P>
<P>
Lin said, it is the largest garden of birds in China in terms
of both numbers and varieties.
</P>
<P>
The garden attracts thousands of tourists from at home and abroad
each day.
</P>
<P>
In the garden, birds are everywhere. They are taking rest,
playing, singing, or flying. It is realy a kingdom of birds.
</P>
<P>
Tourists, after buying some food, can enjoy feeding the
birds.
</P>
<P>
The most attractive, however, is to talk with the birds. A
myna named Liangliang can say "hello", "sit down, please", "good
luck" to the tourists. Liangliang, from Xisha Islands, can also
imitate the sounds of cocks, hens, ducks, cats, dogs and even sing
"the East is Red", a Chinese revolutionary song.
</P>
<P>
Lots of shows are performed every day. Some are really
funny, such as parrots kissing the tourists, casting a ball into a
basket and pulling a cart.

<HEADLINE> Expanding Airlines Spark off Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Fast-expanding airliner fleets
and slow rises in demand have sparked a price war among China's 34
airlines, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Airlines across China have placed firm orders for 101 aircraft
with international aircraft manufacturers this year and have
received 48 new planes in line with purchase and leasing
contracts.
</P>
<P>
But the air freight market has not been as brisk as
expected. Since the Civil Aviation Administration of
China(CAAC) lifted restrictions on ticket rate ceilings in October,
nearly all the airlines have offered a variety of fare discounts
to grab increasingly price-conscious passengers and cargo clients.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the sellers' market of the past decade is
shifting towards a buyers' market as a result of the sharp
increase in the quantity of aircraft and a dramatic rise in the
number of airlines.
</P>
<P>
Some domestic airlines have been forced to combine to lower
costs and reduce operational risks in view of the intense
competition from operators undercutting each other.
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared to improve competitiveness through cutting
ticket rates," said Gao Junyue, president of Shenzhen Airlines,
and spokesman for the newly founded New Star Aviation Alliance,
which is made up of six local airlines.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, forged in September, ranks fourth in China
after three large operators. It has 5,800 staff and more than 50
aircrafts.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the formation of internationally competitive
aviation groups," said Xia Xinhua, director of the restructuring
department under the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
"New Star's alliance has set a good example for other aircraft
operators," Xia said, adding that Air China, Eastern Airlines and
Southern Airlines are considering taking concrete steps in this
direction.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Captures 55 Percent of Jetliner Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Boeing this year has
received orders for 566 commercial jet aircraft, 55 percent of the
world airline orders.
</P>
<P>
Among the orders are 15 jet airliners to be made by the former
McDonnell Douglas Company, which became Boeing's Douglas Products
Division last August.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's sole rival, Airbus Industries of Europe, has won
orders for 461 passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is expected to finish this year with 53.7 percent of the
market share worldwide, falling short of its goal of capturing at
least 60 percent of the global commercial aircraft market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said this week, however, that he is
satisfied with the company's present market share. He noted that
other factors such as unannounced orders may alter the percentages.
</P>
<P>
Condit said Boeing may be even further ahead in the dollar
value of orders because it sold more costly aircraft such as the
Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
Orders for 109 smaller airplanes from United States airlines
have contributed to the increase of Airbus' market share, which
last year was 33 percent. But this does not necessarily mean the
European manufacturer is making significant long-term gains
against Boeing, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Boeing estimates it will deliver 505 airplanes next year, while
Airbus predicts it will deliver 220. That would give Boeing nearly
70 percent of the deliveries in 1998, not counting jets produced
by Douglas.
</P>
<P>
Asia's economic crisis will affect next year's order ratio,
analysts said. Slippages in orders from Asian carriers are
expected to hit both manufacturers in the months ahead, especially
affecting Boeing's earnings.
</P>
<P>
Although Boeing said no orders have been canceled, it
acknowledged this month that as many as 60 aircraft deliveries
could be delayed in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Excavation Found World Earliest Rice Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Latest excavation of the
site of an ancient city in Chengtoushan in central China's Hunan
Province convinced archaeologists that under the ruins of the city
wall lies a piece of rice field which could date some 6,500 years
back.
</P>
<P>
Traces of ridges, cracks and still water sediment on the field
surface, the rice leaves, and roots discovered in the soil, as
well as dried ponds and ditches for irrigation around the field,
all testify to the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery represents a breakthrough in the study of
China's rice planting history and ancient agriculture as a whole,"
said He Jiejun, director of Hunan Institute of Archaeology."It
might be the world's oldest rice field, plus the one discovered in
Jiangsu Province."
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also found tens of thousands of carbonized
grains of rice in the site of ancient man habitat about two
kilometers away. Study of the grains suggested that they are of
5,800 years old.
</P>
<P>
Director He said the findings throw doubt on the view that
rice planting was introduced from foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
"It gives strong evidence that rice planting originated from
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River," said he.
</P>
<P>
The excavation also found some wooden and bone objects and
earthenware. A wooden knife unearthened has well measured marks
on it and experts said that it might be the tool to make
earthenware.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists began to excavate the Chengtoushan ancient city
ruins in 1991. It belongs to the primitive society in southern
China between the period of Daxi Culture and Shijiahe Culture
about 6,500 to 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The earliest city ruins ever found in China, the Chengtoushan
site, together with a city moat, occupies 150,000 square
meters.

<HEADLINE> Performance of Indian Industry Remains Sluggish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua)-- The performance of India's
industrial sector continued to remain sliggish in the first
quarter of 1997-98 fiscal year (April 1, 1997-March 31, 1998),
said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report on Currency and
Finance, 1996-97, released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector with the highest weightage of 77.11
percent in the index of industrial production fared poorly in the
first quarter registering a low growth of 4.8 percent compared to
14.3 percent in the corresponding quarter of the preceding year.
The only sectors which recorded an accelerate growth were mining
and quarrying and the electricity generation sector.
</P>
<P>
There are no signs of any improvement in the industrial
activities in the second half of the current fiscal year. The
overall industrial growth recorded a lower growth of 4.7 percent
during the period April-August,1997, as compared with 11.2 percent
in the corresponding period of the preceding year, the RBI report
said.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of six infrastructure industries
(electricity, coal, salable steel, cement, petroleum crude and
petroleum refinery) for the first four months of 1997-98 showed a
marginally higher growth of 4.4 percent as compared with 4.0

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Budget Plan For Fiscal 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
endorsed a budget plan for fiscal year 1998, calling for a cut in
general expenditures for the first time in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
The plan, announced Thursday, calls for a 0.4 percent rise from
fiscal 1997, to 77,670 billion yen (597.5 billion U.S. dollars),
for the general-account budget in the year to start April 1.
</P>
<P>
The general expenditures, which are used to cover government
policy measures in the fiscal year, will drop 1.3 percent to
44,540 billion yen (342.6 billion dollars), Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The cut is mandated by the fiscal structural reform law binding
the government to set reduction targets on major spending items
and stop issuing deficit-covering bonds by the end of fiscal 2003.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the quantitative reduction targets, the government
optioned to cut public works-related expenditures by 7.8 percent
and those of official development assistance by 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget is trimmed 0.2 percent from fiscal 1997 to
4,940 billion yen (38 billion dollars), the first decline in the
defense outlays since the Defense Agency was created in 1954.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government more than doubled the allocation
requested by the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry for
subsidies to help rice growers cope with market liberalization
pledged under the Uruguay Round global trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan, approved at an extraordinary meeting of Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's cabinet, will be submitted to a
session of the ordinary Diet, Japanese parliament, in January.
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders in general welcomed the plan, saying
it is "fairly good" as a whole to reflect the government's efforts
to eliminate "sanctuaries" where spending cuts have long been
tabooed.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Economy Maintains Low-Speed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 is the
fourth year in South Africa's transformation from apartheid to
democracy and the second year of the implementation of the
government's "growth, employment and redistribution" (GEAR)
macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
In spite of difficulties left over from the apartheid system
and new problems stemming from transformation, South Africa's
economy maintained low-speed growth.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in the first nine months of the year was 1.8
percent, and that for the whole year is estimated at less than
two percent. This allows the new South Africa to maintain its
record of positive growth every year since its birth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the most adorable achievement of the government this year
might be the control of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year consumer inflation rate dropped to 6.8 percent in
November after the 9.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the producer's inflation dropped to its 26-year low
of 4.9 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
With the depreciation of the Rand, the government made efforts
to encourage exports and as a result, the country's trade surplus
was significantly built up. It jumped by 360 million U.S. Dollars
in October and by the end of November, it stood at 2.37 billion
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves, which reached 5.7 billion Dollars
by the end of October, were also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The government was successful in its control over budget
deficit, which was contained roughly within the target of four
percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank made a long-awaited move in October by
reducing its lending rate to commercial banks from 17 percent to
16 percent, helping build commercial confidence as there were
widespread expectations for new rate cuts next year.
</P>
<P>
Other moves made by the government to try to boost the economy
include privatization of state-owned enterprises and the
relaxation of foreign exchange control.
</P>
<P>
The government continued to invest heavily this year to
improve the living standards of the black majority.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic growth fell short of the 2.9 percent
target set up at the beginning of the year, let alone the
ambitious six percent required by GEAR.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for next year is not rosy either. South African
Chamber of Business predicted that GDP growth next year would be
about 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Poor employment situation dealt a heavy blow to GEAR, which
projected some 250,000 new jobs this year. Statistics showed that
instead of job creation, the country was losing jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to figures of the official Central Statistics
Service, employment shrank 1.5 percent sine June last year.
Joblessness among the African population was appalling with 47
percent of black women and 29 percent of black men believed to be
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Inflow of foreign investment was also below expectation, with
only 2.3 billion Dollars being pumped into the country for
November, as against the 4.6 to six billion Dollars required by
GEAR.
</P>
<P>
Crime and violence, which peaked in South Africa in the 1980s,
remained a big impediment to economic growth. After the all-race
general elections in 1994, violent crimes like murder, robbery
and rape were still out of control.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth is unlikely in a society ruled by
murderers, armed robbers, rapists as well as corrupt judicial
officials, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Certain policies of the government also served as adverse
factors to the economy. Labor policies under the pressure of
powerful trade unions pushed up labor prices that is unbearable
for enterprises, especially small-and-medium-sized enterprises.
High labor prices also hindered the inflow of foreign capital.
Certain labor legislation was also criticized by the business.
</P>
<P>
The South African government is exploring ways of correcting
various forms of unfairness left over from the apartheid system
and tackling new problems like rampant crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, these problems were deeply rooted in the society and
could not be solved overnight.
</P>
<P>
During South Africa's delicate social transformation, it would
be an arduous task for the government to fundamentally improve
the living standards of the black majority and at the same time
maintain national reconciliation by taking into account the
interests of the white.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties, it is generally believed that South
Africa's economy has a great potential with its natural
resources, sound infrastructure and advanced skills.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to be hit
by the worst drought in 50 years, the Bangkok Post Friday quoted
Agriculture Minister Pongpol Adireksarn as saying.
</P>
<P>
To help alleviate the hardship resulting from water shortage,
his ministry has drawn up a 21-page drought prevention plan for
1998, imposing limit on the total acreage of irrigated farming
during the dry season, and regulating irrigation water release,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Rain-making has also been planned, with about 70 planes
available from the air force and private sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also provide farmers with seeds, fertilizer,
pesticide, animal feed and vaccine, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the rainy season this year (May-September) there was not
enough rainfall and rain is not expected in the current dry season
until late may next year.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in Bhumibol and Sirikit reservoirs, the two main
water sources for irrigation for the central plain, stand well
below 50 percent of capacity. Other large reservoirs in the north
and northeast are also drying up, according to earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> Official Report Shows North-South Gap in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Almost all major economic
indicators, as shown by a latest official report, point to a big
gap between Italy's prosperous north and the depressed south.
</P>
<P>
The gap, said the report available on Thursday from the
National Statistics Institute, or Istat, is more apparent in per
capita gross national product and per capita disposable income.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the latest year that complete data are available,
Italy's national economy grew 2.94 percent, with the northern and
north-central regions leading the way with gains of over 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in southern regions, such as Sardinia, Sicily,
Puglia and Campania, growth was less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the north's main economic sectors, metal,
mechanical and other large and medium-size industries, enjoyed a
growth of nearly 10 percent in that year, statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the agriculture and construction sectors, as
the south's main economic engine, saw a decline of about 2
percent.

<HEADLINE> India's Fiscal Deficit Likely to Cross Targeted Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua)-- India's fiscal deficit likely
to overshoot the targeted 4.5 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in the current fiscal year (April 1, 1997-March 31,
1998) due to a setback in tax collections and additional
expenditure commitment arising out of the wages increase in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) report on Currency
and Finance, 1996-97, released here Thursday, the fiscal deficit
shows an increase of 8.8 percent in 1997-98, due to the increase
in developmental capital outlay and higher net lending.
</P>
<P>
"The slippage in revenue deficit together with non-realization
of disinvestment proceeds inevitably resulted in widening of the
fiscal deficit. The gross fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross
domestic product was 5 percent in 1996-97," the RBI report said.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate expenditure growth accelerated to 15.3 percent as
compared with 12.4 percent during the same period of the preceding
year. The actual expenditure requirement to meet salary revision
would be more than double the amount earmarked in the budget
estimates which would cause further increase in gross fiscal
deficit, the report said.

<HEADLINE> New oil Reserve Found in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- New oil reserves of 350
million barrels have been found recently in the Rimau block of
Indonesia's South Sumatra, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest oil finding in Indonesia in the last 15
years," Director of Finance and Administration of PT. Medco Energi
Corporation (MEC) Sugiharto said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Mines and Energy Sudjana said Indonesia
has been able to maintain oil reserves of around nine billion
barrels over the last 10 years, thanks to continuos gas/oil
exploration activities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, as the only Asian member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), produced 1.61 million
barrels of crude oil per day in 1996, and 8.18 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
However, Sudjana said, at the current output rate, Indonesia's
deposits of oil and gas will only last for another 10 years and 30
years respectively.
</P>
<P>
The situation has prompted the government to intensify efforts
to discover additional oil and gas deposits.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, oil and gas experts must try hard to
extent the productive period of the existing oil and gas fields
for as long as possible through various technologies.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Financial Sector Thrives Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' financial
sector has continued to post unprecedented growth during the first
three quarters of 1997 despite a currency crisis which has hit the
country since July.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data from the National Statistics
Coordination Board, the financial sector is thriving very well
under the present regime of "abnormally high interest rates" that
started almost immediately after the de facto devaluation of the
peso six months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine currency has depreciated to 40 pesos against the
dollar from 26.4 pesos since July 11.
</P>
<P>
Based on current prices, the share of the financial sector in
the gross nation product (GNP) from January to September this year
climbed to 4.56 percent from 4.3 percent a year ago, the
statistics coordination board said.
</P>
<P>
It said that after it posted a 12.9 percent growth in 1996, the
financial sector further expanded by 13.9 percent in the first
nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Among the sector, the banking industry, which mushroomed during
the last two years following its liberalization to foreign
investors, accounted the highest gross value-added at 60.3 billion
pesos (1.5 billion dollars) during the period, up from last year's
49.6 billion pesos, the board said.

yet the declining baht may hinder the airlines from settling
fund-raising schemes with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Orient Thai Airlines, one of the two
privately-owned airlines, reportedly will close its operations
around Thailand on January 9 next year due to its operational
losses.

<HEADLINE> 41 Suspects Detained for Chiapas Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 41 suspects
involved in the massacre in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas
have been detained, Mexico's Attorney General Office said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the state, Attorney General
Jorge Madrazo Cuellar presented a preliminary report on the
investigation of the Monday killings that left 45 dead and 25
injured in the village of Acteal.
</P>
<P>
Madrazo Cuellar said that another 23 men were identified by the
Acteal villagers as gunmen who killed the 45 unarmed Indian
peasants.
</P>
<P>
Investigations found that the victims, most of them women and
children, were killed by bullets ranging from 0.22 inches calibre
up to those used with AK-47 automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Zapatista Army (EZLN) Wednesday blamed
President Ernesto Zedillo and his government for the massacre. It
said paramilitaries from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) should be held responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
But both the president and the PRI denied any connection with
the massacre. The government said that the massacre came as a
result of a worst conflict between native indians and local
peasants.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Mexican government reiterated its
willingness to resume the deadlocked peace talks with the EZLN,
which declared war on the government on January 1, 1994 in a bid
to obtain greater rights for the indigenous Indians.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet Chemor also stressed that
the government is willing to explore all possible ways to end the
four-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Chuayffet called on the Zapatista rebels
to sit down and resume the peace talks with the government which
were stalled almost one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Party Calls for Poll Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Eelam People's Democratic
Party (EPDP), one of the contenders for the local government
elections in Northern Sri Lanka, has called for independent poll
observers to ensure free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
EPDP leader Douglas Devananda on Thursday called for university
teachers and intellectuals in the south to act as independent
observers in the forthcoming polls, The Island newspaper said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Devananda as saying he would have local
observers rather than foreign ones. "Foreign observers will be of
very little use because they don't know much about the situation
in the north," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the majority of the people in the north want
Tamil parties to contest the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil parties have to contest the polls because the
elections were forced upon them by the government, the party
leader said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his party decided to contest for the sake of the
people whose lives have been devastated in the 14-year-long ethnic
war between the government troops and the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The elections is scheduled for January 29, 1998. A total of
571,484 voters are to cast their ballots at 422 polling stations
to elect 234 representatives for municipal, urban and village
councils in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts in the north.
</P>
<P>
About 1171 candidates from three Tamil parties and two
independent groups are to run the elections, the first in about
ten years in these districts.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Debts Surge to 1.5 Trillion Pesos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
outstanding public debt has surged to 1.504 trillion pesos (37.5
billion U.S. dollars) because of the peso's continuing fall
against the dollar, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper, citing a Bureau of Treasury report, said that the
national government's debts stock surged to 1.504 trillion as of
September 30 this year from 1.203 trillion pesos (30 billion
dollars) a month earlier, an increase of 300 billion pesos (7.5
billion dollars) just in a month due to the peso's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The debt stock is the government's combined foreign and
domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
The peso's plunge has bloated the peso value of the country's
dollar-denominated borrowings, forcing the government to shell out
more pesos to buy dollars needed to service the loans, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The peso has lost about one third of its value against the
dollar since July 11, when the central bank decided to free the
devaluation of the currency. The exchange rate between the peso
and the dollar is now around 40:1.

<HEADLINE> Pre-World Cup Year of 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- In terms of football, the
year of 1997 is a true case of saving the best for the last.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 1997 sporting year had its highlight coming at
the end on a soccer gala on December 4 which saw next year's
World Cup finals take shape in the Southern French city Marseille.
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented total of 32 teams were crossing their fingers
and the rest of the world were holding their breath as FIFA
general-secretary Sepp Blatter mastered the first ever outdoor
drawing ceremony which later turned out far more balanced groups
than usual.
</P>
<P>
None of the eight groups fully deserved the name of "Group of
Death" and Group D, where a woeful seeded Spain have to take the
unenviable challenges from Olympic champions Nigeria, last world
cup semi-finalists Bulgaria and unpredictable Paraguay, seemed
the toughest.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Brazil and runners-up Italy were both
blessed with an easy task in the group stage and hosts France and
South American force Argentina should be the same satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The European neighbours the Netherlands and Belgium are
becoming World Cup riveries again as they will clash into each
other for the third time on World Cup stage since 1994, and the
most colorful group match next year seems to take place in Group
F, where the United States confronts the Iranians in the
footballing world.
</P>
<P>
African champions South Africa, star-studded Croatia, 2002
World Cup co-hosts Japan and "Reggae Boys" Jamaica forms a
quartet of world cup first-timers in next year's biggest-ever
soccer show.
</P>
<P>
Romania is the most outstanding outfit in the European
qualifying campaign as the 1994 quater-finalists came first in a
fiecely-battled European zone to grab the French ticket while
Italy, outclassed by Glenn Hoddle's rejuvenated England, had to
endure nerve-rattling play-offs against Russia to make its French
connection.
</P>
<P>
The most impossible mission in the World Cup qualifying, which
stretched 18 months and ran more than 600 games all over the
globe, was fulfilled by the Asian side Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians set a world cup scoring record for a single match
after their 17-0 demolition of the Maldive Island on June 2 and
later amazingly turned the tide against Terry Venable's Australia
in the Asian/Oceania play-offs to squeeze into the last plane for
France.
</P>
<P>
World Cup is the theme throughout the entire year of 1997 and
the South American Championship, the oldest continental soccer
tournament and better known as "the Copa America", was pushed to
the side-shows.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 tournament, taking place in Bolivia from June 11 to
29 and sandwiched in between World Cup fixtures, only saw current
world champions Brazil, not tied down by World Cup duties, and
the hosts Bolivia send a full-strength squad and reasonably
enough take the top spots.
</P>
<P>
And the South American footballing force proved to be
consistent as FIFA's two world events for boys--Under-17 World
Championship held in Egypt in September and Under-20 World
Championship in Malaysia in June--were both snatched by the South
Americans, Brazil and Argentina respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the club football, the passing year looked Teutonic as the
German clubs took home two of the three European Cups.
</P>
<P>
Borussia Dortmund upset the formbook as the German champions
toppled the hot favourites Juventus 3-1 in the Champions League
final in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Former German international Karlheinz Riedle's double strikes
and substitute Lars Ricken's insurance goal dashed the Juventus
hopes of completing a grand slam by adding the Champions League
title to the Italian League, World Club Cup and European Supercup.
</P>
<P>
Before the Munich Night, the modest German club Schalke 04
also produced a remarkable victory against the odds by beating
Italian giants Inter Milan to bag the UEFA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Diversifies Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing had 6.335 million
people working in 120,028 different enterprises and institutions
by the end of last year, according to a report issued by the
Beijing Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report is part of the first nationwide survey aimed at
learning about the ways the city residents live and work. The
survey will also be conducted throughout the country, offering
information to be used to analyze the distribution and development
of people and their occupations, said a notice from the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that there were 98,908 corporate enterprises
and institutions in the capital by the end of 1996. Some 65,000
people were working in 934 agricultural corporate units. Employees
in the industrial and service trade units accounted for 49 percent
and 49.9 percent of the total number respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the pattern of keeping public ownership
in a dominant position and having diverse economic forms develop
side by side has formed in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The number of enterprises under public ownership, including
State-owned and collective enterprises, reached 63,041, employing
85.3 percent of the people working for enterprises and generating
83.9 percent of the yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
Large- and medium-sized firms employed 42.9 percent of the
workers, and generated 61.3 percent of the revenue.

<P>
And the controversial expansion of the Champions League next
season means that Germany will have a record triple
entries: Bayern Munich as national champions, Bayern Leverkusen
as runners-up and Dortmund as defending champions.
</P>
<P>
The European Cup Winners' Cup, for a record fourth time, fell
into the hands of the Spanish giants Barcelona, who successfully
prevented defending champions Paris Saint-Germain from becoming
the first team in the Cup history to retain the title.
</P>
<P>
Juventus remained one of the most feared outfits in the
continent when they celebrated their centenary year by winning
the national league for a record 24 times, and Manchester United,
crowned with their fourth English Premier League title in five
seasons and boasting a wealth of young talents, can be expecting
a vintage European season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the matter, AC Milan, only the shadows of
the early 90s' all-conquering side, hit a spectacular low by the
end of the season, 11th on the table and far out of European
competitions. Arrigo Sacchi failed to work the magic over his
old club after handing the hot potato of Italian national coach
position to Cesare Maldini while Fabio Capello, recalled from
Spain with a league title with Real Madrid to his name, did not
set things right either.
</P>
<P>
Onto the individuals, the Brazilians dominated 1997 headlines
as they one after another for three times involved in world
record transfers.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's World Footballer of the Year Ronaldo's high-profile
transfer from Barcelona to Inter Milan set a world record but the
record was twice broken by his fellow Brazilians Rivaldo and a
relatively unknown Denilson who become the most expensive player
in the world when the Spanish club Real Betis offered a
staggering 21.5 million pounds to his old club Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 also saw other two remarkable personalities
hang up their boots -- in a contrastingly different fashion.
Franco Baresi, AC Milan's arguably most important player of all,
finally called it a day this summer after long-time indications,
while Eric Cantona, Manchester United Captain and inspiration,
stunned the Old Trafford by announcing his sudden retirement at
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Soccer continued struggling through corruption in 1997, both
on and off the pitch. The Portugese club Porto and the Belgian
side Anderlecht were both tangled with bribery scandles, and
former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar found himself an
innocent man after being acquitted by court on the marathon
match-fixing case.
</P>
<P>
Finally, another World Cup battle came to underline the
passing year's football theme -- a battle between Europe's two
footballing heavyweights England and Germany over the European
candidacy to bid for the 2006 World Cup. Germany has the UEFA
backing and England wanted it a fair play, and if they meet with
each other in the World Cup next year, the match will have double
meanings.

<HEADLINE> Target Set For Technical Supervision Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Technical supervision
efficiency is going to be improved, a move to ensure solid
support for China's economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Li Chuanqing, director of the State
Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS) as saying this will be the
State's main goal within technical supervision work during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Technical supervision departments will guide large-size
enterprises and corporations as they complete their own plans to
implement the country's Program to Revitalize Quality, issued by
the State Council last year, as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We will help them improve quality control systems and support
their efforts in producing brand products of international
competitiveness," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He continued supervision departments will guide other major
State-owned enterprises with a good basis of mangement,
introducing international standards, and introducing scientific
management systems for production.
</P>
<P>
"As for those poorly based small factories, and producers whose
products are of an unsteady quality, technical supervision
departments will provide support, including establishment of means
for product quality testing, which will improve interior
management of the enterprises, and the sense of quality among
leaders and workers as well," said Li.
</P>
<P>
The State bureau plans to adopt strong measures to ensure the
effectiveness of quality-certification systems, while supporting
quality enhancement efforts promoted in major Chinese cities
during the new year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will accelerate establishment of a State Quality
Award system, a move to encourage and support enterprises strong
enough to produce famous brands for competition within
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Regular inspections will continue, to monitor the quality of
important materials for industrial and agricultural production and
commodities for daily life.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Facing Gloomy Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initially, it was a private sector driven crisis. Investors
were concerned about the level of short-term debts owed by the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the government, Indonesia's external debts totaled
117.3 billion dollars as of last September, of which 65 billion
dollars was owed by the private sector. Many private debts turned
out to be unhedged. It was these large unhedged debts which
sparked a dollar-buying frenzy.
</P>
<P>
The government's foreign debt servicing burden has also
increased as, according to the Ministry of Finance, every drop of
100 rupiah to the dollar has increased the government's debt
servicing by 500 billion rupiah (98 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Before the crisis, foreign debt servicing accounted for almost
20 percent of the total state budget. With the rupiah staying
above 5,000 against the dollar, the ratio of debt servicing to the
total budget will increase to 42 percent, which is a threatening
level that exceeds the prudential limit ratio.
</P>
<P>
The monetary crisis has hit the interests of domestic and
foreign investors and a number of foreign investors has withdrawn
their investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government said foreign investment, most of which
approved before July this year, was a little more than last year,
but the realization level was reportedly much lower than previous
years.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking economy is already taking its toll on the
country's workforce, with thousands of workers already losing jobs
in the main industrial cities of Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya.
The unemployment rate in 1998 is predicted to raise as high as 11
percent of the nation's total workforce 90 million from 7.2
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the year-on-year inflation rate is expected to break
into the double digits this year as a result of the unexpected
over-shooting of the rupiah and the long drought.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said the inflation rate this year will increase
to 11 percent from last year's 6.4 percent, and it will be 12
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Weakening rupiah, tight liquidity and high interest rates have
often been cited as factors responsible for shrinking domestic
demand, corporate bankruptcy and the banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some local organizations estimated that agriculture,
livestock, forestry and fishery sectors would grow at a lower rate
of 1.7 percent this year as compared to 1.89 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The mining and energy sector, which significantly grew 7.13
percent last year, would grow at a lower rate of 4.5 percent and 5
percent this year and in 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The processing industry sector, with a growth rate of 11.03
percent in 1996, will also see much lower rates of 8.5 percent in
1997 and 8.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The most affected sectors are property, finance and corporate
services. The growth rate of the property sector, which was 12.37
percent last year, will drop to 5 percent and 4.5 percent in 1997
and 1998 respectively. The financial, leasing and corporate
service sector which grew 10.52 percent in 1996, would see
consecutive lower rates of 5.5 percent this year and 4 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto has called on the whole nation to unite in
facing with the current hardship, saying the country's economy
could be recovered by increasing efficiency and productivity. The
target could be reached through doubling the output and halving
the imput as well as boosting exports, he added.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts held that with a relatively strong economic
fundamental, rich natural resources and wide consumer market,
Indonesia's economy might be recovered by the end of next year or
the beginning of 1999, if the government really carried out the
IMF reform package and supported by the return of foreign
investors and good government measures.

</P>
<P>
Now their vocational senior middle school has created a system
of recruiting not only reformed students of their own school but
also those from other middle schools.

MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Boris Ignatiev, head coach of
Russian national soccer team, will stay on the position, at least
for the present time, despite failing to get Russia into the World
Cup soccer finals, the Russian Football Union (RFU) said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The RFU's executive board met for two hours Wednesday before
releasing the decision, and although many of the members were
critical, they gave the coach a second chance.
</P>
<P>
Even President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin have expressed their unhappiness over the team's
performance after they were beaten in the two-leg play-off against
Italy last month and disqualified for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
After the team's failure, sports minister Leonid Tyagachev
called for Ignatiev's removal and president of the Russian Olympic
Committee criticized Ignatiev and the rest of the RFU officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Vyacheslav Koloskov, RFU's president and the players
were sympathetic to Ignatiev, saying he had too little time to
improve performances.
</P>
<P>
Ignatiev admitted making mistakes, but argued that the team's
poor performances was directly related to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ignatiev has been in the national job for 17 months and he is
Russia's third coach in as many years. His contract runs through
to August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The final decision may be made after January's draw for the
2000 European championships although Koloskov, the RFU's
president, had expressed his wishes to extend his contract to
2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Facing Gloomy Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy may shrink
by up to three percent in 1997, with sluggish domestic demand,
growing unemployment and prolonged industrial recession during the
current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Recent forecasts by economists and financial organizations have
predicted that after experiencing a high growth of 6 percent per
annum for more than 20 years, Indonesia's real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth this year will slow down drastically to about
5 percent from last year's 7.9 percent, and it will drop further
to 2-3 percent in 1998, due to the regional monetary crisis which
has badly hit the country for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the monetary crisis, which has hit almost all the
Southeast Asian countries since July, President Soeharto said that
 "the hard work, diligence and sacrifices over several decades
were wiped out overnight."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic performance over the past several decades
has ranked among the best in the developing world. The success has
been based on a consistent adherence to prudent macroeconomic
policies, high investment and savings rates as well as
market-oriented trade and exchange regimes.
</P>
<P>
The strong overall performance, however, masked the emergence
of a number of underlying structural weaknesses which made
Indonesia vulnerable to adverse external developments.
Long-standing rigidities in the form of domestic trade regulations
and some import monopolies impeded economic efficiency and
competitiveness, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, less transparency in decisions affecting the
business environment and data deficiencies increased uncertainty
and adversely affected investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, large capital inflows intermediated through a weak
banking system exposed Indonesia to shift in financial market
sentiment. Thus, Indonesia's banking sector was not prepared to
withstand the financial turmoil that swept Southeast Asia starting
in July.
</P>
<P>
To maintain stability and confidence in the national currency
of the rupiah, which started to drop sharply against the U.S.
dollar in the middle of July, the Indonesian government has taken
many measures necessary to increase national efficiency, enhance
economic resilience and improve its economy's global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Despite the measures, which included floating the currency,
raising benchmark Bank Indonesia (central bank) certificate rates
squeezing liquidity tightly, revising its budget, postponing or
review large infrastructure projects worth 35 billion dollars,
were taken one by one, the rupiah continued to drop to new lows
almost every day as the supply and demand for the dollar were far
from being balanced, and the central bank had to step into the
currency market several times.
</P>
<P>
All of these developments motivated Indonesia to seek help from
the IMF. And at the end of October, Indonesia reached an agreement
with the organization on a financial and economic reform package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF assembled 23 billion dollars in loan commitments to
Indonesia and Indonesia agreed to comply with the IMF package such
as to liberalize trade by eliminating the state monopoly on wheat,
wheat flour, soy beans and garlic.
</P>
<P>
The government also closed 16 private commercial banks, which
it claimed were insolvent.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah then strengthened from 3,600 to 3,300 to the dollar.
But the recovery was short-lived. It dropped again and again until
now. Observers said, "Whatever the government do, it will be too
late to stave off the country's first recession in 20 years."
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 100 percent of its value against
the dollar this year, the biggest drop in Southeast Asian
countries even in East Asia including South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Market composite index has sunk 47
percent in rupiah terms, and plunged 78 percent if the
depreciation of the rupiah is factored in.
</P>
<P>
Many parties, including the government, attributed the drastic
fall of the rupiah to a sudden loss of confidence in the currency
on the part of investors, both domestic and foreign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails Planned Panama Anti-Drug Pact </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's drug czar today hailed a U.S.-Panama accord to create a
multilateral anti-drug center that would let U.S. troops stay in
Panama after giving up control of the canal in two years.
</P>
<P>
The planned creation of the center in Panama is "an impressive
step to substantially increase cooperation and coordinated action
against drug trafficking in the hemisphere," retired Gen. Barry
McCaffrey said in a statement read by an aide.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, a former commander of the U.S. Southern Command,
which moved its headquarters from Panama to Miami in September,
said the center reflected "growing optimism that true hemispheric
cooperation can be accomplished" to fight the drug scourge.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Panama's President Ernesto Perez Balladares
announced a tentative agreement on the center, to be based at
Howard Air Force Base in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Final details for building the center will be worked out
through further negotiations, which will start next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Panama Canal Treaties signed in 1977,
the United States is to hand over full control of the interoceanic
waterway to the Panamanian government by Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Extends Mandate of Northern Watch Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Parliament today
decided to extend the mandate of the multi-nation Northern Watch
operation over Iraq for another six months, local TV and radio
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This decision will enable the Northern Watch force consisting
Turkish, U.S. and British jets to continue monitoring the
northern Iraqi region.
</P>
<P>
"The motion has been passed," said Parliament Speaker Hikmet
Cetin following the vote, declining to give details.
</P>
<P>
Northern Watch, formally known as Operation Provide Comfort,
was designed to protect the Kurdish people from possible attacks
by the Iraqi government forces and has been renewed every six
months since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 warplanes, including 27 U.S jets, are now
deployed in the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to carry out
the monitoring duty.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should obey all the United Nations resolutions if it
wants an end of the operation, parliamentarians said, adding
Turkey fully respects the territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Welfare Party lawmakers said that it hopes the
operation would end as soon as possible although they voted in
favor of the motion.
</P>
<P>
Some politicians have argued that the operation could lead to
an independent Kurdish state in the region.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has lost its effective control of the northern Iraq
following its defeat in the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Russian Plane Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A Russian plane with five tons
of medical supplies for the Iraqis and 23 Russian parliament
members arrived in Baghdad today after receiving permission from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The plane Tupolev-204 landed at the Saddam International
Airport, which saw the first foreign flight since 1990 when the
United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The airport has to be shut due the U.N. sanctions which also
bans flights to and from Iraq. The United Nations and humanitarian
flights have used a military air base near Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, one of the Russian MPs told reporters that they
have not brought missiles to Baghdad as the Americans have done.
Instead, they have brought medicine for Iraqi children, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation called on the international community to
take measures to lift the sanctions on Iraq, saying the policy
pursued by the U.S. government has led to horror and death in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The plane stopped at Iran's border town of Kermanshah on
Tuesday and was scheduled to arrive in Iraq on Wednesday. But it
was held by the Iranian authorities which feared it would violate
the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The plane left Iran this afternoon after the U.N. Sanctions
Committee on Iraq issued a permission Wednesday for the aircraft
to continue its flight to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The flight has been initiated by Russian Liberal Democratic
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who strongly opposes sanctions
against Iraq.
