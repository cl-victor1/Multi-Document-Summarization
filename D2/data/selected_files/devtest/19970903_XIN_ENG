<HEADLINE> Masood Refuses to Talk with Taliban Individually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's former
military chief Ahmad Masood today ruled out the possibility of
holding talks individually with the Islamic Taliban militia,
Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
"I will not talk with Taliban individually," Masood was quoted
as saying by Taliban sources in Peshawar, a major city in
northwestern Pakistan, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban are really interested in resolving the current
crisis, they should hold dialogue with all the parties in the
northern alliance," said the Tajik warlord, who was routed out of
the Afghan capital Kabul by the Taliban 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Masood is one of the strongmen in the anti-Taliban northern
alliance which is composed mainly of forces led by Masood, Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik and Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat leader Karim Khalili.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban sources also disclosed that the chief of the
militia's Supreme Council, Muhammad Rabbani, has left Kabul for
Saudi Arabia for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who is accompanied by five senior Taliban officials,
will discuss matters of mutual interest with leaders of Saudi
Arabia, which has already recognized the Taliban government, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic fighting has been continuing north of Kabul for nearly
two months after a surprise attack by Masood brought his forces to
within the rocket range of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
But since the late July advance, neither side has been able to
deal a decisive blow at the front, which zigzags through the
fertile Shamali Valley that sweeps north from Kabul to the snowy
Hindu Kush mountains.

efforts in Afghanistan, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns PNA Against Failure of American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today warned against the failure of American
peace efforts if the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
continues refusing to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the pending visit to the region by United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next week,
Netanyahu told Israel Radio that the American peace efforts
would not go far as long as PNA leader Yasser Arafat
refused to carry out his promises to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright had the right when she put the primacy
of security in the peace process. If the Palestinian Authority
continues to refuse to fight the infrastructure of terror
organizations, our peace efforts would not go very far.
Indeed, I would say, the entire peace process would be in
danger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu blasted Arafat and Palestinian security chief in
the West Bank Jibril Rajoub for embracing leaders of the
militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) recently during the
two-day "national unity conference."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the PNA had yet followed through
the list of 150 suspected Palestinian terrorists handed over
by Israel, and refused to taken actions against the militant
groups and their infrastructure, and the incitement of violence
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that "no engagement" with Hamas and any
other terror organizations was justified, because the goal of
these groups is to destroy Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks indicated his intransigency on the stance
on security despite of the pending visit by Albright, who is
to try to revive the deeply-troubled Israeli-Palestinian peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to arrive in the region on September 10
for her first Middle East peace mission seven months after
assuming office, during which she will visit Israel, Palestine,
Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In order to prepare for Albright's visit, a high-level
Israeli delegation led by Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh will
depart for Washington Tuesday night. The delegation included
Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Uzi Arad, his attorney Yitzhak
Molcho and senior officials from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 30 Hamas-claimed twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem which have killed 17 people, Israel has been
pressuring the PNA to crack down on Hamas and other militant
groups.
</P>
<P>
During Albright's visit here, Israel is expected to
request her to push Arafat hard on the issue of fighting
terrorism.

</P>
<P>
Items on the agenda include a declaration on gender equality
and a proposed process of review and rationalisation of the SADC
program of action.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Further Improve Syllabus for Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will further
improve the syllabus and the text books for Chinese language
education so as to focus more on conveying cultural values and
heritage, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said today as he
launched this year's Speak Mandarin Campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We should ensure that the higher Chinese and also the Chinese
syllabi and textbooks convey Chinese cultural values and heritage,
and do not just teach the language for utilitarian purposes," the
deputy prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will do this progressively over the
next few years, he said. But he added that in doing this, it
should be careful not to make the subject more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Making higher Chinese harder will reduce the number of pupils
who can cope with the subject, he warned. "This will defeat our
purpose."
</P>
<P>
He noted that only about 10 to 20 percent of the students take
higher Chinese at the primary and secondary schools and at junior
colleges in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
A sound approach to teaching Chinese in schools will lay the
foundation for wider use of Chinese in the Singapore society, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must take a flexible and pragmatic approach towards
teaching, learning and promoting Chinese, in order to reach all
segments of society," he added.
</P>
<P>
By catering to the varied needs, "we give the Chinese language
the best chance of flourishing in Singapore," he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC States Set for Crucial Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The member countries of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) will meet in a
crucial 17th annual summit in Malawi this week during which they
will review the organisation's structures, consider enlargement,
resolve the thorny issues of trade as well as a number of
protocols meant to consolidate economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency reported today that the summit kicks
off with a two-day council of ministers meeting starting on
Wednesday which will set the agenda for the heads of state and
government meeting which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will be represented by foreign affairs minister Stan
Mudenge while president Robert Mugabe is expected to join other
leaders on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the first after last year's historical Maseru
summit which culminated in the signing of four key protocols as
the grouping moved closer to creating a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The four protocols signed last year were on trade, transport,
communication and meteorology, energy and combating trafficking
in illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol, which is yet to be ratified by 10 of the
12 member states, seeks, among other things, to eradicate tariff
barriers in the region over a period of eight years.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the regional powerhouse, is reportedly
finalising its offer to the other member states under which it
hopes to reduce tariffs on trade to zero, except in sensitive
sectors like those involved in vulnerable production.
</P>
<P>
Items on this year's agenda include a declaration on gender
equality and proposal to review and rationalise the SADC
programme of action in light of the reports of lack of funds for
various sectoral projects.
</P>
<P>
Protocols on education, training and mining would be
considered for adoption and a declaration on productivity in SADC
is expected to be made.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also expected to consider applications by the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda and Seychelles to
join the regional grouping which currently has a combined
population of approximately 128 million people.
</P>
<P>
SADC has also been reviewing its structures following its
transformation from the anti-apartheid Southern African
Development Co-ordination Conference to the Southern African
Development Community.

<HEADLINE> US Federal Minimum Wage Increases This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal minimum
wage was increased by 40 cents an hour to 5.15 dollars from
September 1 as part of the second phrase of an increase package
approved by the U.S. Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
The first phrase last fall lifted the nation's standard wage
for hourly workers to 4.75 dollars from 4.25 dollars, where it had
sat unchanged for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
The change will affect more people than just the estimated 6.4
million workers who now make below 5.15 dollars per hour. Overall,
about 10 million minimum-wage workers will have benefited from the
increase, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the Americans receiving the minimum
wage work in private-sector jobs such as retail stores and
restaurants, sales or private household jobs like housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Of those getting the minimum wage increase, roughly 57 percent
are women, 32 percent are youths ages 16 to 19, and 55 percent
work part time, according to the statistics from the U.S. Labor
Department.

<HEADLINE> Camerounian MPs Split over Bill on Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 2 (Xinhua) --After four days of scrutiny of
the bill on presidential election tabled at the National Assembly
of Cameroun, parliamentarians appeared more divided in opinion
now than they started, Cameroun Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock was imminent when parliamentarians of the
Constitutional Laws Committee agreed to analyse and open debates
on the bill Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, three articles have caused major debate: one which
empowers the Ministry of Territorial Administration to receive,
examine and maybe reject application files of candidates, was
severely criticised by most of the opposition party members of
the committee. They prefer that such powers be conferred on the
constitutional council.
</P>
<P>
Another issue which is yet to be resolved is the building up
of the divisional supervisory commission which most of the
opposition parliamentarians consider too representative of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
Most parliamentarians prefer to see more representatives from
the independent group replace some of the local administrative
officials in the various commissions.
</P>
<P>
By midday Monday, the committee is still in session and there
was little or no signs that the members would easily agree
through consensus on all the articles.
</P>
<P>
However, parliamentarians of the ruling Cameroun People's
Democratic Movement which has an overwhelming majority in the
committee may break the deadlock by taking a common stance if the
need arises. For now, it is open debate.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians have been working for eight days since
the first extraordinary session of the parliament convened on
August 26.
</P>
<P>
During the eight days, the mandates of the seven
parliamentarians elected on August 3 in a re-run in three
electoral constituencies had been validated.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the present debates on the bill are through, it
will take on the bill related to private security companies.

JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The first political meeting
of Palestinian national and Islamic factions concluded in Gaza
today, reported the East Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service
JMCC (Jerusalem Media and Communication Center).
</P>
<P>
Thiab Al-Louh, member of the Revolutionary Council of
Palestinina leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement who attended in
the three-day conference, said that the participants discussed
political issues and ways of confronting challenges.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also focused on relations between the national and
Islamic factions and the Palestinian National Authority, and
issues of international affairs concerning the establishment of a
democratic civil society, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All participants agreed upon confronting aggressive measures
of occupation and the policies of closure, siege, political
blackmail (by Israel), in disregard of Palestine's dignity," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the issue of Palestinian refugees, he said the
participants asked the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA)
to provide more services to the refugees instead of reducing
financial support.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA is now serving 3.4 million Palestinian refugees. Two
million of those are scattered in camps throughout Lebanon, Syria
and Jordan. The remainder live in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
According to UNRWA, it received so far no more than 207
million U.S. dollars towards its projected budget of 312 million
dollars for 1997.

documents, some of which carry the logo of the Federal Government
of Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria or any other government
agency.

PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- France today appealed for
dialogue and negotiations in the Indian Ocean island nation of
Comoros after hundreds of Comoran soldiers were reportedly on
their way to the separatist island of Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to the problems which the Federal Islamic

integrity (of the country)," said French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.

inter-Comoran peace conference in the Ethiopian capital Addis
Abeba on September 10-15, and invited all parties concerned to
cooperate with the OAU in a "constructive spirit."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the OAU envoy to Comoros, Pierre Yere, is also
evaluating the needs for economic and humanitarian aid to the
local people.
</P>
<P>
The OAU envoy to said today that the Comoran government has
asked for a postponement of the Addis Abeba peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We call on all parties concerned to facilitate the task of
these missions (by OAU) whose objective is to open the way for a
solution which is reached by consensus, lasting and pacific, to
the problems which is experienced by Comoros," said Rummelhardt.
</P>

They said chemicals registered in Europe and the United States
will have to be cleared for use in South Africa as an emergency
measure.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) are expected to
table a final set of recommendations on future trade relations
with the European Union (EU) at their summit next week in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
SADC spokesman Kgosinkwe Moesi said today in Gaborone,
Botswana that SADC ministers have worked with other stakeholders
to establish a Southern African position on the review of the
Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
Moesi was quoted by local media as saying that if approved by
the summit, the proposals will become SADC's contribution to the
African position on the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
The convention is a trade and aid arrangement bringing
together the 15 EU member states and 70 countries in Africa,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP).
</P>
<P>
The accord is due for renewal at the turn of the century with
both sides scheduled to open negotiations on the convention next
year.
</P>
<P>
No official position exists within the SADC, but calls have
been made for trade concessions of the Lome Convention to be
restored in a post-1999 agreement.
</P>
<P>
The EU has mapped out a number of scenarios for future ACP-EU
cooperation, including breaking the ACP bloc into regions and
asking some countries to grant free market concessions to EU
exporters.
</P>

<P>
The peace plan had resulted in elections which had been
declared as "free and fair" by the international community, and
an end to the civil war in Liberia, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ikimi noted, some 11,000 ECOWAS troops would remain
in Liberia for six months after the elections in the interest of
and the need for, stability and security while the country
restructured its defense and police forces.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Sierra Leone, Ikimi said the military coup
which took place as African leaders were holding the Organisation
of African Unity summit in Harare, had been condemned worldwide.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS took it upon itself to remedy the situation through a
committee of four countries consisting of Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire,
Ghana and Guinea, which later met the coup leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said, ECOWAS imposed an economic blockade on Sierra
Leone and formally extended the mandate of its forces covering
the country.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the moves Nigeria had made in returning to
civilian rule and democracy, Ikimi said the process was onging
and October 1, 1998 was officially earmarked as the end of
military rule.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he appreciated efforts ECOWAS was making to return
Liberia to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the people of Liberia would
appreciate those efforts which had cost a lot of resources to
both Nigeria and Liberia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Convention on Desertification Ratified in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's parliament today
finally ratified the U.N. convention to combat desertification in
countries experiencing serious drought, especially in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The convention, concluded in 1994 in Paris, is a product of
the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development which took
place in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, identified as being at risk from drought
and desertification, are required to create an enabling
environment for implementing the convention.
</P>
<P>
Ratification of the convention also binds a country to drawing
up a national action program and give priority to drought and
desertification issues as well as creating a desertification
fund.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians said if conservation was to bear fruit,
especially in the rural areas, people should be provided with
alternative forms of fuel and energy.
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns raised by the parliamentarians, Mines,
Environment and Tourism Minister Simon Moyo said, a
multi-sectoral task force had been established to work on
creating the fund and the national action program.

<HEADLINE> Greece Welcomes Poos' Statements on Athens-Ankara Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece today welcomed the
statements made by Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos, whose
country is currently holding the rotating European Union (EU)
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Athens was
"fully satisfied with Poos' statements."
</P>
<P>
Poos reportedly said after meeting his Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem Monday that the improvement of Turkey's relations with
Greece and the facilitation of negotiations on Cyprus' entry into
the EU were prerequisites for Ankara to improve its ties with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkey opposes Cyprus' accession to the EU without the
admission of Turkey itself, saying that the move would amount to
the island joining Greece, which is already an EU member.
</P>
<P>
Asked about media reports that soldiers from Britain's bases on
Cyprus were visiting the Turkish-occupied north of the island
using papers declaring "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", the
spokesman said that the Greek government knew nothing of the
matter, but added that "such matters have no bearing on
developments. What is important are official relations".

<HEADLINE> Egypt Bans Reporting on Minister's Libel Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian prosecution
authority today banned the press from following up a libel lawsuit
filed by the interior minister against an opposition newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The ban would remain effective until the end of the
investigations, Ragaa Al-Arabi, Egyptian attorney general said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The national, partisan, local and foreign press are not
allowed to publish reports of any more developments connected with
Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy's libel charges against the
editor in chief and some reporters of the opposition newspaper
Al-Shaab," he said. But he did explain the reason.
</P>
<P>
For a month Al Shaab has been accusing el-Alfy and his
associates of racketeering, nepotism and involvement in a
high-profile corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the Interior Ministry and the bi-weekly
mounted as el-Alfy filed a libel suit on August 16 against
Al-Shaab which then filed a counter lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Since August 20, the attorney general's office has been
questioning the implicated journalists.
</P>
<P>
Magdy Hussein, editor in chief of the newspaper, said he
presented "100 pages of incriminating documents against el-Alfy
and his acolytes."
</P>
<P>
Hussein claimed he had proof that el-Alfy, who was supposed to
keep corruption under his vigilance, had sold a villa he bought
from the government to Abdel Wahab Habbak, a former public sector
company baron who is serving a 10-year imprisonment sentence for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
El-Alfy has in fact labeled Al-Shaab a tool of the outlawed
Muslim Brothers, implying the paper could get the same treatment
reserved for those Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
"Everything that is printed in this newspaper is a lie," he
told the press earlier.
</P>
<P>
El-Alfy's ministry is fighting a war against Islamic militants
that have staged a violent terrorist campaign since 1992 to
overthrow Egypt's incumbent secular government.
</P>
<P>
The case was the second prominent lawsuit in two months against
the press. President Hosni Mubarak' two sons last month brought a
Saudi paper to court for publishing a "defamatory" story of their
business dealings.

<HEADLINE> Rehabilitation Projects Launched in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Huge work has started in
northern Mozambique to rehabilitate the rail-port system and
create a free trade zone in the Nacala Development Corridor.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Maputo said the corridor will bring
to three the number of such trade zones which benefit countries
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The Nacala corridor is regarded as the first project of
significant magnitude to be carried out in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambique railway comany will rehabilitate the
Cuamba-Lichinga line in the region and will ensure a regular link
between Nacala and Malawi, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There is a great potential in areas along the Nacala corridor
in agriculture, cattle breeding, fishing, forestry and mining.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 174 million U.S. dollars, financed by
the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the European
Investment Bank and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF to Reduce Mozambique's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) have proposed Mozambique be
granted debt relief worth 2.25 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported
today from Maputo that the two institutions say this will help
reduce the burden of Mozambique's external borrowings to bearable
levels.
</P>
<P>
The assistance program will be the largest considered so far
under the highly-indebted poor country initiative, which is being
coordinated by the two Washington-based institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is one of the poorest nations in the world, with
national income of 135 U.S.Dollars per person last year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this year, the net present value of Mozambique's
external debt is expected to be 4.95 billion U.S. Dollars or 709
percent of the country's yearly exports.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is due to be discussed by the executive directors
of the bank and the IMF this month.

HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's parliament today
dissolved the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA), paving way
for the privatisation of the Cold Storage Company, the Cotton
Marketing Company and Dairibord Zimbabwe Limited.

<P>
Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Lands and Agriculture, steered

levies imposed on producers, processors and buyers of
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The fund may receive capital from the state and financial
assistance from other sources.
</P>
<P>
With the passing of the bill, the AMA will be dissolved and
its assets and obligations be transferred to the state.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to be Prepared for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today urged its member countries to
be prepared for possible poor rains in the 1997-1998 season.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Mugwara, coordinator for SADC food security sector,
said in Blantyre, Malawi, that there is urgent need for the
member countries to map out strategies to deal with the
likelihood of drought during the rain season, reported Zambia
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The re-emergency of the Ei Nino phenomenon in equatorial
pacific ocean points to a strong possibility of poor rainfall in
the 1997-1998 season. Based on the latest observation by
climatic experts, SADC food security is maintaining its note of
caution that climatic condition indicators are such that there
could well be adverse impacts on food production during the
forthcoming season," he said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the possible drought, SADC countries should review
current food stocks and logistics of alternative seed supply to
commercial and communal farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the member countries review external
financial commitments.
</P>
<P>
The existing surface water resources must be taken care of
together with available irrigation equipment, Mugwara added.
</P>
<P>
Should the fear of drought materializes, the member countries
should strive to raise resources to feed their own people instead
of relying on donor aid, said the SADC official.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Has Mixed Reactions to Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordanians have expressed mixed
reactions to the upcoming maiden visit to the Middle East by
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's aimed at
reviving the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali said here today that he was
"optimistic" about the long-awaited visit by Albright, Radio
Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Albright would urge all the parties in the
region to overcome obstacles facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright's Mideast tour, due to start on September 9, is
expected to include Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh, however,
has expressed concern that Albright might have a tilt over Israel
while seeking ways to save the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the Jewish woman secretary of state should, during her
visit, propose new initiatives which do not focus solely on the
"security needs" of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot go back to the terms of reference of (U.S. Middle
East special envoy) Mr. Dennis Ross, where the security issue was
the basic problem," the semi-official newspaper Jordan Times
quoted Tarawneh as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross managed to initiate a series of security meetings
among Palestinian, Israeli and U.S. officials during his visit to
the region in early August shortly after the suicide Jerusalem
market bombings.
</P>
<P>
"The security needs are part of the whole peace process
but not the whole issue," Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. was the only party that is able to bring the
region a viable initiative while Jordan and Egypt, the only two
Arab countries having peace treaties with Israel, were not
qualified to make such an initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been in deadlock since
March when Israel broke ground for building a Jewish settlement at
Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as
their future capital.

<HEADLINE> UK to Seek Tougher Rules on Dumping at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to seek tougher international rules on dumping waste
and redundant oil platforms at sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview early today, Britain's
Environment Minister Michael Meacher said the British proposals,
including targets for reduced levels of radioactive waste and
other hazardous substances at sea, would be presented to a
Brussels meeting of the Oslo/Paris Convention.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo-Paris Convention is an inter-governmental organization
monitoring and regulating pollution in the northeast Atlantic from
the Arctic to Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the most important change in UK marine policy
for at least a couple of decades," Meacher said. "We are making it
clear that Britain accepts the presumption against sea disposal of
redundant oil and gas installations."
</P>
<P>
Meacher noted that dumping oil platforms at sea would be
unacceptable to the Labour government, saying that option would
only be considered for a "small number of cases" covering the
heaviest concrete installations in very deep water or damaged
structures which could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some 75 percent of Britain's oil and gas
platforms are light installations in shallow water which would
have to be removed during decommissioning under International
Maritime Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmental activists hailed the British
government's guidelines on dumping at sea with Greenpeace
executive director Peter Melchett rating it " the most dramatic
change in UK marine policy for at least a decade and a half."

LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, President of the
Irish Republican Army's (IRA) Sinn Fein political wing, left
Dublin Tuesday for a five-day visit to the United States,
according to reports reaching here from the capital.
</P>
<P>
Adams will meet high ranking members of the U.S. government and
other prominent politatians including White House National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger and Senator Ted Kennedy, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Dublin Airport before his departure, Adams said his
visit was taking place at a critical time in the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The visit also takes place days before the start of all-party
talks in Belfast on the future of the province, to which Sinn Fein
has been invited by Britain's Labor government following the truce
announced in July.
</P>
<P>
Adams was quoted as saying that "We will be engaging with the
White House, with political leaders from both sides of the House
on Capitol Hill, with mainstream opinion right across Irish
America and wider."
</P>
<P>
"We will be seeking continued support for our efforts, for our
particular view of the way these negotiations should go," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Adams also said Sinn Fein wanted a continuation of the very
balanced approach that U.S. President Bill Clinton had shown in
the conflict since he became president.

UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General conveyed his deep condolences to the death of
Princess Diana, said a statement issued today by the spokesman's

</P>
<P>
In the statement, Annan said the Princess made a major

the weak and the sick throughout the world. Her Unflinching
commitment to the cause of banning anti-personnel landmines not
only helped in placing that cause high on every humanitarian
agenda, but endeared the Princess to millions around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the tragedy has robbed the world of a
consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of
suffering children worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Annan also conveyed his deep condolences to the family of the
Princess, the Government and the people of the United Kingdom, and
to the families and friends of the others who died in the

<HEADLINE> Israel Still Punishes Palestinians: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Palestinian official
today brushed aside the Israeli claim to ease the closure on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip as "empty and meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Israel is still imposing a "collective" punishment on most
Palestinians, said Palestinian Minister of Information Yasser Abed
Rabbo after meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Jordan, during today's meeting Rabbo briefed
Majali on the latest developments in the region and the Israeli
measures against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel has relaxed a harsh blockade of the Palestinian
self-rule areas imposed following the July 30 suicide bombings in
Jerusalem, which killed 17 people and injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to the call from the international
community to alleviate the economic hardship of the Palestinians
incurred by the closure which cost millions of dollars in economic
losses every day for the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It was also regarded as a gesture to the U.S. in order to build
up pressure on the Palestinian National Authority to take efforts
to fight terrorism ahead of the pending visit to the region by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright will begin her maiden Mideast tour on September 9 in
an attempt to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which
has been stalled since March due to Israeli construction of a
controversial Jewish settlement in the traditional Arab East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Militia Still Trying to Force S. Leone Junta Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The decision of west African leaders
not to use force against Sierra Leone's military junta has not given
it a chance for a breathing spell as some local militiamen continued
their activities for restoring the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Traditional hunters known as Kamajors loyal to elected President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who was ousted in the May 25 coup, have occupied
the highway between Bo, the second largest city in the south, and the
northern town of Makene.
</P>
<P>
They set up checkpoints along the highway in an effort to capture
personnel and vehicles of the junta as well as its allied ex-rebel
group Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors beheaded four people who were suspected of being
soldiers and allies of the junta Monday in northern Sierra Leone,
the British Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The four were travelling in a commercial bus heading for Makene and
were taken at a Kamajor checkpoint in a village 25 miles from Bo.
</P>
<P>
All the four, including the driver identified as a retired soldier,
two men and a women, were executed and the vehicle impounded.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one of the passengers back in Bo this afternoon
as saying that the Kamajors had vowed to take Bo at any time.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen, said to be in an angry mood, told them that they
were only after the government soliders and RUF rebels, but the
civilians were free to travel without risk.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the brigade commander of the army in Bo admitted that
the Kamajors had occupied the highway but said his troops would soon
"flush them out".
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have been fighting with the military ever since the
coup, mainly in the southern areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Repeated fightings have been reported with the armed forces seeming
to gain more than the militia group.
</P>
<P>
The resistant activities of the Kamajors have intensified the
crisis in Sierra Leone, where the junta is facing tightened sanctions
and embargo imposed by west African countries aimed at forcing it to
step down.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The judge in the trial of
Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of
defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
</P>
<P>
In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Having Problems With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister tom
Ikimi today denied that Nigeria has problems with South Africa,
saying that the two countries enjoy cordial relations.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi told this to the News Agency of Nigeria in Pretoria,
where he held talks with S. African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in S. Africa on Monday to deliver a special message
from Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi accused external forces of trying to paint a false
picture of the relations between Africa's two major powers.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed sensitive issues of bilateral importance
with President Mandela and that his visit "should send the right
signal to the world that Nigeria and South Africa have nothing
against each other".
</P>
<P>
According to him, General Abacha and Mandela are in regular
contact and has worked closely to find solutions to several
continental problems.
</P>
<P>
Seeming to admit that the relations of the countries are not
without any problems at all, Ikimi further said,"Even the best of
friends could disagree on issues sometimes, but they remain
friends."
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Ikimi flied to Harare and held talks with
his Zimbabwean counterpart Stan Mudenge. He is also expected to
meet with Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who is also
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Ikimi's visits to S. Africa and Zimbabwe
are related with the meeting later this month in London of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG).
</P>
<P>
Both Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Mudenge and South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo are CMAG members.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to make its recommendations to the
October Summit of the Commonwealth of Nations in Edinburgh,
Scotland, on whether Nigeria will remain in the Commonwealth or
will be expelled.
</P>
<P>
When the Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in
November 1995 for executing Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists, it gave Nigeria an ultimatum of two years to improve
its human rights records.
</P>
<P>
While he was still in S. Africa, Ikimi urged Commonwealth
member countries to guard the ideals of the organization and
avoid it being used as a body for hounding other nations by some
other over zealous members.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed disappointment with the CMAG for holding
talks with Nigerian dissident groups abroad, many of whom, he
said, are responsible for Nigeria's problems.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Accuses US of Biased Mideast Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri today accused the United States of carrying out a
biased Mideast policy in favor of Israel, the Lebanese official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is unable to get out of the shadow of Israeli policies
on Middle East issues, Berri said during an interview with
Romanian TV. He is scheduled to begin visit to Romania, Armenia
and Iran on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Now that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 was
initiated and voted for by the U.S., the speaker asked "why can't
it be observed by Israel, whereas the U.N. sanctions it proposed
against Iraq and Libya can be completely implemented?"
</P>
<P>
The UN Resolution 425 demands Israel to withdraw its troops
unconditionally from south Lebanon it occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Berri said the Lebanese people enjoy good relations with the
Americans, but oppose American policies, because they are not in
the interest of Lebanon and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his top task for his visit to Romania, he said
he would first thank the Romanian people and government for
supporting Lebanon and the Arab world in their efforts to recover
the lands occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Romania and its people have sided with Lebanon and its
people in the implementation of the U.N. Resolution 425.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Have Independent News Agency: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- African countries had
offered more than eight million U.S. Dollars for the setting up
of an independent news agency for the continent, an official with
the United Nations said in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
Babacar Fall, seconded by the UN to run the process as
co-ordinator-general, said that the South African government
will also take part in the venture and was expected to make a
significant contribution.
</P>
<P>
The new enterprise will culminate from the privatization of the
Pan African News Agency (PANA), which was set up by the organization
for African Unity in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Fall said only 25 percent of the news agency would be owned by
African governments. The rest of the shares would be offered to
African nationals in the private sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Dakar-based PANA, which was wholly owned by OAU member
countries, has struggled since its inception because many states
failed to pay their dues.
</P>
<P>
OAU heads of state gave the go-ahead for PANA to be privatized
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Democratic changes have been sweeping across the continent, and
PANA has to change accordingly," Fall said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was hoped that the media in the private sector would be
the first to take up shares. Other commercial enterprises, such as
commercial and development banks, were also showing interest.
</P>
<P>
"The only restriction is that all the shares must be in the hands
of African nationals. We must keep the Africaness of PANA intact," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In July, a conference of African Information Ministers in Cairo
decided the privatization process had to be expedited. At that
occasion, a total of 6.7 million U.S. Dollars as pledged by
participating governments.
</P>
<P>
The amount had since grown to about 8.3 million U.S. Dollars and
was expected to rise further as some governments had yet to
decide on the amount they wanted to contribute.
</P>
<P>
The donators included South Africa, for which a number of
symbolic shares had been set aside, Fall said.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that South Africa will give more than some of the
smaller countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
PANA Press Limited will be established in Dakar on September 26,
Fall said, the news agency will need at least 150 staffers, and
offices would be opened in key cities as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Lifts Embargo on Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping
force in Liberia known as ECOMOG lifted a 30-kilometer embargo zone
along the coast of Liberia Monday, said a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate advantage of this action is that a "war risk"
insurance for charterers or owners of vessels calling at the Liberian
ports will no longer be applicable", the National Ports Authority
announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The move by ECOMOG is believed to be a result of a decision made at
the summit of heads of state and government of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The meeting which ended Saturday in Nigerian capital Abuja ordered
that all sanctions imposed on Liberia by ECOWAS will be lifted as a
result of the inauguration of an elected government in that country
in early August that ended Liberia's seven years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The summit also decided that ECOWAS will request the United Nations
and other members of the international society to do the same.
</P>
<P>
During the war, "vessels sailing to Liberia were doing so at risk,
thus paying huge insurance," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the war and the embargo, the free port of Monrovia now
handles less than five percent of its pre-war volume of freight, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"With the abolition of the embargo, vessels, especially main line
vessels can now sail to Liberia without any security risk," said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> More State-Owned Shares to Go Private in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will sell 250
million government-owned shares to the public on September 14 in
a bid to accelerate the country's privatization drive launched in
1994, a Kuwaiti official said today.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled sale of the shares valued at about 76.25 million
Kuwait dinars (254 million U.S. dollars) was within the
privatization plan of the state-run Kuwait Investment Authority's
(KIA), Fahad Rashed Al-Ibrahim, KIA chief manager said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted him as saying the share offering was
also aimed at implementing the second phase of privatizing KIA's
shares in Burgan Bank, one of the main commercial banks in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The shares, mainly for minor subscribers, will be sold to the
public at the price of 305 fils (a little more than one dollar)
per share. Al-Ibrahim added this batch of shares represents 34
percent of the total shares of Burgan Bank.
</P>
<P>
KIA, the state agency overseeing the privatization program,
has recently privatized 130 million shares of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, more than 2 billion dollars has been raised in the
privatization program which set out to sell state shares in some
62 companies and is due to be completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the program does not include the sale of any major
state-owned utilities, such as water and electricity, nor does
it include the key oil sector, which is the government's main
source of revenue, the manager said.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Photographers Sued for Death of Princess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite the discovery that the
chauffeur of the late Princess of Wales was drunk when death
descended on her Saturday night, the French judicial authorities
today did not let go the six photographers and one motorcyclist
who were caught pursuing her.
</P>
<P>
They were charged by the Paris Public Prosecutor for
"involuntary homicide and injury" and "non assistance to person in
danger."
</P>
<P>
The photographers are Nicolas Arsov of the Sipa agency, Jacques
Langevin of the Sygma agency, Laslo Veres, an independent
photographer, Serge Arnal of the Stills agency, Romulad Rat of the
Gamma agency and Christian Martinez of the Angeli agency. The
motorcyclist is Stephane Darmon of the Gamma agency.
</P>
<P>
Six of them were released in the evening but were put under
judicial control after being questioned by Judge Herve Stephan of
the Paris Investigation Court. They could face up to five years
in jail and 500,000 francs (83,400 U.S. dollars) of fines if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
After the Public Prosecutor of Paris and the Investigation
Court of Paris decided to begin legal proceedings against the
seven men, their employers and lawyers made an outcry denouncing
the authorities for picking up the photographers as scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
Hubert Henrotte, the director of the Sygma agency, said in a
protest statement published by daily le Monde today that his
employee Jacques Langevin was returning home "in his old car" when
he saw the incident taking place.
</P>
<P>
Out of "good professionalism", Langevin took out his camera and
took the pictures of rescue operation before being arrested by
police, said Henrotte.
</P>
<P>
William Bourdon, the lawyer of Nicolas Arsov, denounced the
decision of the judicial authorities as "justice Quai d'Orsay
(French Foreign Ministry) and justice spectacle, far from the
reality of the reproached infractions."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a French photographer who joined the chase for Diana
but was not arrested by police today told the German private
television channel Pro Sieben that before the chase began, the
chauffeur of Diana, Henri Paul, shouted to them: "You will not
catch us tonight!"
</P>
<P>
Paul was found to have an over high containment rate of alcohol
in his blood and was driving at 180 kilometer per hour (about 110
miles per hour) when he crashed the Mercedes into a pillar in an
underground tunnel by the Seine river in downtown Paris.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified photographer told the German television that
the Mercedes was "burning with maximum speed like a red fire" and
"took several sways." He said that it was speeding so fast that
the motorcycles could no longer catch it after entering the tunnel
by the Alma Bridge.
</P>
<P>
"While we heard the noise from the accident, we first thought
that it was a bombing attack, because it was like the noise from
the explosion of a bomb. In the tunnel, it was a real massacre,"
said the photographer.

UNITED NATIONS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. inquiry team
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could start its delayed
investigations on the alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees
as the country had dropped its objections, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said today.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Bizima Karaha, informed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by phone
on Monday that the U.N. human rights investigative team in the
Congo can begin its work," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The objections raised in a letter to the secretary-general
signed by two ministers of the government have been dropped,"
added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the United Nations was awaiting written
confirmation of this and the investigation team was making
preparation to start its work.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups and aid officials believe that thousands of
Rwandan Hutu refugees were killed by Kabila's troops and their
Rwandan Tutsi backers during their military fighting this year to
topple former President Mobutu Sese Seko.

<P>
ANKARA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police today
blocked six busloads of pro-Kurdish activists from entering the
capital Ankara, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Those activists planned to stage a sit-in in support of the
Kurds in Turkey and were stopped by the police near the border of
Ankara province.
</P>
<P>
The convoy then drove towards Istanbul, the country's largest
city where they set off from Sunday under a "Peace Train" plan.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has taken measures to block the plan,
which would take a group of pro-Kurdish Europeans to Turkey.
However, some of them have reportedly entered Turkey through
different ways.
</P>
<P>
In Sanliurfa in southeastern Turkey, security police stopped
seven buses carrying activists including European, U.S. and
African politicians and reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish issue is a long-standing problem annoying the
Turkish authorities, which also frustrated Turkey's bid for full
European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has been fighting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) since 1984, as the PKK seeks to establish
an independent Kurdish state in the southeastern region.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
warned Israel not to harm workers on a U.S.-funded road project in
the West Bank city of Hebron on the eve of the first visit to the
Middle East by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Palestinian workers who were working on the
project have been attacked by Jewish settlers with stones,
intended to disrupt the project sponsored by the USAID agency.
</P>
<P>
"These attacks on USAID workers are simply unacceptable and we
call on the Israeli authorities to ensure the security of those
working on the road, so that it may be completed as called for in
the Hebron agreement," State Department spokesman James Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred just a week before Albright is going to
take her first trip to the Middle East to address what she said
was the "crisis of confidence."
</P>
<P>
The road project is in Hebron's Shuhada Street, which links two
Jewish settler enclaves. The street is controlled by Israel but
inhabited by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel handed over most of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule
under a U.S.-brokered agreement in January. The city is inhabited
by 100,000 Palestinians with some 400 Jews residing there.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Block Missiles Delivery to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bluent Ecevit said today Turkey would use all necessary means to
block the delivery of anti-aircraft missiles purchased by Cyprus
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press prior to a government meeting today,
Ecevit said Turkey would closely monitor the Turkish straits
linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean by checking all ships
sailing through its waters.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said these measures are aimed at safeguarding the
security of Turkey. Earlier reports said the missiles might be
shipped to the east Mediterranean island through the straits.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed an arms deal in January with
Russia to buy 150 S-300 missiles. Turkey was enraged and
threatened to destroy the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government, however, repeatedly said its purchase of
the missiles was for defense, arguing that Ankara has no reasons
to block the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Russian side said it had no plan to give up the
arms contract, adding the delivery of the missiles would go ahead
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by Greek Cypriot seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- To settle the orphans
rendered by the 20-year long civil war, the Angolan government is
to build its war orphans' village in the central part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The village is to be built in Kunje district, about seven km
north of Kuito, the capital city of Bie Province in the central
plateau, the village planners said today.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the locals and some foreign donors
are pooling about three million U.S. Dollars are to be invested
on the orphans' village, which are designed to house about 500
children.
</P>
<P>
Kindergarten, residential houses, schools, hospitals, and
service facilities will be built in the village, according to the
village planners.
</P>
<P>
The idea to build the village was initiated by the Bie
Province locals in 1993, aiming to memorize those who have
contributed in avoiding blood-shedding, especially in Kuito and
Kunje.

<HEADLINE> UK House Price Inflation Scaled Back to 6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest mortgage
lender Halifax has scaled down its prediction for the country's
house price inflation this year, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
According to Halifax's monthly survey, house prices rose on
average by 0.5 percent to 68,881 pounds (110,898 US dollars) in
August, taking the annual increase to 6.4 percent, unchanged
compared with July and at its lowest level this year.
</P>
<P>
This led the bank to cut its 1997 forecast for annual house
price rises from 7 percent to 6 percent, which, it said, should
ease fears of the housing market overheating after large increases
in house prices reported in London and the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Halifax said that the lower rate of annual growth reflected
higher base interest rates, up one percentage point since the
election, and budget changes to cut the rate of mortgage interest
tax relief from 15 to 10 percent next April.

<HEADLINE> Germany Diary Of Nanjing Massacre Available In Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Xiuying was only 19 years
old in 1937 when she was almost stabbed to death by Japanese
soldiers in her hometown of Nanjing, but the young pregnant woman
survived after she was rushed to a hospital in a safe area.
</P>
<P>
Today, at the age of 79, Li's painful memories have come alive
with the publication of a diary written during the Nanjing
Massacre, when an estimated 300,000 Chinese died.
</P>
<P>
"Today we also want to show our heartfelt respect to Mr. Rabe
for his authentic records of the period," she said at a
publication ceremony, referring to John H.D. Rabe, the author of
the diary.
</P>
<P>
Rabe came to China as the general representative of Germany's
Siemens in 1931 and witnessed the Japanese invasion and the
soldiers' atrocities after they occupied the city in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Elected as chairman of the International Committee of the
Nanjing Safety Zone, Rabe, along with a dozen foreigners, helped
house 250,000 refugees and protected more than 10,000 women from
being raped by Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He was an eyewitness to the massacre and wrote a 500,000-word
diary and collected some 100 photos to prove that it was committed
by Japanese troops. He returned to Germany in 1938, where he died
of a stroke in 1950.
</P>
<P>
His diary was never made public until his granddaughter, Ursula
Reinhardt, showed it at a press conference in New York in December
last year. Then, Nanjing's Jiangsu People's Printing House and the
Jiangsu Education Publishing House signed a copyright deal last
April with a German a publisher to publish it in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"The diary and we survivors of the massacre are all
eyewitnesses to history, which nobody can distort," Li said,
pointing to a photo in the diary of the emergency treatment she
received.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Not Optimistic About Albright's Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan was not optimistic about
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's upcoming Middle East
trip scheduled on September 9, Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali said today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was also not optimistic about the result of Albright's
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Jordanian prime minister told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Netanyahu must feel unhappy with Albright because
part of her agenda may contradict with his.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not elaborate on the problems that
may possibly arise during Albright's maiden trip to the region,
which will take her to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and possibly Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Albright's trip to the region is aimed at reviving the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations which have been stalled
since Israel began the construction of the controversial Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Majali expressed the hope that the U.S. secretary
will urge all the parties concerned in the region to overcome the
obstacles facing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
To make preparations for Albright's trip, U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross visited the region in August and brought about
security meetings between the Palestinians and Israelis following
the double suicide bombings in West Jerusalem which killed 17
people and wounded 170 others.

One of the young men was shot dead inside the car and
another was found lying nearby.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A Vietnam Airlines plane
crashed today at Pochentong airport in Cambodia, killing all 66
passengers and crew members except one boy.
</P>
<P>
Four people were taken from the wrecked plane alive and were
rushed to hospital, all but the boy died on the way or after
arrival, the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a doctor at
Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh as saying.
</P>
<P>
The agency identified the lucky boy as of Thai nationality, who
suffered a broken right leg and a cut on the head. It said he was
not in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-built Tupolev-134, carrying 60 passengers and six
crew members, crashed at 1.55 p.m. (0655 GMT) into paddy fields
just off the Pochentong airport, which lies 10 kilometers out of
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The fuselage was completely torn apart and was engulfed in
flames. Bodies of victims were scattered in the rice field,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were believed to be foreigners, but
aviation authorities refused to release a detailed list of them.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, the victims were at
least 30 Chinese(including those from Taiwan and Hongkong), 23
South Koreans and other foreigners from Thailand, Vietman, Japan,
Canada, Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The plane was on flight VN815 from Ho Chi Minh City in southern
Vietnam to Phnom Penh. It crashed when it was trying to land in
pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
It is learnt that the "black box", the flight recorder, was
already found and an investigation into the cause of the crash is
under way. But officials said the weather might be to blame.

BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The baht plunged to an

leading commercial banks on spot trading once exceeded 37 baht
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The selling price at Bangkok Bank today once hit 37.56 against

Thai central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said that in
addition to the strong dollar, the psychological factor might also

He called on the public to remain calm.

The baht Tuesday was once traded at more than 35 baht against
the dollar, setting the previous record.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Up 0.5 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in
the U.S. increased by 0.5 percent in July, the best showing in the
past five months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the spending increased to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 598.7 billion dollars in July following a
0.1 percent gain in June, which was revised upward from previously
reported 1.1 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
The gain of U.S. construction spending last month was the
largest increase since last February.
</P>
<P>
The increase in July was led by a 0.9 percent increase in
residential construction which rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 259.9 billion dollars. Gains in remodeling and
single-family construction more than compensated for a drop in
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential commercial construction jumped by 1.2 percent
to an annual rate of 163.9 billion dollars. Gains in the
construction of factories, hotels and churches offset modest
declines in offices, shopping centers and private schools and
colleges.
</P>
<P>
Government construction fell by 0.7 percent to an annual rate
of 136.5 billion dollars. There were declines in highway and
streets and schools, but an increase in sewer construction.

<HEADLINE> Azeri President Orders Closer Cooperation with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September (Xinhua) -- Azeri President Geidar Aliyev has
ordered government ministries to strengthen their "partnership"
with the United States and develop bilateral cooperation in
politics, economy and security.
</P>
<P>
In a decree to "expand and deepen partnership" with the United
States, Aliyev instructed the government, the Foreign Ministry and
the central bank to work to ensure the implementation of better
cooperation between the two countries and to hand in quarterly
reports on their progress, Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president urged his office, the National Assembly and the
Foreign Ministry to open up dialogue in politics, economy and
culture with their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry to
work out a proposal for stronger cooperation with Washington over
Azerbaijan's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
(NATO) Partnership for Peace Program.
</P>
<P>
The president's order followed his visit early last month to
the United States, during which he and U.S. President Bill Clinton
issued a joint statement vowing to enhance the two countries'
"partnership" by promoting all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised Aliyev U.S. support for his country's bid for
membership in the Partnership for Peace Program and an early lift
of sanctions against the central Asian country imposed in 1992
during a war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the
Nagorno-Karabkh dispute.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Azeri national oil company signed eight
billion dollar deals with four U.S. companies on joint exploration
and drilling of Azerbaijan's oil fields in the Caspian Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), today decided to
allocate 100 million ECUs (130 million U.S. dollars) to prevent
further leakage from the Chernobyl sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
The EU move follows a decision at the Denver summit of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations in June to provide 300
million dollars of the overall 750 million dollars needed to make
the sarcophagus safe.
</P>
<P>
A team of international experts have found that the
sarcophagus, which covers Chernobyl Unit 4 nuclear reactor which
melted down in April 1986, is in dire need of repairs in order to
prevent radiation leakage.
</P>
<P>
The EU provides technical and financial assistance to the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant for reducing the negative social
impact of the closure of Chernobyl, which still employs 4,000
people.
</P>
<P>
It also provides medical help to the victims of the accident,
including treatment for thyroid cancer in children, and the
rebuilding of a hospital for children.
</P>
<P>
At the Denver summit, the G7 heads of states and governments
and the European Commission endorsed the setting up of a
multilateral funding mechanism to assist Ukraine in transforming
the existing Chernobyl sarcophagus into a safe and environmentally
stable structure.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Takes Measures to Boost Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea plans to bolster the
sluggish stock market through measures including cutting
stock-brokerage taxes drastically.
</P>
<P>
The government's tax-reduction package, to be formally
announced soon, will also include various incentives for foreign
stock investors, officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering slashing taxes on investors from
countries without agreement on preventing double-taxation, like
Japan and Germany. Investors from such countries are currently
required to pay 10 to 25 percent of their returns in taxes at home.
</P>
<P>
The government will advance, from October to this month, the
launching of a plan to raise the foreign stock ownership limit from
23 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a policy recommendation delivered to the MOFE Tuesday, the
Korea Securities Dealers Association (KSDA) asked the government
to suspend plans for massive sell-offs of Korea Telecom shares in
the second half of the year and called for expanding the issue of
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
"The government should make greater efforts to minimize new
public offerings in the second half," said the KSDA.
</P>
<P>
The government should be racking brains to work out far more
drastic steps as the stock index was unlikely to recover in the
immediate future, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the investors' disappointment with the delayed
market-boosting package, share prices edged down nearly 60 points
to a 690-level-low during last week.

China makes further progress after the 15th National Congress of

<HEADLINE> Minimum Income Guarantee For Chinese City Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council is
preparing to put in a minimum cost of living system in urban areas
before the end of 1999, according to a conference held by the
State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
A State Council circular issued a few days ago says that the
people covered by the system are permanent urban residents with a
per capita income that is below the local minimum cost of living,
which is set by local governments. Funding for this will come from
the local government.
</P>
<P>
As China moves toward a market economy, more employees of
inefficient state-owned enterprises have lost their jobs, but
their lives must be protected by a proper social security system
to help state-owned enterprise reforms, State Councilor Li Guixian
said at today's conference.
</P>
<P>
"This system is also a major step toward gearing the
traditional social security system to the socialist market
economy," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that with China's booming economy, state revenues
are on the rise and that provides a foundation for a social
security system to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, a minimum wage guarantee system has been
established in 206 Chinese cities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Announces Measures to Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
today announced a number of restructuring measures to stabilize
the country's economy following the rupiah depreciation against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, speaking after a limited
cabinet meeting chaired by President Soeharto, said the measures
were aimed at creating a balance in imports and exports, money and
capital markets, and budget and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
These included maintaining development momentum, continuing a
prudent fiscal and monetary policy by easing the monetary
liquidity and lowering interest rates stages.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said that in accordance with the current realities, the
government will soon start revising the budget.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the economy resulted in an equally significant
drop in state revenues from taxes. Based on the principle of a
balanced and dynamic budget, state expenditures will also be duly
adjusted so as to avoid a budget deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decreased budget, he noted, certain government
projects have to be postponed or rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also take concrete measures to
increase exports, including granting facilities to exporters and
other export supporting activities within the scope of existing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, to discourage imports, luxury sales tax on
non-vital goods will be raised.
</P>
<P>
Apart from state budget projects, he said added, all other
state projects including those of state-owned companies,
particularly with a high import content, will be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
National banks that are sound but facing temporary liquidity
problems will be assisted, he said, adding that banks which are
clearly unhealthy will be encouraged to merge or be acquired by
sound banks.
</P>
<P>
If this measure fails, such ailing banks will be liquidated in
accordance with existing regulations by giving top priority to the
interest of small depositors, he said.
</P>
<P>
To revive the unhealthy development of the local capital and
money market, the government also plans to abolish the 49 percent
limit to foreign investors in buying shares at the primary money
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister requested all related agencies to safeguard the
basic needs of the population and maintain price stability.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following the de factor
devaluation of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso in July.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the rupiah continued to weaken against the U.S.
dollar to drop below the 3,000 level and stock prices also fell by
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the depreciation of the rupiah has brought
serious impacts to the Indonesian economy.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Patients Urged to Eat Traditional Foods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's herbalist
Sithembile Moyo today advised people with AIDS to concentrate on
traditional foods as they are unrefined and consist of some
healing elements.
</P>
<P>
Moyo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that modern foods were too
refined with chemicals that destroyed the immune system, adding
that manufacturers should reduce the amount of chemicals in foods
or add traditional medicinal preservatives.
</P>
<P>
She advised manufacturers to include remedies to problems such
as acidity caused by labels.
</P>
<P>
The herbalist also urged people infected with AIDS to seek
early treatment from traditional healers so that their lives
could be prolonged.
</P>
<P>
While a remedy for the incurable infection which kills an
estimated 500 people in Zimbabwe every week had not been found,
she said, some traditional medicines could reverse the symptoms
and prolong life.
</P>
<P>
"People have to understand that these symptoms can only be
reversed at an early stage," said Moyo, adding, "Most people
visit us as a last resort when they are very sick. We cannot
help them because their immune system would have been destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Most traditional medicines worked on an immune system that was
still functional, but once this had been destroyed, treatment was
futile, she said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- UNDP Administrator James
Gustave Speth said here today that large-scale assistance will not
come forth until peace is established in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Describing his negotiations with Afghan Taliban militia as
constructive, Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP), said at a news conference here that the world body is keen
to help the people of Afghanistan "as much as we can."
</P>
<P>
However, Speth stressed that major international support for
Afghanistan will depend on a durable peace settlement and
establishment of effective institutions for development
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meetings with the Taliban authorities Tuesday
in Kandahar, a major city in southeastern Afghanistan, Speth said
matters pertaining to additional opening of schools for boys and
girls were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Donors are finding it increasingly difficult to provide funds
for a country that has been at war with itself for almost 20
years, said Speth who has been visiting the region since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The international community will be unable to find the funds
Afghanistan needs for rehabilitation and development until
fighting stops, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP, with offices in 132 developing countries, is the
world's largest multilateral source of grant technical assistance.

the regional emblem, surrounded by characters in red.
</P>
<P>
The provisional legislature passed a motion on the PLC emblem

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Sets Up Stock Market Supporting Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced
the setting up of a 60-billion ringgit (about 20.68 billion U.S.
dollar) fund to support the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, announcing the step,
said the money would be used to buy shares on the stock market
from Malaysians at a premium to the market price.
</P>
<P>
Shares from foreigners, however, would be purchased at market
prices, he told delegates ahead of the general assembly of the
ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) which will begin
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir later told a press conference that 30 billion ringgit
(10.34 billion dollars) would be raised through bond issues while
another 30 billion ringgit would be pooled from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
If the money is not enough, more would be raised, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken the move to help investors facing
problems following the sharp drop in shares prices due to
continued manipulation of the stock and currency markets by
foreigners, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said his country did not depend on foreign
parties to raise the money.
</P>
<P>
"We will raise the money locally and we will overcome the
problem in our own way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Today, persistent selling on the KLSE caused share prices to
close at a 50-month low with decreased volumes with the Composite
Index which opened at 797.06 points, falling to a low of 747.68
before holding to close at 750.76 points, 44.97 points lower than
the previous closing.
</P>
<P>
The main board ready turnover dropped slightly to 329.776
million shares valued at 1.217774 billion ringgit (about 419.9
million U.S. dollars) from 374.050 million shares worth 1.370312
billion ringgit (about 472.5 million U.S. dollars) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
KLSE chairman Nik Mohamed Din Nik Yusoff today called upon the
local investors to try their best to maintain the Kuala Lumpur
share market in line with Mahathir's call to support the local
bourse.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The first China Career
Development Award Program of The Chinese University of Hong Kong
(CUHK) has achieved remarkable success, the university said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the CUHK, the program
attracted 171 students this summer, who found the program
interesting and instrumental in understanding contemporary China.
</P>
<P>
The program, initiated by the university's Office of Students
Affairs with the assistance from the Office of Academic Links, was
the largest in scale among tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. It
aims to broaden the experience and perspective of the students by
providing them classroom and workplace training in China's inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the first part of the program, 100 students who
had completed their first year of study went to Beijing to have
four weeks of training on China's social-political and economic
system, with lectures and seminars in Beijing University, Qinghua
University and Beijing Administrative College.
</P>
<P>
And 71 other students were placed at offices of Hong Kong-based
companies, government or academic institutions in Beijing and
other cities in China's inland areas, for a six-week internship
program to acquire hands-on working experience in China.
</P>
<P>
Professor Kwok Siu-tong, University Dean of Students of The
CUHK, said the program provides an in-depth and comprehensive
exercise to enhance the students' understanding of China. It also
helps to shape one's personality, to discover one's talents and
lead to one's self-fulfillment, the professor.
</P>
<P>
The university plans to organize the program next year for more
students, the professor said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Pohang Iron and Steel Company
(POSCO), one of the biggest steel makers in the world, has decided to
raise the prices of six types of cold rolled steel sheets effective
this Saturday, September 6.
</P>
<P>
The new price rise would bring the price of general cold rolled
steel sheets to 409,000 won per ton (452 USD), from 388,000 won, up
5.4 percent, while prices of tin plated, electro-coated, and oriented
silicon steel will also rise 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prices of galvanized products and non-oriented silicon
steel will be boosted by 9 percent each and will now go for 495,000
won (547 USD) per ton and 502,000 won (555 USD) per ton, respectively.
</P>
<P>
POSCO said the boost in prices of those products have become
inevitable because their domestic prices have been much lower than
their international prices, which prompted a flood of buyers to POSCO
sales outlets when other domestic steel producers raised the prices on
steel products recently.

BONN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The offer price for the German
state's remaining 37.5 percent holdings in the German airline
Lufthansa will be issued on October 11-12 for the planned final
privatization phase of the company this year, the German
government said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The final offer price will be determined by an international
book building exercise led by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and SBC
Warburg, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the state's holdings totaled about 5 billion
marks (2.7 billion U.S. dollars) at current stock prices.
</P>
<P>
It said that subscription would start on September 29 and run
through October 10. German investors would receive a discount on
the offer price and priority allocation for early orders, it said

Under German law, shares owned by foreigners should not exceed
50 percent of Lufthansa's total equity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ramos Asks Congress to Stop Charter Change Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today asked the House of Representatives to stop floor
deliberation on a resolution calling for the convening of the
congress into a constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
Senator Leticia Shahani, vice president of the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party, said at a press conference that the president
made the decision after having a meeting with Lakas leaders and
key cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Ramos asked the lower chamber of the congress to give a greater
impetus to tackling vital economic, social and anti-poverty bills
instead of the charter change bill seeking to extend the terms of
elected officials including the president through a constituent
assembly.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahani said, President Ramos also underscored the
need to hold consultation among the various sectors of the society
to feel the pulse of the people on the issue of charter change.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for our people to be given the opportunity to
pause, to be informed and to reflect on the issue of charter
change, as well as on our economic condition, with greater
sobriety and calm discernment," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Shahani clarified that the consultation will not be used to
solicit support for the charter change move, adding that the
country's economic condition, particularly the plunge of the
Philippine peso and the rising interest rates, would also be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ramos took the step to diffuse the tension
resulting from the debates over charter changes. President Ramos
recently voiced his support for amending the constitution, thus
clashing with the opposition and Cardinal Jaime Sin, who called
for a rally on September 21 to express their anger at charter
changes.

He reiterated the need for strict adherence to the fiscal
requirements for Euro qualification, saying: "If the foundations
are sufficiently stable, then the monetary union would be really
positive for the future of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"But if not, the monetary union could prove to be a conflict
union in the long run."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that this did not mean that he was
speaking for or against delaying the Euro, adding that a
discussion over the issue was not appropriate for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Only in the spring of 1998 could the overall situation be
sufficiently assessed and decisions made on which countries would
be able to join the Euro, or whether there should be another
timetable, Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is due to launch the Euro on January 1,
1999. The first wave of countries to join the Monetary Union will
be chosen in the spring of 1998, based on EU states' full economic
data in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht treaty, countries wishing to join the Euro
club are required, among other things, to bring their budget
deficit to less than three percent and overall national debt to
below 60 percent of the gross domestic product.

</P>
<P>
The project will assist local businessmen in establishing
their warehouses to accept cotton and coffee and issue them with
receipts, he said.
</P>
<P>
These receipts could be used as collaterals by banks to extend
loans to the buyers to enable them to expand their business, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The fund would inject a further 7.0 million U.S. Dollars in
the project once it took off, the report said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Postpones Charter Change Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Jose
de Venecia announced here today that the lower chamber of the
congress has decided to postpone a bill calling for the convening
of the congress into a constituent assembly to amend the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We decided that we will postpone the consideration of
Resolution 40 to enable us to concentrate on the remaining bills
of national importance," de Venecia said after an hour-long
closed-door meeting with majority members from the ruling
Lakas-NUCD party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Fidel Ramos urged the House of
Representatives to set aside the charter change bill to give more
impetus to vital social and economic bills pending in the house.
</P>
<P>
The senators expressed their welcome to both the president and
the speaker's decision to shelve the bill seeking to extend the
terms of elected officials including President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the postponement of the bill would help diffuse
the tension recently arising from debates over charter changes.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Jaime Sin and the opposition have called for a protest
rally against the charter change move in Metro Manila on September
21.
</P>
<P>
However, some charter change opponents warned that the Filipino
people should be wary because the bill may be taken up again after
the rally when the congress reconvenes on September 29.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artists Encouraged to Produce Better Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Artists should work hard under
the principle of "good quality, high demand" and create fine works
of art for the people, a Chinese official has said.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, head of the Propaganda Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, made these remarks yesterday at
an award ceremony for books, songs, films, TV plays, and dramas.
</P>
<P>
Ding, also a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, said that theorists, artists and publishers should keep
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics in mind and should encourage people to commit
themselves in such construction by producing outstanding artistic
works.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin has suggested that artists create works
that are superior in ideological content, artistic quality and
good for appreciation, Ding noted, and added that artists should
make every effort in their pursuit of better work.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Propaganda Department began promoting "good books,
good songs, good movies, good TV plays, and good dramas".
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth award ceremony for this project. Some 227
works have won awards. The TV series "Deng Xiaoping" was given a
special prize.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the ceremony was Li Tieying, a political Bureau
member of the Party Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> US, GCC Trade Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The trade gap between the
United States and its main commercial partners in the Gulf
jumped by more than nine times in the first half of 1997, mainly
due to higher oil prices, according to official figures available
here today.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the United States and the six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member states surged to around 470 million
U.S. dollars in the first half of this year from nearly 50
million dollars in the same period of 1996, the figures by the
U.S. embassy here show.
</P>
<P>
GCC exports to the U.S. climbed to 6.24 billion dollars in
the first half of this year, compared with 5.62 billion dollars in
the same period of last year, while their imports rose slightly
to 5.77 billion dollars from 5.57 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts here said the increase in the GCC exports to
the U.S. market was caused mainly by higher oil prices. The bulk
of GCC exports to the U.S. are crude.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices averaged more than 19 dollars a barrel in the
first half of 1997, one of their highest levels in nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
The United States is a key importer of Gulf oil, receiving
around 2 million barrels of oil per day from the 16-year-old
economic, political and defense alliance which groups Bahrain,
Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Washington is also the second biggest single commercial
partner of the GCC after Japan.

<HEADLINE> Pioneering Spirit of Grain Producing Area Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun has
praised the pioneering spirit of "Beidahuang", where five decades
ago some ex-servicemen set up China's first group of state-owned
farms in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a recent forum to mark the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, Jiang, also a
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, said the "Beidahuang" spirit is part of
the nation's heritage.
</P>
<P>
"Today," Jiang said, "The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area has
become the largest group of mechanized state-owned farms in China,
and one of its most important grain and farm sideline product
production bases."
</P>
<P>
Its annual production capacity of grain is more than five
billion kg and it has produced 100 billion kg of grain for China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 15th National Congress of the CPC will guide
socialism into the 21st century and the CPC Central Committee and
the State Council will support development in the Heilongjiang
Reclamation Area.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes officials and people in Beidahuang will hold
high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and will unite around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and stick to the central
issue of economic development to improve the standard of
living.

The two sides inked the accord after another round of low-level
negotiations on September 2-3 in Cotabato city, the southern
Philippines.
</P>

The agreement was aimed at "giving further meaning and
substance" to a general ceasefire agreement the two negotiating

civilian refugees displaced by recent fighting in Pikit, North
Cotabato province and Pagalungan, Maguindanao province, according
to local media.
</P>
<P>
The accord also stipulates that government troops shall return

BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's 900 million rural
residents have become a more powerful consumer force whose
earnings, food consumption and living space were substantially
improved over the past five years, according to a survey report
from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The average net income of rural residents last year stood at
1,926 yuan per capita, 2.7 times that of 1991, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Their living expenditures also rose to 1,572 yuan, compared
with the 1991 figure of only 620 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the substantial increase in incomes, rural residents
have started showing more interest in higher quality, more
nutritious food. Their meat consumption increased from 12.15 kg
per capita in 1991 to 12.90 kg in 1996, and that of fruit
reached 15 kg per person last year, about 1.3 times that of
1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average living space reached 21.7 square meters
for every rural resident, up 17.3 percent from five years ago.
Compared to the earth and wood cabins dominating the countryside
decades ago, over 89 percent of the newly-built houses are made of
both brick and reinforced concrete.

Moreover, the expanding buying capability of rural residents
makes them a potential buyer for China's electronic industry. By
the end of last year, there were 88 televisions in every 100 rural
households, 63 percentage points higher than in 1991. A rapid
increase was also recorded in the purchase of refrigerators,
washing machines and cassette recorders in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that a great change also took place in the
buying mix of rural residents. In the rural households, the
proportion of food spending decreased to 56.3 percent of the total
incomes last year, 1.3 percentage points lower than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the spending on education, culture and
entertainment registered a 8.4 percent increase during the past
five years, indicating a substantial improvement of quality of
life in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Minister Urges More Japanese Investment in Central, West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- MOFTEC Minister Wu Yi expressed
hope today that Japanese enterprises would grasp this opportune
time to invest in the central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the seventh joint session of Chinese and
Japanese investment promotion institutions, Wu, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), expressed hope
that the Japanese business circles will take full advantage of
investment opportunities in China and better utilize their
technology.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
the development of central and western parts of the country and
has issued series of policies designed to encourage foreign
investment in related areas.
</P>
<P>
She noted that China is pleased to see that Japanese business
circles have exhibited keen interest in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Central and western China covers an extensive area featuring
abundant natural and labor resources, as well as great potential
for development of agriculture and mining industry, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
She described the regions as "full of hope," and noted that
various cities there have established industrial infrastructure
and integrated industrial systems.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who also serves as president of Sino-Japanese
Investment Promotion Council, expressed her belief that Japanese
enterprises will distinguish themselves based on abundant funds,
advanced technology, vast experience and their country's
geographical and human advantages.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources note that investors from more than 170
countries and regions have participated in the highly competitive
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment has grown rapidly over the past two years,
with Japan topping the list of countries and areas investing in
China.
</P>
<P>
Projects under discussion indicate that China and Japan will
expand cooperation in capital- and technology-intensive fields,
and in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that the two nations should place priority on
common interests in order to ensure the smooth development of
bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Problems should be resolved through equal consultation, Wu
said, adding that any discriminatory action will damage
cooperation and infringe on the interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ikeura Kisaburo, president of the Japanese-Chinese Investment
Promotion Council, said Japanese enterprises have great investment
potential in China.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that greater efforts will be required to
fully display the potential in line with China's policies on the
use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The 300-odd participants in today's meeting included Chinese
officials and leaders from 48 Japanese business groups, including
Panasonic, Sanyo, Canon and Mitsubishi.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Proposes Expanded Reform of Rural Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture
recently issued "Proposals for Expanding the Reform of Township
Enterprises" urging accelerated reform to ensure the sustained,
rapid and healthy development of rural industries.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the proposals is to further accelerate reform of
the property rights system by introducing cooperative
stock-holding and joint stock systems, as well as merger, outright
sales and bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of reform is to establish a modern enterprise
system for township- and village-based firms, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
However, reform must fully respect the will of farmers,
according to the document which emphasizes that various forms of
reform can be adopted, and the value of collectively-owned
properties must be safeguarded and increased.
</P>
<P>
The document also clarifies the relationship between rural
enterprises and local administrations by separating the functions
of each.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Build First Riverine Container Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The construction of Bangladesh's
first riverine container port will soon begin, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of land and preparation of engineering drawing,
the initial phase of the 3.55 billion taka (about 80.68 million
U.S. dollars) project has just been completed.
</P>
<P>
The container port will be located at Pangoan on the Buriganga
River in Narayanganj District.
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan has provided
the project with 230 million taka (about 5.23 million dollars) to
procure land and prepare drawing for the project.
</P>
<P>
The container terminal to be built on an area of 89 acres
(about 36 hectares) is expected to handle a maximum of 160,000
containers per annum.
</P>
<P>
When the container terminal is built, ocean-going ships,
particularly those feeder ships from Singapore and Colombo, would
be able to anchor there, marking a new era in the export and
import business.
</P>
<P>
Besides, this would also reduce congestion and transportation
cost otherwise needed for carrying goods from Chittagong and
Mongla Port either by train or by truck.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Adopt More Incentive Export Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government will
provide incentives to encourage exporters and entrepreneurs to
boost the country's exports, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Any discrepancy in the export-led growth strategy will be
addressed, the newspaper, the Independence, quoted Bangladesh
Commerce and Industry Minister Tofael Ahmed as saying.
</P>
<P>
A proposal for import of raw materials and capital goods
without opening L/Cs (letter of credit) has been endorsed by the
Commerce and Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the new export policy is to cope with the free
market economy and sustain in the international market by
competing with the products of other countries, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce and Industry Ministry has already identified some
sectors like tea, leather and garments, Tofael said, adding that
his ministry has given special emphasis to exploring new export
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
The government is pursuing very liberal export-import policies
and a new policy, to be declared soon, will have short lists of
items banned for export and import, the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
Tofael said the government is not taking any unilateral
decision about the import and export policies, rather it is taking
recommendations from the business community.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the ministry is going to formulate a
five-year policy replacing the present two-year policy in order to
enable the business community to make long-term plans for
production and exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry emphasized the need to include
strategies in the policy for the export of more value-added
products, diversification of export products, quality and
packaging improvement, increase of productivity and market
expansion.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Condemns Terrorist Operations in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Egypt strongly condemned terrorist
operations committed against the Algerian Muslim people.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that those operations have nothing to do
with Islam but are rather "criminal massacres," according to the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed confidence that the Algerian government is
capable, with the help of the Algerian people, to face up firmly
to those terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Egyptian government's full support for
Algeria's stance towards the massacres perpetrated against the
Algerian innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Arab Interior Ministers' Council Tuesday also expressed concern
over the current incidents taking place in Algeria and declared
its full backing to all efforts adopted by President Liamine
Zeroual to uproot terrorism from the North African country.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Bin Mohammed el-Salem, the Council secretary general,
said on the sidelines of a meeting to draft an anti-terrorism
agreement, that the Algerian government "has all the potential to
fight political violence."
</P>
<P>
In the single worst slaughter in nearly six years of violence
in Algeria, 256 died in the massacre in Sidi Rais, just south of
the Algerian capital of Algiers, overnight last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government blamed the fundamentalists for the
violence. About 60,000 people have been reportedly killed since
the government in January 1992 scrapped a general election
dominated by the radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).

<HEADLINE> Extended Drought to Reduce Fall Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The extended heat wave since
late August has caused drought in areas north of Yangtze River and
will reduce this fall's harvest of maize and cotton, according to
scientists from the China Meteorological Science Institute.
</P>
<P>
When compared to corresponding periods in previous years,
rainfall amounts throughout the country were between 50-90 percent
lower in late August. Most areas in Northwest and North China, as
well as in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River
Valley and the Sichuan Basin recorded a rainfall of less than 10
mm.
</P>
<P>
Average temperatures in the regions were some two to three
degrees centigrade higher than corresponding periods in previous
years, and as a result created drought conditions across the
northern section of the country.
</P>
<P>
Scientists noted that the widespread drought will adversely
affect the irrigation of maize, and hinder the maturity of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predict that the drought will continue through
the first ten days of September in spite of increased rainfall in
some areas in Northeast and south China.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) today failed
to forge a general ceasefire agreement in their seventh low-level
talks.
</P>
<P>
But they signed another accord on hastening the return of
thousands of war evacuees in the southern province of Cotabato and
Maguindanao, the official Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the government-MILF peace panel said they
will meet again at an unspecified date to "finalize" the ground
rules of the general ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the two-day meeting in Cotabato city, Ghadzali Jaafar,
MILF deputy-chief for political affairs, declared that both sides
had already agreed "in principle" on the guidelines of the
proposed truce.
</P>
<P>
However, in the statement, the peace panel said "the ground
rules shall be finalized during a scheduled meeting on a later
date."
</P>
<P>
The MILF is now the largest anti-government Muslim force
operating in the southern Philippines, with an estimated 25,000
armed members.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Cases Down in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of leprosy cases
in Uganda declined from 1,645 in 1995 to 1,511 in 1996, with its
prevalence rate of 0.76 cases in every 10,000 people, a local
paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
This rate surpassed the target rate set by the World Health
Organization (WHO) of one case in every 10,000 people, according
to today's "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
Decrease of outbreaks of new cases of the disease was a result
of introducing a new cocktail treatment, the report said, adding
that a total of 10,566 patients have been cured since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The declining of the disease is benefited from the joint
efforts of Uganda National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program and
the German Leprosy Relief Association.
</P>
<P>
The most successful region in the fighting against the disease
is the south and southeast of Uganda. But still, there are 17 out
of total 45 districts in the country remained the problem areas.
</P>
<P>
Districts Arua in the northwest, Lira and Kitgum in the north
account for 30 percent of new cases in the whole country. Arua
and Kitgum districts are the rebel-haunting areas. Experts
attribute the spreading of the disease to refugee movement.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Index Makes Biggest Single-Day Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's blue chips went
through the largest day-to-day fluctuation today by rocketing
nearly 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, which traces the 33 blue chips listed on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, shot up 978.66 points today to close
at 14,713.99. The second sharpest rise was recorded on June 20
this year, when the benchmark index soared 647.87 points in a
single day.
</P>
<P>
Today's surge of 7.13 percent from the previous session was
however not the biggest in terms of percentage gains.
</P>
<P>
Turnover reached about 34.6 billion HK dollars (4.4 billion
U.S. dollars) today, the eighth heaviest in history. The Hong Kong
bourse has created all its top 10 turnover records since August 7
this year, with the highest hitting 46 billion HK dollars (5.9
billion U.S. dollars) on August 29.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic rebound today followed yesterday's big rally of
309.68 points, after a free-fall of 2,018 points in three
consecutive working days that wiped out all the gains made this
year.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts contributed the strong momentum in Hong
Kong to an overall rebound on global stock markets triggered by a
rise on Wall Street. They seem to maintain an optimistic view of
the stock market, which has recently been riding on a roller
coaster, as the economic fundamentals in Hong Kong remained strong
and other major determining factors, such as the U.S. interest
rates, remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices soared across the board, led by property and bank
stocks, whose sub-indices advanced by 1,401.11 and 1101.92 points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises Index, which reflects the
performance of 34 Chinese state-owned firms listed in Hong Kong,
rebounded sharply by 17 percent, or 193 points, to cover all the
losses on the previous trading day. The Hang Seng China-Affiliated
Corporation Index, a key indicator of red chips, also bounced back
by 422.17 points to close at 3.691.77.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Respected in Hangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Gong Baoxian, an old man in
the capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province, always brings
along his red senior citizen's discount card when he goes out.
</P>
<P>
"With this card, I can visit any park in Hangzhou free of
charge," he says with a satisfied air.
</P>
<P>
Similar to an identification card, it has the words "Card
Prescribing Preferential Treatment for the Elderly" on it.
</P>
<P>
"I got my card from the street residents' committee. Every
person over 70 has one," Gong said, proudly pointing to his card.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has issued more than 80,000 such cards, according to a
city official in charge of elderly people's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has about 240,000 people aged over 60 in the urban
areas, which accounts for 14.5 percent of its total population. It
is one of the few aging cities in China.
</P>
<P>
To carry forward the long-time tradition of paying special
attention to old people, the Hangzhou Municipal Government has
taken measures in the past few years to guarantee the rights of
its senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy special treatment when we go out," said Du Yixin, an
old man who resides in Zhaohui newly-built residential area. "To
go to West Lake I have to change buses, but it costs me only two
jiao."
</P>
<P>
The bus ticket in Hangzhou is half of one yuan, but senior
citizens need only pay one jiao (about one US cent).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the special treatment on buses, old people in
Hangzhou aren't charged for use of public toilets, registering in
hospitals, boating on West Lake, visiting Lingyin Temple, museums
and memorial halls, or receiving legal advice.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the elderly can get a discount of 50 percent in
cinemas, stadiums and theatres in daytime.
</P>
<P>
"It really pleases us that we can visit any park and scenic
spot of the like in the urban areas free of charge," Du
said. "Retired people should go out into nature to build character
and improve the body."
</P>
<P>
Du, who came to Hangzhou to live with his son, said that
because of this special treatment, he and his wife might visit a
scenic spot near West Lake every day.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou has built an old people's park, a rarity in China,
with an investment of five million yuan (about 0.6 million US
dollars). The park has been open to the public for half a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The interior ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will soon meet here
to tackle the growing drug-related problems in the region, a
senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly National Press Club Forum Meet, Philippine
Interior and Local government Secretary Robert Barbers said the
ministers will focus their discussions on ways of mapping out a
common strategy to combat the growing drug menace to the region.
</P>
<P>
Barbers did not give an exact date for the meeting, according
to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which is currently chaired by the Philippines, also
groups Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Laos,
Myanmar and Vietnam. Myanmar and Laos were admitted by the
grouping in July.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing campaign against this social menace, the
drug-related problem has reached "an alarming proportion" both in
the Philippines and in the ASEAN region, Barbers said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures released by the anti-drug authorities, Barbers
said at least 1.7 million Filipino youth are now drug addicts, a
sharp rise from the level of 20,000 recorded in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Barbers also noted that drug lords and drug syndicates in the
country are now raking in a staggering 250 billion pesos (eight
billion U.S. dollars) annually by engaging in such illegal
activities.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Six photographers and one press motorcyclist, who were in
the first-tier box in the accident of Alma tunnel which killed
Princess Diana, were accused by Judge Herve Stephan of the Paris
Investigation Court of "non-assistance to persons in danger,
involuntary homicide and involuntary injury."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Liberation, Jacques Langevin, one of the
accused photographer of the Sygma agency, said that he felt like
"falling into a trap."
</P>
<P>
-- According to information obtained by Liberation, the
Algerian government has negotiated with the Islamic Salvation
Front for a ceasefire with it and its armed wing, the Islamic
Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
Algiers was apparently angered by the announcement last weekend
by the FIS leader Abassi Madani to the United Nations Secretary
General that he would appeal for a stop of violence, because
Madani, released recently from jail, was supposed to make the
appeal on state television.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The debate over the privatization of France Telecom and Air
France has divided the Socialist government headed by Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, who has to choose between economic
efficiency and the hardline position of some ministers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, by reaffirming his opposition to any privatization
of Air France, Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot, who is
from the Communist Party, is risking to bring a breakdown of the
management to the company, as President of Air France Christian
Blanc has threatened to resign if the government does not agree
with the merger of Air France and Air Inter.
</P>
<P>
-- The German daily Bild Zeitung has denied a report by the
Associated Press that it had bought the photos of a dying Diana
taken after her fatal accident on August 31 in Paris. The
Hamburg-based daily, which has the largest circulation in Germany,
Tuesday published two photos taken on the site of the accident,
but none of them had any sensational images.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Won't Replace Soldiers in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria police officers will
not replace the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG)
operating in Liberia, the New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper quoted Defense Headquarters spokesman,
Col. Godwin Ugbo, as saying Tuesday that ECOMOG operations in
Liberia had been a full military exercise from onset.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it had nothing to do with introducing police from
Nigeria and other west African countries in Liberia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to reports several
weeks ago that the Nigerian police had drawn up lists of its
officers and men detailed for the exercise in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue was not raised at the 20th summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which ended at
the weekend in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to Col. Ugbo, there were instances where the United
Nations wrapped up their military operations in peace keeping
with inputs from the police.
</P>
<P>
However, "the inclusion of the police in wrapping up some
United Nations operations is normal, as the police assist in
cases of investigations but such is not the case with ECOWAS,"
the spokesman explained.
</P>
<P>
With the last lap of ECOMOG operations centered mainly on
training of the armed forces of Liberia and policing of its
borders, the military was in a better position to carry out such
duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, sent to Liberia in 1990 in the heat of the country's
civil war, has succeeded in disarming and demobilization of the
warring factions, which finally led to the end of the seven-year
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
It is originally planned that ECOMOG will leave Liberia six
months after the elected government was put in place last August.
</P>
<P>
But as the job of restructuring and training of the Liberian
army and police has not begun, the tenure of ECOMOG's stay is
expected to be extended, pending request from the Liberian
government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished a little higher against the U.S. dollar after the release
of June national accounts data today.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a reduction in official interest rates is
weighing on the market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 72.72 U.S. cents, up
from 72.65 locally late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released today
showed that Australian real gross domestic production on an
average basis rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent in the
June quarter, making an increase of 3.2 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said they did not expect the result to change the
Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) current easing bias towards
monetary policy and they predicted the bank would ease again by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The financial market had been talking of the possibility of a
rate cut this morning, following yesterday's RBA board meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 88.24 Japanese yen
from 88.31, and against the German mark, it was at 1.3369, from
1.3242.

chi Minh City to Phnom Penh on Wednesday, one in the morning and

JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Three drug couriers were

a total of 196 condoms filled with cocaine in their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted a police spokesman as saying that the three

<HEADLINE> August Stock Turnover Down in China's Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The stock indices tracking
the performance of companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
rose in August but trading declined, according to the latest
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Stock Index closed at 1,221.06 points at the end
of August, up 2.63 percent from July. The SSE-30 index, which is

by nearly 20 percent from the previous month to 84.133 billion
yuan (about 10 billion US dollars).

were spurned by investors last month, analysts noted, saying this
is a reflection that Chinese investors are maturing.
</P>
<P>
Trading in B shares, which are issued in China but reserved for
overseas investors, expanded to 3.48 billion yuan in August,
nearly 3.62 times that of July. The index for B shares surged 14.6
percent from July to end at 83.55 points.

trading in state treasury bonds reached 51.8 billion yuan and 19.8
billion yuan, respectively, in August. The figures were almost
unchanged from July.

<HEADLINE> Vandals Cause Pipeline Fire in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Fire caused by unknown vandals
has gulped a petrol-carrying pipeline in southwest Nigeria's Ogun
State since late Saturday, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
As at Tuesday, the fire has not been put out, raising afresh
the issue of fuel crisis in the west part of the country, as the
pipeline was carrying petrol from the Warri refinery to Lagos and
other west states.
</P>
<P>
According to Alhaji Haruna Abubakar, Managing Director of the
Pipeline and Products Marketing Company, the fire may have been
ignited by "some vandals in the process of cutting through the
pipeline to steal the products".
</P>
<P>
Oil industry observers are now disturbed by rising cases of
pipeline vandalization by criminals, local media said, adding
that this year alone, about 40 cases have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that given the rising attacks on pipelines, he
would recommend to the government to impose death penalty for
those caught in so doing.

<HEADLINE> Australian Official Calls India Priority Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer said here today that India is now a priority
market for his country and trade between the two nations is
expected to double to 2.8 billion U.S. dollars over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Although exports of major commodities such as coal, wool and
pulses would continue to underpin Australia's trade, further
opportunities are expected to emerge based on complementarities
between the two economies, particularly in the fields of
automobiles, telecommunications and services, the deputy prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the 5th Australian-Indian Joint Ministerial
Commission (JMC) meeting, Fischer, also the minister for trade,
said trade in goods between the two countries is now running at
over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Indian Minister of State for Commerce B. B. Ramaiah
said there is considerable scope for strengthening commercial ties
through improving market access, examining possibilities of joint
ventures and increasing direct investment.
</P>
<P>
He cited food processing, information technology, software,
pharmaceuticals and the wool industry as areas where new
opportunities might open up for further joint venture projects.
</P>
<P>
India's high growth path and its economic reform process offer
tremendous prospects for Australian investment, particularly in
its infrastructure and mining sectors, Ramaiah said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, which ended today, the two
ministers also discussed Australia's tariffs on textile, clothing
and footwear products.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued today, the two ministers welcomed
the growth in services trade, particularly in the area of
education.
</P>
<P>
Australia is now the second most preferred destination for
Indian fee-paying students, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rapists to Face AIDS Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, troubled
with increasing rape cases and AIDS patients, may force all
convicted rapists to receive HIV/AIDS tests in order to inform
the victims, local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The compulsory measure was on cards following approval in
parliament's Justice Committee on Tuesday of new laws against
aggravated rape, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee had asked the Department of Justice to prepare a
report on the possible criminalization of deliberate acts by
HIV/AIDS sufferers where these endangered the lives or safety of
others.
</P>
<P>
The instruction was made during the endorsement in principle
by all parties in the Justice Committee of the Criminal Law
Amendment Bill, which provides for life imprisonment for a
scheduled of "heinous crimes".
</P>
<P>
These include aggravated murder, rape and armed robbery.
Aggravated rape includes serial rape, gang rape and rape by a
person knowing he was HIV/AIDS patient.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress and Opposition parties,
including National Party, Inkatha Freedom Party and Democratic
Party, have endorsed the proposals.
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS cases in South Africa is expected to
increase dramatically over the next 10 years and more than 90,000
AIDS-related death are predicted next year, according to a latest
medical survey.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse is that rape, which put victims in more
dangerous position in the process of sexual intercourse by AIDS
carriers, has in recent years become one of major crimes in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities said that last year witnessed at least
12,938 cases of rape and attempted rape, 88 of statutory rape and
1,083 of indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of rape had increased almost 20 percent, which
was described by security and medical officials as "an alarming
phenomenon" in the country.

LAUSANNE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Olympic
Committee of South Africa (NOCSA) admitted on Wednesday it had
offered to fly the 20 International Olympic Committee African
members' wives to Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
"Only three or four wives accepted," NOCSA treasurer Kurt

whatever. It was done openly and documented. We wanted to give
wives the chance of sharing in what may be an historic occasion."
</P>
<P>
Africa has never staged the Games.
</P>
<P>
The committee paid for first class return air tickets. It did
not pay hotel bills.
</P>
<P>
Bidding cities are limited to making gifts worth 200 dollars to
IOC members.
</P>
<P>
"It was not a secret," Hipper said. He said Cape Town
represented an African bid supported by the Supreme Council for
Sport in Afrca and the Organisation for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Town Bid Committee had denied on Tuesday it had
offered to pay for the trip.

<HEADLINE> Agassi's Title Dream Faded at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United
States failed to reach the semi-finals when the former world
number one was ousted by 13th-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia
in four-set 6-3, 7-6(7/4), 4-6, 6-3 in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loss ended Agassi's Cinderella dream of matching his 1994
title run, in which he became the only unseeded player in the open
to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who was called by Pete Sampras as title favorite, had
missed this year's other Grand Slam events, skipping the
Australian Open to rest and being sidelined from Wimbledon and the
French Open with an injured wrist that kept him out for two months.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had slumped to 63rd on the world rankings, his lowest
level in 11 years. With the loss in the U.S. Open, his ranking
will take another tumble.
</P>
<P>
Agassi called his serve "horrendous" and said he did not play
well until he was too far behind. And he also expressed that the
ATP ranking was not something he thought much about. "Never have,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Grasslands Emerging as Major Ecological Zones in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's vast grasslands, which
cover 400 million ha., or 40 percent of the nation's total land
area, have emerged as increasingly important ecological zones.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent national symposium on animal husbandry
held in Urumqi, Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang Yanxi said that
major problems in pastoral areas are related to population,
resource management and environmental protection, with the key
problem centered on maintaining a sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that developing animal husbandry represents the
best choice for ensuring sustainable development in pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister noted China ranks second in the world,
following Australia, in terms of grasslands coverage.
</P>
<P>
The 14 million ha. of grasslands planted in China in recent
years have played an important role in improving the ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
China's grasslands extend northwards and eastwards from the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the western end of the Greater Hingan
Mountains. The green belt not only plays an important role in
water and soil conservation at the sources of Yangtze and Yellow
rivers, the country's two longest rivers, but is also extremely
important in blocking severe winds and sand moving, as well as
controlling the climate and purifying the air.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that vegetation coverage on the Qinghai-Tibet, Loess
and Inner Mongolia plateaus has a great influence on surface and
groundwater resources in northern and eastern parts of China, as
well as Yangtze and Yellow river basins.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Moving Forward with Confidence: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa said
here today Hong Kong is moving forward "very well" after the very
smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
"All the three branches of our government in Hong Kong -- the
executive, the legislature and the judiciary -- are all working
very well. We are moving forward with pride and confidence. Hong
Kong is moving forward very well," Tung told reporters after
having separate meetings with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim here.
</P>
<P>
He said he explained to the Malaysian leaders that the fact is
the transition has been "very smooth".
</P>
<P>
Referring to Hong Kong-Malaysian ties, Tung said Hong Kong had
very important trade relationship with Malaysia, which is growing
at about 25 percent per annum. "It is important relationship which
we want to strengthen," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we also have important relationship with
ASEAN nations with trade growing at 21 percent per annum over the
last five years," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Malaysia this year takes the chair of the ASEAN
nations so "it is appropriate for me to be here as the first stop
of my overseas trip and to have the opportunity to talk to the
prime minister and the deputy prime minister."
</P>
<P>
On the situation of currencies of Southeast Asian nations which
are under speculative attacks, Tung said it was something sad, but
he believed that the sky will be clear after the rain.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR chief executive described his discussions with the
Malaysian leaders as "very useful".
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here earlier today on a two-day visit to Malaysia,
his first overseas trip since assuming office after China resumed
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.

<HEADLINE> China's Shanghai Keen to Develop Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
financial and economic center, will make greater efforts to
develop its capital market in order to meet the requirements for
being an international metropolis, a municipal planning official
said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the major economic objectives, Shanghai must invest
an annual average of 200 billion yuan in fixed assets in the next
few years, the official said, adding that the total value of such
investment can be greater than one trillion yuan for the whole
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, Shanghai will invest some 300 billion yuan
in infrastructure construction, including the building of the
Pudong International Airport and a second subway system.
</P>
<P>
Three multi-billion dollar projects will be launched in the
coming years in the Pudong New Area, an emerging financial and
trade district.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put Shanghai's needed investment in
ecological and environmental projects to the end of this century
at more than 40 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that a huge amount of funding is also
required to build new houses with a combined area of 10 million sq
m in order for the living space per urban resident to reach 10 sq
m.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the reform of the state-owned sector, which accounts
for 70 percent of the municipal economy, also needs a considerable
financing, the municipal planning official said.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Yields Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Previously feared rampant
spending on construction of the multi-billion Three Gorges
Hydropower Project on the Yangtze River, the largest of its kind
in China, have not transpired due to effective control over
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
In fact, four billion yuan has already been saved during first
phase construction which commenced in 1992 and is scheduled for
completion in November this year when the river is dammed for
construction of the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Only 27 billion yuan of the projected 31 billion yuan has been
allocated to date and the project, which is proceeding ahead of
schedule, is fulfilling all quality requirements.
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmei, vice-chairman of the Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee under the State Council and general manager
of the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation, offered the information during a recent interview
with Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that state investment in the project is expected to be
90.09 billion yuan if calculated on the basis of price levels in
1993 and the figure will top 200 billion yuan when considering
inflation and interest on loans.
</P>
<P>
He noted that people have for decades questioned the ability
for control of investment, and whether or not the project will
eventually become a so-called "black-hole" for investment.
</P>
<P>
Successfully curbing expenditures has enabled the Chinese
people and both domestic and overseas investors to gain confidence
in the project, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
He attributed successful control over investments to
improvements in the country's macro-economy which has in turn
reduced inflation and bank interest and has created a sound
investment environment for the massive project.
</P>
<P>
Three billion of the total four billion yuan saved during the
first phase was the direct result of falling inflation and bank
interest, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
Market mechanism introduced to the project saved an additional
one billion yuan, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
The Development Corporation is the legal entity responsible for
project construction, fund-raising, repayment of debt and eventual
operations and management.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has adopted international practices such as
the bidding and contracting systems, on-site supervision and
contract management systems, has comprehensive competition.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of international practices has enabled the project
to obtain the honor of having the best cost-effective engineering
teams, materials and equipment, according to Lu.

<HEADLINE> Poor Mountain Area Turns Into Rising Economic Center (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The "village of fine
buildings," located in the heart of Dabie Mountains, one of the
most impoverished areas in China, is once again living up to its
name after decades of being covered with thatched huts.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a forest of pine trees and a clear river, the
village is dotted with row upon row of newly-built brick-and-tile
buildings. Nearly half, or 240, of the families in the village
have built their own homes, and the rest of the villagers plan to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The village got its nickname when a local landlord built a
two-story house in old China -- a tremendous accomplishment in
an area where people did not have enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
For years, the building stood out amid the cluster of
weather-beaten houses made of straw and earth, occupied by
ordinary farmers.
</P>
<P>
But recently, more and more farmers in the Dabie mountainous
areas have replaced the traditional thatched dwellings with
brick-and-tile bungalows and later with multi-story buildings.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that this poor land is catching up with other
parts of the country and heading for prosperity," said Huang
Haisong, an administrative commissioner of Xinyang Prefecture,
which is situated north of the Dabie mountains.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has 18 poverty-stricken
areas, 16 of which are mountainous, with a combined population of
58 million, who are in need. Dabie Mountain, which borders Henan,
Hubei and Anhui provinces, is one of them. Some 4.93 million
people living there have been left nearly destitute because of
poor transport facilities and a shortage of money, information and
expertise.
</P>
<P>
During rimes of war, the Dabie mountain area served as a
revolutionary base.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year anti-poverty drive launched by the central and
local governments has increased local farmers' annual income in
Xinyang Prefecture to 1,356 yuan (163 US dollars) and reduced its
poor population from 2.57 million to 473,000 by the end of last
year, Huang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1986, the central government has sent more than 30,000
agro-scientists to help spread 2,600 practical farming skills,
which has turned the Dabie mountainous area into a rising economic
center in central China.
</P>
<P>
With expertise imparted by the experts, the mountain range has
become a "green bank" which can help raise peoples' income with
little investment. Fur, Ginkgo, chestnuts, tea, fish and turtles
are inexhaustible sources of income.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of the people in Xinxian County, formerly the
most impoverished region in Dabie Mountain area, have quadrupled
their annual income by growing fruit and processing mountain
products.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese company has invested 24 million yuan (2.9 million US
dollars) to build a tea processing workshop with an annual
production capacity of 600 tons. A Ginkgo processing plant will
soon be built in the county with 320,000 US dollars of World Bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has led all other areas in Henan province in
economic growth for three years running and is expected to gain an
annual growth of 13 percent in gross domestic product for the
coming four years.
</P>
<P>
It plans to lift all local poor people out of poverty next
year, hitting the national target two years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Huangchuan, a riverside county, got wealthy from water,
emerging as the largest duck-breeding center in China, raising six
million ducks every year.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the county used British loans to build a joint venture
which includes a hatchery, a breeding center, a fodder plant and a
duck down factory. Half of the venture's products are for
export. Its pre-tax profit is to reach 35 million yuan (4.2
million US dollars) after completion of an expansion project in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructures in Dabie Mountain area have been improved
markedly in recent years to keep up with economic growth. Two
trunk railways, which link Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Kowloon,
run through the area. Three national highways and an expressway
have been extended to the area. And a power plant with a capacity
of 600,000 kw is being built in Xinyang County.

PHNOM PENH, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A Vietnam Airlines plane
carrying 60 passengers and six crew members crashed today at
Pochentong airport, killing more than 60 people on board, an
airline official said.
</P>
<P>
Three people survived, the official said. Witnesses said that
one injured person was rushed away to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a rescue operation was under way.
</P>
<P>
Initial figures put the death toll at 63.
</P>
<P>
The crash left the wreckage in the paddy fields just off the
airport, which lies 10 kilometers from Phnom Penh, sending into
the sky a huge plume of black smoke. The fuselage was completely
torn apart.
</P>
<P>
It was not known if anyone on the ground had been killed, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Russian-built Tu-134, was reportedly on a flight
from Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam to Phnom Penh. It was
trying to land in pouring rain when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain and strong wind was thrashing at Phnom Penh at the
time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
A Vietnam Airlines official in Phnom Penh said one of its
planes crashed. But the airlines' officials in Hanoi, capital of
Vietnam, could not give immediate confirmation of the accident.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Tackle Diplomatic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today received a message from his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel on the solution of the diplomatic crisis after
expulsion of ambassadors from each side in February.
</P>
<P>
The content of the letter has not yet been published but it is
believed to be an important message concerning the resumption of
full diplomatic ties between Ankara and Tehran, a well-informed
source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Ali Tuyagan, deputy under-
secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, who arrived here
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Mohsen Amin-Zadeh, Iranian deputy foreign
minister in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs, before delivering the
message to the Iranian new president this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Tehran relations took a sour turn in February as
the two governments ordered to kick out envoys from each side
within a week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry ordered Turkish ambassador Osman
Koruturk and Consul General Ufuk Ozsancak leave Iran in a
tit-for-tat measure against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between the two countries began when Ankara
protested to Tehran in early February about Iranian ambassador
Mohammad Reza Baqeri for his reported comments in favor of
Islamic law at an Islamist rally in the Ankara district of
Sincan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fights Against Hot Island Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- This east China metropolis
has beefed up its efforts to fight against the "hot island effect" by
increasing its afforestation rate and controlling the total number
of motor vehicles in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, more than 700 ha of public green
space has been added to Shanghai's landscape, an amount that
equivalent to the total built in the previous two decades. The municipal
authorities also raised the quotas for the area to be covered by
plants in each residential quarter.
</P>
<P>
While strictly reining in the total number of motor vehicles,
the city also set stipulations on the installation and use of air
conditioners, another major urban heat source.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the "hot island effect" first appeared
in Shanghai in the 1980s, as a result of the growing population,
increasing number of buildings, surging consumption of energy, and
shrinking green space and water surfaces.
</P>
<P>
The problem was exacerbated in recent years with the growing
popularity of glass exterior buildings, motor vehicles and air
conditioners.
</P>
<P>
Remote sensing photos and statistical charts show that there is
a clear line of demarcation between the temperatures of the
downtown and the outskirts. On a clear and windless summer day,
the urban temperature can be 4.5 degrees centigrade higher than
the suburban.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorologists have suggested several measures to
alleviate the situation, such as curbing the construction of new
highrises, expanding the area of urban green space and controlling
heat emission from industrial enterprises and motor vehicles and
air conditioners.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Institutions Part of China's Financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- As more foreign-funded
financial institutions set foot on China and their business
continues to expand, they have proved an indispensable part of the
country's booming financial industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the Export Import Bank of Japan opened its office in
Beijing to become the first foreign financial body in China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first half of this year, 540 foreign-funded
financial institutions had been set up in 23 Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, all economically-developed areas have
overseas-funded financial bodies which have been involved in many
of the pillar industrial sectors in China, such as energy, steel
and iron, telecommunications, automotive-manufacturing and
petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
Of these foreign-backed financial institutions, banks are
making an eye-catching advance. By the end of June, the total
capital of overseas banks in China stood at 32.96 billion US
dollars, with 23.08 billion US dollars in outstanding loans and
3.99 billion US dollars in remaining deposits.
</P>
<P>
These banks, with well-operating foreign-funded enterprises as
their main clients, normally produced profits in their first or
second year of operation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, the People's Bank of China, the central
bank, approved eight foreign bank branches in Shanghai's Pudong
New Area to open RMB yuan business, and one more was added to the
list early this year. Up to now, seven foreign bank branches have
started the business, which has been operating smoothly so far.
</P>
<P>
A local economist observes that the entrance into the Chinese
financial market by foreign banking institutions has helped lead
China into market-oriented and standardized management concepts
and operational systems and means.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it has further perfected and deepened the
functions of the Chinese financial market, pushed forward the
reform in the country's foreign exchange controlling system, more
effectively enlarged the scale of indirect financing in the
country, and bolstered direct investment by foreign investors, the
economist says.
</P>
<P>
He also points out that the arrival of foreign financial
institutions has brought about changes to China's financial
industry, motivated local banking bodies to accelerate their
restructuring pace, and created a reasonable level of competition
in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Protects Nature Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has effectively improved the protection of nature
reserves in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of nature reserves has almost tripled from 30 to 87
over the past five years, with the total area growing from 1.34
million ha to 1.71 million ha and accounting for four percent of
Yunnan's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has five national, 40 provincial and 42 prefectural
nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of natural reserves has become an important
way to protect wild flora and fauna and the environment in a world
in which related resources are under an increasing threat." said
Shi Jiwu, an official with the provincial Committee for the
Protection of Wild Animals and Plants.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, an inland province lying at a low latitude, boasts an
abundant array of wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that Yunnan is home to 1,638 species of wild
vertebrates and more than 15,000 species of higher plants, or 40
percent and 50 percent of China's total respectively. Some 199
(59.4 percent) wild animal and 151 plant (42.6 percent) species
are under national protection.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's nature reserves provide a haven for wild plants and
animals, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
Protected nature reserves have raised the number of Asian
elephants to 250, Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys to over 600, gibbon to
over 400, and takin to over 300.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya's Opposing Parties Committed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The majority members of
parliament from the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU)
and the Opposition have reiterated their commitment to dialogue
over constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
At the on-going second meeting of the Inter-parties
Parliamentary Group (IPPG) which opened here on Tuesday, 92 MPs
declared themselves the only legal entity to spearhead dialogue
effectively.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting which is going on this morning
passed a resolution binding themselves to the process of
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says, "we are unequivocally committed to the
current dialogue on legal, administrative and constitutional
reform through the Inter-parties Parliamentary Group".
</P>
<P>
Assistant Minister Jone Osogo who chaired the meeting pointed
out that those attending the meeting had not been forced or
coerced to do so but were guided to look for ways of saving Kenya
from sliding into anarchy.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Minister Nicholas Biwott from the ruling party told
the meeting that dialogue between the opposing sides was the only
way out for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Another Cabinet Minister Simeon Nyachae noted that KANU MPs
had had consultations on the reform issues and had endorsed
dialogue among the members of parliament to facilitate changes.
</P>
<P>
Kijana Wamalwa, chairman of the opposition Ford-Kenya, said
that the overwhelming majority of Ford-Kenya members back
dialogue and reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyans want to sit and discuss reforms but not to throw
stones over reforms," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting is discussing, among other things,
constitutional, legal and administrative reforms, peace and
security in the country, and the general elections to be held
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting was held last Thursday and resolved to
appoint an Inter-parties Parliamentary Committee of thirteen
members to coordinate the IPPG activities and meetings.
</P>
<P>
The committee was renamed the Coordinating-Working Committee
of the IPPG which is composed of members from the ruling party
and opposition parties Ford-Kenya, Ford-Asili, Democratic Party
and Kenya Social Congress.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's meeting, the dialogue between the ruling
KANU and Opposition parties brokered by religious leaders had
stalled after KANU refused to talk to the National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC), an umbrella body of Opposition parties,
saying that the body was not elected.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries Need to Close Agro-Industry Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) need major
structural adjustment to close the labor productivity gap between
agricultural, industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
A SADC report said the gap made the sectors stand like two
worlds far apart with a significant decline in both production
and employment in the agricultural sector, local press today
reported.
</P>
<P>
The SADC report attributed poor labor productivity in
agriculture to negligence by policy makers who put all the
emphasis on manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Productivity Key to Sustainable Development in
SADC", the report indicated that attaining a balance in labor
productivity between agriculture, manufacturing and services in
SADC economies was crucial to prepare the countries for the
challenges of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Most SADC member states were still struggling to meet basic
human needs to alleviate absolute poverty, the report said,
adding that the shift to manufacturing and services had to be
accompanied by improvements in agricultural production and
especially subsistence farming.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural productivity in the region was low not only
because of large numbers of people still being employed in the
sector but also because of inappropriate technologies, poor
organization and limited physical and human capital inputs,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that SADC member states must in
priority take measures to curb food insecurity through improved
agricultural output per capita. The earlier this happens, the
sooner they will be able to focus resources on new projects and
eventually move to industrial, secondary and tertiary sectors.

<P>
WUHAN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The recent completion of the
first-phase project of the Mount Wudang National Forest Park
provides a new must-see destination for visitors to this sacred
mountain of Taoism, a traditional Chinese religion.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-ha forest park has 50-some scenic sites of human and
historic interest. Visitors can also find more than 50 rare
species of animals such as snub-nosed monkeys, giant salamanders,
and macaques, as well precious plants.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the park started in 1992, said park manager
Wang Nongji, and more than seven million yuan (843,000 US dollars)
has been invested in building high-voltage power transmission lines,
communications and transportation facilities, and a
4,000-sq-m hotel.
</P>
<P>
The park has received about 10,000 visitors since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The second and third phases of the project require a total
investment of about 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars), Wang
said, adding that foreign funding is likely to be used.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The east China city of Xiamen
is seeking funds to continue the renovation of a 1,300-year-old
temple which has been damaged repeatedly by fire or in wars.
</P>
<P>
The Fantian Temple, constructed during the Sui Dynasty
(581-618), attracted large numbers of religious pilgrims. Major
fires have twice broken out there, and some remaining buildings
were eventually removed during the "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
The city government decided in 1991 to place the temple's
reconstruction on its agenda, and the project started three years
later.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase work reportedly has been finished, with more
than 12 million yuan of donations, partly coming from overseas
Chinese. Four main rooms have been rebuilt, which are linked by
corridors and bell-drum towers, as well as a road leading to the
temple and a square named after the temple.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase work is now under preparation. The total
funding for the whole work is estimated at 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
An inauguration ceremony of Buddha images of the temple will be
held on September 24.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Supports Grain Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has allocated 5,000 million shillings (about 8 million
U.S. dollars) to beef up the nation's Strategic Grain Reserve
(SGR), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru, Chairman of the
Special National Food Shortage Committee, as saying the SGR has
been directed to increase the national food reserve to avert the
impending food shortage following delays of the long rains in the
country.
</P>
<P>
After his recent visit to drought hit areas, Ngombale-Mwiru
said that food situation in the country is bad. He cited Arusha
region as an example, which can only supply 52 percent of its
food needs and the deficit has to be imported from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He asked Tanzanians to preserve food "because the shortage
will haunt us until February or March next year," saying the 13
regions hit by drought will need 916,000 tons of food.
</P>
<P>
Ngombale-Mwiru, who doubles as the Minister of State in the
Prime Minister's Office responsible for Mass Media and Policy,
urged an immediate halt to those smuggling food across the
borders. "We cannot allow these people to starve our people
because of their greediness," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Exports to Uganda Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's exports to Uganda
dropped by 12.5 percent from recorded 280.7 million U.S. Dollars
in 1995 to 245.5 million Dollars last year, the East African
Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya remains the biggest exporter to its western
neighbor, accounting for 33.6 percent of Uganda's market share.
Uganda's total imports were worth 729.4 million Dollars last
year, the report quoted governmental data as saying.
</P>
<P>
Britain maintained its position as second major exporter to
Uganda, with a market share of 14.18 percent or 103.5 million
Dollars of goods.
</P>
<P>
There was a general decrease in Uganda's level of imports due
to the country's emerging industrial sector, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, like other countries, mainly exports industrial goods
to Uganda, whose own efforts to develop its industrial base in
the 1970s and the first half of 1980s were devastated by wars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President to Attend Summit on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe will leave here this afternoon for Arusha, Tanzania to
attend a two-day summit to discuss economic sanctions imposed on
strife-torn Burundi in July last year.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said Mugabe was invited to the meeting,
to be attended by leaders of the Great Lakes region, in his
capacity as the current chairman of the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
He will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Stan
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere
will present a report on the negotiations for the restoration of
democracy in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The talks were aborted on August 25 this year, after Burundi's
Tutsi-led government accused Nyerere, the mediator in the
conflict, of being both the judge and the jury in the war which
has left over 150,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions were imposed on Burundi on July 31 last year, a week
after Major Pierre Buyoya's military junta seized power from
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, in a bloodless coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
A report on the ministers's technical committee meeting held
in the Ugandan capital, Kampala on August 16 this year will also
be presented during the Arusha meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Technical Committee on Sanctions on Burundi comprises
foreign affairs ministers of Zambia, Tanzania, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Releasing Israeli Spy Impossible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has made it clear that it is impossible to overthrow an
Egyptian court decision that has convicted an Israeli of spying.
</P>
<P>
He was defending the judiciary verdict of the Azam Mot'ab Azam
case against the Israeli criticism that the ruling is unobjective,
according to Egypt's leading Al-Ahram daily today.
</P>
<P>
The Higher State Security Emergency Court sentenced Azam, an
Israeli textile engineer accused of spying for Israel, to 15 years
in prison at hard labor on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The court decision is unappealable and Azam could only be
released at the amnesty of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Moussa was quoted as telling reporters here Tuesday that the
espionage case is not a topic that concerns Egypt and Israel only,
but rather a phenomenon existing in all countries.
</P>
<P>
"Any spy gets his or her punishment whether he is an Israeli
spy working in the U.S. or Egypt or any country else," said he,
adding that none of the spies can enjoy a special standing.
</P>
<P>
The same court also ruled that Azam's Egyptian colleague, Emad
Abdel Hamid Ismail, be imprisoned for life.
</P>
<P>
Two Arab-Israeli women Zahra Youssef and Mona Ahmed Shawahnah,
standing trial in absentia, were also sentenced to life
imprisonment on charges of recruiting the Egyptian for spying for
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence, to undermine Egypt's national
and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, maintaining Azam's
innocence on Sunday, called for his release. Netanyahu called the
case "a most serious development in Israeli-Egyptian relations"
but he denied bilateral ties would deteriorate because of it.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel but ties have never been warm. The spy case, however, added
to the tensions in the context of the Mideast peace deadlock.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest City Bids for World Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China is working to get its
oldest city of Chengtou -- perhaps the oldest city in the world --
included on UNESCO's world cultural heritage list.
</P>
<P>
To this end, China is to set up an archeological research
center in Lixian County of Hunan Province, where the
6,000-year-old city was built.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was held this summer to discuss how to make the
oldest city famous worldwide. Experts discussed the significance
of the site and suggested that China apply for the honor at UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
Centered around Chengtou hill, the city was first excavated in
1974. Archeologists have found completely preserved sites and
abundant relics, including well-designed houses, a moat and tombs.
</P>
<P>
They have also found a massive stretch of farmland out of the
city where eight types of rice are believed to have been planted
6,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now the site is called the "Research Center for Chengtou Hill
Prehistoric Culture."
</P>
<P>
The city, together with other ancient sites discovered in the
region, has provided important clues for the origins of city,
agriculture and even the human civilization as a whole, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The site has attracted scholars and tourists from Japan, the
Republic of Korea and the US over the past years. In 1995, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin inspected the site and inscribed a sign for
it.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Supports Development of Ecology-farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Hard work and a spirit of
determination are required in the fight to protect the
environment, today's People's Daily quoted President Jiang Zemin
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper carries the full text of Jiang's comments on an
investigation report by Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun regarding the
drive to control soil erosion and develop ecologically-sound
agricultural programs in northern Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that the long-term efforts of different
generations to promote afforestation, to green the deserts and to
develop ecology-oriented agriculture may eventually change the
existing environment.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was pleased to read the investigation report and
considers the northern Shanxi's experiences in the field have been
good.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that many areas in Shaanxi province, which had been
the seat of 13 ancient dynasties including the dynasties of Zhou
(770-221 BC), Qin (221-207 BC), Han (206 BC-AD 265) and Tang
(618-907), were fertile and prosperous in the past.
</P>
<P>
War conflicts, natural disasters and random tree cutting in
modern times which caused severe desertification, are held greatly
responsible for the slowing down of the economic and cultural
development, President Jiang noted.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Stresses Water-Soil Conservation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Today's People's Daily carried
a frontpage editorial calling for the conservation of water and
soil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "To Re-establish the Splendor and Beauty of
Our Mountains and Rivers," says that the campaign is an important
strategic decision made by the third generation of leadership of
the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
It says that prior to the convening of the 15th National
Congress of the CPC, which opens on September 12, President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng along with other Chinese leaders have
asked the nation to control soil erosion by planting trees and
establishing an ecologically-oriented agricultural program.
</P>
<P>
They want to "rebuild northwest China into a region with
beautiful mountains and rivers," the paper says. The region now
has a severe soil erosion problem.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that the work relates to the realization of
the country's socialist modernization, as the environment is
the basis for human existence and development, as well as for the
development of the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
It adds that after 40-odd years of hard work, China has planted
34.25 million hectares of trees, harnessed 700,000 square kilometers
of eroded land and 30 million hectares of desert.
</P>
<P>
The work has helped improve the environment, develop the
agricultural sector and increase farmers' income, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
However, it notes, some 3.6 million square kilometers of land,
or 38 percent of the country's total territory, suffer from soil
erosion, and some 2.62 million square kilometers of land, or 27.3
percent of the national territory, have been
desertified. Moreover, an additional 2,460 square kilometers of
land is desertified every year.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that it is fully possible to recapture the
beauty of the mountains and rivers in the northwest, because the
region had for a long period been prosperous and covered with
trees.

<TEXT>
<P>
It says that some 2,000 years ago 50 percent of the Loess
Plateau in the northwest was covered by forests, and the rest was
fertile grassland. According to historical documents, the region
had many mountains and forests in ancient times and people made
their houses out of wood.
</P>
<P>
The article says that over the past 40 years, particularly in
the past dozen years, the poor environmental conditions of some
cities and counties in the region have been tackled. This
demonstrates that with the active participation and support of the
people, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, all the
faces of the mountains and rivers will be changed, and poverty
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The article says that to beautify the mountains and rivers,
people should reach a common understanding that protection of the
environmental protection means the protection of the productive
forces, and that a sound environment is the basis for the
development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the environment is the lifeline for agricultural
development and human existence," the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
It asks the people to concentrate on the difficult work of
harnessing the land by fully using the advantages of the socialist
system.
</P>
<P>
The CPC leadership should play the key role in the work which
will benefit future generations, it says, adding that cadres at
various levels must take the lead.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that as the work is not easy and will take
a long time, it must begin next winter and spring so
as to achieve noticeable progress soon.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's environment will have a brand new appearance
with the efforts of cadres and the people, and the target set by
CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin will no doubt be reached," it
concludes.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Supports Development of Ecology-farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
asked that measurable achievements be made over the next 15 years
in harnessing soil erosion on the Loess Plateau, in a move to
bring the Yellow River under control in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In his comments on a report by Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun about
harnessing of soil erosion in northern Shaanxi Province and
developing of eco-agriculture, Li said the Yellow River, which
runs through the Loess Plateau, brings large amounts of silt to
its lower reaches and causes floods, a problem which has long
plagued the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
However, the river has been calm in the past 50 years since new
China was founded, as a result of comprehensive harnessing plans,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
The damming of the river for the Xiaolangdi Project offers good
opportunities for water and soil preservation on the plateau, he
said. More should be done to afforest wasteland, develop an
eco-agriculture plan, and beautify the northwest region, as
President Jiang Zemin instructed.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier was asked to present a program on the
harnessing of the Loess Plateau for examination and approval of
the Party and the State Council, Li said, adding that the project
of harnessing the river course at the lower reaches and of
reinforcing dykes and dams should receive equal emphasis.
</P>
<P>
The once barren Yan'an is now covered with lush greenery, while
Yulin Prefecture, which suffered from serious desertization, now
grows rice thanks to construction of a shelterbelt and ground
water tapping. Northern Shaanxi will probably become one of the
country's most prosperous regions with a beautiful landscape, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Exports Register Big Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The turnaround in the global
electronics demand has helped the Philippines improve its export
performance in the first seven months of this year with an
increase of 22 percent in export income over last year.
</P>
<P>
"Income from merchandise exports for the first seven months of
the year improved by 22 percent to 13.763 billion U.S. dollars
from 11.276 billion dollars last year," the National Statistic
Office said in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The office said that for July alone, export shipments posted a
21.8 percent gain as receipts reached 2.063 billion dollars,
surpassing the 1.694 billion dollars in 1996 by 369.67 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Electronics and components, accounting for 37.9 percent of the
aggregate export revenue for July 1997, remained as the top dollar
earner with receipts valued at 782.69 million dollars, or 23.3
percent higher than the year-ago level of 634.92 million dollars,"
the office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that exports of articles of apparel and clothing
accessories, cornering 11 percent of the total, inched up 2.4
percent to 227.20 million dollars in July.

Receipts from input, output and peripheral units, representing
8 percent of the total, increased 1,303.9 percent to 165.8 million
dollars from 11.81 million dollars last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that the devaluation of the Philippine
peso by 16 percent since July 11 and the increasing demand of
electronics in the world market could help the country improve
further its export performance this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Singapore are the Philippines
major trade partners.

<HEADLINE> Luxury Buses Running in Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 3 (Xinhua) -- As high-grade roads are being
extended in the remote province of Heilongjiang, officials there
are on a shopping spree for luxury buses to make road travel both
quick and cushy.
</P>
<P>
On August 21, the first batch of 22 luxury coaches, each with a
price tag of two million yuan (240,960 US dollars), were put into
operation by a company affiliated with the Provincial Transportation
Department, thus unveiling a plan calling for fine-quality and fast
transport on highways.
</P>
<P>
The new buses, which run between Harbin, the provincial
capital, and Jiamusi, Hegang, and Shuangyashan, can cut the
previous travel time by two thirds, and are 50 percent faster than
the railway speed. The cost of a luxury bus ticket is equal to
that of a hard-seat train.
</P>
<P>
More such buses, which provide service likened to that on an
airplane, are expected to be put into use by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that by the year 2000, about 200 luxury
coaches will be in use, including some on a route linking Harbin
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
With the opening to traffic of four new roads in August and
October, the length of quality highways in this northernmost
region of China will reach 1,666 kilometers. In the coming three
years, 3,000 kilometers more will be added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Baht Plunges Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Continued dollar-buying
dragged the Thai currency further down to a record low of 35.20
baht to the U.S. dollar in local spot trading on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the Thai currency sank below the 35 baht
level against the greenback, a 36.49 percent plunge from 25.79
baht per dollar prior to its floatation on July 2.
</P>
<P>
The baht was traded at 34.90 to 35.20 per dollar, compared with
34.55 at the close of trading on Monday. The offshore baht was
quoted at 34.28, down from 34.40.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand set its reference rate for the greenback
at 34.452, up from 34.330 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, no signs of central bank intervention have been
detected.
</P>
<P>
Heavy dollar-buying caused tight liquidity, forcing banks to
raise their interbank lending rates, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has continued to absorb cash out of the market
through the repurchase window, hoping to prevent banks from
selling baht in favor of the rising dollar.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attribute the slide to widespread fears over
ongoing political and economic uncertainties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Satian Tantanasari, senior vice president of Thai Danu Bank's
treasury department, said that the baht was hit by an extreme lack
of positive news to drive the market.
</P>
<P>
A dealer from Nakornthon Bank said investors decided to buy
dollars as they do not know what will happen in future.
</P>
<P>
Siri Ganjarerndee, assistant governor of the Bank of Thailand,
admitted that the bath's weakness reflects a deterioration in
investor confidence regarding economic and political stability.
</P>
<P>
The controversial draft of Thailand's new constitution, which
aims to put an end to patronage system and stop money politicking,
is scheduled to be debated in parliament starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although public sentiment is to support the draft, the
government, which is seeking amendments to it before putting it to
vote, has not indicated it will vote for it.
</P>
<P>
If the draft is rejected by the National Assembly in the vote,
possibly before the end of the month, the draft will have to be
decided upon by a nationwide referendum, which, many people fear,
may lead to confrontation between opponents and supporters of the
draft.
</P>
<P>
There have also been other speculations such as a coup,
dissolution of the parliament, and resignation of the prime
minister, although Prime Minister Chavalit Yonchaiyudh himself has
denied all these rumors.
</P>
<P>
A dealer from Standard Chartered Bank said that the market was
driven by strong demand for the greenback as Thai corporations
continued to buy dollars to change their foreign-currency debts
into baht.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the stock market, after declining continually for
almost a month, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index on
Tuesday showed a rapid rise to close 21.53 points up, or 4.36
percent, to finish at 515.37 points.
</P>
<P>
While an analyst said the rise in the SET index was driven by
speculative purposes, a report in The Nation, a local newspaper,
quoted today an analyst at a local security house as saying,
"while the baht is still taking a further nose-dive, the SET index
is rising. I'm not sure which theory should be applied to explain
the situation now."

<HEADLINE> China Urges Teachers To Set Moral Example for Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
said here today that all Chinese teachers should set good moral
examples for their students by demonstrating their enjoyment for
the job and putting an end to corporal punishment for errant
students.
</P>
<P>
According to revised regulations on professional morality for
primary and high school teachers, the teachers must do their job
well and behave appropriately, a spokeswoman for the commission
noted.
</P>
<P>
She said that the current trend among some teachers to worship
money, seek pleasure and pursue personal interests must be
stopped, and the teachers are banned from inflicting physical
punishment of any kind on students.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they are not allowed to trade their job for
selfish purposes, and to discriminate against students, she added.
</P>
<P>
She explained that although there are already many good
teachers, the overall morale should be improved to meet the fast
development of the sector.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that educational departments and schools will
create a system to supervise the teachers' moral performance.

<HEADLINE> Pak-Indian Talks Likely in Late September: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The next round of the
foreign secretary level talks between Pakistan and India is likely
to resume some time during the second half of this month,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Pak-Indian foreign secretary level talks in
the month of September, as agreed by the two sides in the second
round of such talks here in June, "cannot be ruled out," the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"At least Pakistan is ready to go into the third round of talks
even if India tries to backtrack on some key issues," they said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary level talks
in March after a hiatus of three years amid signs of improved
relations between the two arch rivals in South Asia. The Talks
broke down in January 1994 due to their differences over the issue
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The officials, however, said that India had reportedly proposed
September 10 to 13 as tentative dates for the start of the third
round of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"But we think the talks, if going well, will take place around
September 14 or afterwards," they said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the dialogue process between Pakistan and
India will resume after the forthcoming meeting of the prime
ministers of the two countries in New York, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart I.K. Gujral are likely to meet on September 23 in New
York, where they will go for the U.N. General Assembly meetings on
September 22, a local news paper reported today.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Promote Exports of Nine Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is to step up its
promotion for exports of nine categories of products in a bid to
expand the country's overall export business.
</P>
<P>
More promotion will be added to exports of crustaceans, chewing
gum, sweets not containing cocoa, alcohol and tonic drinks,
processed food, mirrors and glass, facsimile machines, cement,
printing and paper packaging, the Commerce Ministry said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the products totaled 28.46 billion baht (1.14
billion U.S. dollars) in value in 1996, down 0.7 percent from
1995, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first six months of this year, shipment of
these products reached 17 billion baht (680 million dollars), up
10.4 percent from the same period of last year, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The increase showed that there was a great potential in export
of these products due to their high value-added content, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local newspapers today said that the ministry is
also planning to give promotion to export miscellaneous items like
perfume sprayers, ribbons and buttons.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Women Leader Praises Chinese Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chisinau, Moldova, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the
Moldovan Women's Federation Ludmila Scalnii said China has become
a prosperous country, and is now ranked as one of the most
advanced countries in Asia because of its reform and opening
policy.
</P>
<P>
Scalnii, who has visited China three times, told Xinhua that
she went to China for the first time when she was 17 years old. At
that time, she said, China was facing many social and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 and 1995, she also visited China. During that time,
since Chinese leaders had been carrying out reform and the opening
policy, China had made great progress.
</P>
<P>
"I am very glad to see that shops in China are filled with high
quality Chinese goods, while some European countries are full of
Western-style commodities, which is disadvantageous to their own
economies." Scalnii said.
</P>
<P>
Being chairwoman of the women's federation, Scalnii said
Chinese women have made their own contribution to Chinese reform
and the opening process. She also praised Chinese women for paying
close attention to educating the next generation and making sure
the young continue to grow in strength and good health.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Deaths Increase in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 44,500 people
were killed in transportation accidents in the United States last
year, up from 44,437 the year before, said an official report
today.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board reported that highway
and air accidents were the main cause to the increased deaths, and
as usual the roads were the biggest killer, claiming 41,907 lives,
up from 41,798 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials
estimated that as many as one-third of the accidents and
two-thirds of the resulting fatalities could be blamed on the
increase in aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
Aviation deaths grew from 970 to 1,089 including those in air
taxis, foreign planes that crashed in the United States and
commuter crashes.
</P>
<P>
Two major accidents -- ValuJet and TWA Flight 800 --
contributed to the jump in airline fatalities from 168 in 1995 to
380 in 1996. Private pilots accounted for 631 fatalities last
year, down from 733.
</P>
<P>
Railroad deaths totaled 740 last year, up just sightly from 736
a year earlier. Deaths on commuter and light rail climbed from 98
to 120. Deaths at railroad grade crossings fell from 579 to 472.
</P>
<P>
Marine accidents showed a decline, falling from 912 deaths in
1995 to 769 last year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Work Closely with Other ASEAN Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is ready to work more
closely with other members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) for prosperity of the country and the region, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister for National Planning and Economic Development
Brigadier General Abel made the remarks here Tuesday at the
opening of an Indonesian public company, the Astra Graphia Co.
Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Astra International engaged in
information technology, document services and telecommunication
systems, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Abel said that investment from other ASEAN countries in
Myanmar, which was just admitted into the grouping in July,
accounted for about 45 percent of the total foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN investment has helped the country obtain much-needed
foreign exchange, create jobs and achieve higher growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador to Myanmar A. Poerwanto Lenggono said
that the opening of the company adds to the group of Indonesian
companies doing business in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador also said that Indonesia's investment, which
ranks eighth in Myanmar's foreign investment, has amounted to
236.37 million U.S. dollars in eight permitted projects in sectors
including cement and oil.
</P>
<P>
Visiting ASEAN Secretary General Ajit Singh also attended the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, of the 6.361 billion
U.S. dollar total foreign investment in Myanmar, five ASEAN
countries -- Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines -- shared 3.123 billion dollars in 129 projects at the
end of July this year.

<HEADLINE> US Military Presence Benefits S'pore Economy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is benefiting from
the U.S. military presence here as tens of millions of dollars are
pumped into the country's economy every year by American military
units located here, a Business Times report said today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, millions more are spent by U.S. sailors when they
steam into harbor for port visits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the money spent in restaurants, shops and
places of entertainment by American sailors granted "liberty", or
shore leave, easily amount to 1,000 to 1,500 Singapore dollars
(about 662.25 to 993.38 U.S. dollars) per sailor.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and the United States signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) in 1990, allowing the U.S. Air Force units to
come to Singapore several times each year on training deployments.
</P>
<P>
The document also permits increases in the number and duration
of visits by U.S. Navy ships.
</P>
<P>
The MOU also allows a small U.S. Navy unit, Comlog Westpac, to
use facilities provided by the Singapore government at Sembawang
in the northern part of Singapore island.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 97 U.S. Navy ships visited Singapore. And for this
year to date, there has been 90 port visits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. military officer was quoted as revealing that the
two U.S. military units here have a total staff strength of about
1,000, including a small number of Singaporeans. And their
salaries total some 7.35 million Singapore dollars (about 4.87
million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, rent and utility payments for quarters occupied by
military personnel amount to another 10.2 million Singapore
dollars (about 6.75 million U.S. dollars) per year, the officer
said.
</P>
<P>
The officer also said that during the 1996 U.S. fiscal year,
from October 1, 1995 to September 30, 1996, the American navy
spent about 31 million Singapore dollars (about 20.53 million U.S.
dollars) in Singapore on ship supply services and repairs
performed by local yards.
</P>
<P>
This year, the U.S. Navy has already spent about 30 million
Singapore dollars (about 19.88 million U.S. dollars) on ship
supply and repair work.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures by the U.S. Air Force unit at Paya Lebar, the
497th Fighter Training Squadron for its "Commando Sling"
exercises, amounted to 5.1 million Singapore dollars (about 3.38
million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 7.2 million Singapore dollars (about 4.77
million U.S. dollars) are pumped into the Singapore economy yearly
through airplane fuel contracts, the report quoted the officer as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani, Indian PMs to Meet in New York: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart I.K. Gujral are likely to
meet in New York on September 23, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between the two outside South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The date and time of the premiers' meeting has not been
officially finalized as yet, but given the visit schedule of the
two leaders they are likely to meet on September 23," The News
quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though both the leaders are unlikely to spring any major
surprise, the official said, the talks will be productive and its
outcome might lead to some positive developments in addressing
some crucial issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders will pick up the thread where they left in
Male," the official said, referring to Nawaz and Gujral's meeting
in May in the Maldive capital during which the two agreed to
improve the strained relations between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
It was after quite a few contradictory statements that Gujral
finally evinced his "keen interest" Monday to have talks with
Sharif in New York.
</P>
<P>
Both prime ministers are supposed to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton separately as they go to New York for the U. N. General
Assembly meetings on September 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Jihua Group, which is based in
northeast China's Jilin Province, reported 231.25 million yuan
(28.2 million US dollars) in economic losses in the first half of
the year, "China Securities News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the group has issued 1.8 billion
yuan in corporate bonds since 1996, and it is the first time a
corporate bond issuer declared such a huge loss.
</P>
<P>
The group, a parent company with a 70 percent stake in Hong
Kong-listed Jilin Chemical Fiber Co. Ltd., attributed the losses
to depreciation of facilities, rising costs, price hikes in
crude oil, and a price fall for its products.
</P>
<P>
The group issued 800 million yuan of corporate bonds, with an
annual interest rate of 15 percent, on Shanghai Securities
Exchange in January, 1996, and another one billion yuan worth of
bonds, with an annual interest rate of 11 percent, last

<HEADLINE> Neolithic Wares Unearthed in Southern Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of Italian speleologists
recently excavated two well-preserved pottery pots and other wares
of the Neolithic age dating back to 3,000 years ago in Salve,
south Italy's Lecce Province.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today quoted archeologists with Rome's second
university as saying that these wares, discovered in a cave, might
have been used in religious rituals for worshiping the god.
</P>
<P>
The finding is of great significance because it proves the
existence of herdsmen and animal raisers in the region during the
Neolithic age, the archeologists were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Before the latest discovery, some prehistoric relics had been
found in the same cave. In the 1970s, a number of ancient murals
were discovered in it.
</P>
<P>
Now, the cave has been close down to preserve other historical
relics that possibly exist. Speleologists will further explore the
cave for more findings, according reports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops in Bosnia Get New Grenades Against Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has armed
its troops in Bosnia with "non-lethal" hand grenades to control
crowds of angry Serbs and mark them with dye, the Pentagon said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a regular briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken
Bacon said that the 40-mm sponge grenades, which are designed to
knock people down in crowds when hit in the chest or the abdomen
at a range of 15 to 30 meters were sent to the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. troops will also be armed with some
dye-marking kits, which look like hand grenades filled with dye
that can be thrown at people in crowds so that they are marked
with this dye and can be found and punished later.
</P>
<P>
"Those are two non-lethal pieces of equipment that are in the
process of being issued," the spokesman said. "They were...
shipped into the theater over the weekend, and training teams
arrived yesterday and will begin training troops in Bosnia... to
use this equipment."
</P>
<P>
Bacon warned that the non-lethal weaponry would be for
"supplemental" use and would not prevent U.S. troops from using
their M-16 rifles or other lethal weapons if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also confirmed reports that U.N. and the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) officials had reached agreement with
Pale-backed Serb Radio and Television to stop "inflammatory"
reports.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement signed by Serb Radio and Television
Editor-in-Chief Drago Vukovic on Tuesday has not only promised to
halt inflammatory broadcasts undermining the Dayton accords but
also to give time to broadcast "other political views."
</P>
<P>
"This is designed to prevent the Serb media against inaccurate,
rhetorical flourishes against the Dayton peace process as they
have been doing in using the media to stir up the population
against the Dayton peace process," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen reiterated today that Prince Norodom Ranariddh
must face trial, ruling out peace talks with him proposed by King
Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, responding to a call from Sihanouk for peace talks
with Ranariddh, said this in a reply letter co-signed by
newly-appointed First Prime Minister Ung Huot.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the military and political officials, who went
abroad or hid at home for security reasons, to come back for
normal political and family life. Positions are reserved for them
and they will not be punished for their past deeds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen added the offer of a blame-free return applied to all
opposition members except Ranariddh and two of his top military
officials, General Nhiek Bun Chhay and General Serey Kosal.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Prince Ranariddh and the two generals is completely
up to the decision of the court, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Sihanouk appealed for an immediate ceasefire between
the warring parties and for informal talks between Hun Sen and
Ranariddh after returning to the northwestern town of Siem Reap
from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also denied a proposal for informal talks with
Ranariddh by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
half a month ago.

<HEADLINE> Thai Doctors Urge Refrain From Antibiotics Over-use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai doctors have called for
rational use of antibiotic drugs to prevent bio-resistance to the
drugs, local newspaper "The Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sayomporn Sirinavin, from the Ramathibodi Hospital, voiced
concern over the irrational use of antibiotic drugs in Thailand,
saying that it can lead to an epidemic of drug resistance in the
same way as aids.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her worries in the wake of recent reports that at
least one case of vancomycin resistance has occurred in the united
states. Vancomycin is the latest derivative of antibiotics, which
have broad effects on bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Sayomporn said on Tuesday at a panel discussion that for
vancomycin resistance, there is no drug to cure it now, just like
aids.
</P>
<P>
Citing the principles of science, she said if drug resistance
breaks out anywhere in the world, it can occur in other places and
actually lead to further over-use of drugs.

<P>
Dr. Anuwat Suphachutikul, director of research projects of the

He said antibiotic drugs represent as much as one-fourth of the
total expenditure on drugs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pramual Sunakorn, a former director of the Children's
Health Institute, pointed to research which showed that only seven
percent of doctors prescribe antibiotics in a responsible manner.

<HEADLINE> IRA's Sinn Fein Leader Visits U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, the leader of
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
arrived in New York today for a five-day visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, Adams is expected to meet in New York and
Washington with senior U.S. officials and congressmen. It is the
first time for him to visit the country since a cease-fire was
announced in July.
</P>
<P>
The visit takes place before the all-party talks on the future
of the province start next week. Sinn Fein was invited to the
talks by the British government.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue is the only way forward. It's only through dialogue
and negotiation we will build a better situation," Adams told
reporters at Kennedy International Airport, where he stopped on
his way to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a peace negotiation mode. We don't intend for this
opportunity to be wasted," he said. "This opportunity for peace
clearly is the best one we're going to have this century."
</P>
<P>
Adams said the trip was designed both to raise funds and to
mobilize public opinion to support Sinn Fein's goals. "We want to
make it very, very clear that a united Ireland is not only
possible but it is going to be a reality," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Service Sector Wider to Outside World (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now, 37 retail joint ventures have been formed, eight of which
are operational. Furthermore, a pilot project has begun on
establishing Sino-foreign chain stores.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of the service sector that are accessible to
overseas investment include air transport, general aviation, goods
supply and selling, foreign trade, securities, accounting,
auditing, and legal consultancy, according to a 1995 directory for
overseas investment in China.
</P>
<P>
In January, China approved the first overseas-backed business
in the field of aviation fuels, while in July, the first
Sino-overseas foreign trade company opened in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
And more recently, a railway jointly funded by inland and Hong
Kong investors, was open to traffic. The law on highways, adopted
in July, stipulates that road building is open to overseas
participation.
</P>
<P>
The service sector has entered a period of fast development
since the reform and opening up drive which began in the early
1980s. Statistics show that contributions to GDP by the sector
have risen from 23.7 percent in 1978 to 32.3 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, this still lags far behind the 70 percent produced by
developed countries, an economist said, but added that China also
has great potential to develop the sector.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing pointed out that China will gradually
promote the opening up of the service trades.

<HEADLINE> Investment Funds in China on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China's stable economic growth
is paving the way for the development of investment funds, "China
Daily" today quoted a senior bank official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yin Jieyan, Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, said
China successfully achieved a "soft landing" last year, marked by
reined-in inflation and sustained economic growth. Yin made the
remarks while briefing participants to a symposium on operational
issues of investment funds.
</P>
<P>
Yin said investment funds, with a stress on increasing capital,
professional management and long-term earning, have become one of
the four pillars of the global financial industry together with
stocks, bonds and futures.
</P>
<P>
Compared with many other countries, China's securities
investment funds are still in a rudimentary stage of development,
said Yin.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the number of investment funds in
China has grown from zero to 75, with a market value of 5.8
billion yuan (700 million US dollars). Among them, 25 funds are
being traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
There are some 40 fund managing firms around the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said China would learn skills and lessons from
overseas fund managers and develop its own investment funds
suitable for China's conditions.
</P>
<P>
Information from the symposium also disclosed that China has
been considering establishing joint venture funds which would be
allowed to trade domestic shares.

LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- While most other sports in
Britain have been canceled on the day of Princess Diana's funeral,
Scotland soccer authorities would still carry out their World Cup
qualifying game as planed at Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The game is scheduled to begin just hours after the start of
the 11 a.m. funeral at Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar in Glasgow was
contacting Scottish Football Association Secretary Jim Farry to
express "great concern," especially given that the opponent,
Belarus, is willing to postpone the game.
</P>
<P>
"This has not been an easy decision for the international
committee to reach," Farry said earlier Tuesday. "But there are
insurmountable logistical difficulties in arranging a different
date."
</P>
<P>
Scotland leads Group Four and is in a good position to qualify
for next year's World Cup in France. Belarus is out of
contention.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah, Shares Weaken Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite the restrictions on
forward foreign exchange transactions, the Indonesian rupiah
weakened further against the U.S. dollar Tuesday to cross the
3,000 level and stock prices also fell by 1.4 percent, dealers and
brokers said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the ceiling on forward selling to
non-resident at 5 million U.S. dollars per customer could not
salvage the rupiah as domestic appetite for the dollar remained
high.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 3,010/3,030 Tuesday, continued to
weaken to close at 3,040/3,060.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange fell 1.4
percent on continued uncertainty over when the government would
ease rupiah liquidity and cut down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange Index closed down 6.955 points at
479.014, with total turnover of 205.2 million shares valued at 93
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts attributed the continuing doldrums in the stock
market to the rupiah volatility and regional stock market's
bearish trend.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following de factor devaluation
of the Thai baht and the Philippine pose in July.
</P>
<P>
Despite many measures have been taken by the Indonesian
government, the value of rupiah has dropped by about 25 percent
since early this year. Last Friday the rupiah fell to a historic
low of 3,070 against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Closer Cooperation Helps Construction in HK, Interior of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese construction
official is calling for closer cooperation between the
construction companies in the interior of China and their Hong
Kong counterparts to bring the former into line with
international practices.
</P>
<P>
"The co-operation is sure to help the whole country, including
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to attain a much
bigger share in the international construction market," Nian Fuli,
Vice-Director of the Construction Industry Department of the
Ministry of Construction (MOC), was quoted by today's "China
Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nian made the remarks yesterday during a symposium on
construction procurement and contract administration in China
held in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"We have much to learn from Hong Kong's construction industry,
which boasts advanced technology and administration methods," said
Nian.
</P>
<P>
Nian, who led a group of 14 provincial government officials
responsible for the construction industry, said the symposium, the
second since last year, aims to improve the relationship between
the construction industries in the interor of China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China's construction industry is expected to grow at a rate two
to three percent higher than the country's national economy during
the next ten years, Nian said.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, China's floor space of newly built urban and rural
houses will top 12.5 billion sq m, with a total investment of
6,000 billion yuan (722 billion US dollars), Nian said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics suggest 11 Hong Kong companies won bids for 49 large
projects in Shanghai already this year.

<HEADLINE> Seles Ousted, Chang Continues at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United
states was upset by unfavorited Irina Spirlea of Romania while her
compatriot Michael Chang advanced to the semi-finals by beating
Cedric Pioline of France at the US Open tennis here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Seles squandered a match point against Irina
Spirlea before the 11th-seeded Romanian came back to win 6-7(5/7),
7-6(10/8), 6-3 to reach the first Grand Slam semi-final of her
career.
</P>
<P>
Chang, the second seed who inherited the mantle of US Open
favorite in the wake of Pete Sampras' shocking defeat on Monday,
made a tremendous rally to overcome Pioline 6-3, 0-6, 5-7, 7-5,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
Chang trailed 2-5 in the fourth set, but won 11 of the last 12
games to take the match that lasted three hours and 41 minutes
avoiding the same upset fate as Sampras and Seles.
</P>
<P>
Chang advanced to a quarter-final against the next-highest
seeded player left in the draw, No. 10 Marcelo Rios of Chile, who
gained the spot by eliminating seventh seed Sergi Bruguera of
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Swede Magnus Larsson beat South African Wayne Ferreira
6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 and awaited the winner of the night match
between Andre Agassi and 13th seed Pat Rafter of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Another flamboyant American, 17-year-old Venus Williams, took
on France's Sandrine Testud for a chance to face Spirlea in the
semi-finals.

<P>
CARACAS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela had an inflation
rate of 3.3 percent in August, and an accumulated rate of 21.6
percent over the last eight months, the Central Bank of Venezuela
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that surges in gasoline and urban
transportation fares were the main cause of the upward movement in
consumption prices.
</P>
<P>
However, the accumulated inflation of 21.6 percent in
January-August is much less than 77.4 percent during the same
period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank to Reduce Liquidity Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank is
expected to reduce the required liquidity reserves of banks by one
or two percentage points today to ease the liquidity crunch in the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the central bank,
was reportedly reviewing its policy on liquidity reserves as the
peso tumbled to an all-time low of 30.90 pesos to a dollar
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The review was prompted by the Bankers Association of the
Philippines which asked monetary authorities Tuesday to back down
on a recent decision to tighten the money supply, local newspaper
Manila Bulletin reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the decision had failed to protect the peso and
had pushed interest rates higher, urging the central bank to
readjust the liquidity reserves, which was increased to 8 percent
from 5 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a ranking central bank official told another leading
newspaper Business World that last week's decision to raise the
required liquidity reserves was "only a temporary measure" meant
to siphon off excess peso funds in the system.
</P>
<P>
By increasing the liquidity reserves, the central bank was able
to siphon off some 30.9 billion pesos (1 billion U.S. dollars)
from the system, which effectively limited the opportunity of
banks to buy dollars with their peso funds.
</P>
<P>
However, this move backfired as Treasury bill (T-bill) interest
rates shot up to five-year highs on Monday and interbank loan
rates soared to a high of 75 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the reserves requirement is expected to free
additional funds into the system, thus, allow banks to quote lower
rates at the T-bill auction, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China Opens Service Sector Wider to Outside World (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China is opening up its
service sector wider to the outside world, with almost no area in
the industry excluded from overseas investment, said an official
with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Experiments are being carried out to open the industries of
banking, insurance, communications, tourism, commerce,
consultancy, services, which in the past have been inaccessible to
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
By now, financial institutions from more than 40 countries and
regions have opened 540 representative offices in China, 162 of
which are already in operation, with nine permitted to deal in
Chinese Renminbi yuan. Accordingly, overseas-funded financial
institutions have begun to play an important role in China's
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies followed suit: Statistics show that 84
insurance companies from 13 countries have set up 144 offices,
four of which have been approved to conduct business in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 14 overseas accounting firms have also established 28
offices in China's big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The central government defined the speeding up of the service
sector as a strategy to improve industrial structure. In 1992, the
State Council began to intensify efforts to open the sector
gradually and comprehensively to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the State Council agreed to set up one or two
Sino-overseas retail businesses in six cities including Beijing
and Shanghai, as well as in China's five special economic zones
such as Shenzhen. It was a start in the opening of the commercial
sector.

BONN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Syria wants to rejoin the Middle
East peace process as soon as possible, said Miguel Moratinos, the
European Union (EU) envoy for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks today after meeting with German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is really serious when peace is concerned and wants to
rejoin negotiations as soon as possible," said Moratinos, who came
to Bonn after a weekend meeting in Damascus with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to reveal further details of his talks, saying
only, "It is important that both sides, Israelis and Syrians, want
to use the diplomatic channel and no other channels."
</P>
<P>
On the current standstill in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, Moratinos noted that there are signs for progress.
</P>
<P>
Israel has become much more satisfied than before with
Palestinians' pledges to seriously combat terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Moratinos and Kinkel hoped that the Middle East trip by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on September 9 would be
able to restart the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Protecting China's Ancient Bamboo Slips, Wooden Tablets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Protecting and cataloguing
the bamboo slips and wooden tablets recovered from an ancient well
in Changsha, capital of south China's Hunan province, is now under
way.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning of October 17 last year, archaeologists
found more than 170,000 bamboo slips and wooden tablets in the
well in downtown Changsha.
</P>
<P>
These are regarded as the greatest archaeological discovery
in this century in China and are believed to be archives of the local
government from 232 A.D. to 237 A.D.
</P>
<P>
According to the Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics, earlier
this year, hundreds of bamboo slips and wooden tablets dating from
25 A.D. to 220 A.D. were discovered in another old well nearby.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that they are being bathed in distilled water
and kept at a constant temperature.
</P>
<P>
The bureau director showed a piece of dehydrated wooden
tablet to a Xinhua reporter. It measures three centimeters by 30
centimeters and the characters on it are still clearly
visible.
</P>
<P>
"With complete and detailed records of the political, economic,
military, cultural and administrative affairs of their time, these
slips and tablets have a great historical and cultural value",
said, noting that the work will take ten or more years.
</P>
<P>
"Later when the museum for bamboo slips and wooden tablets is
completed and our research findings are published, Changsha will
be more attractive to visitors for its rich cultural relics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the municipal government of Changsha decided to
allocate five hectares of urban land and five million yuan (some
600,000 US dollars) to support the slip and tablet project.
</P>
<P>
However, a lack of funds is still the main problem hindering
better protection. "We are looking for more financial aid from
all channels," Yang said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela: No U.N. Forces Deployment on Border with Colombia </HEADLINE>

<P>
CARACAS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela opposed the presence
of U.N. peacekeeping forces on the border between Venezuela and
Colombia to halt attacks by Colombian guerrillas, Venezuelan
Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said today.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces on the border would
make a local dispute internationalized and also mean the
Venezuelan troops are not capable of settling the regional
affairs, Rivas said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
It "could bring serious consequences," he said, rather than
prevent Colombian rebels from entering the Venezuelan territory.
</P>
<P>
"We can not enter the Colombian territory, but if Colombian
guerrillas raid into our territory to spread war, we will take
necessary actions," Burelli asserted.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the border issue between the two countries have
made some progress, but "it is still too early to announce a
definitive conclusion," added the foreign minister.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Navy said Tuesday that it planned to
deploy a new generation of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles
that could circle over a battlefield for hours before being
programmed to hit moving targets.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade, Navy officials told reporters, would let
ship-board commanders redirect missiles against tactical targets
such as armor columns, troop formations and mobile missile
launchers using satellite data, images from an onboard digital
camera and "real-time" updates from special forces or other
sources.
</P>
<P>
The officials said at a news conference that the updated
version would cost less than half the current model and the 1991
Gulf War. The new Tactical Tomahawk model would be able to
"loiter" over a battlefield for at least two hours while awaiting
instructions to strike, the Navy said.

NEW YORK -- The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies
Tuesday, setting a nearly two-week high versus the German mark,
following the U.S. stock market rebound and the decision of the
German central bank to leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average made its biggest one-day point
gain ever. Frantic buying of stocks increased demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also got some help from a weak Japanese retail sales
report that added to the pessimism about Japan's economy. Japan's
minister of finance suggested interest rates will remain low and
said the yen's recent weakness is in line with economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8335
German marks, up from 1.8095 late Friday. U.S. financial markets
were closed Monday for Labor Day.

who was killed in a tragic Paris car crash last Sunday, the

"The foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Bizima Karaha, informed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan by phone
on Monday that the U.N. human rights investigative team in the
Congo can begin its work," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The objections raised in a letter to the secretary-general
signed by two ministers of the government have been dropped,"
added the spokesman.
</P>

The spokesman said the United Nations was awaiting written
confirmation of this and the investigation team was making

PARIS -- Despite the discovery that the chauffeur of the late
Princess of Wales was drunk when death descended on her Saturday
night, the French judicial authorities Tuesday did not let go the

They were charged by the Paris Public Prosecutor for
"involuntary homicide and injury" and "non assistance to person in
danger."
</P>
<P>
The photographers are Nicolas Arsov of the Sipa agency, Jacques
Langevin of the Sygma agency, Laslo Veres, an independent
photographer, Serge Arnal of the Stills agency, Romulad Rat of the
Gamma agency and Christian Martinez of the Angeli agency. The
motorcyclist is Stephane Darmon of the Gamma agency.
</P>
<P>
Six of them were released in the evening but were put under
judicial control after being questioned by Judge Herve Stephan of

in jail and 500,000 francs (83,400 U.S. dollars) of fines if
convicted.

</P>
<P>
The Wanjiazhai diversion project will divert water from the
Yellow River, China's second longest, to water-deficient Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 20 billion yuan (2.41 billion
U.S. dollars), of which 400 million US dollars will come from
World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will divert water to Taiyuan, the provincial

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Boosting Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese economists said
Tuesday they believe the year-old Beijing-Kowloon Railway has
started to affect the economy in areas alongside it by improving
the investment climate and contacts with coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Xiusheng and Yu Bing of the State Council Development
Research Center, speaking at a seminar on development along the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, said that the better transportation
helps turn natural and human resources into profits.
</P>
<P>
Areas along the railway produce 14 percent of the nation's
grain and 15 percent of its cotton, and are rich in mineral
resources. Their coal reserves amount to 60 billion tons. The
population density of the area is three times the national average.
</P>
<P>
The 2,381-km railway is also helping form new industrial and
commercial centers and helping old cities. It has carried 2
million tons of cargo and 47 million passengers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Average GDP increase in the seven provinces and two
municipalities along the railway was 11.6 percent in 1996,
compared to the national average of 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cui Zhongfu, an official of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said the Beijing-Kowloon railway artery will be much
more efficient when it is linked with other railways and its
management is improved.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of the railway's cargo capacity and 30 percent
of its passenger capacity were utilized in the first half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The seminar deals with the railway's role in macro-economic
development, infrastructure construction, resource preservation,
environmental protection and investment.

CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- FIFA Secretary General Joseph
S. Blatter disclosed Tuesday that the world soccer governing body
has chosen the hosts of several future world cups events but has
yet to decide on their financial sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a three-and-half-hour meeting of the FIFA
Executive Committee that ended here Tuesday afternoon, Blatter

"It was confirmed that the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship
would be held in Nigeria and two years later in Argentina, while
New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago were appointed to host the
Under-17 World Championship in 1999 and 2001, " Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Finland had already announced its candidature for the U-17 in
2003, according to Blatter.
</P>
<P>
The final project for a first Club World Championship, to be
played in 1999, is to be discussed in further details before the
next Executive Committee meeting in December, he added.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA official said that the Executive Committee will
confirm the granting of the marketing rights for the FIFA World

<HEADLINE> New Investment Zone to Emerge in Southeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has made a big step in
getting more overseas funds for the Xiamen Special Economic Zone
(SEZ), one of five in the country, in Fujian province, by setting
up the Haicang Investment Zone.
</P>
<P>
The 100-sq.km. zone is 870 m from Xiamen and will be connected
with the SEZ by bridge to be completed by 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Chinese government approved the investment zone,
because of the Xiamen SEZ's limited space. Since then, great
effort has been made to build roads, water and power supplies,
telecommunications, and ports.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Mayor Liu Chengye, Haicang will be part of
Xiamen and a key development area. A new Xiamen Port area, a new
industrial block and an urban district will be built there.
</P>
<P>
The city government hopes to speed up the development by making
good use of Xiamen's existing infrastructure, services, and
personnel, because of its rapid development in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Haicang zone has a 13 km coastline, with a large bay where 49
berths, each with a handling capacity of 10,000 tons, are
planned. Annual handling capacity will reach 90 million tons when
completed.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to make Xiamen an international port
city. Haicang zone has convenient highway and railway links with
inland areas, and is an ideal place for modern industries.
</P>
<P>
It has attracted investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
elsewhere, and 85 overseas-funded projects have been set up there,
with a total investment of 1.52 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are also 110 domestically-financed projects approved for
the zone, with total capital of 2.77 billion yuan, 27 of which are
operational and are expected to generate an output value of five
billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is one of two ports with direct shipments across the
Taiwan Straits and Haicang's first berths have been put to use. The
new investment zone is expected to play an important role in trade
and economic exchanges across the strait.

<HEADLINE> US Navy Plans to Deploy Smarter, Cheaper Tomahawk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy said today
that it planned to deploy a new generation of long-range Tomahawk
cruise missiles that could circle over a battlefield for hours
before being programmed to hit moving targets.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade, Navy officials told reporters, would let
ship-board commanders redirect missiles against tactical targets
such as armor columns, troop formations and mobile missile
launchers using satellite data, images from an onboard digital
camera and "real-time" updates from special forces or other
sources.
</P>
<P>
The officials said at a news conference that the updated
version would cost less than half the current model and the 1991
Gulf War. The new Tactical Tomahawk model would be able to
"loiter" over a battlefield for at least two hours while awaiting
instructions to strike, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
The Tomahawk family of cruise missiles are low-flying missiles
designed to perform a variety of ship and land attack missions.
Armed with conventional or nuclear warheads, the current version
can be launched from surface ships, submarines, aircraft and
mobile ground units.
</P>
<P>
The planned tactical Tomahawk would carry only conventional,
non-nuclear warheads, the Navy said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Discovers Gas Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has discovered
proved and probable natural gas reserves in excess of 13 trillion
cubic feet (TCF) in its eastern part, it was announced today.
</P>
<P>
ARCO, or Atlantic Richfield Corp., said in a press release from
Los Angeles, California, that it ranks among the largest natural
gas discoveries in the world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
On an oil equivalent basis, 13 TCF of gas equates to almost
2.2 billion barrels of oil, said ARCO which made the discovery.
</P>
<P>
The reserves are located on the Weriagar and Berau blocks
onshore and offshore Irian Jaya and development plans call for LNG
production to begin in time for anticipated increases in market
demand around 2003.
</P>
<P>
The project named Tangguh is expected to make Indonesia the
largest LNG marketer in the world with a 50 percent market share
in the Asia-Pacific region, ARCO said.
</P>
<P>
The project would add a third source to Indonesia's two
existing LNG production centers in Arun and Bontang.
</P>
<P>
ARCO investment in Indonesia has totaled nearly 3 billion U.S.
dollars, while the Tangguh project is expected to require several
billion dollars of investment, it said.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Gets Higher as Stocks Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against
major currencies today, setting a nearly two-week high versus the
German mark, following the U.S. stock market rebound and the
decision of the German central bank to leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average made its biggest one-day point
gain ever. Frantic buying of stocks increased demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also got some help from a weak Japanese retail sales
report that added to the pessimism about Japan's economy. Japan's
minister of finance suggested interest rates will remain low and
said the yen's recent weakness is in line with economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8335
German marks, up from 1.8095 late Friday. U.S. financial markets
were closed Monday for Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also traded at 121.47 Japanese yen, up from 120.80.
The British pound was quoted at 1.5920 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's current level above 120 yen hadn't been seen since
early May.

Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.5070 Swiss francs, up from 1.4925; 6.1665 French francs, up from

<HEADLINE> US Military May Test Firing Laser at Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
was considering an Army request to test fire laser weapon at a
satellite circling Earth, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
But no decision had been made on whether a powerful laser at
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico would be fired at an Air
Force satellite, said Pentagon spokesman, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col.
Bob Potter.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by The New York Times Monday, the Army's
Space and Defense Command had asked for testing in September the
ability of the big laser to possibly destroy satellites or other
space vehicles in time of war.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said arms control advocates worried that it would
likely set off a race for better space weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States has not demonstrated the ability to destroy
satellites, but defense analysts have warned that any decision by
Washington to develop an anti-satellite weapon could have major
political as well as military ramifications.
</P>
<P>
The Army has fired the laser, called Miracl (Mid-infrared
Advance Chemical Laser) at ground targets and speeding drones and
rockets in flight. It was banned from firing at satellites until
1995, when the Republican-controlled Congress let the ban expire.
</P>
<P>
Miracl produces a two-meter wide beam of light of millions of
watts by burning fuels and then extracting the energy with
mirrors. The resulting laser destroys targets with intense heat.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Link Stomach Cancer to Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 percent of stomach
and esophageal cancer cases could have been caused by smoking,
according to the latest edition of the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
The journal said that the risk of adenocarcinoma was doubled
among current and ex-smokers and that the risk could last for even
30 years after quitting smoking.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by Marlie Gammon and his group at
the Columbia University School of Public Health. They studied more
than 1,000 people aged 30 to 79 who had been diagnosed with the
esophagus or stomach cancer and compared them to 600 people who
did not have cancer.
</P>
<P>
Smoking was a clear risk factors for two different kinds of
cancer: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
They found that smoking increased the risk of squamous cell
carcinoma more than five-fold and ex-smokers had a risk of nearly
three times higher of squamous cell cancer of the stomach or
esophagus.

Omar Bashir held talks here today with his Zambian counterpart
Frederick Chiluba on the peace talks process of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir said his government is working to implement a federal

</P>
<P>
He said that the call for a federal government has become
prominent after the 1989 conference held to discuss the root
cause of the problems in his country.

under-development in many areas of the country is also identified
as one of the causes of the protracted civil war in Sudan, said
the Sudanese leader.
</P>
<P>
He assured Chiluba that his government is committed to finding
a lasting peace solution to the war so that resources can go to
the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that relations Zambia and Sudan will be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Chiluba said Zambia will play a leading role in
the peace talks, adding that Zambia should be furnished adequate
information about the conflict in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Chiluba said Sudan must come to the negotiating table
to find a peaceful solution.
