RANGERS DEFFEAT ISLANDERS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few minutes before, during a Rangers power play,
Wayne Gretzky had taken a good shot from a good spot but got beat
by Islanders goalie Wade Flaherty. ``Darn,'' he said, or a word to
that effect, as he winced and made a sharp gesture of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Returned to his center position because of an injury to Petr
Nedved, Gretzky had been firing the puck better and more often than
in most games this season. His next chance came soon, with more
than two minutes remaining in the third period and the score tied
at 1-1 in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After an Islander turnover, Gretzky fired, and Flaherty blocked
the first shot while falling back. As if in a slow-motion dream
sequence from a film, the puck lay in the blue-painted ice of the
crease. Players for both teams struggled and fell atop the goalie.
Gretzky charged forward, stick extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely got to the puck,'' he said. ``I hate to say I kind of
panicked. I felt like I couldn't get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he got to it and pushed it over the red goal line to give
the Rangers a 2-1 lead that eventually became a 3-1 victory. The
Rangers won all five games against the Islanders this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it put them 5 points behind the Boston Bruins
in the race for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference of the National Hockey League. The Rangers have eight
games left and the Bruins have 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, it was Gretzky's goal No. 1,072, regular
season and playoffs combined in both the NHL and the World Hockey
Association. It broke the total held by Gordie Howe, Gretzky's idol
when he was a boy and the man Gretzky calls the greatest player in
the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good goal,'' Gretzky said, ``and a goal that I'll
never forget. It's a pretty special moment. I feel very
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The record won't be official, because the NHL does not recognize
the WHA, a rival league of the 1970s. But these were real goals
scored by real stars in real games. Gretzky, who broke in as a
17-year-old with the Indianapolis Racers in 1978, played one season
in the WHA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a record I guess won't be in the books,'' Gretzky
said, adding that people will remember it and debate it anyway.
``Some of my records are going to be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Among active players, Mark Messier, Gretzky's former Edmonton
and Ranger teammate, is next in career goals with 611. Howe had 202
in the WHA and Gretzky 56.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has only nine goals this season, only one since Jan. 10.
Since then, he missed 12 games with a disk injury in his neck and
this was his fourth game back. Shortly before he announced his
injury, in late February, Gretzky said Howe called to tell him he
was on his way to China and to wish him luck. Gretzky said he had
told Howe he didn't know when he would get another chance to score
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   After he scored, Gretzky reacted with jubilation. So did his
teammates and the fans, who chanted ``Gretzky! Gretzky! Gretzky!''
He finished the game with seven shots on goal, most in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said Coach John Muckler's original plan was to use
Nedved at left wing with Gretzky at center, but that Gretzky
suggested his own move to the left side. It all became moot when
Nedved left early in the game with a rib injury. Muckler said he
hopes Nedved can return for the next game, Friday, against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gretzky's goal, Muckler said: ``I know he was looking forward
to it. I know it meant a lot to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first period on Monday night was scoreless and the teams
exchanged goals in the second period. The Rangers took a 1-0 lead
when Adam Graves scored his 36th goal of the season, most on the
team and tied for eighth in the NHL with Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr.
Leading the league is Teemu Selanne of Anaheim with 43. Graves
scored at 3 minutes 21 seconds by deflecting a Brian Leetch shot
with his back to the goalie, Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders tied it at 8:53 on a goal of a scrambled play
scored by Mariusz Czerkawski past a sprawling Mike Richter.
Technically, the goal was at even strength, although the Islanders
had an extra skater because the goalie had been pulled for an extra
attacker when a penalty was about to be called against Chris Tamer
of the Rangers.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ This is the way it so often seems to wind up
in the last days of March. The month that is supposed to go out
like a lamb gives one more lion's roar.
</P>
<P>
   Or in this case, a Husky's howl.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke Invitational became the Great Conn Job.
</P>
<P>
   You can't imagine it? UConn believe it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Blue Devils' night to make history. Instead they were
history.
</P>
<P>
   Just the latest chapter in the book on the NCAA Tournament
championship game that has more plot twists and surprise endings
than an Edgar Allan Poe story.
</P>
<P>
   When the last seconds finally ticked down and Trajan Langdon
practically dribbled himself into the ground trying desperately and
fruitlessly to make any kind of play, it was Connecticut 77, Duke
74, and Khalid El-Amin, the Huskies' husky little point guard,
sprinted to the courtside press table and shouted straight into the
CBS camera: ``We shocked the world!''
</P>
<P>
   Only if the world hasn't been paying attention to these
maddening Monday nights when incredible things happen, when teams
like North Carolina State, Villanova and now UConn prove that
anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   It was a magnificent basketball game, 40 minutes of youthful
exuberance and untamed energy. It was like sitting at a window
watching a crackling display of summer lightning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that should go directly to ESPN's Classic Sports
channel, no matter that the sweat has barely dried on the uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   It should be framed and hung in the Louvre, protected behind
velvet ropes. Or maybe the video should be locked away with other
precious heirlooms in a vault, pulled out any time in the future
when anybody dares to say that one team is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of gripping drama and sparkling entertainment
that made it worth switching the channel from back-to-back episodes
of Ally McBeal, because it was a game where the gap between the two
teams was skinnier than Calista Flockhart's waist. There were 14
ties and seven lead changes.
</P>
<P>
   It was an evening when Duke came for a coronation and wound up
getting crowned by a pack of Huskies who sank their teeth in early
and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   It was big, dough-faced Irishman Jim Calhoun finally making it
all the way to the top after years of regular-season excellence
followed by years of Tournament frustration. There were all those
previous years when the Huskies expected to be here and were not,
and then they showed up and won on their first try. He implemented
a defensive game plan that used varying double teams to stifle
Duke's Elton Brand, the national player of the year, and turned the
Huskies loose on offense with a confident, pedal-to-the-metal
attack that told the Blue Devils that they were not afraid.
</P>
<P>
   It was two-time Big East Player of the Year Richard Hamilton,
who is smoother than a set of silk sheets and cooler than the other
side of the pillow, firing in 27 points and never looking anything
but confident.
</P>
<P>
   It was the little marshmallow of a point guard, El-Amin _ 5-10
and 205 pounds _ who struggled with his offense for most of the
night and then stepped up to score UConn's last four points of the
game on a running eight-footer and then a pair of clutch free
throws. When it was over and the Huskies were wearing their
championship T-shirts and running all over the floor at Tropicana
Field, the unlikely looking El-Amin was hauled in by a security
guard who thought he was a fan who had joined the party.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ricky Moore, the Huskies' best defender, who did his
usual excellent job on the perimeter and also helped carry the
offensive load early with 11 of his 13 points in the first half.
With UConn protecting a 75-74 lead, it was Moore, the spider, who
lured Langdon into his web and forced a a turnover on a walking
violation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Strake Jesuit's Jake Voskuhl, who kept his composure and
battled Brand all night, and it was Kevin Freeman and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   For Duke, it was a night of shattered hopes and broken
expectations, a game that was supposed to take the Blue Devils into
the pantheon of great champions such as Indiana and UCLA and
Kentucky but left them tied instead to other heavy favorites like
Georgetown and Houston that couldn't carry the burden.
</P>
<P>
   At 37-1, the Blue Devils were a steaming locomotive. At 37-2,
the legacy of this Duke team has been derailed. A year ago, in this
same building, Duke blew a 17-point second-half lead to lose to
Kentucky in the South Regional. Twelve months later, they tied 1985
Georgetown as the largest point-spread favorites (9{) to lose a
national title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we wanted,'' Moore said. ``This is the
game that we wanted to play, and this is the team we wanted to do
it against.''
</P>
<P>
   Another mad moment in March. A night to howl.

HUSKIES FINALLY REACH FINAL FORE 
</HEADLINE>
 BKC-RYAN COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Close down I-95. Just shut it down from
Clark's Falls to Westchester. Shut it down and turn it into one big
block party. The University of Connecticut Huskies are No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   No tricks, either. There were no tricks and no gimmicks. Jim
Calhoun lined up his athletes against Mike Krzyzewski's Duke
athletes to play a nice game of 40-minute basketball, and guess
what? Calhoun's were better.
</P>
<P>
   This was no Villanova-Georgetown anything-can-happen-in-one-game
miracle. This was a heavyweight title fight from the opening tip,
and we didn't need no stinkin' judges. We only needed to record
what we saw, and what we saw was an untainted, no-frills,
100-percent, totally legitimate 77-74 UConn victory.
</P>
<P>
   UConn? UConn? Yup, UConn! I'll say it again. UCONN!! The Huskies
of Art Quimby and Toby Kimball and Tony Hanson and Joey Whelton and
all those other nice New England players whose names meant zilch
outside the state lines have now graduated to the ultra big-time.
The University of Connecticut Huskies are the 1999 NCAA champions.
</P>
<P>
   UConn.
</P>
<P>
   The names to toast are Khalid El-Amin, the chunky and utterly
fearless guard who always sees to gravitate to the spotlight when
the game matters most, no matter what he has or hasn't been doing
earlier in the contest; Ricky Moore, the erstwhile defensive
specialist who turned the clock back to his high school big-scoring
days with a where-did-that-come-from? 13-point first half; nasty
Kevin Freeman, the King of Dirty Work; and, most of all, feathery
Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton, the 6-foot-6-inch junior who scored 27
points in the biggest game of his life.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget Calhoun, the kid from Braintree who learned
his basketball from the late, great Fred Herget. Think about this.
Coach K got whomped by a Wamp.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun will never have to apologize for anything again. They
pooh-poohed his phenomenal record in the '90s _ ``We've been
criticized for mere excellence,'' is the way he puts it _ because
he couldn't get to the Final Four. Now what will it be?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I know. He shoulda won by 10.
</P>
<P>
   He did not seize the opportunity to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we won the national championship,'' he said. ``I am
no better coach now than I was three weeks ago. I am no worse a
coach now than I was three weeks ago. I don't have to prove
anything. I just want to be true to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kids gave him everything but the rights to their
first-born.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played their hearts out,'' saluted Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   It was, without a shred of exaggeration, a great game, truly
worthy of a 1-2 designation. The first half may have been the best
display of the product in an NCAA title game since the epic
Kansas-Oklahoma first half 11 years ago. These were clearly the two
most complete teams in the country, replete with textbook players
at every position (and plenty of them), and extraordinarily
well-coached.
</P>
<P>
   If Coach K is, as Calhoun himself maintains, the ``coach of our
generation,'' Calhoun is a member of the Inner Sanctum Board of
Trustees. For, who knows? This may not even be his most talented
team. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. I know I'd pay cash money to
see the '95 team that lost a 102-96 game to eventual champion UCLA
play this bunch. Ray Allen vs. Richard Hamilton? Hoo, baby. Pass
the beer and fill up the bowl of chips. I'm there.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has put team after wonderful team on the floor during
this decade, starting with the '89-90 bunch that came within a
miracle Christian Laettner shot of going to that Final Four. But
whatever he's done has never been enough for the stringent markers
down there in the Nutmeg State. Let's hope they recognize an A-plus
performance when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be a point sometime in the first half when Duke
knew it was in trouble. Duke simply had to know it was playing the
best opponent of the year, because Duke wasn't getting into its
offense at all. UConn was quicker and more aggressive. UConn was
every bit as basketball-smart. And UConn was surely as determined.
But Duke is still Duke, and despite being outplayed in many
departments, the 3-point shooting of Trajan Langdon gave them a
39-37 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duke even went up by 5 (48-43), but over the next four minutes
the Huskies went on a 14-5 run to let Duke know this game was about
to go from merely being good to being a borderline epic. And how
about this? UConn was deeper. Coach K was forced to shorten his
rotation. There was absolutely no place for Chris Burgess in this
game, and not much of a spot for Nate James, either. Coach Calhoun
was even getting a contribution from Souleymane Wane, the pride of
Dakar, Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that this was a battle of equals. If they played
again, well, who knows? Coach K didn't even come close to making an
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept the pressure on,'' he said. ``You have to give them
an immense amount of credit. Everything in the game was clean. They
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems redundant to point out that when UConn
absolutely, positively needed a play, it turned to the
extraordinary El-Amin. With the Huskies leading by a 73-72 score,
El-Amin slinked down the lane and tossed in a one-on-one 10-foot
leaner. And it was his two big free throws with 5.2 seconds
remaining that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   But big plays by El-Amin hardly qualify as news in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And two clutch defensive plays by the amazing Moore on Langdon
aren't bulletins, either. This is who the Huskies are. This is why
they are the new champs.
</P>
<P>
   UConn. The Yankee Conference and all those first-round tourney
KOs in the '50s and '60s. UConn, and Duke 101, UConn 54 in '64.
UConn, and the old field house.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Jim Calhoun left Huntington Ave. for Storrs and
brought a national vision to a parochial program. UConn is No. 1.
This is hard to digest.

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN FORECAST FOR STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California's economy, currently riding a
4-year-old wave of prosperity, is probably headed for a slowdown
sometime in 2000, according to a widely watched survey that will be
released today.
</P>
<P>
   But economic diversification in several regions including
Southern California and in some industry sectors will mute the
deceleration's impact, concludes the quarterly forecast from the
Anderson School at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there has to be a limit to this expansion and the
longer it goes on the more concern we have about its
sustainability,'' said Tom K. Lieser, the executive director and
author of the California report at the Anderson School.
</P>
<P>
   California's recovery began in 1994 and accelerated in the
following year. The state has just completed its fourth consecutive
year of solid economic performance despite turmoil in international
markets with key trading partners. And the expansion of
California's economy during the last half of 1998 is carrying over
into this year, the business graduate school's survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey predicted nonfarm employment will expand by
3.4percent this year, off slightly from 1998's 3.6percent rate.
Jobs will grow at an annual rate of 3.6percent in this year's first
quarter and 4.4percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect unemployment in California to average
5.5percent this year and 5.6percent in 2000, somewhat higher than
the national rate but impressive in light of the predicted strong
growth in the size of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in personal income won't be as robust as in the past.
Personal income in California grew 6.6percent in 1998 but UCLA
believes it will taper off to 6.4percent this year and slow to
5.3percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation will continue to remain in check.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, notes that the state's economy is coming off three
consecutive years of growing by at least 3percent. ``That's pretty
strong and it's reasonable to expect one way or another there is
going to be some slowdown in 2000 and 2001,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while a slowing of the economy is likely, it still will
remain relatively strong, Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good breadth in the mix of industries so if
we lose a driver, such as exports to Asia, we have been able to
make that up. It's hard to come up with a shock such as the loss of
the defense business we experienced in the late 1980s and early
1990s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some factors that could speed the slowdown,
including the highly leveraged status of stocks in some of the
state's high-tech companies, the survey noted. Silicon Valley has
typically drawn high-risk investment in new companies by venture
capitalists seeking profits, but they are usually well-capitalized
and prepared to absorb periodic losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it has more recently become a primary focus of
so-called day trading, high-risk investment in existing companies
by amateurs,'' Lieser said of the region.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that there was an upside to the state's export
sector suffering more than the nation's from the Asian economic
crisis. ``That weakness has given a breather to Silicon Valley
manufacturers who were running out of room to expand and couldn't
fill all of their high-tech job openings anyway,'' Lieser said.

 BKC-UCONN-DUKE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ So much for this ``one of the greatest
teams in history'' business.
</P>
<P>
   On a magical night when Ricky Moore, Khalid El-Amin, and Richard
Hamilton made classic plays in the most pressure-filled situations,
a gutsy Connecticut team hung on and hung in to win its first
national championship, beating Duke, 77-74, before 41,340 at
Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (34-2) became the first New England team since Holy
Cross in 1947 to win a national championship in men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (37-2), which had been called by some one of the greatest
teams of all time going into this NCAA Tournament _ and was a
9-point favorite Monday night _ tried its best to win its third
title this decade, but in the end did not have enough answers for
what UConn threw at it.
</P>
<P>
   This tightly contested game, in which a 5-point lead looked
enormous, came down to one key defensive play, provided by Moore,
who showed the skills that have made him a standout for four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, which found itself trailing in a game for the first time
since November, when it sustained its only other loss (to
Cincinnati), faced its greatest crisis of the season when Hamilton
(27 points, tournament MVP) pumped in a 3-pointer from the corner
with 3:38 left to give the Huskies a 73-68 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Chris Carrawell followed that by making one of two free
throws to cut the deficit to 4, 73-69, with 3:1l left.
</P>
<P>
   The game then turned into a series of mini-dramas, with each
possession holding enormous importance.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Huskies felt they could breathe a little bit
easier, Trajan Langdon, playing his last game for Duke, fired in a
22-foot jump shot from the right to make it 73-72 with 1:43 left.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, UConn faced its most important possession of
the season. El-Amin responded with a driving jump shot with 1:05
left to increase the lead to 75-72.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's William Avery was fouled and made both shots, making it
75-74.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies ran the clock down to 34.3 seconds before calling a
20-second timeout. El-Amin then threw up an airball, and Duke had
its chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   With 5.4 seconds left, Langdon drove to the basket but was
called for traveling on his spin as he could not get free of Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies took the ball out under the Duke basket and El-Amin
was fouled by Avery with 5.2 seconds left. He made both, and when
Langdon couldn't go the length of the court for a game-tying shot,
UConn had its championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question thse guys pulled it out with the help from
the guys before them,'' said UConn coach Jim Calhoun, referring to
former Husky stars such as Cliff Robinson and Ray Allen, the latter
of whom was so intent on seeing the Huskies win that he chartered a
plane to make it to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment for Duke was immense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Moore in the first half was the difference,'' said
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   Moore scored all 13 of his points in that first half to keep
UConn within 2 of the Blue Devils at the break, 39-37. He also was
the difference in the end, foiling Langdon's efforts and causing
the turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a move,'' said Langdon, who scored a team-high 25
points. ``I might have traveled. I might not have. That's the call.
That's the way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the senior guard who has played in the shadow of Allen,
Hamilton, and even El-Amin at UConn, made a statement with his
first half. No one was surprised at his defense, but his offense
(which included 9 of UConn's first 15 points) was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out to prove myself tonight,'' said Moore, who went to
high school with Avery in Augusta, Ga., and wanted to reestablish
the student-mentor relationship they had when Moore was a senior
and Avery a sophomore. ``I wanted to show everybody that I have an
offensive game as well as a defensive game.''
</P>
<P>
   He had more than enough of both. But UConn, like Duke, is not a
one-player team on any night. Monday night was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils went to all of their weapons. After a first half
in which he was harassed by a defense that sagged and swarmed over
him every time he touched the ball, Duke center Elton Brand broke
loose as the second half started. He was part of the reason Duke
took a 5-point lead in the first three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn, whose only two losses came when it was depleted
(missing Hamilton and center Jake Voskuhl), responded.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all season, different people stepped up and
filled roles.
</P>
<P>
   First it was Moore. Then it was Hamilton, throwing in key
baskets when the game turned into a scoring derby. And then it was
El-Amin, who after committing a turnover and shooting an airball
came back to make the two most critical foul shots of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there was Calhoun, who was remarkably calm all week,
savoring the highest moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading the parade, saying how good Duke was,'' said
Calhoun, ``but we felt all along we had a reasonable chance to beat
a great, great Duke team.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Huskies had more than a reasonable chance.
On a night when Duke expected to be crowned, it was the Huskies who
played like champions.
</P>
<P>
   National champions.

THEATERS URGED TO BAN ADVANCE SALES TO STOP `MENACE' SCALPING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scalpers, beware of the Force.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest wrinkle surrounding ``Star Wars Episode 1: Phantom
Menace,'' George Lucas and 20th Century Fox have asked theater
owners to ban advance ticket sales for the prequel when it opens
May 19 and for two weeks after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear is that if we sell tickets in advance,
scalping will take place and you and your families would either not
be able to get tickets or would have to pay above face value,''
said Tom Sherak, chairman of Fox Domestic Film Group, in a message
on the official ``Star Wars'' Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sherak conceded Monday that the issue remains unresolved since
Fox cannot force theaters to ban advance sales. But he added that
the studio hopes to sway exhibitors by staking out its position
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   What's uncertain, however, is how much clout Lucas and Fox will
have with theater owners wanting to cash in on a movie expected to
eclipse ``Titanic's'' box office records.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co., said
theater chains will probably go along with the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think exhibitors will agree because they want to maintain
the best possible relationship with Lucas and Fox,'' he explained.
``I think holding off on advance sales is a good idea. People are
going to cry foul if they stand in line and can't get tickets
because people on the phone have gotten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, services such as MovieFone have enabled
moviegoers with credit cards to buy tickets by phone up to a week
in advance. ETM Entertainment Network announced plans this month
for presales of movie tickets through its network of kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Dergarabedian said he was not surprised at the move, citing the
previous decree by Lucas and Fox that ``Menace'' be shown only in
theaters with state-of-the art sound. The studio plans to book
3,800 to 4,000 screens in about 2,000 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox is being very careful about every element on
distribution,'' Dergarabedian said. ``This will be quite an event
with a lot of camaraderie among the people standing in line, which
will build the excitement even further.''

   BRUSSELS _ Refugee aid organizations scrambled Monday to cope
with the vast humanitarian crisis caused by the exodus of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo, with up to 4,000 refugees an hour flooding
into northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``up to 80,000 to 100,000 refugees'' in Albania, said
Emma Bonino, the European Union's Commissioner for Humanitarian
Affairs. ``It is almost impossible to count them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would leave for Macedonia and Albania on Wednesday
to assess the crisis and coordinate EU aid efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top priority is shelter, sanitation, and also to find a
way for transport and communication,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid efforts were being coordinated by the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, which was struggling to ship supplies to the Albanian
border of Kukes, where most of the refugees were massing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. organization has based most of its supplies in the
Albanian capital, Tirana, because of the risk of looting in the
north of the country. A spokesman said it was taking up to two days
for trucks to reach Kukes and return.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian authorities were attempting to move the refugees
further south in convoys of buses and trucks but were overwhelmed
by the scale of the exodus, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The French government said that the airport at Tirana, the only
one in the country, was closed Monday, further complicating the
relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bonino said aid organizations had been surprised by the huge
flow of refugees into Albania compared with the smaller number
crossing into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   She said Yugoslav troops and police appeared to be directing the
refugee flow toward Albania, stripping people of identity papers
and car license plates in an apparent attempt to make it impossible
for them to return.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner was speaking at the headquarters of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels, where she discussed aid
coordination with NATO Secretary-General, Javier Solana Madariaga,
in a rare instance of cooperation between the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Solana said that an apparent Serbian campaign of
``ethnic cleansing'' was not due to the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a new phase of human tragedy that has been going on
for many years, particularly last year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Solana concurred and said, ``We are trying to stop this
catastrophe and stop this killing.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugee crisis ``didn't take us by surprise because it was
going on for many, many months,'' he said. ``This is not new. The
purpose of the bombing is to stop the humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency estimated that before the NATO bombing
began last week, 460,000 people in Kosovo had been displaced. But
that was over a period of years. The new exodus has overrun the
capability of governments and aid organizations to cope.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing drove international agencies out of Kosovo, forcing
them to regroup amid chaotic conditions in Albania and Macedonia,
both of which appealed Monday for international assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Bonino said the EU to date had given 21.6 million euros ($23.4
million) in food, medicine and other aid for the refugees and that
a further 20 million euros was on hand for immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, which with Kosovo and Serbia make up the rump
Yugoslavia, suspended a law limiting the inflow of refugees as an
estimated 30,000 people crossed the border, with thousands more
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Branko Perovic said he would appeal to the EU
and Italy for assistance in setting up refugee camps for 50,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, its economy and basic services such as electricity,
transport and telephones collapsing, also appealed for urgent
international assistance. &QL;

UCONN STUNS DUKE FOR TITLE

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The pursuit of history ended here Monday
night with a brilliant collision, leaving a state in ecstasy and
the nation's No. 1 team without the crown required to validate its
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic, fabulous 40 minutes, Connecticut did what few
thought possible and no team had done in four months: It stopped
the Duke machine with an airtight game plan, swarming defense and a
little help from a guard named Rip.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 27 points from All-American Richard ``Rip'' Hamilton,
Connecticut captured its first NCAA title _ and authored the
greatest chapter in the Nutmeg State's sporting history _ with a
breathtaking 77-74 victory over Duke before 41,340 at Tropicana
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the greatest games I've ever been involved
with,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said. ``The kids were saying
they wanted Duke instead of Michigan State. I said maybe the wiser
head knows better. But the kids knew better.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzzer sounded with Duke senior guard Trajan Langdon (25
points) sprawled on the court _ his full-court charge had ended
with a turnover _ and Calhoun embracing his assistants. Together,
they designed a masterful game plan that accentuated Connecticut's
strengths (its speed and one-on-one ability) and smothered Duke
center Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   But this night was as much about the losers as the winners.
Calhoun composed himself quickly, then hugged Blue Devils coach
Mike Krzyzewski, who departs the decade with two NCAA titles and
three title-game defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled for hip replacement surgery next week, Krzyzewski left
the court with a methodical stride and stern expression _ one he
had seen before. Eight years ago today, his Devils stunned
supposedly unbeatable Nevada-Las Vegas in an equally riveting Final
Four duel in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, a team that couldn't be beaten once again whiffed
on history's fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But to put Connecticut's victory in the upset file alongside
North Carolina State over Houston and Villanova over Georgetown is
to ignore the Huskies' talent and accomplishments. They won 34
games, they won the Big East title, they beat Michigan State, St.
John's, Stanford and Ohio State, and they lost just one game
(Miami) with Hamilton in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're shocked,'' Calhoun said. ``We're happy as
heck, we're proud, but I don't think anyone's shocked. We truly
felt we could beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have much company. The Blue Devils eliminated
Connecticut from the tournament in 1990 _ Christian Laettner's
last-second shot _ and 1991. They have the most talent, one of the
best coaches ever, and they dominated the regular season like no
team since ill-fated UNLV in '91. The tournament gives, and the
tournament takes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were a 10-point underdog, and we felt that was
ridiculous and we felt that hurt our pride,'' Connecticut point
guard Khalid El-Amin said. ``We wanted to come out and prove
everyone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Their quest started with strategy. Realizing it was no match for
Duke in a half-court game, Connecticut opened with full-court
pressure and pushed its fastbreak at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of backing down from the Durham bully, the Huskies
attacked. They spread Duke's man-to-man defense and used their
speed to slash into the lane and create scoring chances. Senior
guard Ricky Moore shed his reputation as a defensive specialist and
scored nine of Connecticut's first 15 points, but the main man was
Hamilton. He was too quick for Duke, and his jumper was right all
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hit 10 of 22 shots, then gave way to El-Amin, whose
short jumper from the left side with 1:05 left gave Connecticut a
75-72 lead and proved to be the winning shot. Duke's best chance
collapsed when Langdon, matched against Moore, traveled on his way
through the lane with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, positively, I want Trajan to take that shot,''
Krzyzewski said. ``I'll win or lose with Trajan. I'll walk down any
road with Trajan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies edged to a 36-32 lead late in the half when Langdon
singlehandedly changed the momentum. He buried a 3-pointer from the
top of the key, then drained a 3-pointer from the left wing as
Moore fouled him. The rare four-point play gave Duke a narrow lead
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon kept his rhythm through intermission and scored five
quick points to open the second half. When William Avery found
Brand for a dunk and Chris Carrawell did the same to Shane Battier,
the Blue Devils had carved a 48-43 lead and seemed on the verge of
a game-breaking surge.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut reserve Albert Mouring slowed Duke's momentum
with a 12-footer from the lane, and Connecticut scored on its next
six possessions. Its margin expanded to 65-59 on Hamilton's jumper
from the left wing with nine minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Duke responded immediately. Brand blocked a Hamilton shot, then
raced downcourt to receive Avery's pass for a layup. Two
possessions later, Carrawell's mid-range jumper trimmed
Connecticut's lead to 65-63, and he tied it with 4:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The final minutes were riveting, beginning with Hamilton's
3-pointer from the left wing that gave Connecticut a 73-68 lead.
Two minutes later, Battier grabbed an improbable rebound and fed
Langdon for a 3-pointer _ right wing, 1:40 left _ that brought Duke
within one point.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ As if the Los Angeles Lakers haven't been
shaky enough lately, the schedule took its best shot.
</P>
<P>
   From playing the New York Knicks on national TV on Sunday, the
Lakers hosted the Vancouver Grizzlies on basic cable on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Lakers were rolling right now, which they are not,
that's a recipe for a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in that they were coming off a literally hard-fought
victory over the Knicks and playing their 17th game in March, and
it was clear this could be a long evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the Lakers took their time before knocking out
Vancouver 116-98 before 17,312 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there wasn't enough energy in certain situations,''
point guard Derek Harper said. ``We've played a lot of games of
late and you have to grind out a win in a game like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an emotional game like yesterday, it was (tough). But we
were able to put them away and that was encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been going, any win is appreciated, though
only slightly more than a day off.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers (21-11) have played more games than any team in the
league, and a matchup with the lowly Grizzlies wasn't going to be
enough to jumpstart their emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a couple steps slow today,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``It
was one of those games.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had a career-low one rebound in 34 minutes. His previous
career low was three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more than that,'' O'Neal said, after insulting the
statistician.
</P>
<P>
   How many? ``Three,'' O'Neal answered playfully.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain how Dennis Rodman had 17 rebounds and the
rest of the team had just 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played down to our opponent,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis
said. ``We did what we had to do and that's basically the end of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until Glen Rice hit a 3-pointer with less than five minutes
left to give the Lakers a 100-84 advantage did the fans feel
comfortable enough to head for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   It just wasn't any way to be playing the Grizzlies, who came to
the Forum with a 5-23 record, and without center Bryant Reeves, who
has been out more than a week with a knee injury. Not to mention
starting an all-rookie backcourt of Mike Bibby and Felipe Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Lakers have gone just 5-5 in their past 10 games,
perhaps it wasn't totally unexpected they struggled with Vancouver.
Maybe the Lakers were worn out from all the shoving and scuffling
the previous day with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we came out a little flat,'' Rice said. ``I know
that Vancouver defeated the Lakers before and we didn't want that
to happen again. In the fourth quarter we came up big and really
slammed the door on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers unimpressively held a 75-67 lead entering the fourth
quarter, but outscored the Grizzlies by 10 in the final period,
with Rice scoring 12 points and Rick Fox adding 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers got a terrific boost from their bench, with Fox
scoring 17 points and center Sean Rooks scoring a season-high 11
points with six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the ever-vigilant Rodman watch, the erratic forward
started again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play the guys that are going to get the job
done,'' Rodman said. ``For me, I have to start, I have to get my
motor running and at least get an idea of what I have to get done.
I'm accustomed to doing certain things and I hope this team
respects me for doing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to come here and be the star of the
team. I came here to win, that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers may have been a little out of it after playing the
Knicks, but their defense was better than average. They had a
season-high 16 steals and Vancouver committed 25 turnovers, the
most for a Lakers opponent all season.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a season-high 31 assists.
</P>
<P>
   But they were happiest after the game about having today off, a
welcome occurrence with the lockout schedule forcing them to play
so many games in a short period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for the guys, they have (a day) off, to
mentally get away from the game, physically get themselves a little
bit of rest'' Rambis said. ``We're still in a transition period
with this ballclub so we have to come back to work to get geared up
for the next run of games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not escape the lowly Grizzlies without an injury.
Forward Robert Horry suffered a strained left hip flexor in the
first half and did not return. His status is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Horry will get at least three days to rest, however, since the
Lakers are off until Friday, when they play at Phoenix.

GALAXY SHOULD SHOW CIENFUEGOS THE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rarely do people side with the athlete in a
contract dispute. But in Mauricio Cienfuegos' case, the Los Angeles
Galaxy should show him the money.
</P>
<P>
   He's underpaid, his team is owned by a billionaire and he's
worth as much to Major League Soccer as any player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what Cienfuegos did to win the hearts of his
countrymen in El Salvador, but the Salvadoran population in Los
Angeles clearly loves and supports him. There is, in fact, talk of
a Salvadoran boycott if he decides to leave the team Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jorge Campos left last year, there has been no bigger
attraction than the 5-foot-5 wizard. Ask anyone in the Galaxy's
front office and they will tell you Cienfuegos is a big reason Los
Angeles led the league in attendance in two of its first three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Paul Caligiuri talk about the three-time MLS
all-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those players who makes everyone around him
better,'' Caligiuri said. ``If you compare him to basketball, you
think of Magic Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   But unless something dramatic happens in the next 48hours,
Cienfuegos will board a plane for El Salvador and likely never
return to the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, Cienfuegos hired sports agent Corey
Clemetson, the same man who represented Caligiuri in his successful
lawsuit against the MLS two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson told Cienfuegos his $106,000 contract is well under
the league maximum, which is said to be $230,000. Clemetson also
explained he believes players are earning figures in the
million-dollar range after signing incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming all this is true, a million for Cienfuegos isn't a bad
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Galaxy president Tim Leiweke claimed that spending
$30 to $40million to build a new stadium for the Galaxy was pocket
change for new owner Phillip F. Anschutz. So what does that makes
Cienfuegos' asking price? Pennies.
</P>
<P>
   It also is in the league's best interest to accommodate him. To
replace a foreign player of Cienfuegos' caliber on and off the
field would require a transfer fee of at least a million dollars,
and the league still would have to pay a hefty contract.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, lies with MLS' single-entity concept, in
which the league negotiates all the contracts, instead of
individual owners and general managers. But where is this league
headed if a billionaire owner can't help his financial stake in the
league by securing a valuable player?
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is that Cienfuegos isn't asking for a million
dollars. He is believed to be asking for roughly $500,000 (which
the league can make up with incentives). Cienfuegos has said
countless times that he is willing to meet the league halfway.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the league hadn't changed its stance. It offered
Cienfuegos a 15percent raise at one point -- a slap in the face if
Clemetson's figures are correct.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how this will play out. Last week,
Cienfuegos ended his season-long holdout for 10 days so the two
sides could work toward an agreement. But nothing has changed
since.
</P>
<P>
   MLS and the Galaxy surely will pay the price if he leaves. In a
year in which attendance is vital to the league's growth,
Cienfuegos' absence figures to be a hefty blow to attendance.
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which some athletes earn a salary equal to the
worth of some sports franchises, Cienfuegos' asking price is hardly
unreasonable.

AZUSA PACIFIC TO BE PRACTICE SITE FOR '99 WOMEN'S WORLD CUP
</HEADLINE>

By FRED J. ROBLEDO 
San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AZUSA, Calif. _ Azusa Pacific University will serve as a
practice site for the 1999 Women's World Cup, officials announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which will be televised to more than 60
countries worldwide, begins June 19 and ends July 10, with the
championship and third-place matches to be played at the Rose Bowl.
Teams from 16 countries will compete at seven venues throughout the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl also is the site of a first-round June 20
doubleheader, pitting Germany against Italy and Korea against
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Four days before the first-round match, Germany and Korea will
train at APU. In the week leading up to the championship game, the
WWC organizing committee will decide which of the final four
participating teams will use APU's facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Finn, director of public relations for the WWC, said the
Galaxy's willingness to train at APU on occasions helped with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (the Galaxy) there, it showed there was something good
about that school,'' Finn said. ``We just didn't pluck this out of
nowhere. A German official was there last week and was satisfied
with the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, the overall quality of the field is
very good. They have put some care into that surface, and we feel
it best mirrors the conditions of the Rose Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   APU men's soccer coach Don Lawrence said the school is delighted
to be part of the event. With two of the teams staying at Arcadia
hotels, the short ride to APU and its well-maintained fields played
a big role in the WWC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a solid field, as far as training,'' Lawrence said.
``Our surface is similar to the Rose Bowl, and this is a good
atmosphere for teams to come and train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, we have made sure we can take care of the privacy
part. We have security and locker rooms that are efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence also said it will be good for the neighboring
community, as well as APU's 1998 NAIA women's championship soccer
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a good opportunity for our women to sit in the
stands and watch the training sessions,'' he said. ``They will be
able to see first-hand what it is like on the next level.''

 ABORTION RIGHT TIED TO 2000 ELECTION  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the nation's leading abortion advocates
warned Monday that if the next president elected is opposed to a
woman's right to end her pregnancy, that protection is likely to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, made her prediction after
addressing several hundred boisterous supporters gathered in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The event celebrating the 30th anniversary of NARAL resembled a
political pep rally with rhetorical speeches by California Gov.
Gray Davis and Michelman, underscoring the national effort to make
abortion a pivotal issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get an anti-choice president in the year 2000, we will
see the overthrow of Roe vs. Wade,'' said Michelman after the
luncheon, referring to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court
decision establishing a woman's constitutional right to an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that if two of the justices who form the majority
supporting abortion rights are replaced by abortion opponents, it
will mean the end of the constitutional right. For instance, she
said, it is possible that Justice John Paul Stevens, a liberal who
is 78, could leave the court in the next few years, as well as
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a crucial swing vote. O'Connor, 69,
has had a history of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In its last major decision on the issue, a divided Supreme Court
in 1992 reinforced the right to have an abortion but allowed states
to impose certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that the freedom to choose will be a major
issue in the presidential campaign,'' said Michelman, whose group
is pouring millions of dollars into a campaign to keep the issue
near the top of the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been running a series of television ads in Iowa
and New Hampshire that accuse two Republican presidential
candidates of trying to hide their anti-abortion positions.
Michelman said that their next step is to air the ads in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole has declined
to state where she stands on the divisive issue, and Texas Governor
George Bush Jr. has stated that he would allow abortions only in
the cases of rape, incest or where the mother's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelman said that the two Republican front-runners are
trying to portray themselves as moderates as part of a campaign
strategy to maintain distance from the far right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to obscure their views and say they're in the
middle. We can't let them get away with that,'' she said. ``It is
important for us to get in early and not let them establish
themselves based on erroneous information.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelman, who has been at the forefront of the abortion battle
for decades, admits that one of the biggest challenges will be
getting the attention of abortion supporters who think that the
fight has already been won.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest threats in the last six years has been the
complacency of pro-choice people,'' she said, citing in particular
the generation of young men and women who grew up after abortion
was an established constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   Because of threats to doctors and numerous state laws
restricting abortion rights, Michelman said, ``it is harder today
in 1999 for women to exercise their right to choose than anytime
since Roe vs. Wade.''

 SETTLEMENT TALKS TO START IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST SUIT  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Settlement talks are to begin Tuesday between the
Justice Department and Microsoft Corp., but the two sides remain
miles apart on the core issues of their antitrust battle.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders familiar with the case estimated the probability of a
settlement at zero to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, the 19 state attorneys general who joined the
federal government's suit against the software behemoth want
Microsoft to auction off the heart of the company _ the secret code
to the Windows operating system used on roughly 90 percent of the
world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, Microsoft has offered to make relatively modest
changes to its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of posturing going on,'' said Daniel
Wall, a San Francisco antitrust attorney who worked for the Justice
Department on the breakup of AT&AMP;T in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The government has charged Microsoft with wielding monopoly
power over personal computing software to stifle competition.
Microsoft denies both having a monopoly and doing anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The states' proposal to auction off the Windows source code ``is
ludicrous as an antitrust remedy,'' Wall said, ``so they can't be
serious if they think either that Microsoft would agree to it or
that they would go into court and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But an industry player opposed to Microsoft argued that the
government is winning in court and has every reason to press hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have your opponent on the canvas and he says he's
ready to settle, it's not surprising that the guy who's hitting him
says, let's finish the bout,'' this source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department refused to comment Monday on the talks,
which Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had urged during a trial recess
that could continue through mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates emphasized Monday that although
his company remains open to settlement talks, any agreement must
protect both Windows' ``integrity'' and the company's right to
integrate new features into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The last settlement talks collapsed nearly a year ago on the
brink of the government's filing of the lawsuit, and matters hardly
look more promising today, after months of court battle that has at
the very least bruised Microsoft's public image.
</P>
<P>
   Under the states' proposal, Microsoft would be forced to auction
its Windows intellectual property to two or three outside
companies, while keeping a copy for itself to develop. Microsoft
shareholders would get ``reasonable compensation'' under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the Windows source code, Microsoft's lifeblood, would
``actually break up and render impotent the Windows monopoly, which
is the source of Microsoft's power,'' the state plan said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft made its own four-page settlement proposal last
Wednesday, offering to stop making exclusive contracts with other
companies to enhance sales of its products, and to allow computer
makers to alter the first screen that users see when they turn on
their computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the government dismissed the proposal as meaningless, saying
the company has already ceded that ground under pressure from the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has done no more than offer what they did before
trial started,'' said Kevin Arquit, an antitrust lawyer at Rogers &AMP;
Wells in New York and a former antitrust official at the Federal
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Microsoft, giving up the Windows code would be tantamount
to total surrender. And some outside lawyers believe that the
appellate courts would never force the company to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both sides have reasons to settle. For the government,
the longer the case goes on, the greater the risk that changes in
the fast-paced technology industry will make its case obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Judge Jackson is almost sure to be appealed,
ensuring at least two more years in court.
</P>
<P>
   The government also risks losing the case, or winning on such
narrow grounds as to yield a hollow victory.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, meanwhile, also  &LR; faces the risk of losing or _ almost
as bad from its view _ being legally  &LR; declared a monopoly, which
could open the door to a crippling wave of private litigation.

LACKLUSTER MAVS FALL TO SUPERSONICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Somewhere out there in America, Jim Cleamons is
probably laughing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because Cleamons is assured of having a better record
during his 98-game tenure as the Mavericks coach than the man who
fired him, Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton and Detlef Schrempf scored 20 points apiece as the
Seattle SuperSonics defeated Nelson's Mavericks, 109-101, Monday
night before an announced crowd of 13,311 at Reunion Arena. The
loss pushed Nelson's record to 26-71 since he took over for
Cleamons as the Mavericks' coach Dec. 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson gave Cleamons the ax and became the Mavericks' coach
after the 16th game of the 1997-98 season, Cleamons ended his
Mavericks' coaching tenure with a 28-70 record. More than a year
later, the landscape is basically the same at Reunion _ only the
leadership at the top has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson was puzzled the Mavericks (10-21) put up no more than a
meager showing against a Seattle team that was ambushed, 104-87,
Sunday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not a good effort by our team, and I'm a little
surprised by it,'' Nelson said. ``I really thought we'd be ready to
play tonight; this was what I considered a winnable game for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Sonics) approached it as a much-needed win for them. The
bottom line is we just had a hard time controlling Payton. He
played a terrific game, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's Mavericks have lost seven of their past nine games and
will play in Minneapolis tonight, where they battle the Minnesota
Timberwolves at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Only a 44-point performance by the Mavericks in the fourth
quarter prevented Monday night's game from being a complete
wash-out. It was the most points the Mavericks have scored in a
quarter since they racked up 46 in the fourth quarter Feb. 29, 1996
against the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks were 4-of-20 from the field in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense isn't running as smooth as it has,'' Nelson said.
``I can't give you all the answers, but we couldn't run plays out
there in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent, recovering from a stomach virus that has been
bothering him for 11 days, kept the Mavericks within striking
distance. Trent finished with 20 points and nine rebounds, and his
layup moved the Mavericks within 52-44 early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Owens, Payton and Schrempf took control the rest of
the period, and the Sonics eventually built an 81-60 lead before
coasting down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they took us out of our rhythm,'' said Erick
Strickland, who logged a season-high 39 minutes in making his first
start of the year. ``Everybody's shots were there all night; they
just didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland finished with 17 points, seven assists and four
steals, while reserve forward Samaki Walker pitched in with 10
points, 13 rebounds and three blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to come out with more energy,'' Walker said.
``Normally in the game we'll have some spurts, and tonight I didn't
see that. They had control from the beginning to the end.'' nn

NHL.COM BENEFITS FROM RELATIONSHIP WITH ESPN
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Followers of the World Wide Web will notice that alliances and
deals between Internet companies are being struck every day.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is merging with Netscape Communications. Yahoo!
is eyeing Broadcast.com. Microsoft and NBC have already spawned
MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   It's also happening in the cybersports world.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN Internet Ventures, a joint venture of Disney's Buena Vista
Internet Group and Infoseek, has become a major player by operating
official sites for the NBA, NFL and NASCAR and ABCNews.com's Bowl
Championship Series and Monday Night Football sites as well as
ESPN.com, the 'Net's most popular sports site.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, ESPN Internet Ventures added the NHL in its
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   NHL.com, the league's official site operated by NHL Interactive
CyberEnterprises, entered into a relationship with ESPN Internet
Ventures to develop a co-branded gamecast application and official
fantasy game as well as include NHL video highlights on ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   These features will be available through ESPN.com and NHL.com
before the end of the current NHL season and extend through the end
of the 2000-01 NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this cyber-mumbo-jumbo mean to the average
NHL.com user?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   It means more exposure for NHL.com's better features, especially
those NHL fans who follow the game online.
</P>
<P>
   According to details announced yesterday, ESPN Internet Ventures
will have preferred use of statistics generated from the NHL's Real
Time Scoring System _ meaning the gamecast will have real-time
depictions of all NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the official fantasy game will make use of the real-time
scoring system. NHL.com plans to feature a basic game free of
charge and a more sophisticated game that is fee-based.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, best of all for NHL.com, it becomes part of the ESPN
network, meaning that the site will be linked from all of the main
ESPN.com pages. ESPN.com receives the most traffic of any
sports-related site, according to Media Metrix, which measures
online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Richardson, general manager of NHL Interactive
CyberEnterprises, said the agreement gives the league a chance to
take advantage of ESPN's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also help raise the profile of NHL.com and spur
further growth this year and beyond,'' Richardson said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also opens the door to more integration of NHL
content with ESPN's, said Steve Zales, senior vice president and
general manager of ESPN Internet Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   NHL.com does well on its own with live audio broadcasts of NHL
games, the latest in league news, licensed merchandise and video
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RIGHT TRACK: Phil Murray, a volunteer track coach at
Boswell High School in Saginaw, Texas, has seen the popularity of
his Texas Track &AMP; Field Online (www.texastrack.com) vault in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said his site, a comprehensive clearinghouse of all
things related to track and field in Texas, received 2.1 million
hits last year, and he expects more this year, including about
500,000 this month. The increased traffic meant Murray had to move
his site to a service provider with more space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize when I started how much the entire world
looks to Texas as a mecca for the sport, especially at the high
school level,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides information about the hundreds of meets, Murray has
added interactivity featuring a chat room and discussion forum and
a survey.
</P>
<P>
   NFL AS A RESOURCE: The NFL plans to launch a site designed to
support and recognize high school and youth football, according to
a news release by NFL Charities. The site, which is scheduled to be
launched in mid-August, is expected to include coaching
information, officiating instruction, health and nutrition
information and direction on college scholarships.

MAVERICKS SIGN 7-3 TEEN-AGER FROM CROATIA

<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks grew taller and younger yesterday when
they signed Bruno Sundov, a 7-foot-3 center from Split, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   A second-round draft choice by the Mavericks in the last NBA
draft, Sundov, 19, will begin the season on the injured list
because of a fractured wrist. Sundov scored eight points in 10
minutes against a group of high-school all-stars from the United
States in the Hoop Summit game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a project,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said of Sundov.
``He's several years away, but we're taking this opportunity to
sign him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will basically just be in our development program, and he
will work with our personal trainer, Bill Peterson. That'll give us
our summer program to work with him and training camp next year,
and then we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had to sign Sundov this season, or else he could
have re-entered the next draft.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Sundov has put on about 20 pounds since the draft,
and now weighs approximately 220. He might be even bigger now,
according to Nelson, who said Sundov went to Bob's Steak and
Chophouse in Dallas and ate a 28-ounce steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eye-balling mine,'' Nelson said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks also moved injured point guard Robert Pack to the
active roster to make room for Sundov on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Pack, who is recovering from a torn right hamstring, is not
slated to return to action for at least another three weeks. SESAY
OUT OF CAST
</P>
<P>
   Rookie forward Ansu Sesay had the cast removed from his
fractured right foot yesterday and replaced it with a walking boot.
</P>
<P>
   He will start rehabilitating the foot today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get my movement back in it,'' Sesay said. ``But I
can't start running for another month.''
</P>
<P>
   Sesay fractured the foot during training camp and will miss the
season. He was a second-round draft pick out of Mississippi.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Center John `Hot Rod' Williams missed Monday night's game
because he had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Erick Strickland in the starting lineup last night for
the first time this season, the Mavericks have used 11 starting
lineups this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Mavericks general manager Norm Sonju attended last
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mavs Man, the Mavericks' popular mascot, limped off the court
holding his right leg after dunking during a third-quarter timeout.

RANGERS LIKELY WON'T DEAL FOR A'S ROGERS THIS SPRING
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ The Rangers continue to scout Oakland
Athletics pitcher Kenny Rogers, but general manager Doug Melvin
said a deal isn't likely during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll listen, but I don't think he's that available,''
Melvin said. ``Most clubs feel they want to start the season with
their best pitching staffs and wait until the season to make a
deal. They feel there's a better chance of a team panicking in
July. I think it will be hard to upgrade dramatically in spring
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said a number of clubs have asked about Esteban Loaiza,
who is in danger of losing his spot in the rotation to Mike Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to listen to anybody,'' Melvin said. GONZALEZ BACK
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Juan Gonzalez returned to the Rangers' lineup after
spending the weekend in Puerto Rico with his ailing mother. He
missed three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is all right,'' Gonzalez said. ``She's getting
better.'' RELIEF SHINES
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers received four scoreless innings from relievers Eric
Gunderson, Danny Patterson and Tim Crabtree, the trio of pitchers
who will have to serve as the closer committee should John
Wetteland not be ready for Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said the performances were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get people out,'' Oates said. ``Gundy has been
good all spring, Patty has had some good outings and Crabby turned
it up a notch today.'' GAME RECAP DEVIL RAYS 8, RANGERS 1
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays scored seven runs in the third inning and
defeated the Rangers at Al Lang Field. Bobby Witt held his
ex-teammates to one run on four hits through five innings. The
Rangers have lost four of five.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate: Tom Goodwin went 2-for-3 with a run-scoring single
in the fifth off Tampa Bay starter Witt. It was his second run
batted in during 54 at-bats this spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound: After two strong starts, John Burkett was smacked
around by the Devil Rays, allowing eight runs in five innings. The
Devil Rays scored seven of those runs in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one bad inning and four good ones,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett allowed eight hits, walked three and struck out two.
Opponents are hitting .275 off him this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In the field: Gonzalez misplayed Bubba Trammell's line drive for
a three-base error with no outs in the second inning. But Trammell
didn't score. Third baseman Scott Sheldon made two nice backhanded
stops on grounders, and left fielder Rusty Greer made a sliding
catch on Kevin Stocker's line drive to end the inning. nn

MAKE JOKES, BUT HELLING CLOSEST TO ACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ For a good laugh from most of the
baseball world, just suggest this spring that Rick Helling will
repeat as a 20-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, such rampant disbelief signals Helling is gaining
in respect. What has become laughable this March was unthinkable a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, manager Johnny Oates selected Helling as the
Texas Rangers' Opening Day starter. This bit of non-news provided
final proof both Randy Johnson and Roger Clemens had officially
declined the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the scene with the wood-chopper machine in the movie
``Fargo?'' Having advanced from a career-high five victories in a
season to 20 in 1998, Fargo-native Helling finds his head stuck in
a baseball version of the same device. A majority opinion around
the game has Helling being reduced to shavings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as mentally tough as Helling is, and as much bulldog as
he's got in him, I kinda like him constantly hearing this spring
how he can't or won't,'' general manager Doug Melvin said Monday.
``Rick has the right kind of attitude to repeat last season, just
out of spite.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Melvin and the Rangers didn't intend for it to be
this way. Helling also didn't spend the winter trapped in a
snowbank in Fargo _ the Rangers pursuit of baseball's best
available No. 1s was interesting reading in North Dakota. But when
Johnson and Clemens declined, the responsibility came back to
Helling, who has had a decent spring _ easily the best of the
Rangers' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the ``Sports Illustrated'' staff of baseball writers
has any definitive answers, but this week the magazine rated the
Rangers the seventh-best team in the majors. Add Johnson or Clemens
to the rotation, and that ranking goes to third, or maybe second to
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a questionable rotation has been a 27-year tradition
in Arlington. The difference this time, however, is the Rangers
will be leaving Florida on Thursday with their best-ever collection
of everyday talent. Oh, for a true No. 1 pitcher. How good could
this club be?
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody else had the No. 1, we'd feel worse,'' Melvin
said. ``The truth is, very few teams have that ace because there
aren't many aces. You can pursue them in free agency. You can try
to trade for one. We've done both. We thought we were close, but
close doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do like is we've got a Helling, and he's a tough,
durable guy who had a breakthrough season in '98. I don't mind
giving the ball to Rick and asking him to lead the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, 28, spent most of his career scuffling to be noticed by
the Rangers after being drafted in the first round out of Stanford
in 1992. After being traded to Florida in '96, Melvin re-acquired
him a year later.
</P>
<P>
   For a career comparison, Melvin points to the Phillies' Curt
Schilling, although Helling is not that type of strikeout king.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Schilling is on everybody's list as a true No. 1
pitcher,'' said Melvin, ``and he's won 84 games in his career.
Schilling is 32, and his stock has jumped mainly in the last two
years. A lot of teams made a mistake on Schilling before he was 30
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Baltimore front-office assistant, Melvin recalled the great
deal the Orioles made _ trading veteran pitcher Mike Boddicker to
the Red Sox for a couple of youngsters named Schilling and Brady
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then (the Orioles) thought we just had to have a power
hitter, and made an awful trade,'' said Melvin of the trade that
sent Schilling, Steve Finley and Pete Harnisch to the Astros for
Glenn Davis.
</P>
<P>
   A year later (1992), the Astros also blundered. Schilling was
dealt to the Phillies for pitcher Jason Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three different clubs had a true No. 1 in Schilling and didn't
even know it,'' said Melvin. `` A lot of times it takes a while to
find out. Rick overcame much doubt and adversity to have his
breakthrough season. I'm just glad we got him back so he could do
it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin recalled a chance meeting with Helling last season in a
room off the visitors' clubhouse at Coors Field in Denver. ``I
walked in before the game, and Rick was in there alone. Two TVs
were on. One had ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' The other had a tape
of the Colorado hitters. Rick was ignoring Springer. Like always,
he was absorbed in his pitching homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing, Melvin added, ``Believe me, I've seen far too many
Springer fans in the clubhouse before a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter has been heard this spring. Come Monday, Helling
begins his reply. The Rangers have a lot riding on that answer. nn

 &HT;    Georgia trims search for basketball coach to three finalists
 &HT;    (EDS: Must credit The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Newspapers.)
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley said
Monday that the interview process for a new basketball coach has
been completed and a new coach could be named as early as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley and UGA president Michael Adams are expected to choose
from three finalists that emerged from interviews conducted in St.
Petersburg last weekend - Mike Brey of Delaware, Rhode Island's Jim
Harrick and Buzz Peterson of Appalachian State. In the last week,
Dooley has interviewed Brey, Harrick, Peterson, Jim Crews of
Evansville, Georgia assistant coach Jerry Waters and former St.
John's coach Fran Fraschilla, who has accepted the New Mexico job.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley is searching for a replacement for Ron Jirsa, who was
fired March 11 after only two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a few other names, but I don't think we'll
interview them,'' said Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   Brey, 39, first interviewed with Dooley March 21 in Atlanta and
had a second interview Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla., while
attending the Final Four. But Brey, a former Duke assistant who has
led Delaware to the NCAA tournament the last two years, is also a
leading candidate for the vacant Notre Dame post along with
Xavier's Skip Prosser and reportedly is awaiting word from the
Fighting Irish before announcing his intentions. When contacted
Monday in Tampa, Brey declined to discuss the Georgia coaching
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not comment on that situation right now,'' said
Brey, who turned down the Auburn job five years ago. ``I would love
to comment on it eventually, but I just can't right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick, 60, won a national championship at UCLA in 1995 and has
led Rhode Island to two straight NCAA appearances. One sticking
point for Harrick could be Georgia's nepotism policy, which would
prevent him from hiring his son, Jim Harrick Jr., on his staff if
he came to Georgia, but said he would not rule out the possibility
if the job was offered to him.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, 35, is the former North Carolina player who has been
endorsed by former coach Dean Smith and former teammate Michael
Jordan. He was the first of the finalists to have a second
interview.

BOB DOLE'S PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>

representative DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at
732-390-4697.) 
 For release: Tues., March 30 or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Bob Dole needs a job.
 &HT;    The last few months haven't been pleasant ones, as parents and
grandparents have watched their children learn far more than any of
them needed to know about sex and our political leaders.
 &HT;    I had thought, or at least hoped, that this phase was over once
the impeachment hearings ended and wannabe-Speaker Bob Livingston
(R.-La.) dried his eyes and packed his bags for home. House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R.-Ill.) had fessed up about
fathering a child out of wedlock and Right-to-Lifer Rep. Bob Barr
(R.-Ga.) had been outed for having paid for an abortion.
 &HT;    But no, along came Bob Dole, of all people, looking straight at
me and my grandson in my living room and talking about erectile
dysfunction.
 &HT;    I have no doubt that this has been a problem for some men since
the time our ancestors lived in caves. But, considering the
extremely short life span of cavemen, I presume that it wasn't a
matter of major concern to the community at large.
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, to judge by Bob's television commercial for
Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and its much-hyped product Viagra, this
problem is not only a matter for concern to the individual
affected, but also an important issue for the rest of us.
 &HT;    As I understand it from Bob's comments, erectile dysfunction _
or, as he more casually refers to it once he's warmed to his topic,
``E.D.'' _ can be caused by many serious illnesses, as well as
depression and other emotional problems. These tragic conditions
call for a doctor's help, not pharmaceutical treatment of one of
their symptoms.
 &HT;    Bob also fails to mention that age frequently plays a part in
this condition. If it didn't, why would all of us marvel at Tony
Randall fathering two babies in his late 70s, and why would Larry
King bother to announce, when his wife became pregnant, that he
hadn't used Viagra?
 &HT;    And what about the end of the commercial? Bob begins the ad by
saying ``Courage _ something shared by countless Americans. Those
who risk their lives, those who've battled serious illness.'' He
picks up this theme at the end by urging us to ``get educated''
about E.D., and telling us that, ``It make take a little courage,
but I've always found that everything worthwhile does.''
 &HT;    Is he referring to his impressive war record and his courage
under fire? Is he _ or are the scriptwriters for the commercial _
subtly equating courage in battle and the courage it takes to get
information about impotence?
 &HT;    I would hope not. Because to do so would be to mock the tears my
aunt shed in 1942 when she found out that her 19-year-old son had
gone down with his ship in the Pacific. It would be to cheapen the
struggle my cousin Frank had when he returned home, leaving a leg
and his future on the fields at Normandy.
 &HT;    It would even be to cheapen the horrific injuries which cost a
young Bob Dole the use of one arm and years spent in rehabilitative
therapy.
 &HT;    And the former senator isn't the only one likely to be affected
by the ad. After all, his wife is now mounting her own candidacy
for the Republican presidential nomination in the election of 2000.
 &HT;    Elizabeth Dole should speak to her husband about this Viagra
business. She needs the support of the religious right to win the
Republican nomination, and her husband's public discussion of
private matters could be problematic in those circles.
 &HT;    There are also gender issues involved here, obviously. Can you
imagine if Tipper Gore or any other wife of a presidential
candidate were to do a commercial for birth-control pills or some
feminine-hygiene product? I guarantee you that the old double
standard would be at work, and people wouldn't be laughing.
 &HT;    Bob Dole has had his turn _ now it's Elizabeth's, and she'll
find it a lot easier if her husband isn't on television talking
about their sex life. If his Washington law firm isn't keeping him
busy enough, maybe she can recommend him to the Red Cross personnel
office.
 &HT;    At the very least, she should ask him to push Pfizer to air its
ads at night, instead of during the morning news programs. After
all, it seems to me that more people are thinking about this
problem when children are already in bed, rather than over the
family breakfast.
 &HT;    As for me, I'm just glad my grandson is only 4 years old and
didn't ask me what the two words meant!
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based
attorney.)

DOW TOPS 10,000 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON AND ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rose above the 10,000-point
milestone Monday and stayed there, finally breaking a barrier that
has come to symbolize a remarkable period of prosperity for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, the Dow Jones industrial
average finished the day above 10,000, closing at 10,006.78, up
184.54 points, after weeks of flirting with the mark. Even as NATO
bombs fell on Yugoslavia, investors _ energized by merger talks
between BP Amoco PLC and Atlantic Richfield Co., which drove up oil
company shares, and by huge gains in blue-chip technology stocks _
drove the market upward.
</P>
<P>
   While the day's event represented only a 1.9 percent increase in
the Dow, the index has risen more than 7,000 points this decade. On
April 17, 1991, when the Dow broke 3000 for the first time, the
economy began what would become the longest-running peacetime
expansion in US history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fantasy land for investors,'' said Ned Riley, chief
investment officer for BankBoston Corp. The average yearly return
in the 1990s, about 20 percent, is double the yearly average return
over the past 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned the Dow could fall back below 10,000 Tuesday.
But Monday's trading was big news on Wall Street, which lately has
marked time _ and profits _ in increments of 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the greater significance of the market's new high,
however, may be what it portends for the future, investment experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000 level ``is a deceptive number,'' said Thomas O'Neill,
chief investment officer of Fleet Financial Group. Though the index
overall is at a new high, the majority of stocks have sunk in
recent months. Many money managers are concerned that the market
may not continue at its present rate of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Laubscher, a veteran market analyst who works at Tucker
Anthony Inc. in New York, said the soaring Dow masks weakness in
most stocks. That's because money managers, when in doubt, invest
in the large and profitable firms that make up the index like
pharmaceutical giant Merck &AMP; Co., General Electric Co. and Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   If the market rally doesn't broaden to include other stocks,
Fleet's O'Neill said, ``it won't be a healthy long-term condition''
that would suggest strong future growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's rally went well beyond the Dow. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index, a broader market indicator, had a stronger day,
gaining 2.13 percent, compared with the Dow's 1.88 percent rise.
The S&AMP;P 500 added 27.37 points, closing at 1310.17.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq rose even more, gaining 3.05
percent, or 73.67 points, to 2492.84.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned Dow, which has few technology stocks, is no
longer a reliable gauge of the market, analysts said. For example,
Microsoft Corp., which trades on the Nasdaq but is the nation's
most successful computer company, is not among the 30 stocks that
make up the index.
</P>
<P>
   The true start of the current bull market can be traced back to
1982 when a market rally was sparked by falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   After a bear market for much of the 1970s, the Dow climbed past
1000 for the first time on Nov. 14, 1972, and crashed in October
1987. But, the Dow recovered and soared, breaking through 3000 in
1991; 4000 and 5000 in 1995; 6000 in 1996; 7000 and 8000 in 1997,
breaking through 9000 on April 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered as the Dow reached its milestone, after two
weeks of watching it rise above 10,000 briefly, only to dip below
it. Monday's rally came on the heels of a 169.5-point rise Thursday
and a small decline Friday. The day's activity brought more ups and
downs: The market rose above 10,000 around 2:30 p.m., fell below it
for a time and broke through to trade above it during the final
hour before trading halted at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing stocks on the New York Stock Exchange led decliners by
1,829 to 1,127.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, we made it _ a new record,'' said Marshall Acuff,
stock strategist for Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``We
certainly have been working on it. It took a while in coming, but
we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The gains were the result of a confluence of positive factors.
News that BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield were in merger talks
signaled that other deals could follow in the struggling oil
industry, driving up the market.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield stock rose 8 11/16, closing at 74 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks also had a good day, continuing recent strong
performance. IBM gained 5 3/16, closing at 177 9/16, and Sun
Microsystems rose 8, to 124 1/2. Intel rose 4 3/4, closing at 121
7/16.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the psychological factor of a 10,000 target.
``Ten thousand has acted as kind of a magnet, bringing stocks up to
that level,'' said Bill Morton, chief executive of the Boston Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, the Dow's high closing price had little significance.
The higher the market gets, the less numeric import can be
attributed to each increase of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal because people think it's a big deal,'' said
Samuel Hayes, a finance professor at Harvard Business School.

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS PLAN PEACE TALKS WITH MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just a week ago, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov ordered his Washington-bound plane turned around after he
learned that NATO intended to bomb Yugoslavia despite Moscow's
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The midflight U-turn seemed to sum up how little Russia's
opinion meant when NATO had serious business to do. But after a
week of massive NATO bombardments, Serb defiance, and harsh
criticism from Moscow, Russia is suddenly relevant again.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the US-led alliance will be ignoring Primakov when the
Russian premier, bolstered by the promise of a new loan from the
International Monetary Fund and the backing of NATO members France
and Italy, leaves Tuesday for urgent peace talks in Belgrade with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's mission could produce a breakthrough in the Kosovo
crisis _ or deal the Clinton administration a devastating blow by
exploiting cracks that have appeared in the alliance. That depends
on whether Primakov can get Milosevic to sign a peace agreement
ending the Serb offensive and reported atrocities against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, and under what conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his mission is ... very welcome by Clinton officials,
but they are also very nervous,'' said Michael McFaul, of the
Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for Peace. ``A real concern for
the Clinton administration is that Primakov is in the driver's
seat, and that allows him to draft his own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia was part of the six-nation Contact Group that mediated
between the Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians before the the
bombings began, and Russia encouraged Yugoslavia to sign an
agreement that would give Kosovo autonomy. But both Russia and
Yugoslavia, traditional allies who share Orthodox Christian
religion and a Slavic ethnic identity, oppose stationing NATO
troops in Kosovo to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   One concern for US officials is that Primakov might make a deal
with Milosevic that substitutes European monitors for NATO troops,
something France and Italy, under domestic pressure to end the
airstrikes, might be willing to approve.
</P>
<P>
   That would put the Clinton administration ``in an awkward
position,'' McFaul said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia has issued harsh daily criticism of NATO's
airstrikes, it has made mostly symbolic moves, such as suspending
contact with NATO, while avoiding any action that could
significantly affect relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Russian analysts credit this tactic to Primakov, the wily former
intelligence chief, who has slowly consolidated power since his
surprise appointment to prime minister in September. Primakov's
Cold War rhetoric, accompanied by protests across the political
spectrum, in the media, and in the street, has raised the question
of whether the West underestimated Russia's reaction to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Primakov's anti-Western posture has left the
Russians in a position to travel to Belgrade as a friend while
leaving Moscow the option of trying to pressure Milosevic to
approve a political solution NATO would find acceptable. Such a
solution would be a major diplomatic coup for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has intervened this way in the past, most successfuly
early last year when, as Russia's foreign minister, he extracted
last-minute concessions on arms inspection from Saddam Hussein to
halt planned US airstrikes against Iraq. Both Primakov and US
leaders took credit for the last-minute breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who will accompany
Primakov along with Russia's defense, intelligence, and foreign
policy chiefs, sought to show that Tuesday's trip to Belgrade was a
purely Russian initiative. He said Moscow had not asked NATO to
halt its daily airstrikes on the Serb capital during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going there not to save face for anyone, but to stop
aggression,'' Ivanov said in  news conference. Privately, Russian
officials say they are confident that a positive outcome could
indeed save face for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's trip appeared likely to further upstage President
Boris N. Yeltsin, who was planning to use his annual address to
parliament as a forum to denounce NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had sent a delegation of three leading liberal
politicians to Belgrade on Sunday. Primakov announced his trip
after Milosevic declined to meet with the trio.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov got another boost Monday when the IMF agreed in
principle to extend a loan to help Russia pay off billions of
dollars in foreign debt. The new loan, reportedly worth $4.8
billion, is a victory for Primakov, as the IMF had suspended a $22
billion aid package to Russia after the country's financial crash
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the IMF and the Clinton administration had demanded
proof that Primakov had a plan to reform Russia's huge state-owned
natural resource monopolies, improve revenue collection, and crack
down on waste and corruption. But the new credit comes without
signs of significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money was clearly given for political reasons,'' said
Sergei Markov of the Moscow-based Institute for Political Studies.
``Western countries have decided to underscore that the
disagreements with Russia are local, not global.''

 &HT;    Reds look to solve pitching question
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ An American League scout sat behind the
screen at City of Palms Park Monday, casually asking questions
about the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many pitchers will they carry?'' the man asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten? Ten? How can they do that? Their bullpen arms will be
dangling like cooked spaghetti strands by May,'' he said. ``I mean,
check out their starters. Other than Brett Tomko, they don't have
guys who will go more than five innings.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an astute observer, a guy worth the price of his straw
hat and sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Avery pitched against his old teammates, the Boston Red
Sox Sunday, still unable to spin the numbers on the radar gun above
84 miles an hour, mostly hitting 81 to 82 during his 91-pitch day
</P>
<P>
   He owns one complete game since 1995 and is known these days as
a five-and-fly guy _ five innings and which way to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, he worked six innings, giving up three runs
on two hits, walking five and striking out five. The Reds won,
12-4, behind two home runs by outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds, who
leads the team with four, and a seven-run third inning that
included home runs by Brian Johnson, Dmitri Young and Aaron Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere is just now regaining full strength in the surgically
repaired elbow that took nearly three years of intensive care and
recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch regressed last week when back spasms hit, forcing
him to skip a start and pushed him back in the stretching-out
process for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle won't be ready until mid-April, at the earliest,
and when he returns he won't be ready for long outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we should be looking at 12 pitchers,'' manager Jack
McKeon said. ``Even 11 would help. We carried 11 most of last
season. With the make-up of this staff, this is the wrong year to
go with 10. . .but I understand the situation and we'll make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even general manager Jim Bowden agrees 12 is the number he'd
like, but 10 is the working figure. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Four reasons: Mark Lewis. Jeffrey Hammonds. Michael Tucker. Hal
Morris. All four are extra players with guaranteed contracts.
Unless Bowden makes another trade, he can do nothing with these
players but keep them, leaving no room for extra pitchers. And he
doesn't want to trade any of the four. . .if it were possible.
</P>
<P>
   Two of baseball's astute managers, Colorado's Jim Leyland and
St. Louis' Tony La Russa, are filling their roster with 12
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that the Reds will have only five bullpen
occupants and the workload will be burdensome, maybe strenuous, for
guys like Scott Williamson, John Hudek, Scott Sullivan, Danny
Graves and Gabe White.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of those five bullpenners, Sullivan, hasn't
pitched since last Wednesday when he left a game with a strained
left buttocks. The plan is an inning for Sullivan today against the
New York Yankees, or as pitching coach Don Gullett said, ``We
anticipate Sullivan being ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good with the bullpen, though. Sullivan's spring
earned run average is 0.82 (one run in 11 innings over eight
appearances), White has not allowed a run in his last nine
appearances, Williamson has not allowed a run in his last nine
appearances (10.2 innings) and his ERA over 12 appearances is 0.61.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sure getting a lot of work and it is going to take its
toll. . .and I don't see how we can go with only 10 pitchers,''
Hudek said.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett watched Harnisch throw for 12 minutes in the bullpen
Monday morning, after Harnisch begged off an attempt Sunday. He
threw 12 minutes Saturday, but felt tightness in his back Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used all his pitches again (Monday),'' Gullett said. ``He
is on schedule to pitch Wednesday (against Philadelphia). A game
situation, facing hitters, is a big test. We'd like to see 75 to 80
pitches, but it depends on how he is going, whether he is smooth
and throwing with no problems.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch gave up 12 runs and nine hits in 2 1/3 innings against
Detroit on March 16 and hasn't pitched since, leaving his Opening
Day assignment in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he is feeling, McKeon said, ``I'd feel a lot better if
our pitchers threw strikes and quit walking people. Avery was fine,
but five walks. . .that's gotta go down. Two of 'em scored.

 &HT;    The retirement question: Determining how much to save is tricky
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Stan Goldman, a 47-year-old massage therapist, raises
a question we often hear from readers: How much do I need to put
away if I want a long, comfortable retirement?
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize this will have to get me through the rest of my
life,'' Goldman said. ``There's no pension plan for me, and I'm not
convinced Social Security is going to be there for me. I'm doing
this all on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldman and his 42-year-old wife, Trish, are in better
shape than most couples their ages. They are self-employed _ hence,
no retirement plans _ but they have already put away a substantial
amount in four individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   His question is a complex one. You can find approximate,
back-of-the-envelope answers. The worksheet on this page is one way
to do that.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to the Internet and find interactive calculators that
go into considerably more detail. There's a good one, for example,
at www.vanguard.com. Another potential resource is nearby financial
institutions. Large banks, for example, sometimes offer financial
planning services as a way of selling their own financial products.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to hire a financial planner to take you
through the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're facing one of the most important financial decisions
you can make,'' said William J. Kring, a certified financial
planner with Financial Network Corp. ``You want a pretty high level
of comfort that the numbers you have used are accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps to building a retirement plan are not hard to
describe. You figure out the basics, including how much you have
now, how much you want to spend each year after you retire, and how
much income you expect from Social Security, pensions or other
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Then you figure out how much you'll need to take each year from
your own investments. Finally, you can back into an estimate of how
much you need to have put away if you want to draw out that amount
from investments.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, of course, it's not all that easy to figure out and
correlate all those elements.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, you have to make a handful of assumptions _
things like how much inflation will be in future years and the
growth rate you can expect from your investments. And there's the
big, unsettling assumption: how long you and your dependents will
live after you retire.
</P>
<P>
   There are some details within those assumptions that require
more than a little thought. If you want a high return from your
investments, for example, you'll have to decide whether you're
willing to make riskier investments.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things that software and worksheets just can't
take into account. One is the phases of retirement _ relatively
expensive early years, followed by a less active and less costly
period. ``As you age, you'll spend less on clothes, and you may
replace your car every seven years instead of every four years,''
Kring pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Another not-so-obvious problem is getting an accurate estimate
of retirement tax loads. ``Worksheets may overestimate the impact
of income taxes or not take into account the taxes on withdrawals
from retirement accounts,'' Kring said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the best path? For some, the answer will depend on the
usual balancing act performed by shoppers: how good a product I
want vs. how much I'm willing or able to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The horseback estimates are a good start. But if you want more
meticulous estimates, you'll have to pay. Fee-only planners may
charge from $75 to $250 an hour. A complete financial plan,
including retirement needs, can cost from $500 to $5,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to choose a planner is word-of-mouth referral. Ask
friends or co-workers whom they have used and can recommend.
Lawyers or accountants may name some planners they trust.
</P>
<P>
   For an excellent and free booklet on evaluating financial
planners, contact the Certified Financial Planner Board of
Standards and ask for ``10 Questions to Ask When Choosing a
Financial Planner.'' Call 1-888-237-6275 for a copy, or read it on
the Internet: http://www.cfp-board.org

<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ I take the issue of underage drinking
personally, very personally. Especially where it concerns adults _
parents _ throwing parties and making alcohol available to
youngsters. Not just their own. Other people's kids. My kids.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what goes through their minds as they watch the
teen-agers get in their cars and drive away after the party,
putting their young lives in danger, as well as other people's
lives, including mine and my kids'.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they think they are super cool parents because, well, kids
are going to drink anyway. And they drank when they were kids, and
survived. Oh, and giving ``supervised'' drinking parties allows
them to keep an eye on the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Don't do me any favors.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder about those who have been cited for their law-breaking
ways, providing alcohol to minors, and what went through their
minds as they saw their misguided efforts result in their child or
someone else's child
</P>
<P>
   becoming a criminal. In Texas, a citation to a minor in
possession of alcohol is no traffic ticket. It becomes part of an
individual's criminal record. But maybe those adults' twisted logic
holds that as another one of
</P>
<P>
   those rites of passage and that makes it OK.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. Alcohol has passed over these lips. But I'm not
selfish or stupid enough to give it to my children, who are all
still underage, or to make it available to them. Neither am I such
a bonehead that I'd give it
</P>
<P>
   to your kids.
</P>
<P>
   It gets even more personal. I have watched a talented family
member waste his life away, a slave to alcohol. Some adult was
trying to be cool with him and saw no harm in introducing him to a
cold beer. Now in his late 50s, he still battles the demon. I've
watched him and his bottle destroy two marriages. I've watched his
parents suffer as he dies slowly before their eyes. I've watched
his son become an alcoholic. And I dread the day I get
</P>
<P>
   the telephone call telling me this person I love dearly is dead
or that he has gotten behind the wheel and killed someone.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he has been through countless programs and treatment
facilities but alcohol is still winning the game he started playing
long before he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   If it is ingrained in your family's culture to introduce alcohol
to minors, if you believe you must absolutely do so, then keep it
at your house. Do not be a distributor to other people's children,
especially mine. And do not
</P>
<P>
   serve alcohol to young people and then send them out in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Stupidity such as this has a way of coming back to bite you,
hard. It is commendable that the Texas Legislature is considering
laws against minors who are found in possession of alcohol, but we
need stricter laws and much
</P>
<P>
   higher fines for those adults who provide it to them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the possibility of sharing a criminal record with their
child would deter some of our free-wheeling adults. I've also heard
angry parents say they would seriously consider a lawsuit against
those who provide alcohol to their kids.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is it never needs to get that far _ if adults would
stop acting like children.

 &HT;    Bush has one way to get around First Amendment: the old end run
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush and John Cornyn may be on to
something asserting that a court-ordered ban on prayer at football
games violates Texans' freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe, as most Texans do, that football is religion,
the governor and our new attorney general are paydirt-bound in the
appeal they plan. On the other hand, if they assert that the
Constitution gives the majority power to make sports events
religious events, they have some selling to do.
</P>
<P>
   The latter being the apparent case, Bush, who claims to be an
education governor, is giving children a most damaging civics
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   In words and actions he is patronizing those who cling to an
absurdity: that majority-rule religion is a ``constitutional
right''; that if the majority can't impose religion on others, the
rights of those in the majority are denied.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable why Bush would take that position,
politically. After all, he needs the votes of those who live in the
Wobegon world where every kid is above average and Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is not so homogenous. But some genes have more political
capital. So those who support majority-imposed school prayer _
decided by the students if not by the principal or school board _
need not worry that Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Taoism or Scientology
would come from the loudspeakers as students sharpened their
pencils or as gridiron warriors prepped their cleats.
</P>
<P>
   The too-common argument on behalf of school prayer is not what
you'd sell to a judge: ``We had it when I was in school. So what of
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court that in 1963 ruled against organized school
prayer (the ``Lord's Prayer'' in that case) has been depicted as
Satan's servant, as some mortals cavalierly ``taking God out of the
classroom.'' None of those whose umbrage still overflows from that
moral affront seem to acknowledge that after the court in '63 did
what it did, courts subsequently affirmed it over and over and over
and over. The 5th Circuit Court did it again on the issue of
majority-rule prayer at football games.
</P>
<P>
   You see, courts aren't operating under the ``we had it when I
was a kid'' standard. They are examining the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Just once I want school-prayer backers to have the intellectual
honesty, instead of saying ``the courts took prayer out of
schools'' (they did not; students can pray to themselves any time
they wish), to say ``the Constitution doesn't appear to allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is implied in attempts to amend the Constitution to allow
organized school prayer. The Warren Court isn't Satan's servant,
ladies and gentlemen. The First Amendment is.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue Cornyn will challenge is the court's limiting
graduation ceremonies to ``nonsectarian'' or ``nonproselytizing''
prayer. The court ruled that graduation is a sufficiently solemn
event for an invocation not to be construed as an invasion of
religious rights, but said solemnity doesn't give the majority the
authority to impose sectarian prayer on a public-school audience.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-prayer? If anything, this decision bends over backwards to
rationalize state-established religion _ not a particular sect but
religion unto itself. We don't have to go so far as the ghost of
Madalyn Murray O'Hair to raise questions about that. We can call on
Baylor University religious liberty scholar James Wood, whose motto
is: ``There is no freedom of religion without freedom from
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we aren't there and we won't be, and we can live with
that. We also can live with prayer at football games. But the fact
is, a majority imposing its sectarianism on others at a school
event is exactly what what the establishment clause forbids.
</P>
<P>
   However, if we can convince the courts that football is a
religion unto itself, then prayer is just part of the game.

   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' is the biggest
cultural event this side of the Millennium. Now your readers can
get in on the action early with Ian Spelling's STAR WARS COUNTDOWN,
a multipart package of interviews with the film's stars and some
fun features _ with art. From The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling has already done his first interview _ with Samuel L.
Jackson, who plays Mace Windu.
</P>
<P>
   From the interview:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Misusing an otherwise just indignation at
racism, congressional Democrats recently set a neat little trap to
embarrass Republicans, and Republicans, as is their way when race
is involved, dutifully lined up on the brink and jumped right in.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ An e-mail message last week was addressed to
me and 15 others. At the bottom of the page, I was able to see that
the sender, along with another 15 persons, received it from someone
else. What he passed along to me, and to all those others, was an
extension of a venal hoax. My friend didn't recognize it as such
and, thus, compounded it. The gist of what he sent began: ``I'm not
sure many of you watched the recent taping of the Oprah Winfrey
show where her guest was Tommy Hilfiger . . .'' (Kleinberg, Cox
News Service) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-COLUMN _ I take the issue of underage drinking
personally, very personally. Especially where it concerns adults
``parents'' throwing parties and making alcohol available to
youngsters. Not just their own. Other people's kids. My kids.

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ Millenium madness? I have not begun to panic.
Nor have I rented a cave in West Virginia and begun stocking it
with Spam and automatic weapons. Talk about an exercise in
futility. Who'd want to shoot anybody over a few tins of
reconditioned ham? (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush and John Cornyn may
be on to something asserting that a court-ordered ban on prayer at
football games violates Texans' freedom of religion. If you
believe, as most Texans do, that football is religion, the governor
and our new attorney general are paydirt-bound in the appeal they
plan. On the other hand, if they assert that the Constitution gives
the majority power to make sports events religious events, they
have some selling to do. The latter being the apparent case, Bush,
who claims to be an education governor, is giving children a most
damaging civics lesson.(Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   COMICBOOK-CONVENTION _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Christian Holmes
is a nice, normal fellow. At 30 years old, the future looks bright.
And he really enjoys dressing up like a superhero. Not Superman or
Batman. He's got a thing for a comic-book hero known as The Thing.
For special occasions, Holmes dons an orange ski mask, orange socks
and a pair of orange longjohns covered with orange sponges and made
modest by the addition of a skimpy blue Speedo. The Thing, you see,
was damaged by gamma rays in a horrific accident years ago that
made his skin look like a portable rock slide. Holmes couldn't glue
rocks to his longjohns. Sponges had to suffice. ``I drove here like
this in my convertible,'' he says, his voice tinged with pride.
``Got a few honks.'' It isn't often he gets to show off this getup.
But he did break it out for one of his favorite events, the MegaCon
comic book and science fiction convention in Orlando this month.

THE GREEDY HAND: HOW TAXES DRIVE AMERICANS CRAZY AND WHAT TO DO
ABOUT IT 
Amity Shlaes (Random House, $22.95) 
 
 By BOB KAMMAN  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For readers who always wanted a book that makes sense out of the
federal, state and local tax system, Amity Shlaes' ``The Greedy
Hand'' brings an end to the search. It's not that the book provides
a logical explanation, but it makes clear that there are no good
reasons for the absurd tax rules that too often control our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Shlaes, an editorial writer for the ``Wall Street Journal,''
took her title from early American tax protester Thomas Paine, who
complained about ``the greedy hand of government, thrusting itself
into every corner and crevice of industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy the book to learn where to shop for clothes without paying
sales tax (anywhere in Minnesota will do, but the Mall of America
is best because its restaurants are also tax-free). Read it to find
out more than accountants know _ at least until after April 15,
when they have time to catch up on their reading _ about the causes
and effects of our bizarre tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In each of 10 well-researched, highly readable chapters, Shlaes
discusses an aspect of life touched by taxes in a way that it
probably shouldn't. ``Your Baby,'' ``Your Work,'' ``Your Success,''
``Your Retirement'' and ``Your Death'' all illustrate that history
and politics, more than logic and fairness, determine not just our
tax bill, but how we live.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax, income tax, employment taxes and estate taxes, Shlaes
writes, are ``meddling, bossy, intrusive. Today, our tax code
doesn't stop at merely taking its share. It also wants to tell
people how to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone should read her chapter on ``Your Marriage.'' Only
taxpayers who are married, or thinking about it, would find it
educational and disturbing. She tells the story of Congressman Dave
McIntosh (R-Ind.), and a letter he received in early 1997 from two
constituents who were living together and wanted to marry but
couldn't afford the $2,800 tax increase. McIntosh undertook to
repeal the ``marriage penalty,'' and received encouragement from
then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer, and the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, however, conservatives had discovered
that repeal of the marriage penalty, for couples with two incomes,
also meant repeal of the marriage (itals) bonus, (end itals) for
couples with just one income. ``The failing marriage penalty
legislation,'' Shlaes writes, ``came to symbolize the greater
failure of the Republican Party to unify on important issues, and
the failure of the Democrats to play a meaningful role in
addressing Americans' tax troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlaes, however, fails to deliver on her subtitle promise to
tell us ``what to do about it.'' Her recommendations are slogans:
``Taxes have to be simple,'' she writes. ``Taxes have to be lower .
. . we must lock in change.'' Helpful observations, but not a
comprehensive plan.
</P>
<P>
   She contributes to the discussion, though, by pointing out that
a national sales tax is no panacea. ``In Europe, where value-added
taxes have long reigned, they have done much to sour the political
culture. Heavy sales taxes have helped render Europe a continent of
scofflaws. . . . America is too good for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she endorses the ``alternative maximum tax,'' proposed
by Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute. It gives taxpayers a
choice: Pay the lower of what you owe under the old system, or pay
a flat rate of ``something like 25, 23 or 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, of course, there are already opportunities
to figure tax both ways. Itemize, or take the standard deduction?
Separate, or joint returns for married couples? Convert to a Roth
IRA now, or pay on IRA distributions later?
</P>
<P>
   Another way of figuring the tax, on top of the many choices that
already must be considered? If tax reform must wait until the
system collapses from its own weight, that idea might be the last
straw. &QL;

SENATOR PUSHES REFORM, BUT IRS CHANGES SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   Duplication warning: Story also moved in ``E'' (entertainment)
category.  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By BOB KAMMAN  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If American taxpayers were to vote on which senator born in July
1921 accomplished the most in 1998, John Glenn might take second
place.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could be William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del), whose Senate
Finance Committee hearings set a fire under the Internal Revenue
Service and launched the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act with a
unanimous Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Roth's efforts, our federal tax system may never be
the same. Then again, the result may be much the same as Glenn's
space-shuttle mission, going around in circles while public
interest fades, then landing in the same place where it started.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring such skepticism is Roth himself, who writes in a new
book:
</P>
<P>
   ``As Charles Rossotti, the agency's new commissioner, told me,
changing the culture of the IRS will require more than legislation.
It will take a decade of training and oversight, vigilance by
Congress, and zero tolerance for abuse and mismanagement within the
Service. . . . As we discovered in our investigation, many of the
abuses committed by Service personnel were in violation of laws
that were already on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, prevention of IRS abuse is much like cancer
research; there is great hope for the future, but no immediate cure
for many of today's victims.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's book, published by Atlantic Monthly Press and co-authored
with his senior staffer, William H. Nixon, is the right material
with the wrong title, ``The Power to Destroy,'' from Chief Justice
John Marshall's quote (in an opinion that had nothing to do with
federal tax collection) that ``the power to tax is the power to
destroy.'' A better title would be ``Making Sausage,'' from a maxim
by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck: ``The less people know
about how sausages and laws are made, the better they'll sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   One revealing insight into the legislative process is Roth's
admission that Congress for many years failed to watch IRS
operations closely because of ``intimidation, the concern that the
agency, as it had been known to do, might wreck the political
fortunes of the senator or congressman who probed too deeply into
its activities.'' He says his committee's senior Democrat, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, told him, ``What seemed to matter
most was that taxes were being collected . . . we have never paid
attention either to (IRS) or to the job we were giving it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Roth and Moynihan were members of Senate Finance when a
subcommittee chaired by their now-retired colleague David Pryor
(D-Ark.) conducted an earlier round of hearings on IRS abuse. After
I testified at those 1992 hearings, Pryor wrote me, ``Over the past
year, it has become obvious that we need additional safeguards to
protect taxpayers from the devastating effect of IRS mistakes and
misdeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's conversion to the cause of taxpayer rights may have come
late in his Senate career, but (perhaps for that reason) it came
with considerable zeal. In fact, his book sets an example for
lawmakers who grapple with other major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One way Congress deals with problems is to appoint a commission
to study them and make recommendations. A couple of years later,
when the subject is no longer in the headlines, the commission's
report is filed away and forgotten, or turned into legislative
proposals that are watered down in committee before final dilution
during floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   Roth stood the process on its head.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, an 18-member
bipartisan group set up by Congress in 1996, finished its work in
1997 with a report that identified many IRS problems and offered
solutions for them that were acceptable to its mix of public
officials and private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that they didn't go far enough,'' Roth says of
the commission's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He prevented a Senate vote on a bill the House had passed
quickly in 1997 with most of the commission's recommendations
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to see a small step taken by Congress when I
knew that events were coming together in such a way that we could
restructure and reform the agency from the ground up,'' he writes.
``Only a few times in history had conditions been so ripe for
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to real reform evaporated after the 1998 Senate
Finance Committee hearings, chaired by Roth. The resulting
legislation is not perfect, but it is significantly better than its
earlier drafts. Roth himself admits that ``much more needs to be
done,'' and he promises to carry on the good work.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs, though, that the book on IRS reform is
not only written and published, but closed.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the law is an IRS Oversight Board, with six
members appointed from the private sector and an IRS employee
representative joining the commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
secretary of Treasury to monitor the IRS administration. As Roth's
book explains, ``The board will have the authority to influence the
appointment and removal of commissioners, as well as top-level
officers, and it will work to ensure that the organization and
operation of the agency is carried out as Congress intends.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law required that the president appoint the Oversight
Board's members by Jan. 22. That date came and went, with no action
from the White House and no expression of concern from Capitol
Hill. (Both, of course, were occupied with other matters.) A month
later, a White House spokesman said appointments were ``very
close.'' Two months after the deadline, it's possible that names
will be announced by April 15, because tax stories attract
attention around that date. But it's not possible that taxpayers
who delay filing their returns for the same amount of time will
escape IRS attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the average taxpayer should exercise even greater
caution to escape penalties for tardy compliance, according to
Roth's collection of supposedly helpful tax hints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always file your tax return by registered or certified mail,
or use another carrier like Federal Express, Airborne or UPS. But
it's not enough simply to send the return in this manner; you
should also prepare a written statement that you sign, stating what
was inside the envelope you sent. . . .On the day you mail the tax
return, you should prepare a declaration of mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say; he doesn't have to stand in line at the
post office. (If you mail your return on time, trust the post
office to get it to the IRS. But if your check is not cashed
quickly, or your refund isn't issued within normal processing
times, follow up on the reason.)
</P>
<P>
   Buy the book _ even though the $23 price isn't deductible for
most people because of tax ``reform'' that Roth helped pass in 1986
_ but skip the chapter of banal tax advice.
</P>
<P>
   And if you expect everything that comes out of Washington these
days to touch on sex scandals, the book won't disappoint you. It
tells of the IRS district director who solicits sex from a female
employee. When she reports it to internal inspectors, they do
nothing, so she calls the local police. The district director is
transferred to Washington, where he gets a raise. Also, there is
the IRS collection supervisor whose career went downhill after he
objected to a stripper named Miss Goodbody appearing at a manager's
birthday party in an IRS office during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Roth's book is about taxpayers getting raped.
And there are hints that even Roth doesn't get much respect. He
asks for a copy of a report on an IRS employee attitude survey and
is told by current management that it doesn't exist. Employees in
district offices have it, though, and send it to him. Every
taxpayer should hope to find such decency at the bottom when there
is lack of concern at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Roth ends with a pledge ``to push for tax reform _ a tax code
that is fair, simple, and economically constructive.'' Along with
IRS reform, however, his legacy to American taxpayers is the Roth
IRA, which has convinced thousands of taxpayers to pay millions of
dollars in tax now to avoid paying more later. Yet if you believe
that the income tax will cease to be the major source of revenue
for the federal government, you have to feel sorry for anyone with
a Roth IRA, and for its senatorial namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's book is subtitled ``How the IRS Became America's Most
Powerful Agency, How Congress Is Taking Control, and What You Can
Do to Protect Yourself Under the New Law.'' When was the last time
a lawmaker wrote a book about how Americans can protect themselves
under a newly enacted law he sponsored? &QL;

THE POWER TO DESTROY: How the IRS Became America's Most Powerful
Agency, How Congress Is Taking Control, and What You Can Do to
Protect Yourself Under the Law 
by Sen. William V. Roth Jr. and William H. Nixon (Atlantic Monthly, By BOB KAMMAN  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If American taxpayers were to vote on which senator born in July
1921 accomplished the most in 1998, John Glenn might take second
place.
</P>
<P>
   The winner could be William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del), whose Senate
Finance Committee hearings set a fire under the Internal Revenue
Service and launched the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act with a
unanimous Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Roth's efforts, our federal tax system may never be
the same. Then again, the result may be much the same as Glenn's
space-shuttle mission, going around in circles while public
interest fades, then landing in the same place where it started.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiring such skepticism is Roth himself, who writes in a new
book:
</P>
<P>
   ``As Charles Rossotti, the agency's new commissioner, told me,
changing the culture of the IRS will require more than legislation.
It will take a decade of training and oversight, vigilance by
Congress, and zero tolerance for abuse and mismanagement within the
Service. . . . As we discovered in our investigation, many of the
abuses committed by Service personnel were in violation of laws
that were already on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, prevention of IRS abuse is much like cancer
research; there is great hope for the future, but no immediate cure
for many of today's victims.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's book, published by Atlantic Monthly Press and co-authored
with his senior staffer, William H. Nixon, is the right material
with the wrong title, ``The Power to Destroy,'' from Chief Justice
John Marshall's quote (in an opinion that had nothing to do with
federal tax collection) that ``the power to tax is the power to
destroy.'' A better title would be ``Making Sausage,'' from a maxim
by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck: ``The less people know
about how sausages and laws are made, the better they'll sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   One revealing insight into the legislative process is Roth's
admission that Congress for many years failed to watch IRS
operations closely because of ``intimidation, the concern that the
agency, as it had been known to do, might wreck the political
fortunes of the senator or congressman who probed too deeply into
its activities.'' He says his committee's senior Democrat, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York, told him, ``What seemed to matter
most was that taxes were being collected . . . we have never paid
attention either to (IRS) or to the job we were giving it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Roth and Moynihan were members of Senate Finance when a
subcommittee chaired by their now-retired colleague David Pryor
(D-Ark.) conducted an earlier round of hearings on IRS abuse. After
I testified at those 1992 hearings, Pryor wrote me, ``Over the past
year, it has become obvious that we need additional safeguards to
protect taxpayers from the devastating effect of IRS mistakes and
misdeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's conversion to the cause of taxpayer rights may have come
late in his Senate career, but (perhaps for that reason) it came
with considerable zeal. In fact, his book sets an example for
lawmakers who grapple with other major legislation.
</P>
<P>
   One way Congress deals with problems is to appoint a commission
to study them and make recommendations. A couple of years later,
when the subject is no longer in the headlines, the commission's
report is filed away and forgotten, or turned into legislative
proposals that are watered down in committee before final dilution
during floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   Roth stood the process on its head.
</P>
<P>
   The National Commission on Restructuring the IRS, an 18-member
bipartisan group set up by Congress in 1996, finished its work in
1997 with a report that identified many IRS problems and offered
solutions for them that were acceptable to its mix of public
officials and private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that they didn't go far enough,'' Roth says of
the commission's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He prevented a Senate vote on a bill the House had passed
quickly in 1997 with most of the commission's recommendations
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to see a small step taken by Congress when I
knew that events were coming together in such a way that we could
restructure and reform the agency from the ground up,'' he writes.
``Only a few times in history had conditions been so ripe for
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to real reform evaporated after the 1998 Senate
Finance Committee hearings, chaired by Roth. The resulting
legislation is not perfect, but it is significantly better than its
earlier drafts. Roth himself admits that ``much more needs to be
done,'' and he promises to carry on the good work.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs, though, that the book on IRS reform is
not only written and published, but closed.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the law is an IRS Oversight Board, with six
members appointed from the private sector and an IRS employee
representative joining the commissioner of Internal Revenue and the
secretary of Treasury to monitor the IRS administration. As Roth's
book explains, ``The board will have the authority to influence the
appointment and removal of commissioners, as well as top-level
officers, and it will work to ensure that the organization and
operation of the agency is carried out as Congress intends.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law required that the president appoint the Oversight
Board's members by Jan. 22. That date came and went, with no action
from the White House and no expression of concern from Capitol
Hill. (Both, of course, were occupied with other matters.) A month
later, a White House spokesman said appointments were ``very
close.'' Two months after the deadline, it's possible that names
will be announced by April 15, because tax stories attract
attention around that date. ned yet. But it's not possible that
taxpayers who delay filing their returns for the same amount of
time will escape IRS attention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the average taxpayer should exercise even greater
caution to escape penalties for tardy compliance, according to
Roth's collection of supposedly helpful tax hints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always file your tax return by registered or certified mail,
or use another carrier like Federal Express, Airborne or UPS. But
it's not enough simply to send the return in this manner; you
should also prepare a written statement that you sign, stating what
was inside the envelope you sent. . . .On the day you mail the tax
return, you should prepare a declaration of mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say; he doesn't have to stand in line at the
post office. (If you mail your return on time, trust the post
office to get it to the IRS. But if your check is not cashed
quickly, or your refund isn't issued within normal processing
times, follow up on the reason.)
</P>
<P>
   Buy the book _ even though the $23 price isn't deductible for
most people because of tax ``reform'' that Roth helped pass in 1986
_ but skip the chapter of banal tax advice.
</P>
<P>
   And if you expect everything that comes out of Washington these
days to touch on sex scandals, the book won't disappoint you. It
tells of the IRS district director who solicits sex from a female
employee. When she reports it to internal inspectors, they do
nothing, so she calls the local police. The district director is
transferred to Washington, where he gets a raise. Also, there is
the IRS collection supervisor whose career went downhill after he
objected to a stripper named Miss Goodbody appearing at a manager's
birthday party in an IRS office during business hours.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Roth's book is about taxpayers getting raped.
And there are hints that even Roth doesn't get much respect. He
asks for a copy of a report on an IRS employee attitude survey and
is told by current management that it doesn't exist. Employees in
district offices have it, though, and send it to him. Every
taxpayer should hope to find such decency at the bottom when there
is lack of concern at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Roth ends with a pledge ``to push for tax reform _ a tax code
that is fair, simple, and economically constructive.'' Along with
IRS reform, however, his legacy to American taxpayers is the Roth
IRA, which has convinced thousands of taxpayers to pay millions of
dollars in tax now to avoid paying more later. Yet if you believe
that the income tax will cease to be the major source of revenue
for the federal government, you have to feel sorry for anyone with
a Roth IRA, and for its senatorial namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's book is subtitled ``How the IRS Became America's Most
Powerful Agency, How Congress Is Taking Control, and What You Can
Do to Protect Yourself Under the New Law.'' When was the last time
a lawmaker wrote a book about how Americans can protect themselves
under a newly enacted law he sponsored? &QL;

THE GREEDY HAND: HOW TAXES DRIVE AMERICANS CRAZY AND WHAT TO DO
ABOUT IT 
Amity Shlaes (Random House, $22.95) 
 
 By BOB KAMMAN  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For readers who always wanted a book that makes sense out of the
federal, state and local tax system, Amity Shlaes' ``The Greedy
Hand'' brings an end to the search. It's not that the book provides
a logical explanation, but it makes clear that there are no good
reasons for the absurd tax rules that too often control our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Shlaes, an editorial writer for the ``Wall Street Journal,''
took her title from early American tax protester Thomas Paine, who
complained about ``the greedy hand of government, thrusting itself
into every corner and crevice of industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Buy the book to learn where to shop for clothes without paying
sales tax (anywhere in Minnesota will do, but the Mall of America
is best because its restaurants are also tax-free). Read it to find
out more than accountants know _ at least until after April 15,
when they have time to catch up on their reading _ about the causes
and effects of our bizarre tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In each of 10 well-researched, highly readable chapters, Shlaes
discusses an aspect of life touched by taxes in a way that it
probably shouldn't. ``Your Baby,'' ``Your Work,'' ``Your Success,''
``Your Retirement'' and ``Your Death'' all illustrate that history
and politics, more than logic and fairness, determine not just our
tax bill, but how we live.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax, income tax, employment taxes and estate taxes, Shlaes
writes, are ``meddling, bossy, intrusive. Today, our tax code
doesn't stop at merely taking its share. It also wants to tell
people how to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone should read her chapter on ``Your Marriage.'' Only
taxpayers who are married, or thinking about it, would find it
educational and disturbing. She tells the story of Congressman Dave
McIntosh (R-Ind.), and a letter he received in early 1997 from two
constituents who were living together and wanted to marry but
couldn't afford the $2,800 tax increase. McIntosh undertook to
repeal the ``marriage penalty,'' and received encouragement from
then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer, and the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, however, conservatives had discovered
that repeal of the marriage penalty, for couples with two incomes,
also meant repeal of the marriage (itals) bonus, (end itals) for
couples with just one income. ``The failing marriage penalty
legislation,'' Shlaes writes, ``came to symbolize the greater
failure of the Republican Party to unify on important issues, and
the failure of the Democrats to play a meaningful role in
addressing Americans' tax troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlaes, however, fails to deliver on her subtitle promise to
tell us ``what to do about it.'' Her recommendations are slogans:
``Taxes have to be simple,'' she writes. ``Taxes have to be lower .
. . we must lock in change.'' Helpful observations, but not a
comprehensive plan.
</P>
<P>
   She contributes to the discussion, though, by pointing out that
a national sales tax is no panacea. ``In Europe, where value-added
taxes have long reigned, they have done much to sour the political
culture. Heavy sales taxes have helped render Europe a continent of
scofflaws. . . . America is too good for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she endorses the ``alternative maximum tax,'' proposed
by Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute. It gives taxpayers a
choice: Pay the lower of what you owe under the old system, or pay
a flat rate of ``something like 25, 23 or 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, of course, there are already opportunities
to figure tax both ways. Itemize, or take the standard deduction?
Separate, or joint returns for married couples? Convert to a Roth
IRA now, or pay on IRA distributions later?
</P>
<P>
   Another way of figuring the tax, on top of the many choices that
already must be considered? If tax reform must wait until the
system collapses from its own weight, that idea might be the last
straw. &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE TIMES OF MY LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; Max Frankel (Random House, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and his mother came to America in 1940, after months of
terror in Nazi Germany. Life as a refugee had a peculiar effect on
young Max. ``In a sense,'' he says, ``I became a chronic fugitive,
forever looking to escape the mundane, to find new soil and
stimulation.'' He went to Columbia University (at that time for
less than $700 a year) because he wanted to write for its newspaper
_ as he says, he ``followed the ink'' _ and won a job as campus
stringer for the ``New York Times'' when another student in line
elected to go with the ``Herald Tribune.'' Over the next 50 years,
Frankel rose from stringer to rewrite man to foreign correspondent,
Washington bureau chief, editor of the editorial page and finally,
executive editor of the ``Times'' (he retired in 1994). Here he
offers his impressions of the Cold War, the Cuban missile crisis
and the Vietnam War, the Pentagon papers and Watergate, and leaders
such as Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. There are also interesting
passages about the inner workings of the ``Times,'' including
Frankel's efforts to diversify its staff. He had his bungled
moments, as when he made a remark to a ``Washington Post'' reporter
equating the coverage of ``teas'' with the presence of more women
on the front page. The next day, every woman at the ``Times''
protested by wearing tea bags as earrings. This memoir is both an
account of survival in Hitler's Germany and an American success
story played out against some of the most interesting events of the
century. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ROCKS OF AGES &QL; 
 &UR; Stephen Jay Gould (Ballantine, $18.95)
</P>
<P>
   The symbol of the scientific revolution that flourished during
the late 17th century is Isaac Newton, a man to whom Alexander Pope
paid tribute: ``Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night / God
said, `Let Newton be,' and all was light.'' Yet Gould points out
that Newton and many of his contemporaries were ardent theists _
``He spent far more time working on his exegeses of the prophecies
of Daniel and John, and on his attempt to integrate biblical
chronology with the histories of other ancient peoples, than he
ever devoted to physics.'' In this book, Gould argues that science
and religion are profoundly different but equally vital subjects.
While science tries to record and explain the factual character of
the natural world, religion looks to human meanings and values.
Gould proposes that we abandon the notion that the two are in
conflict and adopt instead a principle of ``respectful
non-interference, accompanied by intense dialogue between the
two.'' This is Gould's contribution to Ballantine's ``Library of
Contemporary Thought,'' a monthly series of books by authors on
topics of their choosing. Anna Quindlen wrote about her love for
reading. Carl Hiaasen trashed the Disney empire. John Feinstein
analyzed the talent of Tiger Woods. Needless to say, Gould's book
takes the series to a higher plane. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ELEMENTALS &QL; 
 &UR; A.S. Byatt (Random House, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Here's another of Byatt's ``little books'' (after ``The Matisse
Stories'' and ``The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye''), which are
lovely to look at and have wonderful stories inside. There are six
here, subtitled ``Stories of Fire and Ice.'' In ``Cold,'' a
beautiful and adored princess flourishes only in the icy weather of
her homeland and risks everything when she falls in love with a
prince from a faraway desert country. In ``Crocodile Tears,'' a
woman reacts to the sudden death of her husband by running away,
taking train after train without knowing where she is going until
she arrives in Spain and meets a stranger who is escaping from
troubles of his own. In ``A Lamia in the Cevennes,'' an enchanted,
snakelike monster takes up residence at the bottom of a painter's
swimming pool. In Byatt's hands, these are odd, otherwordly stories
that have no boundaries, elegantly told fairy tales. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FACTASTIC BOOK OF 1001 LISTS &QL; 
 &UR; Russell Ash (DK, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   We don't know how we came this far in life without knowing that
the longest coastline in the world belongs to Canada, with 151,485
miles (Monaco, with two miles, is the loser). Or that Lebanon _
yes, folks, Lebanon _ is the most moviegoing country, with the
United States eighth behind China, Georgia, India, Iceland,
Australia and New Zealand. Or that the Stephens Island frog,
evolved about 275 million years ago, is found only in New Zealand
and is thought to be the ancestor of all frogs. New &AMP; Notable has
never paid attention to Ash before, but our resistance has been
worn down by his dogged success with his annual ``Top Ten of
Everything'' volumes (they are so trivial that if you let them go
they might just float away). This book has headings such as
``Grisly Execution Methods'' and ``Famous Assassination Victims,''
``Unusual Things Sold at Auctions'' (how nice that the skull of
Swedish philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg sold in 1978 to the
Stockholm Royal Academy of Science, reuniting it with the rest of
his body), ``Famous Disabled Achievers'' and ``Odd Arty-Facts'' (In
1961, it was discovered that a Henri Matisse painting had been
hanging upside-down in the Museum of Modern Art for two months and
no one knew). Ash includes his e-mail address so you can send him
factastic ideas for future volumes. &QL;

LEARN TO MINIMIZE MUTUAL FUND TAX BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Members of Congress have a lot on their minds these
days _ the Kosovo unrest, Social Security reform, next year's
elections . . . and mutual fund taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a bill recently was introduced in Congress that would
direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to require fund
companies to disclose the after-tax impacts of their trading
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (have) suggested that shareholders need more information
on the effect of taxes on their investments,'' SEC Chairman Arthur
Levitt said last week during a stop in Palm Desert, Calif. ``I
share this concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The days when people could trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds and
other investments while remaining blissfully unaware of the tax
consequences are drawing to a close. The tax impact of investing
has become a hot topic thanks to the roaring stock market and new
saving incentives such as 401(k) retirement plans. As a result,
millions of Americans have amassed big paper profits and, sooner or
later, will have to face the tax bite. Investment companies, the
media and even Congress are paying more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest cost by far on unsheltered capital _ bigger than
management fees, custodial charges and commissions, and nearly
always enough of a bite to outweigh stock dividends or bond price
gains _ is taxes,'' reads a report from Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.,
a New York investment-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial Group, a mutual-fund family in Boston, estimates
that Americans shelled out $34 billion in taxes on their fund
capital gains in 1997, the most recent year for which information
is available. That's more than the annual cost of operating all
U.S. prisons and exceeds the yearly amount the government spends on
medical care for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It also represents a quintupling from the estimated $7 billion
in taxes paid out in 1990, the first year of Colonial's study.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the best ways to minimize your tax bill while not
letting tax fears keep you on the investment sidelines? Here are
some guidelines as suggested by Sanford C. Bernstein and other
sources:
</P>
<P>
   - Avoid short-term gains. If possible, avoid selling an
investment and locking in a profit until your holding period has
crossed into the long-term range, after one year. You will pay no
more than 20 percent in taxes on a long-term capital gain. But
short-term profits, which are taxed as ordinary income, could face
a hit of up to 39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of trading, even if it's profitable, creates a lot of
taxable gains,'' said Ernie Scarbrough, a managing director at
brokerage US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   - Offset gains with losses. If you must sell a stock or other
investment at a short-term profit, consider getting rid of another
investment that's in the red. You can use losses to shelter gains,
dollar for dollar. Excess losses can be applied to reduce ordinary
taxable income, up to $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's easier to put an offsetting strategy into play
during the fourth quarter, when you can estimate your gains and
losses for the year. Yet Scarbrough points out that by delaying,
you might face lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wait until the last quarter, you're competing with
other investors in the same situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - Lean to index mutual funds. Regular mutual funds must pay
distributions to shareholders that reflect stock or bond positions
sold at a profit. These payouts are taxable in the year received,
even for investors who didn't do any trading of their own. Index
portfolios and other ``tax-efficient'' mutual funds trade
infrequently and thus don't often convert paper profits into
realized gains.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you need to realize that the tax bite on any such profits is
merely deferred, not eliminated. ``When you transfer into another
fund, or sell shares for any reason, the tax bill may shock you,''
the Sanford C. Bernstein report reads.
</P>
<P>
   - Consider individual stocks for tax efficiency. Unlike with
mutual funds, you control your tax destiny with stocks because you
decide whether _ and when _ to sell. In theory, you can permanently
avoid taxes because any liability gets lifted for your heirs when
you die. That said, most people don't hold stocks throughout their
lives, which means a tax bill will come home to roost eventually.
</P>
<P>
   One key advantage of hiring a private money manager rather than
using mutual funds is that the adviser can time his or her trades
to boost the tax efficiency of your account, notes Eric Nelson,
senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Investment Management in
Scottsdale. However, private managers might not accept you as a
client unless you have a portfolio of $250,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't avoid high-dividend stocks. According to conventional
wisdom, you should stay away from high-yielding stocks since
dividends are taxed more heavily than long-term gains. But the
pattern of historical returns suggests that such a strategy may be
counterproductive in the long run, the Bernstein report says.
</P>

   ``High-dividend stocks have returned so much more than
low-dividend stocks before taxes that the lesser taxability hasn't
made up for it,'' the report said. Between 1967 and 1997, on an
initial $1 million portfolio, the 167 highest-yielding stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index would have grown to $18.2 million
after taxes, compared with $9.6 million for the 167 lowest
yielders, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   - Use options to avoid risk. Hanging on to stocks for the long
haul makes sense from a tax standpoint but subjects you to the
danger of falling prices. One way to get around this is to retain
your shares and buy put options to minimize your downside exposure.
Put options become more valuable if the underlying stock drops in
price. They thus represent a form of insurance against market
setbacks, although their use should be rationed because of the
costs involved.
</P>
<P>
   - Lean to tax-deferred accounts. In addition to workplace 401(k)
plans for which you might be eligible, you also can open some type
of individual retirement account. With traditional IRAs, you can
deduct the amount you invest, provided you meet the income limits.
Your money in a traditional IRA grows tax-free until withdrawn _
presumably after age 59{ to avoid a 10 percent tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   With new Roth IRAs, you don't get a deduction but you do receive
completely tax-free growth assuming you hold the account at least
five years and past age 59{.
</P>
<P>
   - Consider tax-free bonds. Municipal bonds and bond mutual funds
pay interest that's tax-free, although any profits resulting from
bond-price movements would be subject to capital gains taxes. Muni
bonds do pay lower nominal yields than government and corporate
bonds, which means their tax advantage might not be compelling
unless you're at least in the 28 percent federal tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   One additional pointer involving taxes is that you need to
accept responsibility for your own decisions. If you're like many
people, you probably maintain investment accounts at various places
_ perhaps at both a full-service and a discount brokerage. As a
result, none of your advisers may understand your entire tax
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be hard for advisers to see how the various parts of
your portfolio fit together,'' Scarbrough said. ``Consequently,
they alone may not be able to help you become more tax
efficient.'' &QL;

WORLD CULTURES, STORIES PRESENTED FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New books about other cultures and collections of stories from
around the world will expand the horizons of older children. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; IN SEARCH OF THE SPIRIT: THE LIVING NATIONAL TREASURES OF JAPAN &QL; 
 &UR; Sheila Hamanaka and Ayano Ohmi (Morrow Junior Books, $16)
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese kimono is a work of art that takes eight weeks to
design and paint. Basket weaving is another painstaking craft,
particularly ``tabaneami,'' a technique in which a basket is made
from a single length of bamboo. ``Bunraku'' puppet masters train
from childhood to perfect their art; operating one puppet requires
three people.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of World War II, the Japanese decided to
preserve their cultural history through a program that awards
grants to special masters who train apprentices. This book, with
fascinating photographs and illustrations, features six of these
artists. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THUNDER BEAR AND KO: THE BUFFALO NATION AND NAMBE PUEBLO &QL; 
 &UR; Susan Hazen-Hammond (Dutton, $16.99)
</P>
<P>
   Thunder Bear Yates, an 8-year-old Pueblo Indian who lives in New
Mexico, helps his father care for the buffalo. His ancestors have
long depended on buffalo, both as a food source and as a spiritual
brother. Thunder Bear and his people take measures to ensure the
buffalo's survival from hunters who shoot for sport.
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully photographed book captures life on Nambe
Pueblo. Pictures contrast traditional costumes and dances with
modern images such as a 2,500-pound buffalo nuzzling the hood of a
bright red sports car. Hazen-Hammond lives in Sante Fe. The author
of seven adult books makes her debut as a children's writer. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ASK THE BONES: SCARY STORIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Arielle North Olson and Howard Schwartz; illustrated by
David Linn
 &UR; (Viking, $15.99)
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the family ever went near the attic.'' Thus begins
``The Bridal Gown,'' a tale from Germany about an upstairs demoness
who loved silken gowns. The collection of 22 ghost stories from 14
countries has something for everyone who loves to get scared.
Perfect for sleepovers! &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE OXFORD TREASURY OF WORLD STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Harrison and Christopher Stuart-Clark (Oxford University
Press, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This brightly illustrated anthology contains 23 tales from
around the globe. Anansi, a Caribbean spider, begins by spinning a
tale about bananas and tricking his friend. Other unusual plots
center on the barber's wife from India, Robin Hood, the frog
princess and a thief from Egypt. Folklore devotees will appreciate
rarely heard stories, as well as familiar plot lines with new
twists. &QL;

   MILLENNIUM ROME: On a sunny morning, the distinctive dome of St.
Peter's Basilica casts a shadow that dominates the landscape below.
The shadowy shape adds symbolism to the scene. This modern city
_where motorscooterists regard red lights as suggestions, cellular
telephones ring continually and tourists line up outside Gucci and
Prada _ is defined by Catholicism. To celebrate Easter, the holiest
day of their year, tens of thousands of Christians are here to
gather outside St. Peter's, the home church of a billion Catholics.
With the year 2000 only months away, the festivities are a

SHORT STORIES DELIVER HAIR-RAISING HORROR

WEREWOLVES IN THEIR YOUTH: STORIES 
Michael Chabon (Random House, $22.95) 
 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Michael Chabon's ``Werewolves in Their Youth'' sounds like a
batch of horror stories, that's because it is.
</P>
<P>
   But not of the lycanthropic variety.
</P>
<P>
   No, these stories deal with human horror, the horror of everyday
people mired in often unfathomably dire circumstances. (One story
does deal with supernatural horror, but more on that in a minute.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Son of the Wolfman,'' the most ambitious and grueling of
the nine stories, a woman is impregnated by a serial rapist. Chabon
explores the changes the pregnancy and its circumstances have on
Cara, the woman, as well as her foundering marriage. Her decision
to keep the baby estranges her even further from her husband,
Richie _ they haven't been able to conceive despite years of
trying. Yet through the help of a colorful midwife, they arrive at
the beginning, maybe, of a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so lucky. In the title story, Timothy Stokes is a
troubled schoolboy who sometimes pretends to be a werewolf. That
wouldn't be so alarming if he hadn't pursued realism to the point
of biting a little girl on the neck. Another strike and he is bound
for ``the fabulous corridors of the Special School.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is told through the eyes of Paul Kovel, a neighbor
with troubles of his own. Paul's classmates describe him in a song:
``What's that smell-o? Paul Kovel-o / He's a big fat hippo Jell-O /
He's a snoop / He smells like poop / He smells like tomato beef /
Alphabet soup.''
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, his parents are divorcing. His attempts to salvage
his parents' marriage and his adventures with Timothy are told in
the straightforward, innocent voice of a clever child, often
hilarious, often heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Chabon switches voices and styles with ease. In ``That Was Me,''
he captures perfectly the desperation and pathetic air of an
off-season beach bar:
</P>
<P>
   ``The local drunks _ there must have been about sixty-five or
seventy of them, many related by blood or sexual history _ were a
close-knit population, involved in an ongoing collective
enterprise: the building, over several generations, of a basilica
of failure, on whose crowded friezes they figured in vivid
depictions of bankruptcy, drug rehabilitation, softball and arrest.
There was no role in this communal endeavor for the summer
islander, on leave, as it were, from work on the cathedral of his
or her own bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final story, ``In the Black Mill,'' Chabon adopts the
voice of an entirely different writer _ ``August Van Zorn,'' the
pseudonym of a tangential character in Chabon's excellent novel,
``Wonder Boys.'' In the previous book, Van Zorn was described as a
horror writer who wrote at night, ``a Hudson Bay blanket draped
across his lap and a bottle of bourbon on the table before him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a flat-out horror story, the tale of a mysterious
Pennsylvania town and the mill that seems to claim the life, or at
least limbs, of every male resident. An outsider pokes around too
much, suspicions are gruesomely proven true and . . . it's perfect.
Chabon expertly adopts the tone of a bourbon-soaked hack, yet still
manages to raise the hairs on the back of your neck with the story.
Just because you can see what's coming from a long way off doesn't
make it any less enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   And stay away from the locally brewed beer.
</P>
<P>
   Chabon is a comfortable writer, obviously at ease in any number
of settings. ````Werewolves in Their Yout''h'' allows him the
chance to show off that talent, without ever giving the impression
that he's trying to. &QL;

CAREER SURVEY PUTS DISHWASHER OVER THE PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's better to be an actuary than an actor. It's
better to be a statistician than a surgeon. It's better to be a
janitor than a professional basketball player. And it's better to
be a dishwasher than president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the conclusions reached in the ``Jobs Rated
Almanac,'' a new book by Les Krantz that illustrates how you can
use statistics to prove anything _ or absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The almanac takes 250 jobs and ranks them in each of six major
categories: environment, income, outlook, physical demands,
security and stress. A job's rankings in each of those categories
are then added up to see where it lands overall.
</P>
<P>
   Web site manager finishes in first place, followed, in order, by
actuary, computer systems analyst, software engineer and
mathematician. Finishing last is an oil field laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz bases many of his ratings on numbers compiled by the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics and private research organizations, and
the job-by-job profiles for the six categories give job seekers and
potential career changers a good flavor of each job.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers shorter lists of jobs that have particular
attributes, like tight deadlines, long hours or limited physical
activity.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall rankings are one instance when the whole is less
than the sum of its parts. Each of the six categories is given
equal weight, which explains why a cashier can be ranked 87th while
a National Basketball Association player ends up 205th _ even
though the typical NBA player earns more in a year than a cashier
would in a century.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Krantz explained that most of the jobs on the
list earn middle-class wages, so he felt there was no need to give
income more emphasis than the other five criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people won't look at all the aspects of the job,'' he
said, adding that job hunters almost always look at the potential
salary while they overlook other items. Besides, he said, a high
salary doesn't ensure financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see an awful lot of people who were in professional
athletics who end up in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   What the list does emphasize are jobs with low unemployment that
are expected to be in demand through at least 2005 _ those factors
are counted in both the outlook and security criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing even more favor are jobs that involve limited physical
activity, a component in the environment, physical demands and
stress categories.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it no wonder that the book, put out by the career
site of the Wall Street Journal's on-line edition, gives its
highest ranking to jobs involving technology or number crunching.
</P>
<P>
   Stress, physical demands and competition are seen as negatives,
even though many workers find them healthy in moderate doses.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a mythical job that paid minimum wage for staring at
a brick wall eight hours a day, for example, it would probably rank
better than at least half the 250 jobs in the almanac. It would
score extremely well in stress and physical demands, and at least
reasonably in environment and security.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes such useful information as typical hours
worked, potential for promotion and salary growth, degree of
competition, time pressure, travel and perks. The physical demands
section considers such things as long hours and potential hazards,
plus the time spent lifting, crawling, climbing and crouching.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether RSI was included in that section, Krantz said
he didn't know what RSI was. When told it was repetitive stress
injury (also known as repetitive strain injury), a frequent
disability among people who use computers for long hours, he said
it would fit in somewhere among the more than 20 components that
make up the stress rating in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Some other jobs and their rankings: statistician, considered to
have the best work environment, 32nd overall; musical instrument
repairer, 78th; surgeon, 135th; janitor, 154th; teacher, 164th;
mayor, 188th; dishwasher, 213th; actor, 218th; president of the
United States, 229th.
</P>
<P>
   Krantz said his figures do not directly consider the prestige of
a job, but in some cases jobs with higher salaries have more
prestige. But the salary of the presidency, for example, was more
than outweighed by the job's low scores in the five other
categories, including last place finishes in environment, outlook
and stress.
</P>
<P>
   He said his favorite part of the book is the one on workplace
environment, which lists about how many hours a person has to work
and offers about 200 words describing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about what people do all day _ what they have to put up
with,'' Krantz said.

WHEN POLITICAL SATIRE BITES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I've received a number of phone calls from
readers curious or furious about a column I ran not long ago
concerning Hillary Rodham Clinton's possible bid for the U.S.
Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   In that column, I recounted a telephone conversation between
Mrs. Clinton and an unnamed, upstate New York Democratic Party boss
she'd supposedly called to explore her possible candidacy. In that
conversation, Mrs. Clinton expressed surprise that Manhattan was an
island and that not all the land west of the Hudson River was New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Callers wanted to know if that conversation really took place. A
few called to express to their outraged suspicions that I'd
concocted the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is that the conversation I described
never really happened. That column was satire. That's a literary
form described by the ``Random House Dictionary of the English
Language'' as ``caricature'' or ``parody'' involving the use of
``irony'' or ``sarcasm'' pointing up ``human folly'' or ``vice.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I made it up. The point was simply that Hillary
Clinton, whatever her other virtues, is not an expert on New York.
</P>
<P>
   Writing satire is always risky, I suppose. Most people will get
it; some most assuredly will not. Whenever I've used it, I've
unfailingly received a certain number of angry or mystified phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the Monica Lewinsky story broke 15 months ago,
my column the next day dealt with a 1963 visit by a teen-aged Bill
Clinton to the White House. Clinton actually did go there as a kid,
as part of a Boys State delegation. The kids got to meet President
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The column dealt with a newly discovered _ and totally fictional
_ tape of a conversation in the Rose Garden between Kennedy and
Clinton. In it, I reported, Clinton confided his desire to become
president some day. Kennedy replied that it was a great way to meet
chicks. The phone just rang off the hook on that one.
</P>
<P>
   I did another one involving New York Gov. George Pataki's habit
of taking off from work. Every other day, the Associated Press
reports, ``Gov. George Pataki has no public schedule today.'' I
dealt with this by reporting a fictional conversation with my wife
in which she asked me my plans for the day, and I responded that I
had no public schedule.
</P>
<P>
   I'm really sorry if some people don't get it, but satire is a
time-honored journalistic form. Nobody does it better than Art
Buchwald. I vividly recall a Buchwald column of decades ago on
Bobby Kennedy's decision to run for the Senate from New York,
although Kennedy was really from Massachusetts. In that column,
Kennedy was wandering around Manhattan trying to find New York
Common.
</P>
<P>
   Buchwald's best satirical column ever was a piece on Richard
Nixon's failed effort to nominate a U.S. Supreme Court justice
whose primary qualification would be Southern roots. Nixon failed
in the Senate Judiciary Committee with two nominees _ one who was a
dope and the other who had ethical problems. But, Buchwald reported
one day, Nixon finally had found the perfect guy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert E. Lee Beauregard of
Mississippi, Buchwald wrote, was a legal genius and a man of
unchallenged, unimpeachable integrity. He had only one potential
problem with confirmation, Buchwald confided to his readers. Judge
Beauregard still owned slaves.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that some people took it seriously.
</P>

TEXAS RANCH OFFERS A TASTE OF THE EXOTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN HOME, Texas _ A gray day in spring turns a lot brighter
when you get up close with a giraffe, feed a fallow deer and make
friends with an ornery ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chill wind on an overcast Saturday morning in South
Texas during the 45-minute drive from Kerrville to Mountain Home,
home of the Y.O. Ranch. The kids were getting antsy in the back of
the van as we turned into the gates of the Y.O. off state Highway
41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's keep our eyes peeled for animals,'' was barely out of my
mouth when we saw the first of many white-tailed deer.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, everyone sees deer in the Hill Country of Texas, but we
would be seeing some pretty exotic animals before the day was over
_ and getting a lot closer than the passenger seat of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   The Y.O. Ranch has been a working ranch since 1880, when Capt.
Charles Armand Schreiner, a former Texas Ranger and native of
Alsace-Lorraine, bought the Taylor-Clements Ranch. The story behind
the Y.O. brand is rather vague; some say that Schreiner had bought
up so many cattle branded with Y.O. that he kept the brand and the
name for the ranch, figuring it was a hard brand for rustlers to
tamper with.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiner introduced longhorns to the ranch, a breed that
continues today. This is home to Bevo, the mascot of the University
of Texas _ at least the retired one. The Y.O. breeds and lends a
longhorn to the university every few years, and that's not much of
a sacrifice since the Y.O. has about 2,600 longhorns and 2,000
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Schreiner family, headed by Charles III (Charlie 3, they
call him), still operates the ranch. Each son of 73-year-old
Charlie 3 has a role in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Y.O. has had day tours every day (closed Christmas Day) for
about 20 years. All tours are by reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Schreiner introduced longhorns to the ranch. This is
Bevo's home, at least the retired one. The Y.O. breeds and lends a
longhorn to the University of Texas in Austin every few years. The
Y.O. has about 2,600 longhorns out of 4,600 head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't cattle or even longhorns that we had come to see _
there was a kid in the backseat with a hankering to meet a giraffe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Y.O. is known for the some 7,000 exotics,
representing 53 species, that can be found among the 40,000-acre
ranch. This is a breeding and hunting ranch. Animals are auctioned
to buyers, including zoos, while 20,000 acres are set aside for
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the chuckwagon _ really a cookhouse for ranch hands and
guests _ we met driver/guide Jim Hanks and six other visitors for
the morning tour.
</P>
<P>
   As the old school bus pulled out, Hanks filled us in on the
schedule. We would be driving around two pastures for about two
hours, and we could get out of the bus occasionally to take
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get too far away from the bus and if I ask you to load _
load damn fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the first stop Hanks discovered his nemesis, an ostrich who
stood guard at the gate. We all tumbled out of the bus for a closer
look and Hanks offered the critter some corn.
</P>
<P>
   We had to try another gate, but once inside the pasture it was
like a mini African safari. Over at the water hole were a couple of
Gray's Zebra (which Hanks told us sell for about $6,000 each), some
waterbuck, emu and wildebeest (watch out for the droppings).
</P>
<P>
   Emu were abundant, which made us wonder: Has the Y.O. taken in
any emu abandoned by Texas speculators trying to sell the meat of
the Australian birds? ``We have over 100 (emus) that the banks have
given us,'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   But here came the ostrich again, so back in the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the hill stood a giraffe and we wanted a closer look.
Approaching a giraffe stealthily is the key. The adults go first,
balancing the corn on their heads while the kids hang back. Hanks
called this big fellow ``Papa'' and explained that the pregnant
female giraffe died in an accident in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the next pasture, we found an abundance of exotics: graceful
Dama gazelle that followed the bus; a rare Eld's deer from
Cambodia; a funny little addax, a type of antelope, from the
Sahara; an eland, the largest breed of antelope; and herds of
fallow deer.
</P>
<P>
   The fallow deer swarmed the children, one group eager for a feed
cube, the other for a chance to touch this gentle deer.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the bus doors swung open, the addax poked his head in
for a treat. Casey, 6, ran to the front of the bus to dish out some
corn. The addax had only one remaining horn and a top knot of hair
that looked like a bad toupee.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks warned the children to be careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not mean, he just found out if he knocks you down he gets
the whole can of corn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the chuckwagon, we lined up for a hearty lunch of
chicken-fried steak, gravy, potatoes, salad, pinto beans and peach
cobbler. Lunch is part of the tour package.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we moseyed over to the lodge, checked out the pool
and posed for pictures in the giant rocking chair left over from
the annual Y.O. Ranch party.
</P>
<P>
   What a day. We saw longhorns and buffalo, emu and eland. The
only cowboy around was behind the wheel, driving a Longhorn brand
bus full of camera-toting tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Yippee-i-o Y.O.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Y.O. Ranch is located at Mountain Home, bounded by
Interstate 10, U.S. 83 and Texas 41. The ranch is open for tours
daily _ except Christmas Day. Tour meal packages start at $25.95,
half-price for children younger than 12.
</P>
<P>
   Photo safaris, kids summer camp, overnight packages and
horseback riding are also available. Call 800-967-2624 or
830-640-3222 for reservations; on the Web at www.yoranch.com.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Y.O. Ranch Texas Longhorn Trail Drive is May 28-30.
Participants sleep under the stars, round up cattle, attend a
costume dance and ride the range.

READ ALL ABOUT NEW WRINKLES IN AGING
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for BOOK-REVIEW-OLD.) 
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New England Centenarian Study conducted at Harvard
University Medical School revealed some pretty staggering facts
about America's ``oldest old'': For example, there are more than
50,000 centenarians in the United States today, almost three times
the number recorded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Geriatrician Thomas Perls, director of the study, has teamed up
with neuropsychologist Margery Hutter Silver and health journalist
John Lauerman to produce ``Living to 100: Lessons in Living to Your
Maximum Potential at Any Age'' (Basic Books/Perseus, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Profiles of centenarians (some with photos that demonstrate a
youthfulness inspiring to readers of any age), information blocks
and quizzes, including a Life Expectancy Calculator, will give you
an idea of your chances of being among the 75 million people alive
today who can anticipate ninth and tenth decades _ and good health
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather learn about healthy aging from a celebrity than
from a doctor, comedian Joan Rivers has lent her signature ``Can we
talk?'' style to ``Don't Count the Candles _ Just Keep the Fire
Lit! Staying Young at Any Age'' (HarperCollins, $25). As you'd
expect, Rivers sneers at those Pollyannas who insist we're not
getting older, we're getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' she asks. ``Is that a medical diagnosis? Then you
had better get a second opinion because I can't find my glasses to
read how good I've become.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers reminds us that we can fight aging every step of the way,
working on the things we can change and laughing about those we
can't. In the ``Good Things That Happened to You Today'' category,
she counts the day a success if you can say 1) you woke up; 2) you
woke up without pain; 3) you remembered you woke up without pain.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, of course, that Rivers has more resources at
her disposal than some of us: Her book is dedicated ``To all the
innovative plastic surgeons of tomorrow: Hurry!!''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the professionals: Preventive gerontologist Michael
Roizen believes that only 30 percent of aging is genetic; the rest
is determined by environmental factors and our own behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?''
(Cliff Street Books/HarperCollins, $25), he takes the reader
through 44 steps that he presents as scientifically sound and that
can make you look, feel and live ``up to 26 years younger'' (an odd
number, but few of us past the half-century mark would turn down
the chance to be a quarter of a century younger).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a ``RealAge Test,'' then advice and tips for
choosing the life-enhancing behaviors he reveals. The good doctor
considers health like money: ``It has an exchange value. Health
decisions and behavioral choices you make today are capital toward
living younger tomorrow.''

SURGEONS USE RADIO WAVES TO ATTACK TUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In the first operation of its kind, surgeons here
have used a heating technique similar to the way a microwave oven
cooks food to try to kill a malignant, pancreatic tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe the procedure, performed Friday at the Wilford
Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio,
could lead to a change in the way tumors are attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Watkins used radio frequencies to try to stop the
growth of cancerous cells in a 73-year-old patient's pancreas. The
patient, an Air Force retiree, was in serious but stable condition
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The process, called radio-frequency ablation, involves heating
diseased cells with a fine electrode. The high-frequency current
causes molecules to vibrate, heating the tissue from within just as
a microwave oven heats food.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has been used before to fight tumors of the liver,
but Friday's operation was believed to be the first use on a
patient with pancreatic cancer, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent here was to give some chance of cure,'' he said.
``The problem has been that the tumors cannot be removed because of
their proximity to blood vessels. With radio-frequency ablation,
heat is used to destroy tumor cells.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be several weeks before doctors can judge the outcome of
the operation, Watkins said. Still, surgeons noted, no apparent
traces of tumor cells were left after the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   During the surgery, Watkins used ultrasound imaging to help
guide an electrode probe inserted in the tumor. Ten wires fanned
out at the tip of the probe, resembling an umbrella without the
cover, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   An alternating current flowed through the wires and into the
tumor, using heat to coagulate tissue by stopping blood flow to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Destroyed cells are later reabsorbed by the body over a period
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The tumor operated upon Friday was very large _ about 3 inches
by 3 inches, Watkins said. But it was ideal for radio-frequency
ablation because it was in the body of the pancreas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most pancreatic tumors are found near the small intestine,
making it more difficult to target without doing damage to the
walls of the small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   The patient also was an ideal candidate for the surgery because
his cancer, uncharacteristically, had not spread from the pancreas.
By the time of diagnosis, cancer of the pancreas often has spread,
usually first to nearby lymph nodes and then to the liver.
</P>
<P>
   The pancreas supplies the intestines with enzyme-rich juices
that help digest food. It also secretes insulin and other hormones
that control the amount of sugar in the blood.

TV INTERVIEWS ON KOSOVO MISS THE CONTEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although it is staple fare on most TV news
shows, the person-on-the-street interview has never looked so silly
as during this NATO bombing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The passionately opinionated folk tend toward one of two
answers: either ``I think it's terrible that we're killing those
people,'' or ``We should have gone in there a long time ago and
taken that guy out.''
</P>
<P>
   The most honest interviewees tend to look like the proverbial
deer caught in headlights. After struggling to say something
meaningful, they admit, ``I really don't know enough about the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On National Public Radio, two journalists from the former
Yugoslavia were interviewed for a news feature. Both complained
that, until the bombing began, most Americans didn't know where
Kosovo was, let alone what is at issue there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all that is being done is war reporting,'' said one.
``That is reporting behavior on the ground, not circumstances,
history or possible solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   A European friend of mine who was on a business trip last week
to the United States echoed the journalists' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get back home (to France) where there is real
news. Everything on the TV here is about bombs being dropped,'' he
said. ``It all looks very serious and intelligent, but it's about
NATO missiles and the response of Milosevic. There's no context.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, a woman who left Yugoslavia before it started to
break apart and has lived in the U.S. for many years, confided:
``I've been getting all my news from the BBC. American news is
useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest it sound as though I'm blaming television, I'm not. Not
totally anyway. Last week, former U.S. Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a
respected foreign policy expert who served on the House
International Relations Committee, criticized President Clinton for
his ``reluctance to explain U.S. foreign policy'' in the Balkans to
Americans until we were well into shelling the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the American people are not engaged on any real level
in this,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's foot-dragging aside, our disengagement is
typical. Despite our high literacy rate and our many fine public
institutions of higher learning, Americans go into a kind of idiot
mode when it comes to the realities of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Although we generally are an inventive and hard-working people,
we become lazy boys and girls when the subject is something beyond
our vast borders. If we cannot understand ``the situation'' in
Kosovo or Burma or East Timor in, say, three minutes, we get
irritated or bored and give up.
</P>
<P>
   If we just left it at that _ stayed in our isolated cocoon and
contented ourselves with our World Series and our Super Bowls _ it
might be unattractive, but it wouldn't be shameful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, guess who always seems to lead the military charge for
NATO or the United Nations? Who is always coming to somebody's
rescue or sticking its nose into someone else's business? Who,
whether we like it or not, has indeed become the police force of
the world?
</P>
<P>
   The United States. Where millions of people still consider it a
badge of honor to speak only English. The United States. Where
millions of public school students can't tell you what countries
border Spain or which hemisphere holds Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   The United States. Where ``details at 11'' is often an oxymoron.

 &HT;    Wedding plans prompt some soul-searching
 &HT;    Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ For over 40 years, I've been working on an
advanced degree in curmudgeonry. Although not a new field, it is
rather an obscure one, requiring far more scholarly dedication than
throw-away subjects like biophysics and brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just as I was about to be ushered into the hallowed
halls of the truly cantankerous, the unthinkable happens. My son
Kristofor brings home his lovely Amy and tells me they're getting
married.
</P>
<P>
   My reaction is like that of any devoted mother. I hug Kristofor,
check Amy's teeth, and give the union my blessing. Then I ask when
they're going to elope. The children eye one another briefly as my
son breaks the news. Sorry, Mom, no elopement. We're planning a
garden wedding with guests, crying mothers, and a
</P>
<P>
   string quartet. The whole meatball.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment our history, Kristofor's and mine, flashes before
me like a drowning person. Specters of overflowing diaper pails,
emergency rooms, and spit-up carrots, loom larger than life. The
countless boo boos I had kissed, and two years of driving
kindergarten carpool with a gaggle of four- and five-year-olds
pouring Orange Crush in each other's hair, swims before my
</P>
<P>
   eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I even recall the time he invited me up to his treehouse to
discuss the meaning of life. My words were less than profound, but
adequate, I thought. ``You grow up, go to college, work at
something you love doing, meet the lady of your dreams, and
elope.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatant brainwashing, I admit, but it was for his own
</P>
<P>
   good _ and mine _ because for decades now, I have politely
refused invitations to weddings, christenings, graduations, bar
mitzvahs, circumcisions, and showers of all kinds (tedious
gatherings where a bunch of women get together to see how many
words they can make out of ``can opener'' before anybody's allowed
to order a drink). In time, true friends came to understand my odd
ways. ``Oh, that's just Elizabeth,'' I've heard them explain to the
uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   So much for unrepentant churlishness. I'm going to have to get
over it, for the time being anyway, and behave myself. I have vowed
to brush up on small talk, practice agreeing with everything, and
to follow the advice of a couple of my friends who've already been
where I'm heading. ``Wear beige and smile _
</P>
<P>
   with your mouth CLOSED.''
</P>
<P>
   And buy a new dress.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another problem. There are three things I
absolutely do NOT do. I do not wash cars, mow lawns, or shop. So
far, it's worked out to my satisfaction. I've jobbed out the car
washing and lawn mowing, and simply stayed out of stores. But now I
need a dress.
</P>
<P>
   I started thumbing through catalogues but soon realized that
while L.L.Bean is great, I can't wear a sleeping bag to a garden
wedding. Not even with kid gloves.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, I walked up to the drug store and picked up a
fashion magazine _ I didn't buy it, mind you, I just picked it up
and looked at it. Inside the cover is a two-page layout for a well
known peddler of the ultimate in chic. Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is of a young guy wearing a wet T-shirt with a
drooping pocket and a stretched-out neck. His shirttail half-hangs
out of a pair of oversize cargo pants (the ones with a pocket on
each leg big enough to garage a Moped), and he is pouting like
someone has just swiped his half-full bottle of muscatel. Over it
all, he wears a trench coat that even Columbo would have
</P>
<P>
   turned down. If I hadn't recognized the designer's name, I would
have sworn it was an ad warning derelicts to repent.
</P>
<P>
   Two pages back, a pre-pubescent waif wearing only what appears
to be a babushka with spaghetti straps stares at me over circles
under her eyes so dark they can mean only one thing _ she's either
just out of, or on her way into, rehab.
</P>
<P>
   I dropped the magazine back on the rack, went home and called my
high-school-and-forever friend, Jeanne. She's married off two sons,
gracefully, so if anybody can pull me through this, she can.
</P>
<P>
   We're going shopping.

ONE LANCOME FACE RISES ABOVE THEM ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Isabella Rossellini was ``The Face'' of Lancome
until she had the bad manners to turn 42.
</P>
<P>
   Then the French company replaced her with four different models,
including actress Juliette Binoche, as the face of Poeme perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, one face seems to get more face time on the page than
the other four _ Ines Sastre.
</P>
<P>
   With a visage like a kitty-cat, Sastre is a young (25), Spanish-
born actress who photographs like a chameleon, depending upon what
look Lancome makeup artist Fred Ferrugia wants to give her.
</P>
<P>
   She was the butterfly woman for Les Chrysalides; the Kabuki
bunny for the Rouge collection; and now, with the cotton candy
spring collection, Candide, she is all innocence and trembling
lips.
</P>
<P>
   Sastre also has the third-most recognized mole in the beauty biz
_ behind Cindy Crawford and Madonna. ``They used to take it out,''
she laughed one day last week. Fresh off the plane from London,
Sastre was in San Francisco for a Lancome promotion and to open the
Macy's ``Colors of Provence'' Easter flower show. Her outfit was a
mixture of European ready-to-wear _ Chloe skirt, Mulligan camisole,
Voyage cardigan and Ungaro flats; her face, with her wide, dark
chocolate eyes, etched brows and generous mouth, was completely
free of makeup.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Valladolid in Castile and grew up in Madrid, but
left for France when she was 17. Being The Face is nothing new for
her. In 1992, she was the face of the Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A film actress since she was 13 (her first was ``El Dorado'' for
Carlos Saura), she flies to Argentina for three months to star in
``Un Amor de Borges.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way anyone would ever mistake Sastre's sultry looks
for Rossellini's, but comparisons are inevitable. ``One of the
reasons I wanted to represent Lancome was because I adored
Isabella,'' Sastre said diplomatically. ``I had a clear idea when I
was a teen-ager that she was my favorite. It's always difficult in
a sense _ you're not the other face. You still need a little bit of
time for people to get used to you.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they manage to recognize her in her many guises.
</P>
<P>
   To help you out: Watch for Ines's distinctive looks in ads for
Tresor, Vitabolic, Hydra Zen, the color campaigns and the sun
products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with last year's transformer line, Les Crysalides,
which Nordstrom had exclusively, Lancome started a growing trend in
cosmetic marketing _ confining specific products to specific
stores. The latest is the reissue of the 1967 fragrance, Climat, an
unusual blend of woody, floral-aldehyde with a musky, sandalwood
base in green juice. Find it only at Saks Fifth Avenue.

 Wachowskis' goal: Make high-tech action film 
a quantum leap above the dumbed-down genre !dlim!!by1! By Bob
Strauss  
!by2!Daily News Film Writer!dlim!
<TEXT>
<P>
   !text!In many ways, ``The Matrix'' represents the next step in
high-tech action moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   And, if its target audience of sensation-seeking young males can
follow its convoluted plot, the film also might represent a new
leap of intelligence for the notoriously dumbed-down genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``IQ? What IQ?'' jokes Larry Wachowski, who, with younger
brother Andy conceived, wrote and directed the complicated
cyberpunk allegory. ``Yeah, we were tired of dumb movies, that was
sort of our starting point. We like action movies, like seeing kung
fu, we like all sorts of genre films. We just want them to be
smarter, to have some social or political relevance, to be about
something more than just having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensibility would be nice, too. ``The Matrix'' is designed
to throw anyone who doesn't pay close attention, thereby calling
into question both the movie's fictional reality and, at least
metaphorically, a viewer's own.
</P>
<P>
   Set in ... well, it looks like a contemporary city (Sydney,
Australia, where the film reportedly was shot for a bargain $60
million, to be exact). Keanu Reeves plays a cog in a giant info-biz
corporation who moonlights as Neo, a super-hacker who pirates and
illegally distributes software programs. After coming in contact
with a cyber-terrorist dubbed Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Neo
discovers that the world he thinks he lives in is a
computer-generated illusion where only a handful of people can
distinguish between true human consciousness and virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   It gets infinitely more complicated from there, with enough
monster machines, automatic ordnance and Hong Kong-style martial
arts acrobatics to keep a dozen movies from ever getting dull. But
there are also reams of references to Judeo-Christian as well as
Zen philosophy, mythic archetypes and quantum physics, among other
popular escapist topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to be quoted as saying that,'' producer Joel
Silver, the man behind such blockbuster blast franchises as
``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Die Hard,'' says when asked if he's made a
philosophical action-adventure. ``But I think it has that working
for it. I think `The Matrix' helps redefine the genre with
innovative storytelling and really unique action elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's full of some of the most explosive action I've ever been
involved with in my life,'' Silver adds producerishly. ``I mean
big, exciting stuff. If people can't find their way through the
story's different layers of reality, there are other things that
they can enjoy in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's all there.''
</P>
<P>
   All and more. Reeves ticks off what he thinks ``The Matrix'' is
about. ``Love. Evolution. Anime. Classic myth structure.
Questioning _ knowledge, authority, systems, order.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruises?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, no bruises,'' Reeves says, despite the fact that he
endured four months of intensive martial arts training before
shooting even started, in order to convincingly perform ``The
Matrix's'' balletic, wire-assisted, gravity-defying fight stunts.
``It starts with my character asking, `What is the Matrix?' and
from there you're asking, `What is reality? What is around me?' The
film also introduces themes of choice and what happens when you
make choices. You can either learn about reality in answer to your
question or you can go on living in ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing, of course, you survive at all. Reeves claims to have
come through the Kung Fu and wire-work training intensive, which
was presided over by master Hong Kong fight coordinator Yuen Wo
Ping (``Once Upon a Time in China,'' Jackie Chan's ``Drunken
Master''), unscathed. But his co-stars Laurence Fishburne (``What's
Love Got to Do With It?''), Carrie-Anne Moss (TV's ``Dark
Justice'') and Hugo Weaving (``Proof,'' ``The Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert'') all suffered sidelining injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And even the stalwart Reeves admits that ``I couldn't walk a
couple of times. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but there were
scenes where I had to carry about 50 pounds of weapons. Standing
around waiting for them to set up these special-effects sequences _
bullet hits, etc. _ the legs just gave out. Also, some of the
triple kicks in the dojo sequences caused a lot of wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love that. I love that intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Intense to the point where Neo has to be fast enough to catch
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Or slow enough.
</P>
<P>
   We'll try to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The Wachowskis wanted to film some of ``The Matrix's''
firefights in extreme slow-motion, but with the same kind of
unhindered camera movement available at regular speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action in slow-motion is more beautiful, it becomes more
graphic and is just more interesting to look at,'' says Larry
Wachowski, 33, the more talkative of the brothers. ``We began with
this idea that we wanted to move the camera at regular speed while
we shot slow-motion, which is basically impossible. Our first
thought was to build this giant rocket-camera, put it inside a
special crash box and move it at, like, 250 miles an hour. It was
going to come screeching right up to the actor, but the lawyers
didn't like the idea of putting Keanu Reeves in the path of
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ```Are you crazy?' I think was their response.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wachowskis met John Gaeta, who directs visual effects
for a Northern California outfit called Manex. He helped develop a
system that involved a series of up to 100 still cameras, set up
along the path of a particular pre-filmed and -scanned action, that
would snap single frame shots of the live actors and moving objects
as they went along. The resulting photos then were scanned into a
computer, which then virtually generated the missing movements
between each shot to create a smooth visual flow.
</P>
<P>
   That footage then could be run at any speed, slower or faster,
that the filmmakers desired. The brothers dubbed the whole process
bullet-time photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what they do with traditional, hand-drawn cel
animation,'' producer Silver explains. ``The high-end animator will
lay out the shot of, say, a character reaching for a drink, and
then draw the shot of the glass. But they had people called
in-betweeners who would do all those other shots to get that
movement. In this case, the boys had the computer do the
in-betweening. I guess that's logical, but no one ever thought of
it before. Of course, there was no way to do that before the
digitization of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullet time photography is only the most innovative of an
arsenal of CG and morphing techniques ``The Matrix'' employs. But
as Reeves notes, the actual, physical production was often as
mind-boggling as the post-production effects technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sirens going off. Waiting four hours with Carrie-Anne standing
there in her wires, making sounds,'' the actor recalls of one
elaborate scene he just had to watch being filmed. ``She's got one
shot to do, with eight guys controlling wires, that she's been
training four months for. She has to run up against a wall while 55
explosive squibs _ that are the biggest squibs allowable by law for
an actor to be around _ and do a side cartwheel flip, 360-degree
turn, four cameras going ... You're just like, `Awesome. Glad to be
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   It does sound exciting. But what does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about systems,'' Andy Wachowski, 31, and bigger than his
older brother, allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just computers; it's about anything you allow to
think for you, systems of thought,'' adds Larry Wachowski, who with
his brother wrote comic books and directed the lesbian noir
thriller ``Bound'' before plunging into ``The Matrix.'' ``If you
accept a political or religious system of thought without
questioning it, you are basically living in a stasis of
consciousness. You are not attempting to evolve your
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Glad they cleared that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a redefinition of the action drama in many ways,''
Silver translates. ``Look, we made `Die Hard' for the young male,
18-to-35-year-old demographic back in '88; that's the audience we
were hoping to excite and bring into the theater. Now it's 11 years
later, and I hope the same audience responds to this in the same
way that they responded to that.''!end! &QL;

we shot slow-motion, which is basically impossible. Our first
thought was to build this giant rocket-camera, put it inside a
special crash box and move it at, like, 250 miles an hour. It was
going to come screeching right up to the actor, but the lawyers
didn't like the idea of putting Keanu Reeves in the path of
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ```Are you crazy?' I think was their response.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Wachowskis met John Gaeta, who directs visual effects
for a Northern California outfit called Manex. He helped develop a
system that involved a series of up to 100 still cameras, set up
along the path of a particular pre-filmed and -scanned action, that
would snap single frame shots of the live actors and moving objects
as they went along. The resulting photos then were scanned into a
computer, which then virtually generated the missing movements
between each shot to create a smooth visual flow.
</P>
<P>
   That footage then could be run at any speed, slower or faster,
that the filmmakers desired. The brothers dubbed the whole process
bullet-time photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what they do with traditional, hand-drawn cel
animation,'' producer Silver explains. ``The high-end animator will
lay out the shot of, say, a character reaching for a drink, and
then draw the shot of the glass. But they had people called
in-betweeners who would do all those other shots to get that
movement. In this case, the boys had the computer do the
in-betweening. I guess that's logical, but no one ever thought of
it before. Of course, there was no way to do that before the
digitization of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullet time photography is only the most innovative of an
arsenal of CG and morphing techniques ``The Matrix'' employs. But
as Reeves notes, the actual, physical production was often as
mind-boggling as the post-production effects technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sirens going off. Waiting four hours with Carrie-Anne standing
there in her wires, making sounds,'' the actor recalls of one
elaborate scene he just had to watch being filmed. ``She's got one
shot to do, with eight guys controlling wires, that she's been
training four months for. She has to run up against a wall while 55
explosive squibs _ that are the biggest squibs allowable by law for
an actor to be around _ and do a side cartwheel flip, 360-degree
turn, four cameras going ... You're just like, `Awesome. Glad to be
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   It does sound exciting. But what does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about systems,'' Andy Wachowski, 31, and bigger than his
older brother, allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just computers; it's about anything you allow to
think for you, systems of thought,'' adds Larry Wachowski, who with
his brother wrote comic books and directed the lesbian noir
thriller ``Bound'' before plunging into ``The Matrix.'' ``If you
accept a political or religious system of thought without
questioning it, you are basically living in a stasis of
consciousness. You are not attempting to evolve your
consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Glad they cleared that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a redefinition of the action drama in many ways,''
Silver translates. ``Look, we made `Die Hard' for the young male,
18-to-35-year-old demographic back in '88; that's the audience we
were hoping to excite and bring into the theater. Now it's 11 years
later, and I hope the same audience responds to this in the same
way that they responded to that.''

SHAKESPEARE FOR TEENS _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 1/2 STARS 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The teen film ``10 Things I Hate About You'' has a
great title and a terrific soundtrack, featuring a mix of new songs
and 1980s ``oldies.'' Unfortunately, the title and the music are
the two best things about this movie from Disney's Touchstone
Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based loosely _ very loosely _ on Shakespeare's
``The Taming of the Shrew.'' High school senior Kat Stratford
(Shakespeare in-joke), played by Julia Stiles, is an angry young
woman with a sharp tongue and no apparent interest in boys. Her
younger sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), by contrast, is sweet and
popular. Both attend the fictional Padua High School (ha-ha,
another Shakespeare reference).
</P>
<P>
   Since the two girls live in an idyllic Pacific Northwest coastal
town, are financially well-off and have perfect skin, what's the
problem? Here it is: Their overprotective physician father,
amusingly played by Larry Miller, tells Bianca that she can date
when her sister starts dating. He figures Kat will never date.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca desperately wants to go out with Joey Donner, a gorgeous
but heartless male model played by Andrew Keegan. Donner and
Cameron James, another would-be suitor of Bianca's played by ``3rd
Rock From the Sun'' actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, both persuade a
bad-boy student named _ get it? _ Patrick Verona (played by Heath
Ledger) to ask Kat out on a date.
</P>
<P>
   Ledger starred in the recent TV miniseries ``Roar,'' and looks
like he walked off the cover of a romance novel. The equally
striking Kat, of course, resists his advances. The two finally hit
it off, until Kat discovers Patrick originally asked her out as
part of a bribe. ``You're  &UR; !ital! &LR; so &UR; !end! &LR;  not the person I
thought you were,'' storms Kat in an adolescent huff.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, both Kat and Bianca learn a lesson. Kat learns to
loosen up and love someone, while boy-crazy Bianca learns the
subtle art of kicking a boy in the groin.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's tamer than many of recent R-rated teen films, the
characters in ``10 Things'' live in a world filled with sex, drugs
and alcohol. The filmmakers may see as mitigating factors the facts
that Kat ends up stressing to her younger sister the importance of
waiting for ``the right guy,'' and that one of the male characters
keeps condoms on his shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still difficult for those of us over this movie's
target age to see the humor in, for instance, Kat flashing her
breasts at a middle-age teacher to distract him. It's also a little
shocking to see well-known brand names such as Budweiser and
Heineken prominently displayed on the cans being stacked up at a
party by underage drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad all these pretty, appealing young actors weren't cast in
a smarter, funnier movie _ something like 1995's ``Clueless,''
which was based on Jane Austen's ``Emma.'' It's possible to do this
sort of film well, but ``10 Things'' misfires.

RENEGADE REPUBLICANS BACK GAY RIGHTS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seven Republican lawmakers who switched their
vote and came out in favor of a gay rights bill will have some
explaining to do to the state's Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party officials reacted with suspicion and disdain
Monday after realizing that a bill banning discrimination based on
sexual preference had picked up several supporters in the New York
Assembly _ including seven Republicans who had opposed the measure
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the seven are from Nassau County, where there may be
hell to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it cost them? That will be up to their county leader,''
said state Conservative Chairman Michael Long, adding that the
detractors could face a primary challenge if they seek re-election
next year.
</P>
<P>
   That could hinge on Jack O'Leary, the chairman of the Nassau
County Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack's a tough character and I'm sure he won't make life easy
for them,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he would ``have to have a talk with them...There'll
be a little bit of explaining to be done, let's put it that way
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven straight years, the Democratic-controlled Assembly has
passed a bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual
orientation in the areas of employment, housing, public
accommodation and credit. Ten states, including most states in the
Northeast, have such a law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the measure was approved by the Assembly, although it
is doomed to again fail in the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the margin in the Assembly was far wider than
ever before _ 105 to 43 _ and the ranks of supporters included
seven Republicans who had previously voted against it: Frances T.
Sullivan, of Fulton, H. Robert Nortz, of Watertown, Harold C. Brown
Jr. of Onondaga County, and four Assembly representatives from
Nassau County _ Thomas Alfano, Maureen O'Connell, Kathleen Murray
and Donna Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cushing, chief of staff for Alfano, said the assemblyman's
decision to change his vote resulted from ``thoughtful
reflection...He felt, he really strongly felt, it was the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrara, who has opposed the homosexual rights bill six times in
the past, said the brutal murder last year of Matthew Shepard, a
gay college student in Wyoming, changed her mind once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really was the catalyst,'' Ferrara said. ``It clearly
showed that we have a class of people here who need extra
protections. That's why I changed my vote, which unfortunately is
opposed to the fundamental tenets of the Conservative Party. But I
thought it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrara said she was expecting political fallout from
Conservative forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they will not be pleased with this vote,'' Ferrara
said. ``Jack O'Leary is pretty politically savvy, and there will be
a little bit of explaining to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Foreman, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, a
gay rights group, said he was encouraged by the widespread support
the bill secured in the Assembly, and particularly from Republicans
who changed their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it took courage and strength of character on the part
of many Assembly Republicans who voted `no' in the past,'' Foreman
said. ``It is also a clear sign that they are listening to their
constituents. Every poll...has show New York residents want hate
crime legislation. It takes a really good legislator to change
their position in response to the real needs and interests of their
constituents. We hope it is a harbinger of fresh wind in Albany.''

`THE MATRIX' GREAT TO WATCH, HARD TO FOLLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The future, as seen in the brain-rattling and
ridiculous new sci-fi film ``The Matrix,'' is one scary place.
Life, unbeknownst to humans, has become a computer-generated
illusion. Machines no longer serve humanity; they rule it. And
Keanu Reeves is the Chosen One, the only hope the planet has to get
out of this pickle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's what we'd call a bleak tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The world is indeed a poorly lit place in ``The Matrix,'' a
dark, fast-paced, groundbreaking action film from brother
filmmaking team of Larry and Andy Wachowski. The movie will excite
the comic-book crowd with its stunning visuals and kinetic camera
work, which give it the look of a live-action Japanese anime film.
But a complete lack of story logic, coupled with the narrative's
propensity for meandering mumbo-jumbo, make this a movie best seen
and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, a slacker computer hacker who has
always suspected that something wasn't quite right with the world.
His suspicions are confirmed when he meets a young, leather-clad
woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) on the lam from a couple of
black-suited, law-enforcement types. Trinity leads Thomas to the
mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who tells him that life
is an illusion ``pulled over your eyes to blind you from the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, things really get weird. The Wachowskis (whose
previous film, the lesbian heist picture ``Bound,'' certainly
didn't prepare us for this) have pioneered some remarkable
filmmaking techniques in this movie, giving the movie's action
sequences a distinct, fresh and fantastic look that audiences have
never before seen. These boys truly have redefined the action
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Example: The Wachowskis employ a technique called ``bullet-time
photography'' that allows them complete flexibility in controlling
the speed and movement of what's happening on the screen. Thus, in
a head-spinning martial-arts sequence between Reeves and Fishburne,
the fighters can accelerate to the apex of their leaps, hover in
midair, then kick _ rapidly and repeatedly _ and settle softly on
the ground. (Think kung-fu Fred Astaire and you'll get a glimmer of
what the scene looks like.)
</P>
<P>
   The results are eye-popping. But the Wachowskis, who wrote and
directed the film, seem unfamiliar with the maxim that a little
goes a long way. By the end of this overlong movie, the brothers
have staged a few too many loud, bullet-intensive showdowns.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse is that the world of ``The Matrix'' has no logic,
no rules. Even on the rare occasion when someone in the film
(usually Fishburne's Morpheus) says this is the way things are, you
can bet that 15 minutes later the ridiculous plot will dictate
otherwise. As for the theme of questioning reality and not letting
any system think for you, we think that's a good idea, too. We
certainly found ourselves questioning a few things here.
</P>
<P>
   The actors perform their stunts capably. Fishburne epitomizes
cool, while Reeves says ``Whoooa!'' with a conviction that no other
star in Hollywood can match.
</P>
<P>
   After watching about an hour or so of the movie's muddled
mayhem, you are completely inclined to wave the white flag, turn
off your brain and just go along for the ride. And it is a pretty
good head trip. If the Wachowskis had just devoted as much time and
energy to the logic of their universe as they did to its look,
``The Matrix'' would add up to something unequivocally worth the
price of the ticket. &UR;

TEXAS LEGISLATURE SHOULD DRAW THE LINE ON THE SIDE OF PUBLIC
SAFETY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A minister I knew a long time ago in my youth used to
make a homespun analogy about personal freedom vs. public
responsibility that went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   You have the right to swing your fist, as long as it doesn't
encounter the tip of my nose.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that sounds corny _ and it probably does _ then you
likely have little stomach for legislative debate, an art form
often punctuated with misplaced cliches and stale corn pone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Legislature's most difficult tasks is balancing the
rights of individuals with the welfare of society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues, of course, are no-brainers. It was easy for
legislators to outlaw crimes like murder, theft, robbery and
assault. The only challenge there is deciding from one legislative
session to the next how tough the punishment should be, a task most
lawmakers readily welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of harmful, anti-social behavior are not as easy to
address, sometimes because influential interests have money at
stake, sometimes because sanctions strike too close to home, and
sometimes because people fear that government is getting too
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   An issue that remains controversial is drunken driving, despite
successes in recent years by such groups as Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, or MADD, to toughen anti-DWI laws.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the focus now is on prevention, which is a key purpose
of a pending bill to lower the legal intoxication limit for drivers
from .10 percent to .08 percent blood alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   That bill, which already has been approved by the Senate, is
likely to become law this session, partly because it is backed by
Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, partly because Texas
could gain millions of dollars in additional federal highway
funding if it is passed, and partly because many legislators
believe it is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   The only organized opposition to surface so far has been from
the restaurant industry, whose members stand to lose money if the
proposed law, as expected, encourages responsible drivers to order
fewer drinks with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But I received a letter the other day from a reader who objects
to the bill and to a recent column I wrote endorsing it. He
believes government would be going too far in trying to regulate
personal behavior, just to please people like the ``righteous MADD
zealots.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, the reader said he had a friend who has
driven more than 1.5 million miles, never had a fender bender nor a
traffic citation, but has had ``three DWIs'' and now faces the
prospect of going to prison, a penalty that can be imposed after a
third conviction for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   I assume he meant no traffic citations other than the three
DWIs, which are, of course, serious breaches of the law.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt that the reader's friend has never been involved
in an accident and has never harmed anyone. But I don't doubt
either that he and the people sharing the streets and highways with
him have been extremely lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The letter suggests that the driver's ``three DWIs'' have all
been convictions. If so, that same driver probably has been
intoxicated many other times while behind the wheel and just wasn't
caught.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, he is a tragedy waiting to happen if he continues
driving. He belongs in jail, an alcohol-treatment program or both.
</P>
<P>
   The letter writer goes on to suggest that it isn't fair to send
his drunken-driving friend to prison while not coming down hard on
another potential tragedy _ a sober but distracted driver on a
mobile phone who runs a red light, plows into another car and kills
several people.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bill pending in the Texas House that would prohibit
drivers from using their hands to operate mobile phones while their
cars are moving. That bill won't pass _ and it probably shouldn't
pass _ although some drivers misuse their mobile phones to the
point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   But there already are laws on the books that can send a
negligent or reckless driver who kills someone in an auto accident
to jail, even if no alcohol was involved in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we going to draw the line?'' the letter writer
asked.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that, when it comes to drunken driving, the Legislature
will draw the line on the side of public safety.

AIR TRAVELERS UNITE FOR FAIR TREATMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reacting to increased complaints from outraged travelers,
Congress has begun hearings on an Airline Passenger Fairness Act.
Not to be outmaneuvered, the Clinton administration has proposed an
Airline Passenger Fair Treatment Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath, but, because Republicans and Democrats
alike fly the ``friendly skies,'' a small chance exists that we may
see an eventual consensus on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   One consumer advocate urges all air travelers to join the
crusade. ``It's time for us to let our elected officials and the
airlines know that we're fed up and that we're not going to take it
anymore,'' says Tom Parsons, editor of Arlington-based
Bestfares.com magazine and the online site www.bestfares.com.
</P>
<P>
   Impetus for legislation grew after some Northwest Airlines
passengers were stranded on the tarmac for up to eight hours during
an early January snowstorm in Detroit. But issues of concern are
wide-ranging and include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Compensation for passenger inconveniences and full disclosure
on why flights are canceled or delayed;
</P>
<P>
   -- Lost luggage liability;
</P>
<P>
   -- Disclosure of frequent-flyer program mileage-redemption
allotments on each flight;
</P>
<P>
   -- Fare structures, with emphasis on providing passengers more
time to pay for a ticket, or to request a refund, after making a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents has hailed legislation
introduced by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a committee member,
and a separate bill proposed by Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman
of the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials argue that new laws are unnecessary and would
result in higher ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Travel agents and airlines in disagreement. Has that ever
happened before?
</P>
<P>
   Parsons, whose Web site attracts more than 1.5 million monthly
visitors, minced no words in expressing his position during a
recent visit to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   -- On frequent flyer redemption: ``There are more ways to earn
mileage today than ever before. But when we call an airline to book
reward seats on a flight, we are told nothing is available. Then
that plane departs with empty seats. Airlines operated at a 70
percent load factor last year. What percentage of those seats were
made available for mileage redemption? They won't tell us. They're
worried that if they say 5 percent or 10 percent, a competitor will
announce that it's making 20 percent or 30 percent of its seats
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our loyal support of airlines through their frequent-flyer
programs has made them millions of dollars. They're paid by phone
companies and credit card companies and other businesses we support
as we earn frequent-flyer miles. In return, we have a right to know
how many seats are available to us.
</P>
<P>
   -- On lost luggage: ``Airlines are forcing us to check bags by
instituting stricter carry-on limitations. So if they lose those
bags, they should pay more for their negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On delays and cancellations: ``Airlines charge us $75 to redo
a ticket. So why shouldn't they have to compensate us when we're
inconvenienced? We didn't create these huge hub-and-spoke systems
that cause delays; they did. When they cancel a flight and there is
no bad weather, who is to blame? We don't make schedules that have
planes zig-zagging all over the country instead of going back and
forth on one route; they do. If there is one pimple in the sky, the
whole system goes awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're ever going to get cash from airlines (when
flights are canceled or delayed), but at the least, we should
receive vouchers for discounts on future travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons isn't relying on legislation to satisfy his No. 1
obsession: discovering air fare bargains. ``Some people collect
coins and stamps,'' he says. ``I collect deals.''
</P>
<P>
   That quest began innocently enough two decades ago when Parsons
took a sales job with Pier 1 Imports in Fort Worth, Texas. ``I was
the greenhorn of greenhorns,'' he says. ``They gave me a travel
card, and I said, `How and where do I book my tickets?' Then, as I
began traveling to 42 states and Canada, I realized that air fares
had no rhyme or reason. So I studied ways to cut corners
(irritating airlines with some of his ticketing gimmicks). I began
making fare charts. Next, I started a company newsletter that we
called Best Fares. The president gave me time to work on it because
it was saving the company so much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, an independent and greatly expanded Bestfares.com
magazine has 110,000 member-subscribers. Those who invest $59
annually learn about thousands of bargains _ some uncovered by a
staff that now totals more than 100; others negotiated exclusively
with airlines, cruise lines and hotels. (Call 800-880-1234 for
information.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site touts subscriber deals and serves as a
comprehensive free resource for other bargains, including each
airline's special weekend fares. Click on the ``News Desk'' icon to
learn about discounts for air travel, rental cars, hotels and
cruises; hundreds of items are added daily.
</P>
<P>
   What I like best about this Web site is that, even as he
recruits magazine subscribers, Parsons isn't reluctant to direct
browsers to rival companies or individual airline Web sites and
toll-free numbers. ``We're trying to serve as a clearinghouse for
travel bargains,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy bargain-hunter, Parsons says, keeps an open mind,
studies fare trends and comparison-shops. Those slow to embrace the
Internet, he says, ``probably have an Uncle Leo in Cheyenne, Wyo.,
who can do the online research.'' He recommends purchasing tickets
from a travel agent but says, ``You can't expect the travel agent
to do all the work for you. Finding the best deals requires some
`smarts.'''
</P>
<P>
   After all, who wants to pay a fortune to wait on the tarmac for
eight hours?

RELIEF WORKERS READY TO RETURN TO KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC DRUDIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Exasperated relief workers, locked out of
Yugoslavia as NATO continues its air raids on the nation's military
forces, are taking early steps to help refugees from Kosovo when
calm is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go back to Kosovo and help everyone trapped in
the region,'' said Angela Mason of the World Vision relief
organization. ``We intend to go back as soon as possible. This is a
huge humanitarian tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, relief workers have intensified efforts in
southeast Europe as refugees from Kosovo flood shelters in Albania
and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   World Vision, the largest privately funded children's agency in
the world, has had to suspend operations because of the NATO
bombings. Kevin Cook, director of the agency's work in Kosovo,
reported that violence had engulfed Kosovo's capital of Pristina
since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched air raids
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real needs are with at least 300,000 people inside Kosovo,
and there is no way for foreign aid to reach them now,'' said Cook,
who has been based in Macedonia since the bombing campaign began.
``Under current conditions, relief agencies can't deliver aid.
Without that assistance _ and a peaceful resolution to the crisis _
there will be tremendous loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO alliance launched the air raids on March 24 after
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia defied efforts to forge
a peace deal with the largely Albanian population of Kosovo. Kosovo
is a province of Serbia, the dominant state in Yugoslavia. Some 2
million people live in Kosovo, regarded by Milosevic as the cradle
of Serbian nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Although few independent monitors remain in Kosovo, the ethnic
Albanians appear to be fleeing their homeland in the face of
intensifying attacks by Milosevic's police and paramilitary units.
But some evidently are escaping the NATO air attacks on Yugoslav
army installations and ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy,'' Mason said. ``We have been forced to
withdraw our supplies when we are most needed and we fully intend
to return as soon as it is over.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO asked all 30 relief organizations based in Kosovo to leave
in advance of the air raids, or they were expelled by Serbian
officials before the bombing started.
</P>
<P>
   CARE International has relocated its Kosovo relief operations to
Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They evacuated (Kosovo) last week because the situation became
more difficult and the threats of bombing and violence became too
dangerous,'' CARE representative Claudia Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE has intensified operations in Macedonia and expects to
establish a presence in Albania soon.
</P>
<P>
   OxFam America spokesman Seth Amgotg said his organization left
Kosovo once it was apparent relief workers were in ``imminent
danger.''

PITY THE `POOR' EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today we take up the collection plate for a few poor souls who
are down on their luck. They're all good, hard-working men, honest
and God-fearing to a fault. They deserve every penny they earn.
But, of late, fortune has turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Our hearts go out to them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that just last year they were able to look their fellow
man in the eye and revel in the joy of arrogance. Now they shrink
at the thought of bumping into those whose lives have more richly
rewarded them in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the least we can do to take up the collection plate in a
selfless effort to restore the lifestyle to which they are so
accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is the St. Johns Episcopal Church in Charleston,
W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   We'll circulate among the tables of the soup kitchen with our
palms out for donations from the bedraggled crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these kind spirits can part with a nickel or a dime
to help lift up a fellow man, even though, as Wanda Long, assistant
director of the soup kitchen, explained to The New York Times: ``We
usually give them a small can of food or a sandwich or a container
with leftovers. Otherwise, they wouldn't have any supper.''
</P>
<P>
   Our plate jingling with a few shiny coins, we'll make our way to
North Korea. In the barren rice fields of this sad country _ where
by some estimates famine has killed 2 million people since mid-1990
_ we'll step over the dead and dying, the emaciated and immobile
from hunger, until we find someone who can still lift an arm to
drop a coin into our plate.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll race home to present our donations to our downcast
souls.
</P>
<P>
   First is Eckhard Pfeiffer, the chief executive of Compaq
Computer Corp. Mr. Pfeiffer's grin is a little frayed these days
because, instead of receiving $46.3 million, as he did in 1997, he
had his salary slashed to a poverty-stricken $23.3 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's $23.3 million for running a company whose operating
profit plunged 71 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Our soup kitchen diners and starving North Koreans did God's
work in lending him a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Any man who makes $23 million less in one year than he did the
previous year certainly needs a handout. There are many reasons,
not necessarily clear to us all, why a single individual needs more
money than a small country.
</P>
<P>
   Next are David Komansky, chairman and chief executive of Merrill
Lynch, and Hugh McColl Jr., chairman and chief executive of
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   We wish were able to fully restore Mr. Komansky's pay of $11.1
million in 1997, but we were only able to add a little stack of
coins to his $9.9 million of last year. If we were able to ease his
suffering at all, we're pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McColl, painfully, had his bonus cut 29 percent last year to
$2.5 million. A bonus of just $2.5 million for leading his company
to a 21 percent decline in profit.
</P>
<P>
   What pains these panhandlers most of all is seeing their
friends' compensation tumble but still exceed their own by envious
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to overlook Sanford Weill, co-chairman of
Citigroup. His total pay slumped 24 percent last year _ but he
still trotted home with $166.9 million. Now there's something to
burst a few blood vessels in any down-at-the heels executive.

CENTRALIZATION VS. PLURALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I confess that I have always liked and admired George Bush. He
occupied the White House at an extraordinary time. The Cold War was
ending. The Soviet Union was coming apart. China flirted with
democracy. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in a bold attempt to seize
the ``the oil weapon'' _ and Bush firmly repudiated him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was defeated for reelection by the right wing of the
Republican Party because he trimmed the deficit on the eve of the
Gulf War. Even in defeat, therefore, he had laid the early
groundwork for the current 10-year boom. I believe his
administration was the most undervalued since Gerald Ford took over
from Richard Nixon in 1974 and restored the nation's trust in
central government.
</P>
<P>
   So when the bombs started falling on Belgrade last week, I took
a look back to see what the Bush administration had thought and
done about Yugoslavia. I took down my copy of ``A World
Transformed,'' the graceful colloquy with Brent Scowcroft that Bush
and his national security adviser published last year. I turned to
the index.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia, 43, 514, 516, 541.''
</P>
<P>
   The first entry in the 590-page book is a description of a
meeting in the Oval Office in March 1989, not long after Bush took
office. Present were Vice President Dan Quayle; Secretary of State
James Baker; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; Scowcroft and his
deputy, Lawrence Eagleburger; CIA director Robert Gates; and chief
of staff John Sununu. The topic: a speculative memo on Gorbachev by
Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scowcroft, Rice had raised an intriguing
possibility: ``that we might have leverage over Moscow because of
its need for Western economic resources and know-how.'' The
Russians were looking for ideas to rebuild their failing system at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion in the meeting also noted: ``Although in Western
Europe the notion of nationalist conflict was passe, it was too
soon to tell whether political evolution in Eastern Europe had
moved at an equal pace in places like Yugoslavia, Hungary, or
Roumania, where there were long-standing ethnic tensions and
separatist pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in March 1989, Slobodan Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Three eventful years passed. The entries on pages 514 and 516
come as Bush and Scowcroft report the chilly reception to a speech
in August 1991. Bush was about to visit Babi Yar, where 33,000
Ukrainians, Jews, and others had been shot to death by Nazis in 36
hours during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans will not support those who seek independence in
order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism. They
will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon
ethnic hatred,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Critics dubbed the remarks Bush's ``chicken Kiev'' speech,
charging that it was a plea to keep the Soviet Union together. Two
weeks later, a coup in Moscow attempted Gorbachev's dismissal. Its
failure eroded the authority of the Communist party, and
accelerated the rise of the republics.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later occurs the last reference to Yugoslavia in ``A
World Transformed.'' During an Oval Office meeting, Baker says:
``The peaceful breakup of the Soviet Union. We don't want another
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   That summer of 1991, the Yugoslav navy was shelling the coastal
resort of Dubrovnik, as Milosevic began his war on the Croats. A
European Community delegation, led by Lord Carrington, failed to
make him stop. The horrors of ``ethic cleansing'' were yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Origins of a Catastrophe'' by Warren Zimmerman,
Bush's last ambassador to the federal republic, the administration
did little to prevent the breakup of Yugoslavia. Baker, for
example, spent exactly one night in Belgrade trying to prevent the
secession of Slovenia and Croatia. Laura Silber argued in the
Financial Times the other day that a simple show of force by NATO
in 1991 could have deterred Milosevic. But then there are those
four passing entries in ``A World Transformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it's just possible that Bush bet wrong _ not only
on Yugoslavia but on Russia and Gorbachev. After all, he was as
greatly constrained by his right wing in foreign affairs as in
domestic matters. Dismantling governments was all the rage in those
days.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight? Of course. What better way is there to learn?

BIG WINNERS AS DOW TOPS 10,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What to make of Dow 10,000? Think of it as a monument
to the stock market's fabulous gains in what will be remembered as
one of America's most prosperous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, some of them have been achieved close to home.
Dozens of Massachusetts companies have created enormous wealth for
their shareholders during the Nifty Nineties. The repeated lesson
contained on that local list of winners: innovation and execution.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. of Hopkinton was a runaway winner in a Boston Capital
survey of local stocks that were publicly traded at the start of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the data storage company gained an amazing 47,692
percent during that period. Adjusted for splits, EMC stock that was
worth 129 5/8 Monday began the 1990s trading at 27 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc., the office supply retailer based in Westborough,
was second on the Massachusetts list with a gain of 3,022 percent
through the decade to date. Parametric Technology Corp. of Waltham
was third, advancing 2,235 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one way to put those very best stock gains in proportion:
the Dow advanced during the same period from 2753 to Monday's
closing value of 10,006.78. That's an admirable gain of about 263
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The top 20 performing stocks in Massachusetts of the 1990s make
up a list that's heavy on technology, with a sprinkling of retail,
banking and money management. All but one of them, each with a
value of at least $250 million, beat the performance of the Dow
itself.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat to our list: companies that first went public in the
1990s are not included. One notable absentee, Internet investing
comany CMGI Inc. of Andover, has risen from a split-adjusted price
of about 63 cents per share in 1994 to 186 9/16 Monday, a 296-fold
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The advance of EMC shares turned an obscure technology company
into the second most valuable public company in Massachusetts. EMC,
now worth more than $65 billion, trails only Gillette Co.'s market
valuation of $70.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   EMC began to show up on computer screens at big money management
firms like Putnam Investments because it consistently outpaced
expectations and showed consistent promise for the future. Putnam
continued to buy EMC stock and owned 16.5 million shares by the end
of 1998, making it one of the company's largest institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``EMC has run up against the likes of IBM and Storage
Technology, some pretty substantial companies with a lot of
resources and brainpower,'' said David Santos, a Putnam portfolio
manager who works with the firm's group that buys and sells large
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've succeeded because they were so focused on their market
and developed unique advantgage in that niche. The niche turned out
to be a pretty substantial part of the technology market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is what transformed data storage from a small
corner of the technology world into an important specialty. The
Internet required hardware to store large amounts of information
and EMC cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, institutional investors that did not want to buy the
latest Internet stock rocket bought companies like EMC, Lucent
Technologies and others that were building the Internet's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comparable chain of innovations in paper clips this
decade. But Staples survived and prospered on execution, outlasting
all but two of what was once a field 28 companies that tried to
make a buck the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always flawless,'' said John Ballen, president of
MFS Investment Management, which has been a large investor in
office superstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock was flat at times, often for a period of a year or
two. But they perservered, mostly through internal growth, and
dominate the marketplace. It's a matter of execution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The value of execution can be found elsewhere on our top 20
list, from fellow retailer TJX Cos., to other companies like State
Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But few companies on our list can match Gillette when it comes
to turning consistent business performance into huge stock market
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, one of the few top 20 stocks that started the 1990s as
a big company, has appreciated by 936 percent through the decade so
far. Only BankBoston Corp. (ranked 19th) would have been considered
one of the state's largest companies in 1990 and its gains are
helped by depressed bank stock values at the start of the decade
and the modest acquisition premium of its intended acquisition by
Fleet Financial Group.

MEN, WOMEN, AND VACATIONS

   Men and women definitely are not the same. We noticed that years
ago, but the latest proof comes in a survey of Caribbean activities
from Aruba Sonesta Reports. Here are the results:
</P>
<P>
   -- Men spend 20 percent (14 hours) of their time on the island
beach, while women spend 25 percent (18 hours).
</P>
<P>
   -- Although the Caribbean's waters are warm and inviting,
surprisingly little time is spent in them. Men spend only an
average of 3 percent of their vacation time submerged, while women
spend 6 percent. The water time for women is believed to be higher
because they tend to be watching the youngsters, who, the survey
says, spend an amazing 84 percent of their waking hours in the
ocean or a pool.
</P>
<P>
   -- Men snooze slightly more than women _ 10 percent of their
time (seven hours) vs. 8 percent (5.5 hours). (Instead of snoozing,
they should be helping their wives watch the kids in the water!)
</P>
<P>
   -- When it comes to shopping time, women lead with 8 percent
compared with 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The resort report is based on a six-night vacation with two days
of travel time and five vacation days and assumes one full day of
sightseeing.

   Martinique's French accent: The romance of France extends to its
sunny Caribbean ``Departement'' of Martinique. An ocean may
separate this island from its mother country, but nonetheless
you'll find gendarmes directing traffic on streets with names like
rue Victor Hugo and rue de la Liberte. Martinique, in fact, is
enjoying a tourist vogue, with its 86 hotels; its French-Creole
cooking where seafood is king; its pleasant and popular ``Empress
Josephine'' golf course; its shopping, which can include savings on
perfume, spice, and everything nice; and its walking, hiking,
cycling, and nature areas, including the Valley of the Butterflies.

CHEVRON SEEKS TO REDUCE GASOLINE ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Chevron Corp. plans to eliminate MTBE, a
gasoline additive that has turned up in drinking water, from its
California gas supply within two years of receiving federal
approval to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron has heard the concerns Californians have voiced about
MTBE in gasoline,'' Chevron Chairman Ken Derr said in announcing
the move Monday. ``While we believe that MTBE poses no significant
health risk, we also believe that it does pose an environmental
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's announcement came four days after Gov. Gray Davis
ordered the removal of MTBE from the state's gasoline supply by
2003 _ contingent on a change or waiver in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has sponsored a bill that would
amend the Clean Air Act to do away with the requirement to add MTBE
to the nation's gas supply. There is no estimate on how long it
will take for the federal policy on MTBE to change.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fracisco-based oil and gas company said that
immediately upon gaining federal approval, it could cut by at least
half the amount of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, it puts
into its gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE had been hailed as the star ingredient for cleaner-burning
gasoline. In 1996, the federal government required MTBE to be added
to gasoline sold in the nation's smoggiest urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chemical proved menacing when it found its way into
groundwater, lakes and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron spokesman Fred Gorrell said the company cannot
immediately eliminate all MTBE because the additive boosts octane,
which allows cars to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its plan, Chevron also recommended that all refiners
in the state cut by half the amount of MTBE they add to their
gasoline supply in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Gorrell said this recommendation should be easy to implement
since the federal Clean Air Act requires only one city in Northern
California _ Sacramento _ to sell MTBE-laced, or oxygenated, fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron also suggested that all refiners produce gasoline that
is MTBE-free within two years after the law is modified.
</P>
<P>
   Derr said the cost to eliminate MTBE would be modest, increasing
the price of a gallon of gas by perhaps 1 or 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been at odds with Chevron in the past were in
accord with the company's plans to eliminate MTBE from its
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best of all possible scenarios,'' said Krista
Clark, a spokeswoman for the Association of California Water
Agencies, a Sacramento group that represents nearly all of the
water agencies in the state. ``We can come up with a process that
meets federal (rules) and prevent backsliding on air quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over MTBE has become particularly acute in
recreational areas where there are large numbers of personal
watercraft such as Jet Skis and small boats, many of which are
powered by two-stroke engines.
</P>
<P>
   According to scientists, up to 30 percent of the fuel in the Jet
Skis' two-stroke engines is released unburned into the water.

   More and more travelers are discovering the Caribbean in summer,
with resorts costing anywhere from 20 percent to 50 percent less
than winter, or high season, rates. There is also another reason:
weather.
</P>
<P>
   On many islands, summer means a rain-free vacation. And the
weather is almost consistent, with temperatures in the 80s. Compare
that with many places where rain can wipe out a week's vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``off-season'' deals:
</P>
<P>
   At Chenay Bay Beach Resort in St. Croix, one night is free when
five nights are booked. A free car rental for three days is
included on bookings made for April 15-July 15. For information,
call 800-548-4457.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott's new Aruba Ocean Club is featuring rooms beginning at
$160 a night, April 24 through Dec.18. For information, call
800-845-5279.
</P>
<P>
   The West Indies Management Co. in Newport, R.I., is offering
low-season rates at 18 luxury properties throughout the Caribbean.
Packages are for three to seven nights and include accommodations,
airport transfers, car rentals, breakfasts, and more. For
information, call 800-932-3222.
</P>
<P>
   First-time guests will receive a $69-a-night, double occupancy
rate (a savings of more than 50 percent) at the Tamarind Reef Hotel
on St. Croix, June 1-Dec. 1. For information, call 800-619-0014.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-room upscale Spice Island Beach Resort in Grenada is
offering savings of $600-$1,300 on an eight-day, seven-night stay.
For information, call 800-223-9815.
</P>
<P>
   Families will also find activities for children. At the Westin
Resort on St. John in the US Virgin Islands, a Summer Jammers Camp
is available June 14-Aug. 13 with activities for the young set.
Children 12 and under eat free during their stay, and those under
18 stay free with their parents. The camp is an extra cost. For
information, call 800-808-5020.
</P>
<P>
   A handy guide to those planning a Caribbean vacation is the
fifth edition of the Caribbean Vacation Planner. The free 168-page
guide covers 27 destinations, has island maps, facts, figures, Web
site addresses, and general information. For a copy, call
800-356-9999, ext. 799. The guide can also be requested on the Web
at www.caribtourism.com.
</P>
<P>
   While off season offers good travel value, keep in mind that
some properties use this time for renovations. So, before you book,
make sure the facilities you desire are working or available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WORD UP!
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the writers heading? They're off to Club Med in
Cancun, Mexico. Twenty of America's top literary authors, along
with journalists from major magazines and newspapers, will join
with vacationers in exploring a series of provocative questions
from different perspectives. Among authors participating will be
Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Ford and National Book Award finalist
Jamaica Kincaid. The ``Word Up! The American Mosaic'' program will
be held April 10-17.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in Word Up! is included in the village stay. The
seven-night, all-inclusive package is $959 a person. A combination
air and land package is also available. Previous Club Med forums
have covered cinema, art, and photography. The next forum will be
in May on book publishing and will be held in Turkey; a '60s forum
is set for September in France; and the final forum for '99 will be
dedicated to magic and magicians and held in the French Alps. For
information, call Club Med at 800-CLUBMED or a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   SKI SEASON
</P>
<P>
   There's still good skiing in New England. Vermont reports more
than 90 percent of its slopes are operating, and many will continue
to operate into May. (For Vermont ski conditions, call
800-VERMONT). Among spring events are the Reggae Fest and Pond
Skimming Weekend, April 10-11, at Sugarbush (call 800-53-SUGAR), a

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
FLOWER STORE

   FISH-NY (New York) _ New Yorkers may take it for granted. But
browsing the menu at Tropika is a rare opportunity. There are conch
from Mexico, John Dory from Australia and pompano from South
America. A walk though a good fish market is no less extraordinary.
The fish _ a stunning display of glistening specimens _ come from
all over the world. There may be red snapper from New Zealand, so
bright they look as if they are illuminated, and with eyes so
alive, you think the fish may jump if you touch it. Or sardines
from Portugal stacked like silver rods. And you will almost always
find sushi-quality tuna from the Gulf of Mexico, as red as a rose
petal, shrouded in flakes of white ice. By Amanda Hesser.

   FISH-STRANGE (New York) _ It was a fine day for fish, a bad day
for humans _ cold, wet and windy. After squeaking into a parking
place near Grand Central Terminal, Patricio Osses jumped out of his
white van and flashed a triumphant smile at Julian Alonzo, the
executive chef at Cafe Centro. ``Man, I have got some ugly fish,''
he said, throwing open the back doors of the truck. He wasn't
kidding. Deep within the refrigerated gloom, his eyes made out the
horrid forms of fish that dare not speak their names, strange
creatures that haunt Chilean waters but are now, thanks to Osses,
creeping onto restaurant tables in New York. In a city full of the
remarkable and various fish of the world, the very strangest
creatures of the deep come from one purveyor. By William Grimes.

   BRING-YOUR-OWN-WINE (New York) _ The right, even the necessity,
to tote your own wine to dinner is a time-honored practice among
many smaller restaurants that are not licensed to sell wine and
beer. But the practice also occurs at fancier, more ambitious
restaurants that have invested considerable amounts of money in
building their wine lists. Restaurants do not encourage the
practice, but most allow it, especially, as I found out by
experimenting at several restaurants, if you adhere to a certain
protocol. This essentially consists of politely asking a
restaurant's permission to bring wine, and having a good reason for
wanting to do so. By Eric Asimov.

<HEADLINE>
EMPLOYERS MAKE ROOM FOR SPIRITUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the boardrooms, conference centers, and corporate offices of
America, there's a hot new player making a big splash these days _
God.
</P>
<P>
   Growing numbers of workers are organizing workplace activities _
from prayer groups to Torah studies to Buddhist meditation breaks _
embracing spiritual values as a way to find harmony at work, where
the promise of fat paychecks or big promotions still leaves many
people with an empty feeling at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are responding, as more and more companies try to
create humane, compassionate, and fulfilling work environments by
tending to their employees' souls.
</P>
<P>
   Although the size of this nascent movement is hard to gauge, its
growth is reflected, in part, in the number of conferences on
spirituality and work that have begun popping up with regularity
across the country, the most recent one in Boston earlier this
month. The gatherings draw on an expanding list of consultants,
business people, and academicians, and the consensus among those
involved is that businesses are genuinely interested in how
spirituality can improve the work culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey B. Swartz, the president and chief executive officer of
the New Hampshire-based Timberland Company, for example, makes a
direct connection between the Torah and running a multimillion
dollar company. That's a key reason why Timberland employees are so
heavily involved in community service.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing healing to the world is a fundamental requirement of
faithful Jews. Swartz not only brings his religious values to work,
but by doing so makes his employees feel they are working for a
company whose priorites go beyond the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gegax is the founder of Tires Plus in Minnesota, a Midwest
chain with more than 130 stores and 1,500 employees. Rather than
bringing specialists to talk to his workers about the latest
research on tread wear, Gegax invites such people as Deepak Chopra,
the best-selling author and spiritual leader, to talk to workers
about how they might find meaning in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a yearning for spiritual wellness in the
workplace,'' says Gegax, whose new book, ``Winning in the Game of
Life: Self-Coaching Secrets for Success,'' is scheduled to be
published this summer.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of management consultants, theologians, and
clergy argue that too many workplaces have become sterile,
dispiriting, and meaningless, leaving workers wondering: What
exactly am I doing here?
</P>
<P>
   ``If work is the creative expression of the human spirit, then
obviously it makes sense for anyone in business interested in
unleashing their creativity to raise issues of spirituality,'' said
Ellen Hayakawa, president and CEO of the Centre for Spirituality
and Sustainability in Vancouver, Canada, and a frequent lecturer on
spirituality in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The interest in spirituality and the workplace is largely a
confluence of two trends. The first is a deep spiritual yearning
that is fueling the popularity of retreats, spiritual meditation,
and books on faith. The second is a concern that technology is
``dehumanizing'' American workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is beginning to be a shift in our definition of work as
merely a place of survival, where we go to earn our bread, to much
more profound questions,'' says Martin Rutte, president of
Livelihood Inc., a management consulting firm in Santa Fe.
``There's now concern about aliveness _ work that not only feeds
your wallet, but feeds your soul. And also, somehow through our
work, there is an increasing interest in having an affect on
other's people lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the country, Rutte notes that the idea of
injecting spirituality into the workplace is not regarded as oddly
as it was when he first started broaching the subject 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to talk about spirituality in the home,'' said
Rutte, who was a speaker at a symposium on spirituality and
business recently hosted by Andover Newton Theological School in
Boston. ``We've been able to talk about it in our houses of
worship. But we have not been able to talk about it in the
workplace out of fear of what that would mean. That's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to the souls of workers, workplace specialists
say, is a natural progression in the interest many businesses have
taken in the overall well-being of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies started worrying about the mental health of
workers and how that affected performance, they set up on-site
counseling,'' noted Lake Lambert, assistant professor of religion
at Wartburg College in Waverly, Ia. ``Then when people began
drawing a connection between physical health and productivity, a
lot of companies started setting up workout rooms. Now comes
spiritual health.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, don't expect spirituality to become part of the
curriculum in business schools or land on the agenda of corporate
board meetings with any great regularity anytime soon. The idea
that spirituality and religion are intensely private affairs best
practiced within the walls of a church or synagogue or in one's
home is a conviction strongly held by many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace managers, according to specialists on spirituality and
business, are generally leery of talking about the connection
between spirituality and work, and for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid of having religion imposed on them,'' said
Krista Kurth, principal consultant for Renewal Resources, a
management consulting firm outside Washington, D.C. ``Also, there's
a sense that this is another way for organizations to control their
workers. They already use psychological exams to get at attitude
and behavior and now they want to somehow invade people's privacy
by trying to control their spiritual lives as well.''
</P>
<P>
   If a department head is enthusiastic and public about his or her
Buddhist meditation, for example, does that put subtle pressure on
subordinates to try it out?
</P>
<P>
   Yet when huge companies like Xerox, Motorola, and
Hewlett-Packard hire teachers to give workshops on meditation to
their employees, there is clearly a trend taking place in corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is the shifting nature of the nation's workplaces:
downsizing and layoffs (even in successful companies), jobs going
overseas, and technology doing work once done by people. All these
developments undermine what some consultants say was one of the
unwritten rules about working.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that if I work and the company is successful I will
always have a secure job is no longer necessarily true,'' says
Rutte. ``There's a great deal of anxiety, and if your job is no
longer an anchor, then what can replace that?''
</P>
<P>
   Another notable factor contributing to the widening interest in
spirituality and work is the enormous influence the baby boom
generation has on so many issues in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the baby boomer issues is midlife, and during midlife
it's typical for people to start wondering about things like death,
their legacy, their values, what is really imporant in their
lives,'' Kurth said.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to fuel the spiritual renaissance in the United States
is a powerful hunger for a spirituality not just relegated to
once-a-week worship in a church, synagogue, or mosque, but that is
integrated into daily life, including work life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a disconnect for many people between what they do at
home or on weekends and what they do in the office, and many people
are saying that there shouldn't be,'' says Bob Marx, associate
professor of management at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Marx and three others are writing a book tenatively titled
``Living and Leading with the Wisdom of Solomon,'' which tries to
blend Old Testament values with business principles.
</P>
<P>
   The book, scheduled for publishing next February, talks about
the faith of Job, the courage of David, the integrity and justice
of Moses, and the wisdom of Solomon, and shows how they are
practiced in the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reconcile business values with spiritual values,''
Marx said. ``The idea is that being spiritual in the workplace
doesn't mean you have to give away the store. You can use honesty,
integrity, faith, compassion, and wisdom and still be succesful.
There should be something more in the vocabulary of the business
world than profit, incentive, and performance.''

   COLORADO -- MOOD-KOSOVO. With the United States engaged in its
most perilous military operation since the Gulf War -- airstrikes
against Yugoslavia that threaten to fray ties with old Cold War
enemies -- the reaction in the Capitol of the Free World has been a
collective yawn. Unlike various other ``crises'' this decade --
such as the Gulf War or President Clinton's impeachment trial --
NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia has sparked only a muted public
reaction. The few protests that have been staged were scattered and
poorly attended, security precautions have been tightened only
slightly and people seem, for the most part, to have things other
than the Balkans on their minds. Colorado congressional aides
recall former crises in Washington. (800 words). By Charles Davant
</P>
<P>
   MAINE -- DRUG-ALLEN. Almost everybody in Washington agrees that
now is the time to fix Medicare. The government's health care plan
for the elderly has become medically outdated, and, without a huge
cash infusion from the federal government, it will go broke in less
than a decade. Everybody says the situation is dire, but nobody can
agree on a plan to solve it. Even the much-ballyhooed ``National
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare,'' created to find
a solution both the GOP-controlled Congress and the White House
could accept, broke up two weeks ago without making any formal
recommendations. Enter Tom Allen. The second-term Democratic
congressman from Portland says he has devised a plan to help the
elderly poor afford prescription drugs and, at the same time, save
the government a fortune. (800 words). By Charles Davant
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS--ISTEA--MONEY. The federal government released
more than $2.4 million to the Worcester Regional Transit Authority
to be used for the Worcester Intermodal facility. (200 Words) By
Mark D. Preston
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS--KOSOVO-TROOPS. Bay State lawmakers chip in with
their opinions about sending ground troops into Kosovo. (300 words)
By Mark D. Preston
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- WATER. States vary in their restrictions for
bottled water, with many, including Pennsylvania, stricter than the
Food and Drug Administration's regulations. Bottled water may not
be any better for you than tap water, an organization said in a
study released today. The Natural Resources Defense Council says
bottled water is not as regulated as tap water, and sometimes has
misleading labeling about the source of the product. (700 words.)

 &HT;    SEC WIDENS CAMPAIGN AGAINST 'PAY TO PLAY' PRACTICE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By DAVID McNAUGHTON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission this spring
will propose rules aimed at stopping money managers from making
political contributions to officials who could steer public pension
fund business their way.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which had been expected, was announced Tuesday by SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt at the spring meeting of the Council of
Institutional Investors, a pension fund organization.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said the trading of political contributions for
investment business, known as ``pay to play,'' is an ``insidious''
practice that ''has tainted the management of public funds.'' He
said the SEC had heard allegations that political contributions
have affected the selection of money managers for public pension
plans in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   All told, public pension funds have more than $2 trillion(cq) in
assets, Levitt noted.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would extend the SEC's campaign against ``pay to
play.'' Earlier, the agency attacked the practice in the municipal
bond business.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   Levitt repeated his position that education, not rule-making, is
the best way to protect investors caught up in online investing and
day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the kind of phenomenon that invariably arises
at times of high market activity, you may even say market
overexuberance. Because of that, the best remedy for it will be a
market remedy,'' he said. ``You cannot protect people against their
own foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitt said the SEC is ``looking very closely'' at the how day
trading is promoted, and is checking online trading firms to see if
they are following regulations on margin rules and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman said progress has been made on efforts to keep
companies from managing earnings _ reporting profits in a way that
they meet Wall Street expectations _ but added that ``we still have
a way to go.''

of cleaning the attic of his summer home in Plymouth, Mass.,
sorting through the accumulation of four generations of family
history before selling the house, a flimsy, yellowing pamphlet fell
from his father's papers to the dusty floor.
</P>
<P>
   In that serendipitous moment, Touster discovered a copy of a
1946 Haggadah, a Passover prayer book put together by Jewish
survivors of the Holocaust, published by the US Army and used at a
Seder in Munich on the first Passover after the fall of Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The American-born son of American-born parents, Touster vowed to
learn the book's story and to preserve it. On Wednesday, when the
retired college professor sits down to his Seder meal, he will use
a newly published limited edition of the survivors' Haggadah,
complete with commentary that he researched and wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Haggadah replete with Zionist yearnings and haunting
parallels between the survivors' own suffering and liberation and
the suffering and liberation of the enslaved Jews of ancient Egypt.
On its cover is the insignia of the US Third Army, the American
army of occupation. Interspersed through its pages are seven
harrowing woodcut prints depicting the life, and death, of Jews in
Hitler's Europe. In it is the lament, ``The sorrow is great and so
is the pain, such that the survivors swear . . . to go to the Holy
Land at any cost, for it is hard for them to remain in lands that
are soaked with their blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis University historian Jonathan Sarna calls the
survivors' Haggadah ``a remarkable document in terms of spiritual
history.'' David Stern, professor of Jewish literature at the
University of Pennsylvania, calls it ``an incredible testament to
Jewish creativity and Jewish persistence'' and says that ``there's
nothing quite like it in terms of a Haggadah that was produced by
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saul Touster of Boston, 73, professor emeritus of law and
social policy at Brandeis University and a World War II veteran who
served in the South Pacific, the labor of these past three years
has been ``a tremendous fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, he surmises, received the Haggadah in appreciation
of his work as president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in the
early 1950s. ``I felt that he valued this especially,'' Touster
says, ``and kept it separate from the institutional archives (of
HIAS) and somehow fate had delivered it to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of very deep strains in my life,''
Touster says after a long pause. ``The strong Jewish feelings. The
family's commitment to service for the refugees. I wanted to honor
those who survived. And what I put into it was a special feeling of
doing honor to my father.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Historical Society has printed 500 copies
selling for $360 apiece, and the Jewish Publication Society plans a
less expensive bookstore version in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   What Touster has preserved is a Haggadah composed in Hebrew and
Yiddish by Yosef Dov Sheinson, a Lithuanian Jewish teacher and
writer in modern Hebrew who survived Dachau. It is illustrated with
Sheinson's drawings and the woodcuts of Miklos Adler, a Hungarian
Jewish artist whose transport to Auschwitz was unexpectedly
diverted to Vienna. When Jewish leaders in postwar Munich showed a
copy of the Haggadah to US Army chaplain Abraham Klausner, the
rabbi arranged its publication.
</P>
<P>
   The Seders Rabbi Klausner held at the Deutsches Theatre
Restaurant on April 15-16, 1946, were ostensibly for Jews in the US
military, but most of the 200 to 300 who came to each Seder were
Holocaust survivors living in Munich. Different ones came each
night, because Klausner, who'd brokered a Passover meal of fish and
chicken, wanted to feed as many people as possible. Although
Sheinson labeled his work a supplement to the Haggadah, for these
Seders it was the only text used.
</P>
<P>
   Where the traditional Haggadah opens the Passover story with the
sentence ``We were slaves to Pharoah in Egypt,'' Sheinson uses
those words as the caption to a woodcut of Jews digging ditches in
a slave labor camp, and Rabbi Klausner, in his English
introduction, offers, ``We were slaves to Hitler in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the traditional Haggadah features four sons who ask their
father the meaning of the Passover story, the four sons in the Army
Haggadah ask about a Jewish homeland in Palestine. ``What is this
land and state that you long for?'' the wise son of 1946 asks. When
the wicked son admonishes, ``Use your strength to rebuild a
devastated Europe,'' Sheinson's narrator lashes back, ``You should
set his teeth on edge and tell him: We have already given our best
to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the traditional Haggadah features the song ``Dayenu'' _
``it would have been enough'' _ that praises God for redeeming the
Jews, Sheinson's version is a litany of Jewish affliction. ``Had
God brought us out of Egypt and not divided the sea for us, it
would have been enough,'' the traditional song begins. Sheinson's
charts a darker course. ``Had He scattered us among the nations,
but not given us the First Crusade,'' it starts, ``we would have
been content.'' Later comes this: ``Had He given us gas chambers
and crematoria, but our wives and children had not been tortured,
we would have been content.''
</P>
<P>
   That spring day in the attic the week before Passover in 1996,
all Touster knew about the pamphlet was what he read in Klausner's
English title page and introduction and the handwritten inscription
to his parents from a man named Joe Levine. Though he understands
little Hebrew and no Yiddish, he recognized the power of the
woodcuts and the pages illustrated with border drawings featuring
the smokestacks of the crematoria.
</P>
<P>
   His first instinct was to hand the project to a scholar in
Jewish studies, but friends persuaded him to undertake the pursuit
himself. Thus, he embarked on a mission he likens to detective work
in which ``my main witnesses were in Munich, Israel, Austria,
England, as well as other parts of the United States and Canada and
in which four languages are involved.'' By then too, many of
Touster's ``main witnesses'' were dead _ Sheinson, Adler, and
Levine, who worked for the American Jewish Joint Distribution
Committee in postwar Germany and whose precise connection to his
father Touster never determined.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted colleagues to translate the Hebrew and Yiddish in
the Army Haggadah. For the Yiddish he turned to Robert Szulkin, a
professor of Russian literature at Brandeis who spent part of the
war in a Soviet labor camp. He celebrated Passover 1946 in the
former Nazi barracks of a displaced persons camp near Munich, near
the restaurant where the Army Haggadah was used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shot me backwards in time,'' says Szulkin, 65. ``It was
probably the most emotional Seder that I recollect. It was at once
sad because of the horrors that preceded it. At the same time the
need to go on and rebuild lives was the theme set.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Touster's first questions was to his brother Irwin, an
artist in New York. ``Listen, do you have anything about Dad?'' He
did. After their father, Ben, died in 1979, Irwin received _ but
never looked at _ his scrapbook from HIAS. In that scrapbook, Saul
uncovered a hidden side of his father. ``That,'' he says, ``touched
me deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a 1952 report Ben Touster had written about
HIAS's post-war achievements after he toured displaced-persons
camps in Europe and after HIAS helped 167,490 Jews emigrate to
Israel, the US, and elsewhere. Touster included his father's words
in his commentary in the survivors' Haggadah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics are cold things, and one must look for the human
story behind each figure,'' Ben Touster wrote. ``Each figure stands
for the transplantation of a human soul, a Jewish soul, from
wretchedness and terror to a good land and a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I discovered in that quotation,'' the son says, ``a kind of
sensitivity and reflectiveness that was not apparent. My father's
character was that of a very efficient, businesslike man,
practical, almost cold in manner. Here I discovered the inner
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He made other discoveries, too. The woodcuts in the Haggadah
bear the Hebrew name ``Ben Benyamin.'' A hunch by a researcher at
Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial museum, led Touster to a
British art dealer who recognized the prints as Adler's work.
Touster traveled to England, where he saw Adler's series of 16
prints and met his sister. He met a survivor, John Najmann of
London, who'd attended Rabbi Klausner's Seder in 1946. A week after
giving Touster an unpublished translation of the Army Haggadah,
Najmann suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   Touster found one other survivor who'd attended Klausner's
Seder. Solly Ganor, now a 70-year-old writer living in Israel,
survived Dachau and the ``death march'' from the camp as Allied
forces approached in the spring of 1945. He'd learned English in
the Kovno ghetto from the British wife of a Lithuanian Jew, and in
1946, at 17, he was working as an interpreter for the US Army. He
remembers how driven Sheinson had been to complete his Haggadah.
Ganor and his father and stepmother were planning to go to Canada,
but, at this Seder in Munich, Ganor decided to go instead to
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each Jew has to consider himself as if he left Egypt himself,
and I was thinking about our death march. I was thinking how much
more terrible was our exodus than the one from Egypt,'' Ganor says.
``What I read in the Haggadah crystallized it for me. Unless we
have our own country we can't defend ourselves. We would always be
the same kind of flotsam.''
</P>
<P>
   Touster's quest also led him to Sheinson's widow, in Montreal,
and to Rabbi Klausner, who held the pulpit in Boston's Temple
Israel from 1949 to 1953 and now lives in New Mexico. In telephone
calls and letters, the 83-year-old retired clergyman re-created the
scene at that first Passover after liberation, when holding a Seder
``was just another thing on my agenda,'' along with publishing a
Yiddish newspaper and printing lists of survivors to help people
find lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was crowded. Every corner was filled,'' Klausner
recalls. ``We had a little pulpit, so to speak, in the center of
the room, and we just conducted a Seder. We had no sound system. It
was kind of a celebration, over and above being a Passover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haggadahs,'' he says, ``disappeared in the sense that
everyone clung to them in remembrance of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Touster's curiosity and diligence, the survivors'
Haggadah is getting new life. Touster likes to write poetry, but
since he began this project he has penned no verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if this is my poetry,'' he says.

LET US NOW PRAISE A FAMOUS USAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year-end note from the editor suggested that 1998 had
produced a especially bounteous crop of ``famouslys,'' not only in
our pages but in other newspapers and magazines as well. Was there
a trend underfoot, he wondered? On that very New Years Eve, a story
in the works spoke of ``Red Sox management, a group famously bad at
the business of doing business,'' and other examples could not be
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   His observation was on the money: After ambling quietly along
with the herd during the 60s and 70s, famously has charged ahead
like the bull market in the 90s. In this newspaper alone, there
were 147 citations last year, nearly six times the number logged a
decade earlier. In fact, the famously boom has already attracted
some criticism: E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post, though a
confessed user of the word, recanted in 1997, saying famously was
often a way of implying you're hip when you're merely highlighting
the obvious, a bit of rhetorical posturing. If someone or something
is already so well known for being a certain way, do we really have
to be reminded of it? he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more charitable view of famously. Anyone
addressing a heterogeneous audience _ including print and broadcast
journalists - has to allow for enormous variation in the public's
knowledge. Can we mention Cincinnati or Caracas, newspapers ask
themselves, without identifying the state or country? Will a
reference to MIT or the ICA drive newcomers nuts?
</P>
<P>
   No writer wants to be impenetrable. On the other hand, assuming
total ignorance among the readers is hardly practical, especially
in a 600-word rock review.
</P>
<P>
   Famously can help solve that problem. If you already know, for
instance, that the late Yehudi Menuhin was famously photographed in
short pants, the word signals that the writer, like you, is aware
that this is not news. But if Menuhins name means little to you,
famously tells you that for the music crowd, an image of young
Yehudi's shins is part of the violinist's legend. For many music
reviewers, trademark and patented are shortcuts to the same goal:
Scholz moved over to play his trademark manic organ riffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say famously isn't a bit overexposed these days.
When pretty much everyone knows something, the famously is
superfluous: Clinton (famously) said he smoked marijuana but didn't
inhale. On the other hand, using famously of something obscure
seems ridiculous, if not insulting: When a daily newspaper reports
that the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund I famously told the Council
of Constance in 1414, I am king of the Romans and above grammar, I
can't help wondering about that famously. Among whom, and since
when?
</P>
<P>
   These are all judgment calls, though. And they're no easier
today than in the more restrained era when the performed the work
now assigned to famously, as in the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. That
the is meant to tip you off that this isn't just any old violinist;
in fact, the late usagemeister Theodore Bernstein said Motherwell,
the painter was simply an elliptical form of Motherwell, the famous
painter. In a page devoted to the in Miss Thistlebottoms
Hobgoblins, Bernstein concluded that journalists had to figure out
on a case-by-case basis whether people ranked among the famous, the
near-famous, or the slightly known.
</P>
<P>
   Making those decisions, he said, is not the simplest job in the
world, but it is not the most difficult either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as his own examples show, fame is a fleeting thing. In
1971, when the book was published, Bernstein's top-tier guys were
Beethoven, Shakespeare, and Newton, no first names necessary; three
decades later, they're still secure. But Bernstein's semi-famous
folks _ those who rated a the _ were Glinka, the composer; Uris,
the novelist; Watson, the biochemist.
</P>
<P>
   Below them, on the rung just above obscurity, were composer Burt
Bacharach, poet John Ciardi, and physicist Hideki Yukawa. Sic
transit gloria mundi, as Thomas a Kempis famously said. Perhaps we
should be scattering those famouslys a bit more sparingly, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   60 Minutes recently revealed _ all too publicly _ that its grasp
of slang is not ready for prime time. The promo spots for a story
broadcast last Sunday intoned, ``Even though the child welfare
agency said she was guilty of murder, the jury said she wasn't.
What's that all about?'' I didn't stick around to find out, but if
the segment was about a childs death _ murder or not _ the
Seinfeldesque skepticism of ``What's that all about?'' was truly
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Has CBS got a tin ear, or what?

THE RED SOX DISCOVER GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is spring, exactly when a young man's fancy is
supposed to turn to love. So the timing is right for our eternally
young boys of baseball, the Boston Red Sox, to discover girls.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox recently announced the hiring of Micho Spring and
her firm, BSMG Worldwide, to develop a communications strategy as
plans to build a new Fenway Park move forward. The day-to-day
spokeswoman for the project will be Kathryn Murray St. John, a
former Republican activist, marketing specialist, and principal in
BSMG's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their political and professional resumes, Spring and St.
John bring something else to the table: their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, they are competent. But it is no accident that they
are also female.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting to update assorted business people, Red Sox
master consultant John Sasso actually said that the key to the
club's success in advancing a new ballpark proposal ``could be
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Be still, my heart!
</P>
<P>
   Here's the theory: Women like baseball more than other sports.
Its slow pace soothes us. It's lack of bone-crunching violence
appeals to our gentle souls.
</P>
<P>
   Like historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, we hear the roar of the
crowd and think of the sound coming out of the radio on Sunday
afternoons many summers ago, when our fathers would stop mowing the
lawn long enough to catch the score. We also revel in more recent
memories of our pint-sized children stepping up to take a whack at
a grapefruit-sized baseball, propelling it 2 feet forward and
almost certainly scoring a run _ because no one on the other team
can field it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women make up key constituencies,'' explains St. John, who
replaces Dick Bresciani as the voice of the Red Sox, at least when
it comes to ballpark development. ``They are fans, neighbors,
political leaders. They are moms taking their kids to games.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that women almost always prefer clean bathrooms
and comfortable seats to the current Fenway experience. Because of
that, the Sox presume female fans will look favorably upon the
improved amenities offered by a new ballpark, such as better
restrooms, family seating areas, and children's play sections.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that was a marketing strategy overlooked by Robert
Kraft when he was trying to promote a new stadium for the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion was framed by men, for men, and for one even
more specific male subgroup, sports talk-radio devotees. Women were
not viewed as a constituency worth courting, even women in elected
office. Former state senator Lois Pines mentioned recently how she
believed Massachusetts should try to keep the Patriots here. Asked
why she never said so during the debate to support Kraft, a
constituent, she replied: ``Because no one ever asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond hiring female consultants, it remains to be seen how far
outside the old boy network the Red Sox plan to reach.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, this is one woman who likes baseball, has warm
baseball memories as a daughter and a mother, and still believes
the Sox have plenty of questions to answer about their ownership,
direction, and long-term financial status before they win political
support for a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   For what seems like endless innings, the Sox have been slowly
winding up their pitch to replace 87-year-old Fenway Park. They
still face significant resistance from neighbors and from those who
would like to derail the project and perhaps push current Sox
ownership into selling the team sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The ballclub must find a way to deal with those special-interest
agendas _ and to satisfy the broad public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The team is owned by the Yawkey Trust and run by John
Harrington. As chief executive officer, Harrington recently
released carefully selected information on the trust that controls
the ball club and the two charitable foundations set up by the late
Tom and Jean Yawkey.
</P>
<P>
   He denied any improper use of the Red Sox trust, specifically
rebutting a report in the Boston Herald that charged he ``has
personally reaped millions of dollars from Jean Yawkey's estate and
the charitable foundations of her and her husband Tom.'' Harrington
also put out word via friendly media contacts that his salary is
only in the ``$1 million range.''
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of ballpark estimates will not fly if the Sox plan
for a new Fenway requires any public investment. The business of
baseball demands specific numbers, whether a man or a woman is
looking at the bottom line.

NEW STEPHEN KING BOOK IS A GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it
wanted. Trisha McFarland discovered this when she was nine years
old. At ten o'clock on a morning in early June she was sitting in
the back seat of her mother's Dodge Caravan, wearing her blue Red
Sox batting practice jersey (the one with 36 GORDON on the back)
and playing with Mona, her doll. At ten thirty she was lost in the
woods. By eleven she was trying not to be terrified, trying not to
let herself think, ``This is very serious, this is very serious.''
Trying not to think that sometimes when people get lost in the
woods they get seriously hurt. Sometimes they died.``
</P>
<P>
   So begins ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a gem from horror
master Stephen King (Scribner, $16.95, 219 pages). In the press
release, King says, ``It was my idea to write a kind of fairy tale,
`Hansel and Gretel,' without Hansel.'' King has succeeded beyond
his wildest expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Before her parents divorce, Trisha and her family lived in
Massachusetts. Now Trisha and her older brother Pete live in Maine
with their mother, who every Saturday takes them on some kind of
trip. This Saturday, she decides they will take a six-mile hike on
the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail. As usual,
Pete and her mom begin bickering before they even get to the
trailhead and once the hike begins, the arguments get more heated.
The bickering is driving Trisha nuts, so she decides to escape by
going off the trail. She goes down a mild slope so no one can see
her. Then ``Trisha turned back to the slope, and then turned around
as the worst idea of her life came to her. This idea was to go
forward instead of backtracking to the Kezar Notch trail.''
</P>
<P>
   She begins walking, faster and faster, trying to quell her fears
as the bugs hover and bite her everywhere. She begins calling for
help. Eventually, she takes a break and checks out what's in her
backpack _ her Gameboy, her Walkman, suntan lotion, a bottle of
water, a bottle of Surge, her blue plastic poncho, and her lunch
(hardboiled egg, tuna fish sandwich, Twinkees, celery sticks and
potato chips). After putting on some suntan lotion, she repacks her
backpack and begins walking again and calling out for help as the
tears roll. She starts picking checkerberries and eating them. In
droves, the bugs encircle her and land on her eyelids. Then the
rains come and panic sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she stops to eat the egg. Having no idea what time it
is, she turns on the Walkman and finds out it is 3:30 in the
afternoon. Then, she gets her next bad idea _ find a stream and
follow it to civilization. Eventually, she hears running water and
heads for it, then she trips and falls hard down a rock slope and
into a wasp nest.
</P>
<P>
   Now hurting and in total panic, she runs through the woods until
she finds the stream. She checks her body to see how many times she
has been bitten. Fearing the Walkman is broken, she turns it on and
hears a broadcaster say that a search has begun for Trisha. Knowing
she must conserve her batteries, she turns the Walkman off and
begins to walk again, this time following the stream.
</P>
<P>
   Near dusk, she stops and decides to listen to the Red Sox game.
In the bottom of the eighth, the Red Sox go up 5 to 4 over the
Yankees and Tricia's hero, reliever Tom Gordon, comes in to pitch
the ninth inning. Trisha tells herself, ``If we win, if Tom gets
the save, I'll be saved.'' Tom closes and Trisha goes to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   She will be alone for more than nine days _ hurt, scared, and
sure someone or something is watching her. Resourceful, she finds
nuts and berries and even water. She imagines that Tom Gordon is
with her to protect her, keep her company and ultimately teach her
how to close a game.
</P>
<P>
   King does a wonderful job of making Trisha real, her thoughts
and words those of a bright, but still 9-year-old girl. The terror
is in her mind and you feel it growing on every page. The only
glitches in this superb story are a couple of flashbacks to her
parents' reaction _ but you don't care about them, only about
Trisha.

<P>
   ``Bedford Square.'' By Anne Perry. Ballantine Books. $24.95. 330
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's 21st mystery featuring Bow Street Superintendent Thomas
Pitt and his wife, Charlotte, is a fascinating look at the social
structure of Victorian England.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning, Pitt is awakened by a patrol officer who has
found a shabbily dressed body on the steps of a house in Bedford
Square, one of London's most fashionable sections. The owner,
retired Gen. Brandon Balantyne, denies any knowledge of the victim.
Pitt doesn't believe him because a snuffbox belonging to the
general has been found in the victim's pocket. Pitt has Sgt.
Tellman begin a search to learn the identity of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charlotte visits Balantyne and learns that he is
being blackmailed, but so far the only thing the blackmailer has
asked for is the snuffbox. Soon, Pitt discovers that other men of
influence and social standing are being blackmailed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitt mysteries are always genteel reads. ``Bedford Square''
shows how important name, honor and social standing were to the
Victorians. Just one hint of scandal and a man and his family would
be shunned or driven to leave the country. This time around, it's
the down-to-earth common sense of the Pitt's maid, Gracie, that
enables Pitt to find the blackmailer.

GEORGE W. BUSH: A WRANGLE BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ George W. Bush was 15 when his parents sent him
out the door, to a world apart from his Texas home, to what he
remembers as the ``cold, dark, faraway'' confines of Phillips
Academy, the strict all-boys boarding school in this town north of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Unprepared, Bush quickly found himself at the bottom of his
class. Over the next three years, Bush, by his account, ``learned
to read and write,'' gained a measure of independence from his
well-connected family, and made friends, many of whom are now
helping his expected presidential bid. By graduation, Bush had
become a class leader and head cheerleader, and had earned the
nickname ``Boss Tweed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andover,'' the Texas governor said in his Austin office, ``was
a life-changing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Bush has sought to play down his Eastern roots and
his studies at the elite New England troika of Andover, Yale, and
the Harvard Business School. Partly, it is because Bush seems
reluctant to concede that he is anything but a Texan. And partly,
it may be because Bush has sought to avoid discussion of his early
years, a period he prefers to describe cryptically when he talks
about it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young and irresponsible,'' he has said, ``I was
young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, for example, has acknowledged being a heavy drinker, and
has declined to answer questions about whether he used marijuana or
cocaine. ``When I get asked pointed questions,'' Bush said, ``I'm
going to remind people that I made mistakes in the past, and the
question is, `Have I learned from those mistakes?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, Bush was president and legendary party boy at the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity. When he graduated in 1968, at the height
of the Vietnam War, he entered the Texas Air National Guard, a
decision that has raised questions about whether he tried to avoid
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the education and early years of George Walker Bush are
essential to understanding the apparent front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination. The teenager brought up in a
mix of Eastern formality and the Texas wildcat culture is now a
52-year-old man, just reelected in a landslide to the Governor's
Mansion, but apparently still struggling with that balance.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, Bush followed his father's footsteps time
and again, at Andover and at Yale, where, like his father, he was
tapped for Skull and Bones, the secretive club at Yale. To this
day, he seems by turns a copy and an occasional contradiction of
his father, collecting friends as quickly as he gathers autographed
baseballs, but heading toward a race for president _ a contest his
father attacked with zeal _ with insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several weeks ago, when he announced the formation of his
presidential exploratory committee, Bush dismissed suggestions that
he had emulated his father, the former president. ``I went to Sam
Houston Elementary School in Midland, Texas,'' Bush said, ``and he
went to Greenwich Country Day in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Bush had hoped his New England years would go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between my dad and how he was raised and
I was raised,'' he said in an interview. ``In Midland, they don't
ask, `What's your pedigree?' they ask, `Can you hit a baseball?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with the pedigree, however.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was born in Connecticut, where his grandfather, Prescott
Bush, had been a US senator, and his parents, George and Barbara,
were embarking on a journey that would culminate in his father's
election to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But when young George was 2 years old, his father decided to
establish a new home base and moved the family to Midland, a West
Texas town filled with oilfield wildcatters and political schemers.
Childhood friends recall going with Bush and his father on wildcat
expeditions, sleeping in a station wagon while the future president
waited for a well to spout oil.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Georgie,'' as his mother called him, had become a
teenager and the family had moved to Houston, his parents decided
he needed a proper New England education. After a year of school in
Houston, Bush was sent to Andover.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush arrived in 1961, Andover made the cover of Time
magazine, which painted a vivid portrait of the world the young
Texan was entering. The school's unofficial motto, the magazine
said, was, ``sink or swim.'' There were ``a million kids dying to
get in,'' it said, `and a boy who just mopes his way through, boy,
that's almost a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the article, the campus day began when Andover
boys, in mandatory coat and tie, attended a 7:05 a.m. breakfast, a
``generally resented'' 7:50 a.m. chapel service, and ``work, work,
work.'' The article seems dead-on accurate, for when Bush was asked
about Andover, the first things he mentioned were the coat and tie,
daily chapel, and ``hard, hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were way behind the curve and at the bottom of the class,''
said Clay Johnson, a fellow Texan who attended Andover, roomed with
Bush at Yale and is now the governor's appointments secretary.
``All of a sudden we were at the tail end.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pfeifle, a Bush classmate, remembers that ``not very many
people were happy to be there. There was a great deal of cynicism
and unfriendliness in the air, people putting people down. It was
like an old-fashioned English boy's school where you were watched
all the time and weren't having much fun overall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pfeifle, now president of the Blue Eagle Productions apparel
firm, near Dallas, recalls that many boys on campus found refuge
hanging out with Bush. ``He was a natural-born leader and a very
popular fellow,'' Pfeifle said. ``Everybody wanted to be around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   One yearbook photo shows Bush as head cheerleader, wielding a
giant megaphone and wearing a sweater with a large ``A.'' Another
photo depicts Bush among several students trying to squeeze into a
phone booth. Even now, 35 years later, former classmates recall how
Bush was ``high commissioner of stickball,'' which meant he
organized a street version of baseball and umpired the games. He
lived in America House on Main Street, where the song ``America''
(My Country 'tis of Thee) was written in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   Andover and its rigors changed his life, Bush said. ``I can
remember trying to figure out how to catch up,'' Bush said. ``The
high standards lifted me up.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Bush started at Yale, where he was selected president
at Delta Kappa Epsilon and joined the exclusive Skull and Bones
Society, whose members are drawn from the upper crust of old money
and society. Bush was a devoted member of the group, which met
twice a week, five hours at a time, discussing every imaginable
personal and social issue. One classmate recalls spending a weekend
with Bush driving through New York and New Jersey in an
unsuccessful effort to find a tattoo parlor that would apply a
Skull and Bones symbol. Bush's fraternity was also a curious clan _
making news after the school newspaper reported that DKE pledges
were being branded in a hazing rite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no scarring mark, physically or mentally,'' Bush said
at the time, defending the practice to the Yale Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Like those of many undergraduates then and now, Bush's Yale
years included bouts of serious drinking. As one Bush friend puts
it, the term ``binge drinking'' had not been invented, but Bush was
a practiced participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Yale, we all drank,'' said the Rev. Alexander ``Sandy''
Green, who went to Andover and Yale with Bush and is now rector of
Christ Episcopal Church in Denver. Asked about Bush's description
of himself as irresponsible, Green said, ``The only thing I can
imagine is that George was a member of `the Haunt Club,' which was
kind of improper and not the `Hunt Club.' Their sole purpose was to
mix a garbage can full of screwdrivers before the football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalls being a patron but not leader of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Seligson, a CBS-TV producer in New York who went to Andover
with Bush, said, ``I think George, like all of us, felt the
constraints and probably wanted to make up for lost time. College
is a time to explode.'' While Seligson never saw Bush use drugs, he
said, ``if he didn't use marijuana at that point, then he wasn't
alive.''

   PICKS UP:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When asked about this, Bush puts on a resolute face. ``I choose
not to detail the mistakes I made,'' Bush said. ``The reason why I
don't answer the question is that it is never ending.'' When it is
noted that Vice President Al Gore has acknowledged using marijuana
in the early 1970s, Bush said, ``I think most Americans in this day
and age recognize that people made mistakes. The question is, have
you learned from them?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has preached the importance of ``personal
responsibility,'' does say he stopped drinking when he was 40, and
without explanation adds that he might have been ``too tough on
myself'' in describing himself as ``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   College life also included plenty of pranks. Once, Bush and some
friends tried to tear down the goal post of an opposing football
team, which almost got Bush arrested until a friend's father told
police he would watch after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as unserious at the appropriate moments as everybody
else,'' said a fraternity brother, lawyer Franklin Levy of Boston.
``He was just a decent human being . . . He came from a background
where he could have been a snob, standoffish, exclusive everything,
but he just wasn't. He was down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Bush tell it, he was the last man with a crewcut in the
last all-male class at Yale. ``We went from short-haired people''
in the class of 1968 ``and they were long-haired people'' in the
class of 1969, Bush said. ``In '68, all of us were figuring out
what we were going to do.'' He recalls no protests against the war
at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Bush was figuring was whether to marry during his Yale
years. He announced his engagement to a Rice University student in
1967, but the couple canceled the wedding plans for reasons that
have not been publicly specified. ``They drifted apart,'' said a
Bush spokeswoman, Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first to say that he wasn't a great student or an
intellectual. But he developed a love for history, which was his
Yale major, and he made clear to friends that his goal was to go
into business.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently never envisioned getting into politics. He
``never mentioned it,'' Johnson said, a comment echoed by other
classmates interviewed for this article. ``He didn't join the Young
Republicans, he didn't attend political speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did face the prospect of involuntarily going to war. G.
Gregory Gallico, a Yale classmate and Boston physician, recalls
discussions at Skull and Bones about the overriding concern of the
day: being drafted for the Vietnam War. Bush and many other
students had educational draft deferments that would end upon
graduation from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us were apprehensive about going to Vietnam,''
Gallico said.
</P>
<P>
   This portion of the Bush story remains hard to piece together,
as the records of his local draft board no longer exist, according
to Lewis C. Brodsky, a spokesman for the Selective Service System.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, however, the draft question would be moot. On June
13, 1968, around the time of the Yale commencement, Bush joined the
Texas Air National Guard, which provided him with a deferment.
Rather than sign up with one of the active military services, Bush
walked into the Houston office of Colonel Walter Staudt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a fighter pilot,'' Bush told Staudt, again
following a course charted by his Navy pilot father, who was shot
down and rescued in the Pacific Ocean during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received one of the five or six available pilot positions.
He served six years in the National Guard, flying an F-102 fighter
jet and receiving high marks, but his unit was never called to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Walker Bush is one member of the younger generation who
doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or speed,'' said a 1970
National Guard news release quoted by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
``As far as kicks are concerned, Lieutenant Bush gets his from the
roaring afterburner of the F-102.''
</P>
<P>
   Staudt, in a telephone interview, said no one, including Bush's
father, exerted any influence to get Bush into the National Guard.
Moreover, Staudt said, it was unlikely that Bush would have gone to
Vietnam if he had signed up with the Air Force as an inexperienced
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is honest and sincere,'' Staudt said. ``He wasn't a draft
dodger.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked why he didn't join one of the active military
services, said that might not have led to combat and might have
meant he couldn't fly a fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of pilots were just cargo pilots. I was guaranteed a
slot in the Guard and guaranteed a chance to fly fighters, so I
chose the Guard. The opportunity came up and I jumped. I was the
third selected out of five or six slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Did I receive preferential treatment?'' Bush
said, referring to similar queries that were raised about his
father's running mate, Vice President Dan Quayle, who also served
in the National Guard during the Vietnam years. Bush then provided
his own answer: ``There were some pilot slots available, and I was
chosen. I sought and was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I wanted to fight, yes, and I was willing to train
for whatever experience came my way,'' he continued. ``I actually
tried, I tried for what's called a palace alert program from my
guard program to transfer on a temporary basis for assignments, and
I was too junior to get the assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two years of National Guard service, during which
Bush was remembered as a jet jock who drove a convertible and
partied hard, Bush applied to Harvard Business School, keeping the
application secret from his parents until he was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refers to his time in Cambridge as ``a vocational exercise
in capitalism'' and fondly recalls his three years there _ the
apartment in a three-story walkup near Central Square, the jogs
along the Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush walked the MBA walk, he seemed to go out of his
way to talk the Texas talk. He wore cowboy boots and often stuck
tobacco in his cheek and spit into a cup he carried to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him making a comment about how he didn't think he'd
ever see the need to wear a necktie,'' said a classmate, Mark
Hopkinson, now president of Allied Devices Corp. of New York. ``He
was a Texas boy. He was very clear about that.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1975, Bush once more followed in his
father's footsteps, heading to Midland in hopes of making a fortune
in the oil business. And then in 1978, again like his father, he
made an early, unsuccessful run for Congress. His Democratic
opponent, Kent Hance, tagged Bush as a Connecticut carpetbagger and
an Ivy Leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of his Yankee background still burns. But he is
convinced that the lessons he learned in the Ivy League helped in
his business dealings, which included being managing general
partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, and will be crucial to
his candidacy. Indeed, Johnson, the longtime friend and
appointments secretary, said, ``The 52-year-old George I see today
is very similar to the 15-year-old George at Andover, the energy,
the discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to figure me out,'' Bush said. ``Part of what I am
is the Midland, Texas, experience, and obviously part of what I am
is Andover, Yale, and Harvard. People may like it and may not like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a nonchalance that would surprise few who have known
him over the years, Bush reflected on the prospect of launching a
presidential campaign _ one of America's most difficult journeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fear of failure in this venture,'' Bush said. ``Nor
do I fear success. If it works out, great. If it doesn't work out,
hey, you know, come and see me. I'll be a retired governor living
somewhere in Texas. Seriously.''

CONDITIONS HAMPER PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Their fighter jets might soar through enemy air
space faster than the speed of sound. But this week, NATO air units
seem to have found one of their most daunting obstacles: the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only rain and sleet but also clouds that are
threatening to hamper NATO pilots in the coming days, as inclement
weather settles over most of Yugoslavia. Already, some foreign
warplanes have returned without dumping their full payloads,
according to Pentagon and NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weather is bad right now, and it's bad for the next couple of
days,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Monday night.
``That doesn't necessarily cancel all of the sorties, but it can
cause entire packages of planes to be canceled. Or it can prevent
planes that do take off from dropping some or all of their
ordnance.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, officials say, is that many ``smart bombs'' are
guided by lasers _ requiring light to refract off a target, which
cannot happen under cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such a common occurrence, the US Air Force frequently
relies on missiles. Recently, however, the military has also has
developed what is considered a superior weather-resistant weapon.
Known as the ``JDAM,'' the Joint Direct Attack Munition, it is
essentially a normal warhead directed by a global positioning
system rather than a laser.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb is directed in the following way: A target is located
on the ground by a network of satellites. Its coordinates are sent
to a receiving system on the warhead. An internal computer on the
warhead then directs it to the target site, all without relying on
outside stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't care about rain or sleet, or any other kind of
weather,'' said John Pike, defense analyst for the Federation of
American Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first batch of JDAMs was produced in May 1998, the
current operation in Yugoslavia marks the first time the US
military has used the bombs in significant amounts. Dropped
exclusively from B-2 bombers, they have played a major role in
Operation Allied Force, and as many as several dozen have already
been used, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has sent an array of other equipment to help
combat the weather obstacle, including the Predator, an unmanned
plane that flies at slow speeds to snap aerial photos of the ground
below, and ``JSTARS,'' the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar
System, a plane filled with sensors to detect movement from objects
on the ground such as tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is expected to work quite as efficiently in cloudy
conditions as the JDAM system. According to military analysts, the
satellite-guided bombs are so new that they were not expected to be
in wide use until sometime later this year, and many of those that
have been deployed already are believed to have been test bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bacon said: ``They seem to be performing very
well.''

TELEGRAPHING OF ACTIONS IS CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>

 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the first week of the NATO air war against
Yugoslavia, US and European officials have told Belgrade via the
media when, where and how the bombs will fall. President Clinton,
meanwhile, signaled the limits of the American campaign, pledging
that no US ground forces would be used to fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that telegraphing NATO military
strategy in Kosovo is designed to coerce the Serbs into halting
their military offensive in Kosovo and accepting a peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But some defense analysts argued that the United States and its
NATO allies have been giving too much away to the Serbs, imperiling
allied pilots and potentially undermining NATO's diplomatic and
military goals in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given away the element of tactical surprise, and we
have taken a lot of options off the table'' said Lieutenant General
Terry Scott, a fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
``From a military perspective, Milosevic shouldn't know what phase
we're in; he shouldn't even know we have phases.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the air attacks, US officials privately alerted
reporters that bombs would start falling during the night.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign got underway, American and European generals
began giving televised briefings describing how they would target
Yugoslavia's formidable air defense system and command and control
centers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solano announced that
the alliance was shifting its strategy into Phase Two, targeting
Serbian troops, police, artillery and tanks posted south of the
44th parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Western media have also helped provide Milosevic with valuable
battle intelligence. American and European news agencies routinely
report on the number and type of American and European aircraft
headed into battle in Yugoslavia. For instance, Reuters news agency
reported Monday that ``32 fully-armed F-16s, F-15s and F-18s soared
into the sky'' from Aviano air base towards the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon voiced concern Monday that
Milosevic's forces are monitoring American television to glean
military intelligence about NATO tactics.
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed frustration that details of a top secret rescue
of an F-117A stealth fighter pilot on Saturday, including the make
of the helicopters and aircraft used in the operation, had been
leaked to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs monitor the TV very closely,'' Bacon said at the
daily Pentagon press conference Monday. ``They are very aware when
planes take off. They use that to make military calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs know what kind of aircraft we use for these
rescue missions it would be operationally significant
information,'' added Carnes Lord, a national security adviser to
former vice president Dan Quayle and currently a professor at Tuft
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ``In the Gulf
War, we were extremely sensitive about releasing details about
special forces operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts said that the Pentagon has become increasingly
transparent in telegraphing its military intentions since the
Vietnam war. Under the Clinton administration, the practice has
become an integral component of its efforts to use the threat of
force to achieve political objectives from Iraq to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Zalmay Khalilzad, a US undersecretary of defense for policy
under the Bush administration, said that the military often
publicized strategic goals during the Gulf War, while keeping the
tactical operations under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating humanitarian crisis has ratcheted up the pressure
on the White House, the Pentagon and the NATO allies to strike
directly at Yugoslav forces responsible for driving tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics are understandable, but this has the effect of
exposing our pilots to greater risk,'' he said. ``We are doing
things sooner than we would have done otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts counter that the Pentagon's strategy can lull its
rivals into thinking, incorrectly, that it knows exactly what's
coming. Khalilzad said the Bush administration successfully
employed such a strategy to confuse Iraqi military planners seeking
to anticipate US troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   Khalilzad and Scott said that the Clinton administration has
gone too far in the past week, assuring the Serbs that if they
weathered the NATO air strikes, they needn't be concerned about
facing ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the effect of making them stay the course,'' said
Khalilzad, ``If they believe air attacks may not be protracted or
sustained they can afford to remain defiant.''

   Until just last month, Bulgaria refused to recognize the
Macedonian language, making it impossible for the two bordering
countries to sign treaties. For years, Greece tried to block its
northern neighbor from using the name Macedonia, saying the real
Macedonia lies on Greek soil.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions run long and deep in the Balkans. And these
conflicts over language and identity help explain why US officials
fear that the fighting in Kosovo, if left unchecked, could spread
into Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conflict with no natural national boundaries,''
President Clinton said last week in outlining the rationale for
NATO military strikes in Kosovo. The area is inherently unstable,
Clinton said, with ethnic Albanians living in Greece and ethnic
Albanians and Turks living in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let a fire burn here in this area, and the flames will
spread,'' the president warned.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts say Clinton has overstated the fears of an
expanded war, many say that the long-held tensions make a broader
conflict a real possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, for example, might suffer as ethnic Albanian refugees
flood over the border from Kosovo. As a ``miserably poor country,''
Albania might not be able to supply food and other resources to
everyone within its borders, leading to riots and other problems,
said Andrew Winner of the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, a
Cambridge think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, those Albanian refugees might include armed members of
the Kosovar separtist movement, which is trying to break away from
Yugoslavia, led by President Slobodan Milosevic. The Albanian
government, already weak, might have to contend with Kosovar rebels
waging war from within its borders, or with Milosevic's forces
chasing its enemy onto Albanian soil, Winner said.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Albania might enter the Kosovo conflict to protect
its own borders. And that is only one strand in the knot of tangled
political interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia could face problems similar to Albania's. About
one-third of its people are ethnic Albanians, and Albanian refugees
have been streaming in from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's forces could use that as an excuse to move into
Macedonia, or they could lay claim to Macedonian territory under
the excuse that Macedonia was once a republic within Yugoslavia. It
broke away in the early 1990s and is an independent parliamentary
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Political instability in Macedonia could prompt Bulgaria or
Greece to send troops into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a symbolic gesture when Bulgaria, starting in
the early 1990s, refused to sign treaties in the Macedonian
language, saying it was merely a dialect of Bulgarian. By refusing
to recognize the Macedonian language, the Bulgarians were refusing
to recognize the legitimacy of the Macedonian government.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks also have a long-running fight with Macedonia, though
it has been muted since a successful round of diplomacy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks fear that Macedonia has designs on a northern Greek
province that is also called Macedonia. Greeks say the name
Macedonia, as well as the country's flag and a provision of its
constitution, reveal its ambitions in Greece. Because of Greek
sensitivities, the young country has been known officialy as the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   As they play out the ramifications of the war in Kosovo, some
analysts said there is a chance that Greece would attack a
destabilized Macedonia to prevent Macedonia from acting on its own
alleged ambitions in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   That could raise a truly nightmarish scenario: Turkey could
enter the conflict under the guise of assisting Macedonia's Turkish
and Albanian minorities. Like the Turks, the Albanians are Muslim.
A fight between Greece and Turkey, two heavily armed NATO members,
would be the most destabilizing outcome of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who watch the region closely, however, said there is
little chance the war will spread beyond Kosovo. ``The Albanians
have no army to speak of and will do whatever the West wants them
to do, because they need aid,'' said Stacy Sullivan, a freelance
journalist who has covered the Balkans, and who is now a consultant
to the Human Rights Initiative at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulgarians are impoverished, and the last thing they need
is to get involved,'' Sullivan said. ``They believe Macedonia is
theirs, but they're not going to go after it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kurt Bassuener of the Balkan Action Council, a Washington
educational group, said there is danger in a weak government, like
that of Albania, becoming weaker still as rebels and refugees cross
its borders. If one government collapses, other nations might feel
the need to step in to prevent the instability from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to have trans-border army movements to have
destabilization,'' Bassuener said. ``You can have an implosion that
brings in outside forces.''

A TASTE TREASURE FROM DAVY JONES'S LOCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world in which ``new'' too often signifies merely a change
in food packaging or processing, Nova Scotia sea parsley is
floating against the tide. This marine vegetable is an anomaly of
nature, not industry _ though it would not be showing up in stores
now without a little help from human hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sea parsley, a tiny, curly leafed, burgundy-colored seaweed, is
a miniature version of dulse, the red marine plant best known to
diners as an ingredient in seaweed salads in Japanese restaurants.
It is a natural mutation, discovered in 1978 by a group of
scientists off Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy, near the
coast of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists formed a company, Ocean Produce International, to
cultivate the seaweed in saltwater tanks and sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, this delicacy was known only to Japanese
and other Asian cooks, as well as vegetarians, who bought it
directly from the company. But now it is being sold, in one-ounce
packages, for about $5 at specialty groceries in New York. It is
also available by mail order from Adriana's Caravan, (800)
316-0820.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for chefs to be captivated by this new
ingredient, which smells like the ocean but whose taste changes,
depending on how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Moonen, the executive chef of Oceana, said that sea parsley
``seems to have a natural affinity to Asian ingredients, but also
classic French preparations, like consomme.'' He adds it to seafood
soups or stews or to the pot when steaming a fish. The seaweed
lends a briny yet clean flavor.
</P>
<P>
   As a Canadian product, sea parsley often turns up on the menu at
the Canadian Consulate in New York, where Louis Charest, the
executive chef, has been using it for a year or so. He chops it and
adds it to salads, as he would arugula. He also uses it to flavor
salmon, sturgeon and turbot dishes; buries a fish in it for
steaming, and includes it in a warm lobster salad.
</P>
<P>
   Sea parsley, like most seaweed, is packed with vitamins and
calcium, and contains amino acids, which break down food fibers and
permeate them, changing their texture. If sea parsley is used raw
or barely cooked, the changes are subtle. If simmered or broiled
with other ingredients, however, it tenderizes them and alters
their taste.
</P>
<P>
   What chefs have discovered about this chameleon of a vegetable
is that when it is fresh and raw, it has a mild nutty taste with
hints of oyster and lots of crunch. When fried, it becomes a golden
green color and very crisp, and tastes more like bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Boiled sea parsley becomes deep green and takes on a mussel-like
taste. Sun dried, it has a roasted vegetable flavor. Fresh out of a
microwave oven, it tastes more like nori and is great when mixed
with a little rice vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead and do what the chefs do _ experiment. Fry some sea
parsley and sprinkle it like croutons on a salad, particularly a
salad accompanying cold or smoked seafood, or use it as a garnish
for seafood or vegetable dishes or as an accompaniment to smoked
fish, sushi and sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   For a wonderful blast of the ocean, add it to broths for
poaching or steaming. When boiled in lightly salted water for 15
minutes, sea parsley produces a broth that tastes like clam and
oyster juices _ a good base for a chowder or a quick seafood stew.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, it may take some imagination to recognize the
similarities between surf parsley and the more familiar turf
parsley. But just as curly or flat leaf parsley gives a dish a
whiff of the garden, its marine counterpart bespeaks the mysterious
flavors of the deep.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   STEAMED LOBSTERS WITH SEA PARSLEY AND NEW POTATOES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   5 cups (about 4 ounces) sea parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 lobsters, each 1} pounds
</P>
<P>
   1\ pounds small new potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

<P>
   1. Place { inch of water in the bottom of a kettle fitted with a
steamer rack. Cover the kettle, and bring it to a boil. Place
parsley on the rack, and put lobsters on the parsley. Cover pot,
and steam until lobsters are cooked through, 12 to 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a saucepan, and cover with cold
salted water. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until they
are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, cover
and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the lobsters are cooked, remove them from steamer with
tongs, and place them on a platter. Remove the sea parsley from the
steamer, and place it next to the lobsters. Measure out 1{ cups of
the liquid from the steamer, and place it in a small saucepan with
the shallots. Place the pan over medium-high heat, and cook,
uncovered, until only a tablespoon or two of liquid remains, about
10 minutes. Reduce heat as low as possible, and begin whisking the
cold butter, a piece at a time, into the pan. Immediately remove
the pan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice, and season the
sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toss potatoes with 3 tablespoons of the butter sauce. Place
remaining sauce in a small dipping bowl.

THE ONE DESSERT A PASTRY CHEF CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the first of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the pastry
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her collaborator on these
columns is Melissa Clark.  
 By CLAUDIA FLEMING 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's near the end of a satisfying and complex restaurant meal _
dessert time _ the moment when many diners find themselves in the
quivering grip of ambivalence. Do you go for the sweetness your
palate so clearly craves? Or, fearing heaviness and excess, do you
choose moderation and mutter, ``No, nothing for me''?
</P>
<P>
   The perfect dessert leaps this quandary by promising both
sweetness and lightness (even if the lightness is more illusion
than fact). And there is nothing in my repertory of some 60
desserts that does it better than buttermilk panna cotta. It is my
own favorite, the one dessert I couldn't do without.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as it is, this dessert is almost embarrassingly
simple: just warmed sugared cream mixed with buttermilk and a touch
of gelatin. I keep it on the menu all year long, changing its
accompaniment to match the seasons. Ripe summer berries, autumnal
figs and wintery blood oranges have all, in their turn, crowned the
delicate custard.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I've kept the presentation simple, and covered the
custard with a Sauternes gelee. It's beautiful in a restrained way:
the golden gelee, flecked with fragrant vanilla, sparkles in a thin
layer over the silken cream below. It adds a vibrant, elegant note
to the panna cotta without overpowering the tanginess of the
buttermilk or the mellowness of the cream.
</P>
<P>
   I got the idea from Tom Colicchio, the chef at Gramercy Tavern
and one of my mentors. I noticed that he uses a Sauternes jelly
with seared scallops and I love the way it shimmers and shines on
the white plate.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought, ``Why not add a similar element to my stark white
panna cotta?'' The only unusual ingredient is the leaf gelatin.
It's sold in specialty markets and I think it's easier to use than
powdered. Just don't oversoak it: it should be softened, but not so
soft that it will fall apart when taken out of the water and
squeezed dry.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes seven panna cottas, which may seem strange.
That's dessert for six, plus one for the cook the next day. At the
restaurant, leftover panna cotta is one of the most coveted
breakfasts of all.
</P>
<P>
   BUTTERMILK PANNA COTTA WITH SAUTERNES GELEE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes, plus 4 hours chilling
</P>
<P>
   1 and two-thirds cup Sauternes
</P>
<P>
   13 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 2-inch piece of vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and seeds
scraped out
</P>
<P>
   2{ leaves gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1} cups buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small saucepan, whisk together the Sauternes, 6
tablespoons of the sugar and the vanilla seeds. Place the saucepan
over medium-low heat and reduce the liquid at a bare simmer (turn
the heat to low if necessary) until it measures 1 cup, about 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Fill a bowl with cold water and add 1 leaf of the gelatin.
Soak until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, in a saucepan over medium-high heat, warm the
cream with the remaining 7 tablespoons sugar, stirring until it
dissolves. Take the pan off the heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the gelatin leaf from the water and squeeze it dry in
a clean dish towel. Add it to the warm cream and stir until the
gelatin dissolves. Add the buttermilk to the saucepan and stir
well. Strain the buttermilk mixture through a fine sieve into a
glass measuring cup; pour the mixture into 7 8-ounce ramekins,
bowls or parfait glasses. Chill until firm, about 3 hours.
</P>
<P>
   5. While the panna cottas are chilling, soften the remaining 1{
leaves of gelatin in a bowl of cold water for 3 to 5 minutes. Drain
the gelatin and squeeze dry. Add it to the warm Sauternes and stir
until the gelatin dissolves. Strain mixture through a fine sieve
into a clean glass measuring cup and let it cool to room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   6. When the panna cottas are set, stir the Sauternes mixture to
redistribute the vanilla seeds. Very gently pour a thin stream of
the Sauternes down the sides of the ramekins to coat the tops of
the custards (do this slowly to avoid puncturing the creams). Chill
until the Sauternes gelee is set, about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 7 servings.

   Benziger Merlot 1996, Sonoma County, Calif. About $16.
</P>
<P>
   Many laymen, confronted with several glasses of wine and asked
to separate the merlots from the cabernet sauvignons, will have
trouble doing it. So will many wine professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers routinely add cabernet to merlot to give it
structure, and they routinely add merlot to cabernet to give it
roundness, which means softening it up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   This delicious Benziger wine is less than 80 percent merlot. It
includes 10.5 percent cabernet sauvingon, plus cabernet franc,
petite sirah and petit verdot. The result is a velvety wine with
some nice cabernet tannin.
</P>
<P>
   It was aged for 15 months in French oak barrels. Thanks to the
cabernet component, it will improve in the bottle for another five
years, if you can wait that long.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Economists predicted Tuesday that the California
economy would slow down next year but said the effect would be
muted by economic diversification.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is already established. While Silicon Valley's
fortunes have dipped somewhat, the economy in Southern California
has been expanding, and the Central Valley, although plagued by
persistent double-digit unemployment, grew faster than Los Angeles
County did last year, according to the Andersen Forecast from the
University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched quarterly report by economists at the John
E. Anderson Graduate School of Management also projected that the
U.S. economy would slow from a 3.5 percent pace in 1999 to 2.1
percent in 2000. It estimated an unemployment rate increase from
4.4 percent to 4.8 percent in 2000 and predicted there would be yet
another ``soft landing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cost to obtaining economic diversification in
California,'' said Tom Lieser, executive director and author of the
California report. ``It did not just happen. But now that we have
it _ and we are no longer so dependent on aerospace, for example _
I think we are in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there were factors that could cause the state's economy
to slow down more abruptly than the Anderson Forecast imagines.
</P>
<P>
   One potential vulnerability is the highly leveraged status of
stocks in some of California's high-tech companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state, and particularly the Silicon Valley area, has long
been a world focus of venture capital. However, it has more
recently become a primary focus of so-called day trading _
high-risk investment in existing companies by amateurs,'' Lieser
said Monday, before the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   He said he feared these investors ``could lose their cool and
more tangible assets in a bear market, and to the extent that
untested amateur traders have built highly leveraged portfolios,
those stocks may be much more vulnerable than broad market issues
to a major sell-off in the equity market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson Forecast also noted that exports from the state
were up modestly despite continued economic troubles in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``California will remain a hub for trade with Asia when that
region strengthens again, probably in the next year,'' Lieser said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, California exports to the rest of the world
were down 4.2 percent in 1998. For the fourth quarter, state
exports were 6.6 percent below the year-ago totals. Shipments to
Mexico and Canada were up a combined 10.7 percent last year but
were only 2.9 percent higher, year-over-year, during the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments to Western Europe were up nearly 10 percent last year
and 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   California's exports to Latin America, excluding Mexico, rose
15.9 percent in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   There will continue to be growth in certain sectors such as
residential construction, the Anderson Forecast said. UCLA predicts
that 1999 will be the best year since 1990 for home building, with
more than 150,000 new residential units. Housing output is
predicted to rise to more than 200,000 units in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there will likely be too few new homes to satisfy demand
given current price levels, and prices and rents will continue to
rise, the UCLA study said.
</P>
<P>
   In job growth, both Southern California (greater Los Angeles
area plus San Diego) and Northern California (the San Francisco Bay
area and Sacramento) grew at virtually the same 2.3 percent rate
during 1998, the report said.

BEYOND THE ROAST: A LAMB FOR ALL SEASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Easter and Passover upon us, and the first tender leaves
emerging on the trees, the thoughts of many American cooks are
turning to lamb. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   After making its annual appearance at springtime dinners, lamb
will all but disappear from the table in most households. Americans
consumed, on average, just over 1 pound of lamb per person in 1998,
compared with almost 53 pounds of pork and some 68 pounds of beef.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's lack of popularity in the United States is a bit
puzzling, given its prominence in the Mediterranean cuisines we so
admire. From Spain to the Middle East, this savory meat is a
luxurious staple; in North Africa, it is so dominant that when you
say ``meat'' it is understood to mean lamb.
</P>
<P>
   But there are historical reasons for this phenomenon. Unlike in
Mediterranean countries, where farms were small and pasture lands
scarce, in land-rich America it was both easier and more profitable
to raise cattle than sheep. Even in colonial times there was a
widespread feeling that lamb was somehow ``un-American,'' the food
of people from less-fortunate lands.
</P>
<P>
   The range wars between sheepherders and cattle ranchers that
flared in the West during the late 1800s helped to solidify this
negative attitude. Cattle ranchers successfully characterized
sheep, which will eat grass right down to the roots, as little
better than four-legged locusts.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only history that is to blame for lamb's relative
obscurity. The meat also has a reputation for being gamy, with too
strong a flavor for many diners. This preconception seems to have
originated with mutton, which is the meat of sheep that are more
than a year old. Mutton does have quite a strong flavor, but that
has little relevance today, since it is virtually unavailable
commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb is actually rather delicate in flavor, almost aromatic,
with a slight undercurrent of sweetness. But it also has a
distinctive, rich earthiness that makes it ideal for use with
strongly flavored seasonings, like garlic, citrus and mint, and
spices like coriander and chili peppers.
</P>
<P>
   To take full advantage of lamb's virtues, it helps to put aside
two supposed truisms. The first is that you should always buy
``spring lamb''; the second is that the best use of a leg of lamb
is as a large roast.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier days, the term ``spring lamb'' did indeed connote
high quality, as it referred to lambs born in the spring and
slaughtered in the fall. Their meat was particularly tender and
therefore highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the term has meaning only as a marketing tool. Lambs may
be born at any time throughout the year, but most are slaughtered
at between five and seven months. So almost any lamb you buy today
will be tender.
</P>
<P>
   There is another important difference between the cuts of lamb
available today and those that our parents bought. Today's cuts are
considerably larger. Since the 1940s, the average weight of a sheep
at slaughter has increased by about 60 percent, to about 130
pounds. Kreg Leymaster, a research geneticist with the U.S. Meat
and Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Neb., said this has been
achieved by increasing the proportion of meat to bone, without
sacrificing tenderness or increasing the ratio of fat to lean meat.
</P>
<P>
   The larger size provides many opportunities for the savvy cook.
This is particularly true of the leg. Well known as an excellent
roast, it can also be used in a much more dynamic way. Spend a few
minutes talking to your butcher, and you can walk away from the
meat counter with luscious chops, meaty steaks and cubes for
kebabs.
</P>
<P>
   The first option for dividing a leg is to have the butcher cut
four or five thick chops from the sirloin, or butt, end. These
chops have the advantage of being cheaper than chops from the rib,
and they are far more tender than those from the shoulder. As a
point of comparison, they are identical in bone and muscle
structure to the steaks from the sirloin of the cow. Some butchers
actually call them steaks, to distinguish them from chops from
other parts of the lamb.
</P>
<P>
   A tip: Check the first chop taken from the end, as it sometimes
has a large knot of white fat in it. If so, ask the butcher to make
that meat into shish kebab cubes.
</P>
<P>
   With the chops removed, what remains is a four-to-five-pound
roast. This is the perfect size for many cooks, who find a whole
leg not only too large for most meals but too large for their
roasting pans, as well. This smaller roast is also of a more
uniform thickness, which translates to more even cooking.
</P>
<P>
   A second option for dividing the leg is to cut about a half
dozen thick steaks from the center. These substantial but meltingly
tender center-cut steaks, which somewhat resemble ham steaks, can
be cooked in the same way as leg chops.
</P>
<P>
   Once the steaks are cut from the center, the remaining two
portions of the leg can be cut into cubes for shish kebab. While
kebabs from shoulder meat can be gristly, leg kebabs are rich and
meaty, almost silky in their tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   When selecting a leg of lamb, look for meat that is pinkish-red,
since the darker the color, the older the lamb. The meat should
also look moist and bright, rather than sticky, and the fat should
look waxy white rather than yellowish.
</P>
<P>
   Like beef, lamb is graded prime, choice, good and utility, but
almost all lamb sold commercially is choice.
</P>
<P>
   So, by all means cook that paschal lamb. But remember that,
unlike tulips and daffodils, this meat does not need to disappear
with the passing of spring.

   BROILED LAMB LEG CHOPS ON EGGPLANT PLANKS WITH MINT-YOGURT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   \ cup roughly chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons freshly cracked coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 10-ounce lamb leg chops, }-inch to 1-inch thick (or substitute
center-cut lamb leg steaks), trimmed of exterior fat
</P>
<P>
   1 small eggplant
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat broiler. In a small bowl, combine yogurt, honey and
mint. Mix well and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine coriander, and 1 tablespoon each salt and pepper, and
mix well. Rub mixture all over the lamb chops. Place chops on a
broiler pan, broil until they are well seared on one side, then
turn and cook to desired doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes total
cooking time for medium rare, depending on thickness of chops. To
check for doneness, cut into one of the chops; when the center is
slightly less done than you like it, remove lamb from heat. Place
chops on a platter, cover with foil, and allow to rest while
eggplant cooks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Trim the top and bottom half-inch off eggplant, then cut
lengthwise into 4 planks about }-inch thick. Brush eggplant with
olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and press garlic
onto both sides. Place planks on broiler pan and broil until well
browned, very soft and moist all the way through, about 4 minutes a
side.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place an eggplant plank on each plate, top with a lamb chop,
spoon a couple of tablespoons of yogurt sauce over the top, and
serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   OREGANO-CRUSTED ROAST LEG OF LAMB WITH LEMON, POTATOES AND
ONIONS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   } cup roughly chopped fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 4- to 5-pound bone-in leg of lamb
</P>
<P>
   6 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   2 red onions, peeled and sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lemon, sliced very thin
</P>
<P>
   \ cup olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 500. In a small bowl, combine garlic,
oregano, olive oil, 2 tablespoons salt and 1 tablespoon pepper; mix
well. With the point of a paring knife, cut 8 or 10 slits about 2
inches deep into the roast. Push some of the oregano mixture into
these slits and into any gaps between bone and meat on ends of
roast, then rub the rest all over outside of roast.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a large roasting pan, combine potatoes, onions and lemon.
Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle generously with salt and pepper,
and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place lamb in roasting pan with potato mixture, place in oven
and roast until well seared, about 30 minutes. Stir potato-onion
mixture, reduce oven temperature to 300 and continue to cook until
lamb reaches an internal temperature of 120 for rare or 125 for
medium rare, about 30 to 45 minutes more. Begin checking for
doneness after 50 minutes total cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove roast to a cutting board, cover with foil and allow to
rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Carve into thin slices, and serve,
accompanied by potatoes and onions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a fine day for fish, a bad day for humans _
cold, wet and windy. After squeaking into a parking place near
Grand Central Terminal, Patricio Osses jumped out of his white van
and flashed a triumphant smile at Julian Alonzo, the executive chef
at Cafe Centro. ``Man, I have got some ugly fish,'' he said,
throwing open the back doors of the van.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding. Alonzo leaned forward and, deep within the
refrigerated gloom, his eyes made out the horrid forms of fish that
dare not speak their names, strange creatures that haunt Chilean
waters but are now, thanks to Osses, creeping onto restaurant
tables in New York. In a city full of the remarkable and various
fish of the world, the very strangest creatures of the deep come
from this one purveyor.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean sea bass can be found everywhere, of course, and
Osses had a 35-pound beauty to sell. But the sea bass was rubbing
shoulders, so to speak, with the maritime equivalent of the bar
customers in the original ``Star Wars.'' There was the grenadier
fish, also known as a rat tail, a squat deep-water fish with a huge
head, enormous eyes and a whiplike tail. The long, pale fish with
the mottled pink skin was a congrio, a meaty beast known in English
as a golden kingclip, or cusk eel. It shared close quarters with a
Patagonian blenny and a plastic bag filled with Chilean sea bass
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Warming to his work, Osses pulled pulled out several boxes of
choros zapatos, whose name, which means shoe mussels, gives an idea
of their size. They easily fill the palm of one hand. Out came the
limpet-like mollusks known as locos (crazies) and a crate of sea
urchins that looked like large, perfectly formed divots _ but alas,
no elephant fish, a large-headed specimen with a big schnoz that,
when threatened, stands bolt upright and spins like a dervish.
</P>
<P>
   The good news? Picorocos, and lots of them _ enormous barnacles,
nearly a foot tall, with a surprise inside their volcano-like
shells.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are alive and kicking,'' Osses said. ``They're
moving.'' He gently pushed a finger into the quarter-sized opening
at the top of a shell. Inside, a heaving, fleshy mass with a thick,
ribbed skin began to stir. Enraged, it heaved upward, extending two
clawlike fingers and, in slow motion, lunged at the alien finger.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo picked up a plastic bag filled with what looked like
small roasted red bell peppers and took a sniff. They were piures,
a kind of sea squirt. ``I worked at the Sea Grill for five years,''
Alonzo said, ``but this guy brings stuff I've never seen before in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Osses, a 33-year-old Chilean, survives by offering chefs the
kind of fish they cannot get anywhere else. Over the last 10 years,
he has built up his business slowly, selling door to door, opening
up his van and bringing out boxes of fish that make chefs stop and
scratch their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, he was lucky to sell 600 pounds of fish a
week. A few weeks ago, achieving a personal best, he moved more
than 10 times that amount. That's still small volume, but in the
weird-fish market, Osses is the man. ``He brings me things that
make my mind wander,'' said Rick Moonen, the executive chef at
Oceana. ``He makes you realize that there's a whole other world out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   That other world lies just off Chile's seemingly endless
coastline, where small fishing boats head out each morning from
Valparaiso and return the same day with sea bass, whiting and
congrio, as well as dozens of other species unknown to most North
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Osses' father, Rudy, meets the boats. What he likes, he buys.
Within 24 hours, the fish is on an airplane bound for New York and
into the waiting arms of his son, who loads it onto his
refrigerated van, painted on the outside with the name of his
company, Pacifica International, of Rego Park, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is not exactly in the Osses family blood. ``To be honest, I
never even tried fish before I came to New York,'' Osses said.
``I'm from Santiago, which is inland. When my father would take us
to the seashore, I'd order steak and potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate, however, threw a couple of curves at Osses. First, his
parents divorced, and he was taken by his mother to Rotterdam,
where he attended school, learned Dutch and English, and planned on
a career in language studies. After finishing college, however, he
rejoined his father, who had moved to New York and had started a
wholesale fish business, betting that the glorious Merluccius
australis, Chile's version of the whiting or hake, so beloved in
Spain, would make his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't. Burned by deadbeat creditors, the elder Osses
returned to Chile, but his son saw a business opportunity in
Chilean fish, if it was done on a small scale. He installed his
father and his uncle Juvenal in Vina del Mar, a coastal town near
Valparaiso, and began importing whiting, Chilean sea bass and
congrio. He caught a lucky break when Solera, a Spanish restaurant
in midtown, took a fancy to his fish, especially the whiting, a
tender, sweet-fleshed fish that is the starting point for one of
Spain's classic dishes, merluza con salsa verde, whiting in a
parsley-garlic sauce. The Chilean merluza is sometimes sold under
the name Antarctic queen.
</P>
<P>
   Rufino Lopez, the owner of Solera, remains a good customer. He
has a roving palate, and if he sees anything odd in the white
truck, he wants to try it out. ``With these picorocos, all I have
to do is make a few phone calls, and they're sold,'' he said,
grabbing a dozen that he would later bake for about 25 minutes in
the oven and then serve as is, a rich lump of white flesh swimming
in its own fragrant broth. ``The top part is almost like the claw
of a lobster. The middle part is somewhere between skate and crab,
and the bottom part is like a big oyster.'' In Chile, the picoroco
is added to sauces or to fish soups.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Osses is pushing the picorocos, sensing a trend in the making,
but his best volume sellers are sea bass and, more recently, the
whiting, which he has been supplying to the Fulton Fish Market and
to customers in Puerto Rico. Some of his fish also ends up at Wild
Edibles on Elizabeth Street.
</P>
<P>
   After a stop at Oceana, Osses was done with Manhattan. He headed
out to Queens, where he delivered congrio to two Chilean
restaurants, El Arrayan (The Bush) and La Gaviota (The Seagull). At
both places they will be served the traditional Chilean way,
deep-fried without any fuss. The flesh is firm and rich, with a
scalloplike flavor. ``In Chile, it's like our flag,'' Osses said.
</P>
<P>
   At Cafe Centro, Alonzo gave the congrio an Asian treatment,
cooking it in a Chinese black bean broth flavored with garlic,
ginger, lemongrass, sake and Indonesian soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The locos are another matter. This ovoid mollusc, which fits
neatly into the palm of one hand, needs serious tenderizing. One
method is to put into an inner tube and beat it against rocks.
After an enthusiastic beating and 25 minutes of boiling, it comes
out as soft as a potato, which is, in fact, the traditional
accompaniment to the loco, which is served on a bed of shredded
lettuce with a dollop of mayonnaise and a squirt of lemon. It
tastes like a cross between a lobster and a sea bass. ``You have to
be careful cooking them,'' Osses said. ``If you don't do it right,
you can bounce them off the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Piures may be the ultimate test of dinerly nerve. In the wild,
they look like seaweed-covered potatoes. Once the shell is removed,
a soft, red-orange body emerges, with a pungent smell of brine and
iodine. In Chile, the piure is marinated briefly in lemon and then
added, sparingly, to a platter of ceviche.
</P>
<P>
   A day after accepting a bag of sea squirts, Alonzo of Cafe
Centro was still trying to crack the code. ``I tried those little
red things. They have a weird texture and flavor,'' he said. ``Very
interesting, but not easy to come up with something _ they're chewy
when you cook them, and very smoky tasting.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a city that lives for adventure, it just might work
if presented as a new dining concept: the abuse-bouche. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Gov. Gray Davis has signed a bill
into law aimed at ensuring that more California children learn to
read.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, one of the four education measures sought by Davis and
passed swiftly by the Legislature, creates reading instruction
programs and professional development academies to train teachers
on reading instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was elected to restore the promise of education in
California,'' Davis, a Democrat, said Monday during a signing
ceremony at a San Francisco elementary school known for its
successful literacy program. ``This is a very important bill that
sets up a number of reading programs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, the governor signed a bill that requires high
school students to pass a graduation exam. Davis is scheduled to
sign two other education bills next week, one establishing a peer
review system for evaluating teachers and another to begin
measuring the performance of schools and sanctioning those that
don't improve.
</P>
<P>
   The reading bill, a Davis campaign pledge, provides $75 million
for grades K-4 to provide intensive reading instruction.
</P>
<P>
   It also allocates $12 million for summer programs to train
beginning teachers to teach reading and $1 million to establish
leadership training institutes for principals and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, co-authored by Assembly members Kerry Mazzoni,
D-Novato, and Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, who accompanied the governor
Monday to San Francisco's Gordon J. Lau Elementary School, would
provide another $2 million for schools that improve reading scores
by 5 percent or more next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you learn to read,'' the governor said. ``Then, you read
to learn.''

VERSATILE SCALLION PANCAKE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scallion pancake I've always made is similar to
the kind served in Chinese restaurants. It is essentially bread.
</P>
<P>
   I like its tough, chewy, slightly sharp nature, but it has two
drawbacks. One is that the scallion flavor is never strong enough.
And because the pancakes are made with what amounts to bread dough,
which actually requires rising time, they take a couple of hours.
This disqualifies them as a last-minute side dish.
</P>
<P>
   I addressed both of these considerations by making what amounts
to a simplified, scallion-laden pancake batter. The liquid is a
scallion puree, rather than milk, and the flour is barely enough to
hold everything together, so that all you really taste are
scallions, a touch of soy and the oil used for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The result is not the usual hand-held, pizza-dense scallion
pancake but a fork-tender pancake reminiscent of a vegetable
fritter.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor is great, and the preparation time has been cut to
about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the batter is so delicate, it is better to make
individual pancakes, which are easy to turn, rather than one big
cake. They are good not only as a side dish, but also as a platform
for stews and juicy roasts _ place a couple on a plate and spoon
the stew on top.
</P>
<P>
   And although I still associate them with Asian-flavor dishes,
omitting the optional soy sauce makes them a perfect accompaniment
to braised foods that use European seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   The same formula can be used to make pancakes with other members
of the onion family, especially shallots and the spring onions now
in many markets (they look like scallions on steroids). I use
peanut oil for this recipe, but that's only because I associate it
with soy sauce. If you omit the soy, you can use any vegetable oil
or even a good olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   FAST SCALLION PANCAKES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 bunches scallions or spring onions, about 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   { cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Peanut, canola or olive oil as needed
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil while you trim
the scallions. Roughly chop three bunches, and mince the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the larger portion of scallions to the water, and cook
about 5 minutes, or until tender. Drain, reserving about { cup of
the cooking liquid. Puree the cooked scallions in a blender, adding
just enough of the cooking liquid to allow the machine to do its
work.
</P>
<P>
   3. Mix the puree with the egg and soy, then gently stir in the
flour until blended. Add pepper to taste, then the reserved minced
scallions. Film a nonstick or well-seasoned skillet with oil, and
turn the heat to medium-high. Drop the batter into the pan by the
tablespoon or quarter cup, and cook about 2 minutes to a side, or
until lightly browned. If necessary, the pancakes can be kept warm
in a 200-degree oven for about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

NEW WINE SURVEY REVEALS A REASON FOR BRINGING YOUR OWN BOTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pity, if you can, the wine lover with a taste for the
most expensive wines available in New York restaurants. Prices for
these top-quality wines differ so greatly from restaurant to
restaurant that a customer keeping one eye on the budget could go
into the wine-list equivalent of sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, one of the most sought-after California
boutique wines, the Maya cabernet from tiny Dalle Valle Vineyards
in the Napa Valley, which makes only a few hundred cases of it each
year. Our well-heeled wine fan would pay $600 for a bottle of the
1992 Maya at Lespinasse, the four-star restaurant in the St. Regis
Hotel, but only $200 at the River Cafe in Brooklyn. Wouldn't you go
over the bridge to save nearly $400 on a bottle of wine?
</P>
<P>
   But then, things are not much better for drinkers of more
moderately priced wines. A 1992 Gallo cabernet sauvignon from
Sonoma County, for example, ranges from $52 at the Oyster Bar to
$105 at Barolo.
</P>
<P>
   So what are wine lovers and alert consumers, no matter how deep
their pockets, to do? There is no way to determine how or where to
get the best prices for wines in restaurants, or to gauge which
restaurants consistently offer the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers of the Zagat Survey of New York restaurants have
been bothered by this for a number of years, too, and decided to
make an price comparison of 99 restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn
and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The results, according to Tim Zagat, who publishes the survey
with his wife, Nina, will be seen in a guide listing restaurants
with the best _ and worst _ wine prices, along with price
comparisons for specific wines.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat said 150 queries had been sent to restaurants and the 99
represented where those that replied. He said he might make a
second request to several restaurants that did not answer but that
are known to have good wine lists. Specific wines were cited only
if they could be found in at least five of the restaurants that
responded.
</P>
<P>
   The guide is to be published within six months, but here is a
preview: the 10 restaurants with the best prices are Harry's at
Hanover Square, Chiam, Veritas, Sparks Steakhouse, Union Square
Cafe, Windows on the World, Tomasso's, Henry's End, Piccola Venezia
and the Oyster Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 with the highest prices are Lespinasse, Le Cirque 2000,
La Grenouille, Daniel, the ``21'' Club, San Pietro, La Caravelle,
the Four Seasons, Le Bernardin and Park Avenue Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The top-10 and bottom-10 lists were compiled by looking at the
number of wines for which each restaurant has the lowest or the
highest prices in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's offered 85 wines at the lowest prices of any restaurant
in the survey and none at the highest. Chiam has 60 of the best
prices but also had one of the most expensive wines, the 1994
Harlan Estate cabernet sauvignon, at $400.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Lespinasse had 85 of the highest prices and
none of the lowest. Le Cirque 2000, like many restaurants, had
wines in each category: it had 68 of the highest-priced wines but
also offered 12 wines at the lowest prices in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The wine-by-wine comparisons are startling, as they were last
year when Zagat first surveyed restaurant wine prices; that survey
was available only on Zagat's Web site. The range is most
breathtaking among the most expensive wines.
</P>
<P>
   Lespinasse listed the 1982 Chateau Petrus at $4,500, Le Cirque
2000 had it for $4,000 and Harry's for $1,750. The best price _
$800 _ was at a nightclub called Upstairs at Decade.
</P>
<P>
   Prices, of course, are driven by demand, and the fact that 12
restaurants offered the 1982 Petrus at $1,750 or more shows the
almost mindless demand for outstanding vintages. Chateau Latour
1982 was listed at $1,900 at La Grenouille, and Harry's was
charging $575. But the 1983 Latour, also a great wine, could be had
at Harry's for $155.
</P>
<P>
   So how do restaurants set their wine prices? Historically, the
restaurant markup has been two and a half to three times the retail
price. Some restaurants still hold to that formula, but many have
abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't follow any rule anymore,'' said Daniel Johnnes, the
wine director at Montrachet. ``I used to buy a bottle of wine for
$10 and sell it for $30. Now it costs me $20, so I sell it for $40.
The profit is the same but the markup has changed. The accountants
don't like it, but I feel I don't have any choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs cite their replacement costs as the main reason
for the staggering prices they charge for certain wines. And, in
fact, a buyer like Ralph Hersom at Le Cirque 2000 is going to have
to pay staggering prices to replenish his small stock of Petrus
1982. Little of this wine was made, and very few bottles of it ever
appear on the auction market.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants can offer lower prices on this kind of wine
because they have no plans to replace it once it is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement costs are becoming a problem for less expensive
wines, too. A good review can double or treble the prices of some
Bordeaux, Burgundies and California cabernets that are in short
supply to begin with. At the same time, there are many wines in
ample supply whose costs are still unconscionably high, simply
because of the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that the wine you pay $12 for in a retail shop and
see on a restaurant list for $36 probably cost the restaurant $7. A
good way to determine the wholesale cost of a bottle of wine is to
note what it costs by the glass. Many restaurants sell a glass of
wine for what they paid for the bottle. Thus, if there are five
glasses of wine in a bottle, the last four are all profit for the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Most restaurateurs shrug off complaints about wine prices,
pointing to the retail market, where buyers seem willing to pay
almost any price for rare wines and even for many wines of much
lesser quality.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer's only weapon is to search for restaurants that
work to hold prices down and to seek out wines that are good
values. The Zagat wine survey, when it arrives, could be a great
help in this effort.

WHAT MAKES A CHOWDER?  
 TRUFFLE OIL  
 SOFTENING BROWN SUGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What makes a chowder? Clam chowder, Manhattan chowder, New
England chowder _ I'm confused.
</P>
<P>
   A. Generally speaking, a chowder is a hearty milk-based soup
made from onions, cubed potatoes and either seafood or vegetables
like corn. Salt pork or bacon is often used for flavor. The
earliest New England recipes for chowders always included seafood,
since chowders were primarily fishermen's soups, made from whatever
was reeled in that day. Today, as long as a soup is thick and
chunky with a creamy broth, it can arguably be called a chowder.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is Manhattan clam chowder, made with tomatoes.
James Beard described it as resembling ``a vegetable soup that
accidentally had some clams dumped into it.'' Culinary historians
disagree on how tomatoes came to wind up in a chowder, and how the
Manhattan chowder got its name.
</P>
<P>
   The word chowder itself might come from chaudiere, the French
word for boiler or cauldron. In the French-speaking areas of
Newfoundland, these pots likely held fish soup, and it is easy to
imagine how, as the dish moved down the New England coast, the pot
came to signify its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I received a bottle of truffle oil for Christmas. Except for
drizzling a bit on my green salads, how can I use it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Truffle oil is usually extra-virgin olive oil infused with
fragrant white truffle. You can try it over anything that won't
overpower its earthy but subtle flavor: potatoes, pasta, risotto,
polenta, simple pizzas, omelets and slices of good bread and
focaccia. It's also fine addition to soups or mushroom ragout.
</P>
<P>
   White truffles are extremely rare, even more so than black
truffles, and the oil is expensive. The Baker's Catalog
(800-827-6836) sells a 1.8-ounce bottle for $17.75. (It can also be
bought in any good market in New York.) It's best stored in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I stored brown sugar in an airtight container in the
refrigerator, and now it's hard as a rock. How can I soften it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Either heat it in the microwave on high power for 30 to 45
seconds (watch to make sure it doesn't melt), or put it on a pie
plate, and heat it in a 250-degree oven for about five minutes. Use
the softened sugar immediately, or it may firm up again.
</P>
<P>
   To store brown sugar so it stays moist, tightly seal the plastic
bag it comes in (I use a rubber band), then place it in a
heavy-duty resealable plastic bag or an airtight tin. Keep it at a
cool room temperature. If the sugar shows signs of hardening, you
can add an apple wedge to the bag, seal it and let it stand for a
day or two before removing the apple.
</P>
<P>
   When buying brown sugar, give the box or bag a squeeze. If it
feels rock hard, choose another package.

   My wife, Brooke Hayward, and I were en route to see ``Death of a
Salesman.'' The curb in front of the O'Neill Theater was jammed
with cars disgorging passengers, so our cab pulled up to the
opposite curb. Walking across, we paused to allow an elderly
hot-dog vendor, who was pushing one cart and pulling another, to
get by. The vendor looked at the theater, then looked at us and
said, ``Hey, I hear that's a pretty good show.''
</P>
<P>
   We picked up our tickets and stopped next door to have a
pretheater drink. There was the playwright, Arthur Miller. We told
him about the comment made by that other kind of salesman, the
hot-dog vendor. ``That's the greatest review,'' Miller said.

<P>
   I was sitting near the front of a bus, listening to a rather
loud conversation somewhere behind me. The woman was talking about
her day, the man about his.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that I was witness to a typical interchange in the
life of a ``Me Generation'' couple, I heard her tell how hard it
had been to find just the right fabric for the curtains she needed
to order. He, on the other hand, without seeming to hear a word she
said, went on and on about a real-estate deal he had tried to close
that day.
</P>
<P>
   I did not realize how wrong my assumption was until I saw the
woman pass me on her way off the bus, holding her cell phone at her
ear, still talking about her fabric. The man, still seated
somewhere behind me, was obviously on his cell phone, still talking
about his real-estate deal. I guess ``Cell Phone Age'' has replaced
the ``Me Generation.''

   Maurice Finnell was waiting for a friend in the East '60s when
he heard a driver honking his horn, obviously agitated because he
was hemmed in by another vehicle, double parked.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle displayed a large cross inside the windshield, so
Finnell suggested that the driver ask the doormen nearby whether a
member of the clergy was visiting their building, perhaps on an
errand of mercy. The driver did so, with no success. He was
becoming increasingly frustrated and explained that he had an
important interview.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a priest turned the corner and headed toward the two
men. The driver rushed toward him, angrily criticizing his lack of
consideration, especially given his profession. The priest
patiently heard him out and then quietly said: ``Son, I know
exactly how you feel, as would I, but this isn't my automobile.
Would you, however, allow me to assume that motorist's blame?''
</P>
<P>
   Finnell couldn't wait around to find out what happened when the
real culprit appeared to claim his car.

   I live in Chicago, but travel to New York frequently on business
and have established many routines. For several years, I've had the
same man cut my hair, and we often joke about how tourists in New
York are easily identified by their ``anything goes'' approach to
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, I took an early flight to accommodate my
boxing workout session and haircut before lunch. I arrived during a
downpour, had the taxi wait as I dropped my bags at my hotel and
raced downtown for my gym session. Then I took the subway uptown to
my hair appointment. Completely drenched, I arrived at the salon
wearing my workout clothes and carrying my gym bag and boxing
gloves.
</P>
<P>
   My stylist looked at me and smiled. ``The quality of tourist in
New York has really gone downhill,'' he said.

   A friend of Irwin Trinkoff took his 6-year-old grandson fishing
one day. The little boy's line became tangled and he asked his
grandfather for help. After a few minutes of struggle, the
grandfather straightened the line and the boy said, ``You're the
smartest grandfather in the whole world _ how did you get to be so
smart?''
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather, knowing the boy's dislike of a certain
vegetable, replied, ``When I was your age, I ate a lot of
broccoli.'' The little boy paused only a moment: ``It ain't worth

unwrapped.
</P>
<P>
   There was a puzzled silence as a vertical roaster emerged. ``At
that moment,'' Ms. Wingard confessed, ``I felt the irretrievability
of the 10 years I'd lived before most of the women in the room were

   The Easter season reminded Patricia Honea of one some 30 years
ago. It was a beautiful Sunday and she stood outside the Fifth
Avenue Presbyterian Church watching the Easter parade.
</P>
<P>
   A bicycle approached carrying an older woman in a gray sweat
suit. On her head was a straw hat, complete with a big red rose. A
bed roll was strapped to her bicycle seat. As she pedaled past,
Mrs. Honea read the sign hanging off the bed roll. It said: HATTIE
SMITH IS BACK FROM CINCINNATI!''

   Good Samaritan? Harvey Garner and his wife had left their
doctor's office at 33rd Street and First Avenue and asked several
passers-by for the name of a restaurant where they might have
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   After several negative responses, a man who overheard the query
named what he called a ``delightful'' place but said that they
would need a taxi to get there. A cab was hailed and the man got in
with the couple. When they arrived at the restaurant, they thanked
him for going out of his way to help them.

DEBATE OVER PARTY BY GAY `NUNS' TURNS BITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Board of Supervisors, under threat of a
national boycott and feeling the wrath of Catholic Church leaders
and parishioners, refused to revoke the permit for an Easter street
party by gays who dress as nuns.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has jumped from one hot-button topic to another:
the separation of church and state, Christian values, religious
freedom, gay rights and personal persecution.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tinged with ugly infighting among the city's elected
leaders and deep divisions among two of San Francisco's most
powerful constituencies _ Catholics and gays.
</P>
<P>
   The board, in a 9-2 vote Monday, blocked a plan by Supervisors
Alicia Becerril and Amos Brown to pull a city permit granted to the
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to close a stretch of Castro Street
for the group's 20th anniversary celebration on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Becerril and Brown wanted the party delayed one week after the
Archdiocese of San Francisco and Catholic organizations said that
such an event should not be allowed on the holiest of Christian
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, the campy street theater
group whose members dress as nuns, refused to back down from their
plans to hold a street celebration on Easter. The celebration,
which the Catholics consider irreverent, includes a ``hunky Jesus''
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic leaders say the Sisters, who have a long history of
charitable work in the city's gay community, mock church ritual.
They are threatening a boycott of San Francisco for upcoming
conventions and vow to exact revenge on elected officials who
defied them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third rail for us,'' said Wade Johnson of
Catholics for Truth and Justice, a conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   The other side was just as fervent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Sisters want to shut down the street, we will shut it
down,'' said Criss Romero, president of the Harvey Milk Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Democratic Club.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm sent political tremors through City Hall that haven't
been felt for years.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors have fielded hundreds of phone calls, faxes, e-
mails and letters on both sides of the issue since the board gave
unanimous consent two weeks ago for the street closure in what
started out as little more than a debate over rerouting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The rift boiled over Monday night in a packed gymnasium when the
measure by Becerril and Brown was up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five public speakers weighed in with their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of others were prevented from testifying because of a
board- imposed time limit. There was hooting and hollering, hissing
and clapping, tambourines and sign-waving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics have a right to celebrate in peace. They don't need
to be ridiculed and laughed at,'' said Roger Grimes, a parishioner
at St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   Clementina Garcia, who held a crucifix up when she testified,
said: ``I want to tell the homosexual community that there's a time
for everything. ... If you want to be respected, respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union said the board
would be treading on dangerous legal ground if the Sisters' permit
were yanked. And it was that argument, more than any other, that
swayed the board majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence may be offensive and
objectionable,'' said Supervisor Mabel Teng, ``but we, the
government, cannot violate their First Amendment rights.''

PLASTIC WRAPS, LISTERIA: TO WORRY OR NOT?  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Eating Well column of Jan. 13, about the
potential health hazards of some plastic wraps, raised many
questions among readers about plastics in general. The column
looked only at data from Consumers Union, which suggested that a
component in some forms of wrap is an endocrine disrupter.
Endocrine disrupters can mimic or interfere with hormones in the
body and may cause breast cancer, birth defects, low sperm count,
and mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   The component, called a plasticizer, is di-(2-ethylhexyl)adipate
or DEHA. It is used to make some soft, clingy wraps called
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are primarily for commercial use,
and Consumers Union found that it could leach into some cheeses
wrapped in it by supermarkets. (Of seven consumer brands of plastic
wrap tested by Consumers Union, only Reynolds Plastic Wrap
contained DEHA.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Manufacturers Association says that DEHA has never
been shown to be an endocrine disrupter, and the Society of the
Plastics Industry, an industry group, says that the Food and Drug
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have given
the plasticizer a clean bill of health. Even Consumers Union
emphasizes that the risks are small. But Dr. Edward Groth, an
environmental scientist and food safety specialist with Consumers
Union, said that the size of the risk ``should not dissuade people
from taking reasonable steps for avoidable exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that plasticizers leach into food on contact,
especially food with a high fat content. The simplest solution is
to rewrap food like cheese or cold cuts at home, after slicing off
a thin layer where the wrap touched the food.
</P>
<P>
   Readers were also concerned about plastic containers marked
microwave-safe, storage bags, the wrap used on frozen foods, and
the wrap found on processed cheese slices. Consumers Union found no
DEHA when it tested the plastic on cheese slices and in two brands
of microwave-safe containers, Tupperware and Rubbermaid.
</P>
<P>
   Groth said that the few hard plastic trays for frozen entrees
that Consumers Union tested contained no DEHA. The same was true of
the plastic wrap used on frozen dinners, he said. The plastic wrap
on frozen foods probably does not contain plasticizers, he said,
because it is brittle. And any plastic wrap or plastic bag that
says polyethylene on the label does not contain DEHA.
</P>
<P>
   For the safest recyclable plastics among bowls and containers,
Consumers Union recommends those with a recycling code of 1, 2, or
5 (referring to different kinds of plastic). Those are good for
storage but not for reheating in a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic containers used for microwaving should be marked
microwave-safe. That rules out containers like margarine tubs. And
even the plastics industry agrees that no type of plastic wrap
should touch food while it is to being microwaved.
</P>
<P>
   LISTERIA
</P>
<P>
   Listeria, a food-borne bacteria, also worried a number of
readers. The bacteria, which is only a minor concern for most
healthy people, poses a more serious threat for the elderly, those
with a compromised immune system, pregnant women and newborns.
Listeria had not been a problem in recent years, but led to one
serious outbreak and eight recalls of cold cuts and hot dogs from
December to February.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers wondered whether the potentially hazardous
ready-to-eat meats include the precooked poultry found in
delicatessen cases. Turkey breast and chicken are often displayed
in these cases without any indication that they were prepared at
some distant plant, wrapped in plastic and shipped to the store.
They look as if they might have been cooked on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   But listeria was found in just such meats in an outbreak in
December, which was traced to Bil Mar Foods, a subsidiary of Sara
Lee, in which almost 100 people became ill and 20 died. For those
at risk, all ready-to-eat meats could be hazardous unless they are
precooked to 165 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Soft, ripened cheeses should also be avoided by those most at
risk. Brie, Camembert and all blue-veined cheeses are in this
category.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM SARAJEVO: A RAVAGED LAND PLEADS DON'T LET IT HAPPEN
AGAIN
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0331.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ This predominately Muslim city
felt the brutality of civil war, besieged by Bosnian Serb forces
for more than 40 months until late 1995 with artillery and mortar
fire from the misty peaks around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   It became the Beirut of the Balkans. Now for many, the pain and
fear are back as they watch the ongoing Yugoslav Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of mass killings and scorched-earth bombardments by
Serb forces in Kosovo, the television pictures of frightened
refugees on the run -- all cause 72-year-old Emina Juncer-Erich to
shudder with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing to the Kosovo people is the same as they
did to us,'' she said. ``I feel it all again. I'm sorry for those
babies and those young people suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by the United States late in their war against the
Serbs and still protected by 32,000 U.S. and NATO peacekeeping
troops, the Bosnian Muslims and minority Croats look to America as
a liberator, and the only force in the world powerful enough to
stop the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   A poster plastered around the city by a Bosnian political party
declares: ``Long Live America! Long Live NATO!''
</P>
<P>
   A pensioner, Juncer-Erich sells linens from a outdoor market in
Sarajevo's city center that was ground-zero in one of the deadliest
attacks of the Bosnian war from 1992-95. A red blot of paint marks
the grim spot where an artillery shell fell on the crowded market
in February 1994 and killed 68 people.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Sarajevo market jolted the United States and
its allies into action to intervene. NATO escalated an air campaign
against the Serbs that eventually brought the combatants -- the
Bosnian Muslims, the Croats and the Bosnian Serbs -- to the
negotiating table in Dayton, Ohio, and resulted in an enforced
peace that has endured for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarajevo, they are pleading for America to do it again,
before more fellow Muslims, this time the ethnic Albanians
remaining in Kosovo, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   And before the war expands, perhaps returning to this
still-recovering city, where blast marks and bullet holes still mar
hundreds of buildings, including the Olympic stadium which hosted
the 1984 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Some 800,000 people in Bosnia, a quarter of the population,
remain displaced by the war. Muslims, Bosnians and Croats live
largely in separate enclaves carved out at the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions are growing with the developments in the past
week in Kosovo, say international aid workers. Furthermore, some
5,500 refugees have entered Bosnia from Yugoslavia, most of them
Muslims fearful of Serb aggression related to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us here are afraid of the war spreading,'' said Jamila
Bajraktarevic, 48, whose table laden with vegetables for sale rests
next to the bomb-crater from the deadly Serb assault. ``No one is
safe. Even if the peacekeepers are here, the Serbs could attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are doubts that American and NATO planes alone will be
able to bomb Serb forces and their leader, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way planes can do the job without troops on the
ground,'' said Chamil Chatic, 36, a Bosnian Muslim selling bananas
and tomatoes from his market stall. His pregnant wife lost her baby
during the war when she was knocked over by the concussion of a
nearby artillery strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian soldiers are doing the same thing there that they
did here, the killing, the ethnic cleansing. It will only continue
unless the U.S. sends in the army to protect the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and administration officials
declared even before the air strikes began last week that U.S.
ground troops were not being considered in the operation against
Serbs in Yugoslavia. It is a vow they have repeated, including
Tuesday at the daily Pentagon press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But as tens of thousands of refugees continue to flee Kosovo,
pressure is growing within NATO to intervene with ground troops to
protect the refugees and prevent Serb forces from overtaking the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims in Sarajevo have faith that America, like its fabled
Cavalry, will come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise God for President Clinton,'' said the linen-seller,
Juncer-Erich.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ As Dashurie Gashi searched for the words
Tuesday to describe the past few days, she was overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Her face reddened, and the tears fell in line down her cheeks.
She placed her hands over her mouth and spoke. ``I saw 50 people
dead, just like that,'' she said, whipping her hands at the ground
for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Serb soldiers gathered up the people in her village,
Suvareka, and took the men away, she said. She thinks her husband
may have fled before being taken but she wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ordered to line up and were warned
to be silent. ``The soldier says, 'Don't cry or don't say anything,
or else we will kill you,''' she said through a fresh flow of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were allowed to leave, but as they moved
out of the village they discovered the bodies near the road, she
said. ``Men and women shot, just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no way to independently verify her story, Gashi
offered herself as another witness to what is happening inside the
southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombings continued to pound away at Serb military targets
all across Yugoslavia Tuesday, including Serb troops and
paramilitary gangs in the Kosovo province, in an effort to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace agreement
signed by Kosovar rebel leaders. In apparent reaction to the
punishing air strikes, Serb forces have begun a ``scorched earth''
policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of dozens of refugees paint a disturbing picture of
Serb police, soldiers and militia ordering people from their homes,
stealing their valuables, taking their passports and sending the
refugees to Albania. Homes are being torched and leveled, and many
refugees reported seeing dozens of dead civilians along their march
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw 30 people dead,'' said Husnia Shala, a grandmotherly
woman with a scarf wrapped around her head. ``The dogs and the
birds were eating from their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the two daughters of her neighbor were found dead
with their throats cut.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts are common among the tens of thousands of refugees
who have fled to neighboring countries since the air strikes began
a week ago. Since Saturday, 73,000 refugees from Kosovo have
crossed the border near here to seek refuge in this starkly poor
mountain community of 50,000, said Zakareik Kawi, an official with
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-million Kosovars -- nearly one fourth of the
population of 2.2 million -- have been uprooted by the crisis, the
biggest population shift in Europe since 1945, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 were expected here Tuesday, but Serb
authorities closed the border allowing only 6,000 to 8,000 to
cross, Kawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believed the refugees are still coming, however, and
now say they expect as many as 250,000 in the next few days.
``Albania is very poor, and the sudden influx of 70,000 is a real
catastrophe,'' Kawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes sits in a valley ringed by rugged mountains, many topped
by snow. It is isolated with its only road a little more than a
glorified goat path connecting it to Tirana, the Albanian capital.
There are no phones in the city capable of making international
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The one winding road, which often shrinks to only lane, was
filled Tuesday with scores of trucks, buses and minivans carrying
refugees to other Albanian towns and villages. Many refugees road
in the back of flatbed trucks exposed to the sun and cold mountain
air.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 refugees remained in Kukes, said Feriz Ameti, the
community's vice chairman. Most stay in private homes, moving in
with families. ``I saw 30 persons in one one-bedroom flat,'' Ameti
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 90 percent of the community's residents have volunteered
to assist in housing the refugees. ``It's an emergency situation
and our reserves are small,'' he said. ``Without the quick
intervention of international aid groups we would not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Four elderly refugees have died from exposure, and two have died
from gunshot wounds received in Kosovo, Ameti said. There were
unconfirmed reports that two were injured after stepping on
landmines near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Near the town's center Tuesday afternoon, refugees crowded
around a shack where the Red Cross was distributing loaves of bread
and goat cheese. They waited patiently as the food was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   As Gashi arrived with her small daughter, the door to the shack
had been closed. She received no bread. She began to sob as she
recounted her story to a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   A woman nearby interrupted. ``You can come to my house,'' said
Lumitori Tucila, who stood next to her husband. ``We will give you
a place to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucila said her family doesn't have much but will share what it
has. ``We shall divide by half our bread, and we shall stay
together,'' she told Gashi. ``We are family, we are all
Albanians.''

   KUKES, Albania _ As Dashurie Gashi searched for the words
Tuesday to describe the past few days, she was overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Her face reddened, and the tears fell in line down her cheeks.
She placed her hands over her mouth and spoke. ``I saw 50 people
dead, just like that,'' she said, whipping her hands at the ground
for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Serb soldiers gathered up the people in her village,
Suvareka, and took the men away, she said. She thinks her husband
may have fled before being taken but she wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ordered to line up and were warned
to be silent. ``The soldier says, 'Don't cry or don't say anything,
or else we will kill you,''' she said through a fresh flow of
tears.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were allowed to leave, but as they moved
out of the village they discovered the bodies near the road, she
said. ``Men and women shot, just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no way to independently verify her story, Gashi
offered herself as another witness to what is happening inside the
southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombings continued to pound away at Serb military targets
all across Yugoslavia Tuesday, including Serb troops and
paramilitary gangs in the Kosovo province, in an effort to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace agreement
signed by Kosovar rebel leaders. In apparent reaction to the
punishing air strikes, Serb forces have begun a ``scorched earth''
policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of dozens of refugees paint a disturbing picture of
Serb police, soldiers and militia ordering people from their homes,
stealing their valuables, taking their passports and sending the
refugees to Albania. Homes are being torched and leveled, and many
refugees reported seeing dozens of dead civilians along their march
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw 30 people dead,'' said Husnia Shala, a grandmotherly
woman with a scarf wrapped around her head. ``The dogs and the
birds were eating from their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the two daughters of her neighbor were found dead
with their throats cut.
</P>
<P>
   Such accounts are common among the tens of thousands of refugees
who have fled to neighboring countries since the air strikes began
a week ago. Since Saturday, 73,000 refugees from Kosovo have
crossed the border near here to seek refuge in this starkly poor
mountain community of 50,000, said Zakareik Kawi, an official with
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half-million Kosovars -- nearly one fourth of the
population of 2.2 million -- have been uprooted by the crisis, the
biggest population shift in Europe since 1945, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 were expected here Tuesday, but Serb
authorities closed the border allowing only 6,000 to 8,000 to
cross, Kawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believed the refugees are still coming, however, and
now say they expect as many as 250,000 in the next few days.
``Albania is very poor, and the sudden influx of 70,000 is a real
catastrophe,'' Kawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes sits in a valley ringed by rugged mountains, many topped
by snow. It is isolated with its only road a little more than a
glorified goat path connecting it to Tirana, the Albanian capital.
There are no phones in the city capable of making international
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The one winding road, which often shrinks to only lane, was
filled Tuesday with scores of trucks, buses and minivans carrying
refugees to other Albanian towns and villages. Many refugees road
in the back of flatbed trucks exposed to the sun and cold mountain
air.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 refugees remained in Kukes, said Feriz Ameti, the
community's vice chairman. Most stay in private homes, moving in
with families. ``I saw 30 persons in one one-bedroom flat,'' Ameti
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 90 percent of the community's residents have volunteered
to assist in housing the refugees. ``It's an emergency situation
and our reserves are small,'' he said. ``Without the quick
intervention of international aid groups we would not make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Four elderly refugees have died from exposure, and two have died
from gunshot wounds received in Kosovo, Ameti said. There were
unconfirmed reports that two were injured after stepping on
landmines near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Near the town's center Tuesday afternoon, refugees crowded
around a shack where the Red Cross was distributing loaves of bread
and goat cheese. They waited patiently as the food was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   As Gashi arrived with her small daughter, the door to the shack
had been closed. She received no bread. She began to sob as she
recounted her story to a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   A woman nearby interrupted. ``You can come to my house,'' said
Lumitori Tucila, who stood next to her husband. ``We will give you
a place to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucila said her family doesn't have much but will share what it
has. ``We shall divide by half our bread, and we shall stay
together,'' she told Gashi. ``We are family, we are all
Albanians.''

 &HT;    LETTER FROM SARAJEVO: A RAVAGED LAND PLEADS DON'T LET IT HAPPEN
AGAIN
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0331.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ This predominately Muslim city
felt the brutality of civil war, besieged by Bosnian Serb forces
for more than 40 months until late 1995 with artillery and mortar
fire from the misty peaks around Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   It became the Beirut of the Balkans. Now for many, the pain and
fear are back as they watch the ongoing Yugoslav Serbian offensive
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of mass killings and scorched-earth bombardments by
Serb forces in Kosovo, the television pictures of frightened
refugees on the run -- all cause 72-year-old Emina Juncer-Erich to
shudder with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing to the Kosovo people is the same as they
did to us,'' she said. ``I feel it all again. I'm sorry for those
babies and those young people suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Assisted by the United States late in their war against the
Serbs and still protected by 32,000 U.S. and NATO peacekeeping
troops, the Bosnian Muslims and minority Croats look to America as
a liberator, and the only force in the world powerful enough to
stop the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   A poster plastered around the city by a Bosnian political party
declares: ``Long Live America! Long Live NATO!''
</P>
<P>
   A pensioner, Juncer-Erich sells linens from a outdoor market in
Sarajevo's city center that was ground-zero in one of the deadliest
attacks of the Bosnian war from 1992-95. A red blot of paint marks
the grim spot where an artillery shell fell on the crowded market
in February 1994 and killed 68 people.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Sarajevo market jolted the United States and
its allies into action to intervene. NATO escalated an air campaign
against the Serbs that eventually brought the combatants -- the
Bosnian Muslims, the Croats and the Bosnian Serbs -- to the
negotiating table in Dayton, Ohio, and resulted in an enforced
peace that has endured for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarajevo, they are pleading for America to do it again,
before more fellow Muslims, this time the ethnic Albanians
remaining in Kosovo, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   And before the war expands, perhaps returning to this
still-recovering city, where blast marks and bullet holes still mar
hundreds of buildings, including the Olympic stadium which hosted
the 1984 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Some 800,000 people in Bosnia, a quarter of the population,
remain displaced by the war. Muslims, Bosnians and Croats live
largely in separate enclaves carved out at the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tensions are growing with the developments in the past
week in Kosovo, say international aid workers. Furthermore, some
5,500 refugees have entered Bosnia from Yugoslavia, most of them
Muslims fearful of Serb aggression related to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us here are afraid of the war spreading,'' said Jamila
Bajraktarevic, 48, whose table laden with vegetables for sale rests
next to the bomb-crater from the deadly Serb assault. ``No one is
safe. Even if the peacekeepers are here, the Serbs could attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are doubts that American and NATO planes alone will be
able to bomb Serb forces and their leader, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, into submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way planes can do the job without troops on the
ground,'' said Chamil Chatic, 36, a Bosnian Muslim selling bananas
and tomatoes from his market stall. His pregnant wife lost her baby
during the war when she was knocked over by the concussion of a
nearby artillery strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian soldiers are doing the same thing there that they
did here, the killing, the ethnic cleansing. It will only continue
unless the U.S. sends in the army to protect the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and administration officials
declared even before the air strikes began last week that U.S.
ground troops were not being considered in the operation against
Serbs in Yugoslavia. It is a vow they have repeated, including
Tuesday at the daily Pentagon press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   But as tens of thousands of refugees continue to flee Kosovo,
pressure is growing within NATO to intervene with ground troops to
protect the refugees and prevent Serb forces from overtaking the
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims in Sarajevo have faith that America, like its fabled
Cavalry, will come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise God for President Clinton,'' said the linen-seller,
Juncer-Erich.

WOULD YOU LIKE THE WINE LIST? NO, JUST A CORKSCREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I was nervous as I approached Patroon, the clubby
restaurant known for its fine American food and excellent but
expensive wine list. In my bag I had a special bottle of my own, a
cabernet sauvignon from Dunn Vineyards that had been aging for a
decade. On this night, I hoped, I would drink it with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That's what made me nervous. Would the sommelier roll his eyes
at the rube with his own bottle? Would the hostess sneer at my
audacity? Would they tell me to get lost?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the sort. As the hostess showed us to our table, I
showed her my bottle and whispered my request. ``Of course,'' she
murmured. A minute later a waiter appeared. ``May I take your
bottle?'' he asked. A sommelier returned with the bottle and
decanted it, as was appropriate for this wine. ``Where did you ever
find this?'' he asked appreciatively. Success _ and I didn't have
to be embarrassed, or even whisper.
</P>
<P>
   The right, even the necessity, to tote your own wine to dinner
is a time-honored practice among many smaller restaurants that are
not licensed to sell wine and beer. But the practice also occurs at
fancier, more ambitious restaurants that have invested considerable
amounts of money in building their wine lists. Restaurants do not
encourage the practice, but most allow it, especially, as I found
out by experimenting at several restaurants, if you adhere to a
certain protocol. This essentially consists of asking permission to
bring wine when you make the reservation. And if you encounter
resistance, it helps if you can offer a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants go along with it mostly to accommodate regular
customers and special occasions. They don't advertise the fact
because they aren't particularly happy about it under any
circumstance. Alcohol, after all, provides them with some of their
best profits _ the price is generally twice what you would expect
to pay at a retail store, sometimes more. And in many instances, a
restaurant's wine service allows it to show off an expertise beyond
the expected culinary wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not thrilling when somebody brings in a bottle of wine,
because it's one less bottle you're going to sell,'' said Danny
Meyer, whose restaurants include Union Square Cafe, Gramercy
Tavern, Eleven Madison Park and Tabla. ``We've got a huge amount of
money tied up in our wine cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, most restaurants charge a fee to uncork a bottle
of wine brought in by a customer. Depending on the wine you've
chosen to bring, the corkage fee may still permit a considerable
savings or obliterate any advantage at all. These fees can vary
tremendously. At Patroon, the fee was $30. Orinoco, a Venezuelan
restaurant on the Upper East Side, charges $10. At Meyer's
restaurants, the charge is $15. At La Caravelle and Windows on the
World, it's $20. At Montrachet, it's $35. At the Post House, it's
free.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing your own wine is desirable, especially in New York,
where so many people do all their entertaining in restaurants. Some
people want to drink a special wine on a birthday or anniversary.
Others, who have amassed a stock of old and rare bottles, want to
bring in wines from their collections that are hard to find in
restaurants. And some restaurants have small or limited wine lists
to begin with _ Thai and Indian restaurants, for example, rarely
offer rieslings or cabernet francs, the kinds of wine that go so
well with the food. The bottom line, though, is economic.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a wine list is not inflated beyond reason, the costs
can be staggering. Those who think nothing of paying a restaurant
$30 for a wine they can buy in a store for $15 may pause at paying
$200 for a wine they can buy for $100 less.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have collected wine over the years, to pay the prices
in restaurants is amazing,'' said Bill Plotch, a bond trader and
wine enthusiast, who has brought his own bottles to restaurants for
special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Moore, a communications consultant, and her husband,
Terence, belong to a wine-tasting society that occasionally scouts
around for restaurants with modest wine lists that charge minimal
corkage fees. ``It's always been very pleasant,'' she said. ``A lot
of our members have incredible cellars. They've bought stuff at
auction or 10 or 15 years ago where they spent $80 a case and now
it costs much, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant attitudes toward those bringing in wine vary, ranging
from a polite acceptance to outright hostility. As a practical
matter, restaurants are free to set their own corkage policies.
``No laws regulate or prohibit corkage fees,'' said Alan Gardner,
whose law firm, Verini &AMP; Gardner, represents a number of
restaurants that do business with the New York State Liquor
Authority. ``It's strictly up to the individual restaurateur
whether to permit you to bring alcohol or what to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even restaurants that strongly discourage the practice find
themselves accommodating it occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy is fairly firm against people bringing their own
wine,'' Daniel Johnnes, the wine director for Montrachet, said.
``However, like all things in life, there's room for maneuver. If
somebody's celebrating a 50th anniversary, and they bring in a
bottle they've been saving, you can be sure we're not going to
charge corkage, and we'll serve it with pleasure. However, that's
very different from somebody bringing in a case of wine for a
tasting and trying to get away from paying for wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnnes recalled six businessmen who walked in once with a case
of expensive wine, expecting to be accommodated. ``They handed us
the box, told us which order to serve them in and said, `We'd like
Riedel glasses,''' he said. ``Of course we refused. You have to
have some courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Etiquette is crucial when bringing your own wine. It begins with
a phone call, simply to smooth the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk into a restaurant cold with a bottle of wine in
your hand and say, `Pour this,' somebody's going to get a little
uptight,'' said Alan Stillman, the chief executive of the New York
Restaurant Group, which includes the Post House, Smith &AMP; Wollensky,
Cite and Park Avenue Cafe. He does not charge a corkage fee at his
restaurants, he says, because the only people who bring their own
wines are regular customers who do so only on special occasions.
``When it happens, we say there must be a reason for it,'' he said.
``I wouldn't be happy if somebody came in with wine once every
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers understand that politeness counts. Plotch, the
bond trader, says that he rarely brings wines to restaurants, and
only to those where he's developed a relationship with the owner.
``I wouldn't feel comfortable unless over the years I'd spent a lot
of money in a restaurant,'' he said. ``I think it's rude
otherwise.'' He also recognizes the value of sharing the wealth.
``If I do bring in a really great bottle, I'll always offer the
owner or the one who's taking care of me a glass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A quick phone call might have saved embarrassment one recent
evening when I tried to bring in a bottle of Jean-Louis Chave
Hermitage 1994 to Peter Luger Steak House, where the
hamburger-class wine list does not do justice to the restaurant's
legendary steaks. I was politely but firmly rebuffed by the maitre
d'hotel, and no amount of diplomacy could change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do that,'' the maitre d'hotel said. ``I've even
turned down Henry Kissinger.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Luger's treasurer, Amy Rubenstein, said the policy makes
things simpler for the restaurant. ``It's just easier for us,'' she
said. ``We don't charge excessively, we don't have large markups,
but we're in business to sell wine, and that's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've received permission from a restaurant to bring
that special wine, the hand that pours the bottle for you will
still be outstretched. ``The waiter's salary has to do with what we
make on wine,'' Meyer said, ``so generally people are more generous
with the gratuity.'' As a rule, Johnnes of Montrachet recommends
tipping as if you had bought the wine at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While restaurateurs dread the BYO bordeaux crowd, the actual
number of people bringing in their wines is small. ``Our restaurant
has been open about six months, and I can count on my fingers the
number of people who have brought bottles,'' Steven Eckler, the
general manager at Eleven Madison Park, said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckler, the former general manager of Postrio in San Francisco,
says this small number is in direct contrast to his experience
there. ``On the West Coast, I would see two to three times as many
people,'' he said. ``It's a different restaurant culture. People
don't feel the same hesitancy. They weren't embarrassed about
bringing it in. As a restaurant, you got used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stone, the wine director and a co-owner of Rubicon in San
Francisco, says the different attitude stems from the area's
proximity to wine country. ``Winery owners entertain a lot and have
to bring their own wines, and that became the basis for it,'' he
said. ``Seattle, too, is fairly tolerant, but Southern California
is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says that the practice was so common that many area
restaurants have not only abandoned hope of resistance but have
completely capitulated, instead accepting the profits they make on
corkage fees, which Stone said range from $8 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of restaurants don't want to stock wines because people
bring their own anyway,'' Stone said. ``They've just given up on
creating a wine list. You just don't see anything older. You don't
find the kind of collections that you might on the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that when Rubicon opened in 1994, 20 to 25 percent
of the customers on some nights paid corkage fees. The restaurant
managed to reduce the figure to 3 percent by emphasizing rare wines
at reasonable prices, he said. But that victory comes at a cost of
smaller profits on wine, a greater dedication to training the staff
about wine and an effort at ferreting out unusual bottles. And
still, the restaurant lives in fear of customers bearing bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four people bringing in 10 different bottles of wine,'' Stone
envisioned, practically shuddering. ``That's the nightmare part of
this. That's 40 glasses. It takes up a lot of time for the server,
they have to be washed and scrubbed, and they don't tip!'' &QL;

`HOLIDAY EGGS': A CELEBRATION WITH RECIPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In gentle pastels, ``Holiday Eggs'' by Georgeanne Brennan
(Smithmark, $14.95), celebrates the egg as a symbol of springtime
and renewal. Eggs are showcased not only in recipes, but also in
clever seasonal crafts, including stunning Ukrainian Easter eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Without getting too deep into the subject, Ms. Brennan
introduces eggs with descriptions of ancient legends, superstitions
and traditions from English, Greek and Roman cultures. She mentions
the custom of eating eggs with salted water at Passover and how
eggs represent the resurrection of Jesus at Easter.
</P>
<P>
   What may come as news to some is that white eggs are favored in
America and brown in Europe. And that hens with white feathers and
white ear lobes lay white eggs, while brown eggs come from birds
with red or reddish-brown feathers and ear lobes. Who knew chickens
had ear lobes?
</P>
<P>
   The general cooking information is given the same kind of
cursory once-over as the history and folklore. It's useful as far
as it goes, but neglects some basic, perennial questions about
cooking with eggs like:
</P>
<P>
   Why are some so easy to peel after cooking and some not? And how
do you avoid a black ring around the yolk when hard boiling?
</P>
<P>
   The collection of familiar, classic recipes, accompanied by
lovely, soft-tone photographs, is divided according to the way the
eggs are used: whole, beaten, whites only and so forth. Highlights
in the repertory include a salad of frisee aux lardons with an egg
on top, softly scrambled eggs with truffles, huevos rancheros,
seafood quiche and oeufs a la neige.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brennan does include nice little touches. A simple open-face
egg salad sandwich is beautified with edible flowers; French toast
is made from stale croissants, and eggs Benedict is dressed for
spring with asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Simple iced lemon-butter cookies cut into ovals can hang from
budding branches on silken cords as Easter decorations. But the
recipe for eggs pickled with tea and star anise omits an
instruction to crack the shells, though it does describe how
marbleizing occurs at the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonedible creations, using eggs and eggshells, include napkin
rings, votive candles, centerpieces and elegant little containers
for flowers. Egg decorating instructions are given not only for the
complicated Ukrainian eggs, or pysanky, but also for techniques
that children can handle, like tie-dyeing. Children also get
instructions for fashioning the baskets to hold those eggs.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco State University lecturer has
been awarded $2.75 million in a discrimination case in which a
college dean allegedly said he would hire ``a white guy over my
dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded Howard E. McNier, a white teacher who was denied
tenure at the university's College of Business, $2.75 million in
damages Friday for discrimination and another $2.2 million for
retaliation, but a pretrial agreement limits the total award to the
higher of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll (university officials) probably appeal it, but the
critical thing at this point is vindication,'' McNier, 51, said
after resolving his three-year legal battle. ``If this kind of
discrimination is ever going to stop, individuals will have to face
the music.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials declined to comment on the details of the
case, but were stunned by the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked, dumbfounded, deeply, deeply disappointed, and
we are actively considering all of our options at this point,''
said Ligeia Polidora, a university spokeswoman. ``The university
believes and continues to believe that there is no merit to these
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Trials Digest Publishing Inc., McNier's award is
the highest employment verdict against any California institution
since the Oakland-based company began tracking statewide trial
results in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask if this is a reverse discrimination,'' said Robert
Jaret, McNier's lawyer. ``There's no such thing as reverse
discrimination. If you discriminate against someone and prejudge
them _ whether it's sex, race, religion _ it's discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jaret and court documents, McNier was a full-time
lecturer on hospitality and hotel management for five years when a
full-time tenure track position became available in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, McNier said he was told by the chairwoman of the
hospitality management department not to apply for the position.
McNier applied for the job anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence there was a mandate in the College of
Business to hire recognized minorities over Caucasians,'' Jaret
said. ``Howard was precluded from the list of candidates solely
because they wanted to hire a recognized minority.''
</P>
<P>
   McNier said the job required a doctorate in hospitality, a
qualification he said was deliberately added to exclude him.
</P>
<P>
   McNier has a law degree and master's in business administration,
but no doctorate in hospitality. In April 1996, the department
hired a Chinese citizen from Hong Kong who had a doctorate in the
field but less practical experience, according to Jaret.
</P>
<P>
   A tenured business professor testified at McNier's trial that
the former dean of the College of Business, Arthur Wallace, who is
black, made comments over time about refusing to consider white
males for staff openings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the comments reported in the lawsuit, the dean allegedly
said, ``I will hire a white guy over my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was dean from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, after McNier filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, Jaret said his client was no
longer given hospitality and accounting courses to teach.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to continue teaching some management classes at San
Francisco State because of his friendship with the chairman of that
department, Jaret said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five years of teaching (hospitality) management and
accounting, he was completely eliminated,'' Jaret said, adding that
McNier's salary also was cut. ``It was clearly direct
retaliation.''

 &HT;    MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS WILL LIVE LONGER, TRUSTEES SAY
 &HT;    490&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The potential bankruptcy of the Medicare and Social
Security trust funds have been postponed for years thanks to
economic prosperity and policy changes, the programs' trustees
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that seven more years of life for Medicare and two more
for Social Security might relieve pressure for reforms, President
Clinton and the chairmen of key Senate committees pledged to work
hard on the popular programs' long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital benefits for 38
million Americans will last until 2015, the trustees said in their
annual report. That is seven years later than last year's
projection, and 14 years later than the previous year's prediction
of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees said the Social Security trust funds that finance
pensions and disability payments for 44 million Americans will last
until 2034. That is two years later than they projected last year,
and five years later than their prediction of 2029 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The growing economy helped both programs by raising wages and
the number of workers paying payroll taxes, the trustees said. That
means the bankruptcy dates could again shift earlier if the economy
nosedives.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security trust funds will also stretch further
because the newly revised consumer price index doesn't rise as fast
as the old one, the trustees said. That means that beneficiaries
get a smaller inflation adjustment each January when payments are
raised to match increases in the index.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare trust fund also got a lift from the phasing in of a
1997 law that removed the lid on wages taxed for Medicare and
squeezed payments to hospitals and related care-givers, the
trustees said.
</P>
<P>
   Crackdowns on waste, fraud and abuse also helped, said Health
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, one of the four Clinton
administration officials on the six-person board.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and officials disagreed on what the good news _ which
the trustees acknowledged were only experts' ``guesses'' _ means
for current efforts to extend the life of both programs for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The odds that this Congress would ``seriously consider
long-range Medicare reform'' have dropped from ``very little'' to
``no chance,'' said Robert Reischauer, a scholar at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution who once headed the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say this good news means we can simply delay
reforms. Nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said. ``If
we wait, we will be condemning ourselves to future changes that
will be much more costly and wrenching and much less satisfying in
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Chairman William Roth, R-Del., whose support
would be needed for progress in the Senate this year, indicated
within hours that he was ready to move on Medicare, and may push
for action on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let this good news make us complacent in our efforts
to improve the ability of Medicare to meet the needs of seniors,''
said Roth.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He announced that he would start a series of Medicare hearings
in mid-April. ``Based on these hearings, I intend to mark up
legislation and bring it through the committee later this spring,''
Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Social Security, he said, ``I remain hopeful that at
the very least, we can get a personal retirement account program
under way in this Congress,'' which will end in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on Aging, said, ``Today's news doesn't let anyone
off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the two outside trustees _ Democratic economist Marilyn
Moon and Republican actuary Stephen G. Kellison _ said the new
bankruptcy dates show that both programs should be saved through
small, step-by-step changes rather than sweeping and controversial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial Medicare reforms'' could be put off until as late
as 2007, Moon and Kellison said in their portion of the report. For
the time being, they suggested, the government could adopt
``measured changes to make Medicare a more streamlined and
effective program.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Social Security, they said, ``The long-term financing
problem facing Social Security is significant, but could be solved
by small gradual changes, if those changes are enacted soon.''

PHONES, TV SETS WILL WORK JAN. 1, NEW REPORT SAYS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Don't worry. On Jan. 1 you will be able to call
friends and relatives and settle in for hours of college football
games on television without a computer glitch, according to a
Federal Communications Commission report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such typical New Year's Day activities should take place
normally because most of the telecommunications industry's
computers have been upgraded to read the date Jan. 1, 2000,
correctly, the report said. Thus, they will avoid any malfunction
due to the so-called Y2K or Year 2000 problem in which some older
computers may misread 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC, which regulates the nation's telephone, television,
radio and wireless communications industries, did warn that the
response time in 911 emergency systems could be longer as a result
of the date change.
</P>
<P>
   In many 911 systems, the report explained, operators see
callers' addresses on computer screens, and if those computers
fail, the operators would have spend more time getting information
from callers in order to dispatch ambulances, fire trucks or police
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But, overall, the FCC report said the telephone industry is best
prepared of all communications industries for the Y2K date change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of telephone consumers can expect few, if
any, Y2K disruptions,'' said Michael Powell, an FCC commissioner
who heads the agency Y2K task force. He spoke at a news conference
at which the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said the nation's seven largest local telephone providers
and the large long-distance carriers such as AT&AMP;T _ which provide
telephone services to 90 percent of Americans _ have fixed almost
all of their computers so they can read 2000 correctly.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FCC is concerned that some 1,200 small- and
medium-sized local telephone providers won't have their systems
upgraded by Jan. 1, which could disrupt phone service for the
remaining 10 percent of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   On TV reception, the FCC said it expects that people will
continue to have access to broadcast television signals and to
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said all Americans will be able to receive at least one
over-the-air television station even if a Y2K problem temporarily
halts operations at some stations.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said individual cable channels could be disrupted
because cable providers receive the channels from a variety of
sources that could be affected by a computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, the chairman of President Clinton's council on
Year 2000 conversion, who also spoke at the news conference, said
he expects that the nation's electricity systems to continue
working on Jan. 1, assuring that television and cable service will
also operate.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said he fears some of the largest Y2K-related problems
will come from people's overreactions, such as hoarding food and
withdrawing their money from banks.
</P>
<P>
   He and Powell did suggest, however, that people refrain from
making phone calls at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1 just to see if their
phones work.
</P>
<P>
   Powell noted that the nation's phone system isn't designed for a
majority of Americans to use their phones at the same time. He
noted that on Mother's Day, which is the busiest phone day of the
year, some people get busy signals or are unable to complete their
calls on the first try because of the larger-than-normal volume of
calls.

<P>
   Passover comes in the fall in the Southern Hemisphere, but even
for a gaucho judio in the pampas, the eight-day holiday means what
it does for most Jews in the United States: gefilte fish with
horseradish, chicken soup with matzoh balls and roast chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But there, cooks are much more involved in the preparations.
Only recently have they had access to store-bought Passover
staples.
</P>
<P>
   Buenos Aires is home to the largest concentration of Jews in
Latin America, and Argentina has the seventh-largest Jewish
population by country in the world: 206,000. Most came fleeing the
pogroms of Russia, although about 15 percent are Sephardic, from
Syria, Turkey and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Eastern European immigrants to the United States,
however, many of the earliest settlers were farmers. Diego Guelar,
the Argentine ambassador to the United States, said his
great-grandfather arrived from Lithuania in 1891 with the Jewish
Colonization Association of Paris, a fund established by the
philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch to create Jewish
agricultural colonies in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Like a few of these Jewish cowboys, the Guelars stayed on the
land, eventually swapping farming for cattle breeding.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in Washington, Guelar recalled that at his
childhood Passovers on a ranch in Entre Rios Province, about 400
miles northeast of Buenos Aires, roast chicken was on the menu,
along with Eastern European recipes like potatoes stuffed with
ground beef and onions.
</P>
<P>
   These are called chremslach in Eastern Europe and albondigas de
papas in Argentina. An avocado and lettuce salad replaces the
asparagus served in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Passover dishes in Argentina were made from
scratch. Very few of the kinds of products now taken for granted in
this country were sold in stores. Guelar, who is 48, recalls how on
his ranch the gefilte fish was made by hand-grinding carp,
whitefish and pike, and then stuffing it into the skin of a large
carp.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with more kosher-for-Passover products available, like
vinegar and oil, Argentines can eat their roast chicken marinated
in chimichurri sauce, a garlicky blend of vinegar and spices. The
recipe here is from Naomi Sisson, the wife of the Israeli Consul
General in New York, who grew up in Rosario, in the province just
northeast of Entre Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is one of the few countries where kosher butchers
provide the beef casings to make kishke, the Jewish holiday dish of
intestines stuffed with potatoes, matzoh meal, eggs, chicken fat
and spices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, there were 50 kosher butchers in Buenos Aires,'' Adolfo
Maleh told me during a recent visit to Argentina. Now, he is one of
the 20 or so remaining in the entire country. Maleh, who is
Sephardic, makes beef chorizo at his Carniceria Simon in Once
(pronounced OWN-say), traditionally the city's Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The stores in Once and other neighborhoods now offer packaged
products for Passover from Israel and the United States, like cake
mixes and tomato paste and soups, as well as the local Yanovsky
brand of matzoh and matzoh meal.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the younger generation use these time-saving products,
but the old-timers do not. Susana Shalalof, who has cooked for 35
years at Succath David, one of the few kosher restaurants in Buenos
Aires, makes traditional Syrian dishes at home for Passover (the
restaurant closes for the holiday).
</P>
<P>
   Her stuffed vegetables, from a recipe brought by her parents
from Syria, are filled with beef or lamb, rice and pine nuts,
seasoned with cumin, allspice and cinnamon and served in a sauce of
tomato, tamarind and cinnamon, all ingredients permissible at
Passover for Syrian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cooks in this country, Mrs. Shalalof, like most
Argentines, doubles the amount of beef in her traditional recipes
for Passover, and throughout the year.

`FAIRY' ROSE IN CEMETERY POT MAY DETER THIEVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  NOTE: italic indicators in text 
 
By KATHY HUBER 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My wife died in 1996, and I have been going to the cemetery
every day. In the beginning I took cut flowers, but after a while I
started taking flowers in pots, replacing them as needed. I bought
a hibiscus, which greeted me every day with its beautiful flowers.
Then came some sad experiences. Somebody stole it. This, of course,
limits my possibilities. I cannot put anything expensive on the
grave because the thieves have expensive tastes.
</P>
<P>
   What can you recommend that would last a little longer than a
few days, bloom nicely, be theft-proof and not require much
watering?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are many plants that would give you flowers for days,
weeks, even months, but the theft problem is the hitch here. Is it
possible to place a marble or concrete urn or other large, heavy
container at the grave site? If so, you could then plant a rose
called `The Fairy,' which produces sprays of double rose-pink
blooms. Such a thorny plant and a heavy container seemingly would
discourage a thief. The container would be an initial expense, but
I would hope it would be a permanent solution. Make sure the
container has a drainage hole in the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The rose would bring you months of beautiful blooms. Rainfall
would determine how much supplemental watering you would have to
do. During the hot, dry summer months, you may have to water two or
three times a week, depending on the size of the container and how
quickly the soil dries. Check soil moisture with your fingers. If
it's dry several inches down, give the plant a drink.
</P>
<P>
   You also could plant another hibiscus in a large, heavy
container. Or fill it with purple coneflowers and purple fountain
grass for late spring-fall color. These plants, like roses and
hibiscus, like sun but require little care _ just water to get them
off to a good start. Again, during the hottest months, you will
want to check the moisture. These plants are fairly
drought-tolerant, once established, but during extended hot, dry
periods, some watering will be needed. The coneflowers produce
rose-purple blooms that are attractive with graceful purple foliage
and purple-buff plumes of the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I brought seeds from my orchid tree in Arizona to Texas and
now have a small tree growing. How do I care for my tree in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most commonly seen orchid tree here is our native
Anacacho orchid tree ITAL (Bauhinia congesta), END ITAL the lovely
small tree that produces white flowers off and on from spring until
winter. The fruits, beanlike pods, appear in late summer. But I
like the foliage, too. The leaves are divided at the base into two
leaflets, but these appear as one wide, deeply cleft leaf that
resembles a hoof.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose this is similar to what you have. The orchid tree
grows at a moderate-to-fast rate up to 15 feet. I use it as an
understory tree on the south side of our home, where it receives
some protection from cold winds. Some years it suffers some top
damage after a hard freeze, but the tree is root-hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Mulch the roots well. Plant in an organically enriched,
well-draining, acidic soil in sun or partial shade. The pink orchid
tree, ITAL B. macranthera, END ITAL has beautiful pale
pink/lavender blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband has been contributing to the National Arbor Day
Foundation for years. Each year in early spring, he receives six or
more saplings. After starting the redbuds, he transplanted the
1-1/2-inch-diameter trees in several locations. Five years later
the trunks are up to 2-1/2 inches in diameter, and one tree is
1-1/2 stories tall. These trees have never bloomed. They just leaf
out in spring. Is there a reason?
</P>
<P>
   We have received cypress trees. Where can one person use eight
to 10 cypress trees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Redbuds and other flowering trees must pass through
adolescence before they bloom. Your trees should come around with
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Cypresses are great in a Houston-area landscape, but they do
become large, and most gardens accommodate only one to three. You
could plant a grove in an area of your garden or use the trees
along a fence line. These trees are handsome, whatever the season.
I would pass any extras along to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The bald cypress ITAL (Taxodium distichum) END ITAL is a tall,
deciduous conifer, conical in shape with finely textured leaves
that are lime green in spring and deep rust in fall. Birds like the
seeds of this native.
</P>
<P>
   This large tree tolerates wet sites and will live in heavy clay.
It does not demand especially wet conditions and, in fact, is
drought-tolerant. Long-lived, the cypress can eventually reach 80
feet or more.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The thick, emerald foliage of my new blue hydrangea has been
turning brown around the edges for about a week, and this morning I
noticed something is eating it. The hydrangea is planted near my
lavender azalea. Should I move the hydrangea?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible your hydrangea is suffering from a little
stress. Too little or too much water will cause leaf margins to
brown. The recent heavy rains could have been partially
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas like bright shade or partial sun, and they like
adequate moisture, just as azaleas do. So if your azalea is
healthy, I would just leave the hydrangea where it is. Once it has
recuperated from being transplanted, and you maintain consistent
soil moisture, it will be fine. Mulch the root zone.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rains also helped the snail and slug populations in
our garden. Perhaps these pests have found their way into your
shrub, especially if thick, lush growth at the base offers an
invitation. There are slug and snail baits available at garden
centers, or you could use diatomaceous earth, also found at
nurseries, or even ground eggshells to discourage the pests.

   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers may take it for everyday. But the menu at
a restaurant like Tropica is a global snapshot. There are conch
from Mexico, John Dory from Australia and pompano from South
America. A walk though a good fish market is no less extraordinary
_ like an art exhibition with works collected from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The fish, a stunning display of glistening specimens, do come
from all over the world. There may be red snapper from New Zealand,
with eyes so alive that you think the fish may jump if you touch
it. Or sardines from Portugal stacked like silver rods. And you
will almost always find sushi-quality tuna from the Gulf of Mexico,
as red as a rose petal, shrouded in white ice.
</P>
<P>
   These fish are in such pristine condition that it is hard to
believe that many of them were caught in a far-off sea and
transported across the world, making their way to a restaurant or
fish market in no more time than it takes to get from a hotel in
Auckland to an apartment in Manhattan. No longer does a diner have
to fly to the Mediterranean to savor rouget or branzino. The fish
comes to us. And home cooks have benefited as much as
restaurantgoers as the exotic becomes the everyday in good markets.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, this simply was not possible. Fish from Italy
or New Zealand may have made it to New York. But you might not have
wanted to eat them by the time they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, though, the stars in the world of fish
realigned: Transportation became much more sophisticated, importers
got savvy, and chefs seemed to acquire an almost ecstatic
enthusiasm for new varieties. Today, on restaurant menus, hamachi
from New Zealand, opah from Hawaii, rouget from the Mediterranean
and branzino from Greece have become as familiar as cod or striped
bass from New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to get all the exciting fish, we need to get it from
outside the country,'' said Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin.
``It's an excitement,'' he said, when he finds a fish he hasn't
worked with before. ``I feel like a little kid at Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Diners experience the same kind of excitement when they discover
that cockles from New Zealand are tender and sweet, maybe even
tastier than New England clams; that dourade from the Mediterranean
is delicate, much like porgy. Discovering new tastes is why we go
to restaurants in the first place, and why we follow the chefs'
lead at home. But the real surprise is that although a fish comes
from distant waters, it is hardly more expensive than high-quality
halibut or tuna. It is, after all, fish, not caviar.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers weren't always so interested in what lay beyond the
Eastern Seaboard. Chefs, in particular, were spoiled by an ocean
brimming with fish and constrained by a culinary tradition that
settled for the ordinary or the frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Flying Foods, an importer in New York,
initiated a change in the industry by shipping then-exotic fresh
fish like Dover sole into the United States. Others began to see
the lucrative possibilities of a world fresh-fish trade.
Restaurants like Le Bernardin took risks by serving unfamiliar fish
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the demand for fish was steadily increasing.
People were traveling around the world, tasting fish and shellfish
and coming back asking for them at restaurants and fish markets.
</P>
<P>
   But delivering on those requests wasn't so simple. In some
cases, chefs got in touch with fishermen across the world that they
had met on their travels and persuaded them to send them fish. In
others, chefs encouraged dealers at the Fulton Fish Market to
search for varieties for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a progressive kind of improvement over the last
five years,'' said Costas Spiliadis, the owner of Estiatorio Milos,
a restaurant specializing in fish in midtown. More affordable cargo
flights from all parts of the world, with more efficient ground
transportation from ports to airports, have transformed the
business. The introduction of refrigerated trucks in places like
Tunisia and Greece in the last few years, Spiliadis said, has
altered their markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in some cases, it is even quicker and hardly more expensive
to import fish from abroad than to buy domestic products. Red
snapper trucked from Florida, said David Samuels, the owner of Blue
Ribbon Fish Co., a fish seller at the Fulton Fish Market, takes 18
hours and costs 20 cents a pound. Red snapper flown all the way
from Rio de Janeiro takes half the time and costs 50 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   But time is not the whole story. ``Then it's the whole issue of
communication,'' Spiliadis said. ``I can directly communicate by
phone with the captain in the boat while he's fishing in the Greek
islands, and he's telling me, `I'm getting a big catch of
langoustines,' or `I'm getting a big catch of dourade.' So I know
what he's sending me. All these things were just unheard of five
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also emerging as a source, with Web sites
linking commercial fisheries and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have realized they can get more money for their fish
if it is in good condition. Many are getting away from catching
fish by net and converting to line fishing, which batters the fish
less. They are investing in boats with refrigerated hulls, so that
the fish is kept cold from the moment it comes out of the water,
and they are no longer going out for days before getting their
catch to shore and on the way to market.
</P>
<P>
   For fishmongers and chefs, securing fish from all over the world
these days is actually the easy part. What's difficult is obtaining
superior quality. While the fish business has become a more global
enterprise, it also remains astonishingly small _ and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always 10 more restaurants or merchants looking for
the fish than they are able to supply,'' Spiliadis said of
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fisherman catching hamachi in New Zealand thinks his
product is going to be treated with respect by a purveyor or chef,
no price can be placed on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the good fish is highly allocated,'' said Rocco Dispirito,
the chef at Union Pacific. He buys some from Louis Rozzo, an owner
of F. Rozzo &AMP; Sons, a 100-year-old company at the Fulton Fish
Market that buys from 150 suppliers. ``He just wants to know that
we know he goes the extra mile, and that we validate that,''
Dispirito added
</P>
<P>
   With great fish, that usually means cooking it simply so that
the essential flavor remains the most powerful element of the dish.
With many of these fish, particularly the European varieties that
can be cooked whole, the easiest cooking method is the best: Season
the fish, sprinkle it with a little oil and either grill it or
roast it in a 450-degree oven. Fillets can simply be seared.
</P>
<P>
   It is senseless to do anything more. These fish have their own
flavors. Branzino, for instance, is like wild striped bass but with
a much more delicate flesh. Hamachi is tuna on a higher plane, with
a texture that feels like butter in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   For chefs with well-tuned palates, getting fish with such varied
flavors is worth any effort.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships they must develop with suppliers take years to
cultivate. Twenty years ago, when Spiliadis opened his first
restaurant in Montreal, he said he was unable to buy great fish in
Canada. Frustrated, he borrowed a waiter's Impala and drove to New
York. For a week straight he went to the Fulton market trying to
persuade Samuels to sell to him. ``I begged him night and night and
night to begin working with him,'' said Spiliadis.
</P>
<P>
   The begging paid off. For months Spiliadis drove the Impala
twice a week to the market to pick up his fish. Eventually, he had
to buy the Impala from the waiter, but he no longer needs to go to
such lengths. He now buys enough fish to have it shipped and
delivered to his restaurants in Montreal and Manhattan. Along the
way, Spiliadis has sought out sources for Samuels, for
Mediterranean fish and shellfish like pagrus, a fish similar to red
snapper but meatier, octopus, dourade royale and loup de mer. And
in return Samuels has made sure Spiliadis gets the best quality
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most fish sellers and chefs _ at small bistros and
four-star restaurants alike _ know to nurture these kinds of
relationships, but few rely on just one supplier. Finding fish is a
continuously evolving project. Chefs may have a friend in Montauk,
N.Y., who sends local fish directly during the summer or a single
source for Hawaiian fish and a supplier like Samuels or Rozzo for
the bulk of their fish. Ripert, for instance, has a dozen
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a new product, Dispirito said, ``creates excitement in
the kitchen, it creates excitement on the floor, it creates
excitement with guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why chefs are always on the lookout for something new.
Dispirito is on a mission to import Norwegian skrei, a fish similar
to cod but with a slightly oilier flesh. Ripert is trying to get
Pacific fish from a top Asian supplier, no mean feat.
</P>
<P>
   Both, of course, are sure they will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   So are their teams of suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10,'' Rozzo said, ``if it's swimming in the
ocean and people are catching it and selling it, we'll be able to
find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Top Markets
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, fish stores are like jewelry stores, with
colorful, sparkling displays of the world's rarest and most
precious catches. Here are some of the best shops:
</P>
<P>
   CITARELLA, 2135 Broadway (75th Street), (212) 874-0383, and 1313
Third Ave. (75th Street), (212) 874-0383. A good selection of
European imports like branzino, turbot and sardines, as well as New
Zealand specialties like green-lipped mussels and cockles. The
choice is best on weekends. Special orders are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   PISACANE MIDTOWN, 940 First Ave. (52nd Street), (212) 752-7560.
A vast variety, from John Dory and rouget from Europe to sea bass
and red snapper from South America.
</P>
<P>
   ROSEDALE FISH MARKET, 1129 Lexington Ave. (79th Street), (212)
288-5013. Called the Tiffany of fish markets, Rosedale carries a
huge selection from around the world. More than 20 varieties of
whole fish _ from carp to branzino _plus shellfish, fish salads and
even poached large fish.
</P>
<P>
   WILD EDIBLES, 255 Elizabeth St. (Houston Street), (212)
625-9971. In the world of fish, this store is the last word. You
may find elephant fish from Chile one day and dourade royal from
Israel the next. The store has the largest selection of fresh
oysters in the city. And if you don't know what to do with the
picorocos, there is always a chef on hand for consultation.

USING THE INTERNET TO WATCH THE KIDS WHILE YOU ARE AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>

 By AMY SCHLEIN   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Like many parents, Sheeda Ferguson misses
her 2-year-old son Blake while she's at work.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the pangs of separation, she keeps a bulletin board with
photos of him at her desk at the law firm where she is a legal
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But even better, Ferguson can look in on Blake any time she
wants during the day. On-site day care? No _ Web-site day care.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Beginnings, the private, in-home day care Blake attends,
has four Web cameras monitoring play areas. Every 15 seconds,
throughout the day, a Web camera captures images of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can dial up the password-protected Web site and peek in
on their children as often as they want. They can leave a small
window up on their computer screen while they work, seeing a
constantly updated image. And they can send e-mails to the day care
to let them know they're watching, and the children can wave back.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Web camera that drew Ferguson to Bright Beginnings,
but it wasn't the only reason she chose the day care. She liked Liz
Pivnarick, the care provider, and it was convenient to her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the factors that put her on top, though,'' she
said. ``It gives me a great peace of mind to be able to check on
him, and look in on him during the day. And it absolutely makes me
more trusting of Liz. She can't hide anything, the camera is always
on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said she looks in three to four times a day.
</P>
<P>
   There are four camera views at the day care. Two are in the
backyard, two in the playroom. So the children are visible at all
times: eating, napping, painting, story time and playtime.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras have been around for several years, with various
uses, such as weather cams showing surf and ski conditions and
sites with cameras focused on popular tourist attractions.
High-tech offices use them for video conferencing, and their widest
use of all is probably in the adult entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Digital day care centers are multiplying in places like Silicon
Valley, and larger cities. The trend is expected to grow as the
country becomes more tapped into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the trend grows so, too, do concerns over privacy _ both that
of the providers and the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you would live differently with a camera watching,''
said Carrie Anabo of the Community Child Care Council of Sonoma
County, a referral and resource center.
</P>
<P>
   Pivnarick said she has heard a lot of negative reactions about
Web cameras in day care settings, all from other providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all felt like it was an invasion of their privacy,'' she
said. ``But for us, it wasn't a matter of security or a way to keep
an eye on us, it was just a neat thing, to let the parents be in
touch with their kid's day.''
</P>
<P>
   She said while it felt a little strange to be on camera all the
time at first, she's gotten used to it.
</P>
<P>
   As for the children's privacy, Pivnarick said she doesn't
consider that an issue. ``These are 2-year-olds,'' she said. ``If
they're aware of it at all, they're saying `Hi' to mommy, and they
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said she doesn't feel surveillance has a negative
impact on Blake, making him feel he's constantly watched. Rather,
she said, it makes him feel as though she's with him throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's neat that Mommy watches him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pivnarick said there is one situation where she doesn't allow
the cameras. She cares for an 11-year-old handicapped child, and
makes sure she is out of camera range when she changes the child's
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to privacy issues, there may be other downsides. Win
Cary, a child care provider and officer with the Childcare
Association of Sonoma County said one concern with Web-patrolled
day care is cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Childcare providers are notoriously low-paid, with long hours
and no benefits,'' she said. ``Their ability to invest in this is a
real issue. ... It's certainly not going to be possible for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pivnaricks system required an investment of about $4,000 and
includes an IBM Pentium-II server, an ISDN modem, an ISDN line, an
ISDN dial-up account, four Web cameras, 100-base T-network hub and
cards and the domain registration for their site.
</P>
<P>
   The system could be cheaper. A Web camera can be set up with any
personal computer running an operating systems that has FTP
capability (file transfer protocol, the standard way of uploading
files). Also needed is Internet access and the hardware: the camera
_ which could be a regular video camera, some digital cameras or
any number of Web cameras _ and a video capture card for the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Web cameras often come with software applications that
allow users to set up an automatic FTP, or software is easily found
on the Internet. The computer expertise to be able to set this up,
though, is probably the most important element _ and the hardest to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   Parents looking into day care facilities with Web cameras will
want the most efficient browser to see the site with, and should
make sure the site is password protected.
</P>
<P>
   The Pivnaricks think the money they put into their system was
well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line costs a couple of hundred dollars a month,''
Pivnarick said. ``But it's a good investment. I'm always full, and
I get three, four calls a day, looking for day care.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no extra fee for the day care's Web service. Parents
pay about $125 a week. And Pivnarick's day care is thriving with 17
children, although not all at the same time. Most are between 1{-
to 5-years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents tell me that when they interviewed with other
providers, they'll decide to go with us because of the Web
camera,'' Pivnarick said. ``They know we don't have anything to
hide. Even parents without Internet access, who can't use the Web
site, feel like their child is safe here.''

strikes and a seemingly endless stream of ethnic Albanian refugees
leaving Kosovo, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov meets with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in a desperate effort to
bring the defiant Serb leader back to the negotiating table on a
peace agreement and bring a halt to Europe's biggest humanitarian

   KOSOVO-MILITARY _ WASHINGTON _ As NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia enter their second week on Wednesday, the mission is
shifting dramatically from a surgical campaign targeting equipment
and buildings to a harrowing assault on flesh and bone. With the
introduction of the supersonic B-1 and its cargo of armor-piercing
cluster bombs, ground-buzzing A-10 tank busters and possibly even
Apache attack helicopters, NATO is taking its punches directly to
the battlefield. After a week in which Serb troops and thugs have
had a free hand to rampage across the towns and villages of Kosovo,
the landscape is about to change. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

they worry that events could widen and spillover to their area.

used to being the rock of their families, in tears after being

   LEVITT _ WASHINGTON _ SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, as expected,

   SOCIAL-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ The healthy economy has pushed
the expected bankruptcy date of Social Security back by two years,
to 2034, and that of Medicare by seven years, to 2015. The new

reformers would see the task of reforming the programs as less

pursued so vigorously on corruption charges while still in office.
Analysts say the Mexicans aim to make a point -- high-ranking
policitians involved in drug trafficking can no longer count on
impunity. The governor, Mario Villanueva, says he's the victim of
political vendetta. He is testifying behind closed doors in Mexico
today. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SUFFERS ANOTHER BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court dealt affirmative action another
blow on Monday, continuing the national trend of giving up on
efforts to remedy discrimination through racial and gender
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The justices refused to review a lower court decision that held
unconstitutional an 11-year-old Dallas plan permitting black,
Hispanic and female members of the Fire Department to be promoted
over others even if they earned lower scores on written tests. The
5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans concluded that
achieving diversity through preferential treatment violated the
constitutional equal protection rights of firefighters who are
white and American Indian men.
</P>
<P>
   Although the justices did not explain their decision, it fit a
pattern of the past few years in which they have been backing away
from aggressive programs to achieve diversity in education and the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs have fallen from favor all over the country, as
white males have successfully claimed that reverse bias
artificially and unfairly blocks their own prospects of
advancement.
</P>
<P>
   But we still need safeguards against reverting to the bad old
days when white males promoted other white males and women and
racial minorities were bypassed. We are not yet a gender neutral or
colorblind society.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, for instance, the prestigious Massachusetts
Institute of Technology confessed that female professors there
suffer from pervasive discrimination in hiring, awards, promotions,
inclusion on important committees and allocation of research
resources. MIT wasn't simply being politically correct; it was
acknowledging the results of a five-year study of women in its
school of science.
</P>
<P>
   The gender discrimination at MIT is real and well-documented,
but it is the result of subtle cultural patterns rather than an
overt campaign to downgrade women. This is harder to fight than the
brutal racial segregation of old that forbade blacks access to
public facilities or the legally endorsed inferior status of women
that kept them out of professions and denied them economic
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, affirmative action plans that confronted
discrimination by applying easier job or educational qualifications
to minorities seemed like the only way to correct bias. The
reasoning was that blacks and women who had been denied equal
exposure to the workplace and equal opportunities to learn could
not be expected to compete intellectually at the same level as
white males.
</P>
<P>
   Schools and employers in search of diversity often applied
separate criteria for test scores and other measures of ability,
admitting, hiring and promoting minorities ahead of whites who
tested better and had stronger credentials. Individual merit became
almost irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Dallas Fire Department did. The court is
technically correct; unfair favoritism is unfair favoritism, no
matter how noble the social goal. Guaranteeing the equal right to
buy or rent a nice house does not mean those once discriminated
against should get it at half-price.
</P>
<P>
   But to abandon the concept of affirmative action altogether
would be a terrible mistake. Deceitfully, some conservatives
contend that individuals given unfair preference for which they are
unqualified are harmed psychologically and lulled into becoming
lazy.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. This is an elitist assumption that disadvantaged people
prefer to remain in their disadvantaged condition.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Hispanic enrollment plummeted when the University of
California and the University of Texas ended admission preferences.
This is tragic. We cannot maintain a tolerant society if only young
whites are well-educated and grow accustomed to dealing only with
people who look like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? The Supreme Court is clearly not prepared to help
us out of this cultural puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that minorities and women will just have to work harder
and get smarter is not the answer. It trivializes the heavy burden
imposed on individuals by a pattern of social discrimination they
alone cannot break.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment programs that reach out to nontraditional candidates
in unfamiliar neighborhoods and situations do help, if in only a
limited way.
</P>
<P>
   To survive legally, affirmative action should apply only when
there are candidates of roughly similar qualifications. Race or
gender to add diversity can be a legitimate factor if there are,
say, four jobs and 14 candidates with competitive credentials.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it is desirable _ no, essential, actually, for
national unity and stability _ to look for that extra element to
make the school or the workplace more inclusive.

COLUMN: SEPARATING THE MAN FROM HIS ACTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, April 6)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably long after we forget who won which Academy Awards this
year, we'll remember who stood and who didn't for Elia Kazan. This
year there was more to talk about than bum jokes and collagen lips
while we watched Hollywood honor itself.
</P>
<P>
   We got into something real here _ a man who gave his friends up
during the McCarthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   How desperate or scared would you have to be to snitch on a
friend? Could you do it knowing that friend would definitely lose
his or her job? And never work again? And maybe feel so despondent
he'd kill himself? How could you stand yourself?
</P>
<P>
   But what if in saving yourself you went on to do important,
beautiful things that contributed to human enlightenment and
compassion?
</P>
<P>
   OK, but wouldn't you have to say, at some time, ``I'm sorry''?
</P>
<P>
   Even ordinary people tend to have their disappointing traits as
well as their lovable ones, but famous people fall with such a
splat.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who watch and shake our heads in disapproval,
their screwing up provides some balance to their exceptional
talent. We'll never match them in creativity and brilliance, but at
least we would never rat on a friend. Or be a mommy dearest. Or
have an affair with an intern and lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kazan question _ how to enjoy the work of a person but still
not want the person over for dinner _ is something we encounter all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Woody Allen. Many of us adored the man and his movies
until he took off with his step-daughter. We still had ``Annie
Hall'' and ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' but the man was dead to us.
Well, at least we didn't think he was funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But then some of us began to miss his neurotic, zany discussions
and sneaked out and rented ``Everyone Says I Love You'' and it had
its moments. Lately, we can allow that as time has passed, he and
the young woman appear to have a healthy relationship. So, maybe we
go back to appreciating him, in part. But he's still a schmuck.
</P>
<P>
   Same with Bill Clinton. Strong president, weak man. Stunningly
disappointing. Does having an affair get in the way of being
president? Probably not, although if it distracts the president and
the country for a year or more, it makes it difficult to separate
the two. And it would be nice if our president was an all-around
good guy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Elia Kazan's offense is more Linda Tripp-like than
Clinton-like, which makes it even more interesting because it's
about the betrayal of a friend, an act that people find more
loathsome than, say, lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of balancing the good with the bad, Kazan had ``On the
Waterfront,'' ``Splendor in the Grass,'' ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' to his credit. Linda Tripp has yet to reveal her
flattering side.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there isn't sufficient enough to overcome. A professor
once put down the notion that there's something commendable in
everyone, using the ludicrous: ``They say Hitler was a good
dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking it from that extreme, what if something beneficial to
humanity had come out of Hitler's madness? What if one of the
monsters in his experimental hospitals had developed a cure for
cancer?
</P>
<P>
   What if a killer in Kosovo ends up writing incredible poetry?
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Ware is a college instructor in Santa Rosa, Calif.,
whose father was a communist organizer in New York City, which she
writes about in the anthology ``Red Diapers: Growing Up in the
Communist Left.'' She remembers how people were hounded and
constantly feared arrest, how family members were tailed by FBI
agents while she was being assigned in school to write reports on
the menace of American communism.
</P>
<P>
   Her father believed that communism would end racism and classism
in America. When black families were kicked out of their apartments
he'd help move them back in.
</P>
<P>
   Had she been at the Oscars she would not have stood to applaud
Kazan when he got his Lifetime Achievement Award, but neither would
she have sat silent with her arms folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that easy,'' she said. ``Nothing is that pat or
simple. We are so flawed as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Government employees, including teachers, have to sign loyalty
oaths today. What would happen if some extremist type whipped up
enough hysteria about national security that a first-grade teacher
was pressured to snitch on the second-grade teacher?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should have given Kazan the Lifetime Artistic Award
instead of Lifetime Achievement Award. It wasn't his life that
people want to celebrate as much as his art, which was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   He could have said, ``I'm sorry for whatever pain I caused.
Those were lousy times and you're lucky you didn't have to live
them. You need to make sure it never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who tried to squelch debate over Kazan said that we have
to separate the artist from his politics. There are also those who
say we have to separate the politician from his or her private
life. Same for separating the superior athlete from the way he
treats women.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that a character flaw should not erase a body of
work. But neither should a body of work erase a person's character.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the package. We all learn from it.

<P>
   SHARP DRIVING _ Technology is an ongoing process, with one
innovation often leading to another. Nowhere is that more apparent
than in the automotive industry. First there were anti-lock braking
systems, followed by traction control systems. Now the industry is
offering stability control systems. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). Includes 1-column color photograph of

<P>
   NEWINDUSTRY _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes will give
Georgia Tech the resources it needs to double its computer science
graduates by 2001. The action was prompted by ISS, Nortel Networks
and Checkfree, who told the governor they want to expand in Atlanta
but are desperate to find software engineers. The three companies
will send executives to Georgia Tech to teach part time and have
agreed to hire at least 40 percent of the new graduates in computer
science. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-STOCK _ A day after Coca-Cola announced disappointing
beverage volume numbers for the first quarter, its stock was down 4
percent (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   NEWHOUSES _ Atlanta led the nation in permits for new houses in
1998, breaking its own 1997 record in the process, and logged in
nearly four times more permits than Indianapolis, which ranked 6th.
(Harte, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   BELLSOUTH-INTERNET _ BellSouth offers cheaper Internet access in
Florida and other southeastern states to customers who sign up for
a complete local-telephone package of services. BellSouth.net
costs$12.95 a month _ compared with the standard $19.95 _ for
customers who also sign up for the Complete Choice package, which
includes up to 20 features such as caller ID and call-waiting. The
package averages about $30 a month (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   NETBANK-DIRECTO _ The CEO who created NetBank and made it into a
thriving all-Internet bank is moving over to a new company called
Directo, owned and run by the same folks as NetBank (Including
former secretary of state Lewis Massey). He will run sales for the
company that is in the business of computer generated debit cards
that experts believe will be the next wave of credit/debit cards.
These are different from existing cards in that you can stick them
into a slot on any Internet enabled machine and use them to pay for
and authorize access to your e-mail, bank account, etc. (Katz,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   NET-RATINGS _ Nielsen Net-Ratings enters Web measurement field,
putting them head to head with Media Metrix/Relevant Knowledge
(based in Atlanta and New York) How Nielsen stacks up to Media
Metrix and if MM sees Nielsen as a threat or healthy competition.
(Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CELLDEVICES-ATLANTA _ Atlanta, with the highest penetration of
cellular devices of any city in the country, has hundreds, perhaps
thousands of cell towers, but nobody knows where they all are.
These towers are in the news now because many of them have been
sold to a company which will lease them back to their original
owners and others for big bucks. The sales brought in nearly $1
billion for the sellers and will bring in more than that in revenue
to the buyer. How valuable are these towers, how do they work, and
why don't we know where they are? (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   STOCK-FRAUD _ Peter Tosto, aka Lybrand, lately of Madison, Ga.,
has been caught selling fraudulent stocks more than once in the
past. In fact, he's pleaded guilty to same and been fined by the
Justice Department and the SEC. Why has that fine not been
collected? What kind of relationship does he have with the SEC that
keeps the agency at bay? Or what kind of enforcement power does the
SEC have in cases like this and is it adequate to protect
stockholders from fraudulent companies? (Clothier, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Personal finance advice. This week: How much do I
need to put away if I want a long, comfortable retirement? (Ezell,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-DRIVE _ The best way to approach BMW's new M Coupe is with
your eyes shut and your bank account open. (DeVault, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ There is probably more diversity in the methods
used to accomplish stability control than in the previous two
technological steps that preceded it: anti-lock brakes and traction
control. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   THE-MECHANIC _ Questions and answers about auto electrical
systems. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED SUNDAY.

   NEWINDUSTRY _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes will give
Georgia Tech the resources it needs to double its computer science
graduates by 2001. The action was prompted by ISS, Nortel Networks
and Checkfree, who told the governor they want to expand in Atlanta
but are desperate to find software engineers. The three companies
will send executives to Georgia Tech to teach part time and have
agreed to hire at least 40 percent of the new graduates in computer
science. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   NETBANK-DIRECTO _ The CEO who created NetBank and made it into a
thriving all-Internet bank is moving over to a new company called
Directo, owned and run by the same folks as NetBank (Including
former secretary of state Lewis Massey). He will run sales for the
company that is in the business of computer generated debit cards
that experts believe will be the next wave of credit/debit cards.
These are different from existing cards in that you can stick them

<P>
   CELLDEVICES-ATLANTA _ Atlanta, with the highest penetration of
cellular devices of any city in the country, has hundreds, perhaps
thousands of cell towers, but nobody knows where they all are.
These towers are in the news now because many of them have been
sold to a company which will lease them back to their original
owners and others for big bucks. The sales brought in nearly $1
billion for the sellers and will bring in more than that in revenue
to the buyer. How valuable are these towers, how do they work, and
why don't we know where they are? (Kanell, Atlanta

   STOCK-FRAUD _ Peter Tosto, aka Lybrand, lately of Madison, Ga.,
has been caught selling fraudulent stocks more than once in the

Justice Department and the SEC. Why has that fine not been
collected? What kind of relationship does he have with the SEC that
keeps the agency at bay? Or what kind of enforcement power does the
SEC have in cases like this and is it adequate to protect
stockholders from fraudulent companies? (Clothier, Atlanta

 &HT;    UConn's win not magical, just methodical
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Late Monday night, some were looking for
a magical reason why Connecticut was able to knock off top-ranked
Duke, 77-74, and capture the first NCAA men's basketball
championship in school history. They looked for something,
anything, to explain how the Huskies, a decided underdog, were able
to beat the apparently-unbeatable Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   How about this one? UConn was a better team with a better plan
that simply outplayed what was supposed to be a team for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing magical about what UConn did to Duke, which
had its 32-game winning streak snapped. The Huskies, coach Jim
Calhoun admitted afterwards, started working on their game plan for
Duke back in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my free time, I watch a lot of games and take a lot of
notes,'' said Calhoun, who won his first national title after 27
years as a head coach. ``I started watching Duke and writing down
things a long time ago just in case we ever got a chance to play
them down the road. And frankly, our kids hoped that we would.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time UConn (34-2) got to St. Petersburg, Calhoun's Duke
file was pretty full. This players executed the plan to perfection
and dominated the Blue Devils in every phase of the game:
</P>
<P>
   _ On defense they held the Blue Devils to a season-low 41.1
percent shooting. Calhoun's defensive scheme on All-America center
Elton Brand was brilliant because it allowed the Huskies to
double-team Brand inside without giving up easy shots on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   _ On offense, UConn shot 52.5 percent (32 of 61) from the floor.
The only other team to shoot over 50 percent against Duke all
season was Cincinnati, which shot 57 percent in Duke's only other
loss on Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Huskies out-rebounded Duke by 10, 41-31, and turned 12
turnovers into 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ UConn got 17 points and eight rebounds from its bench. Duke
got only eight points from its reserves, all from freshman Corey
Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke our defense down. And really, a team hasn't broken
our defense down all year,'' said junior forward Chris Carrawell.
``They are a great, great team.''
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, UConn won the game because of something it
didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   So many times this season, Duke would literally force teams to
retreat with their constant pressure and talent. During the course
of the game with Duke, UConn had a number of chances to wilt. It
never did.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn clinging to a 75-74 lead, Augusta's Ricky Moore went
toe-to-toe against Duke's Trajan Langdon and forced him into a
walking violation with 5.4 seconds left. The play will define this
game for all time and take a permanent place on the highlight reel
of historic Final Four moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not back down from Duke,'' said Moore. ``We knew that
everybody was ready to put them on the all-time team list. In a
game like this, you don't back down. You stand up to the opponent.
That's exactly what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have a good chance to returning to the Final Four,
which will be held in Indianapolis in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   UConn loses Moore and probably junior Richard Hamilton, the
Final Four's most outstanding player with 27 points, who will
surely jump to the NBA. Point guard Khalid El-Amin, for all his
clutch plays down the stretch of the game, should stay. The Huskies
have a strong recruiting class coming in, led by 6-3 yard Tony
Robertson, who is compared to former UConn All-American Ray Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Duke played five sophomores, a junior, and a freshman in Monday
night's championship game and has the nation's best recruiting
class coming in. Langdon is the only senior who got minutes in the
game. Brand, the national player of the year, will decide in the
coming days if he will return to Duke. If he does, Duke will likely
begin the 1999-2000 season ranked No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta's William Avery, a sophomore guard who has dropped hints
about jumping to the NBA, had his weaknesses exposed in the Final
Four. In two games, Avery hit only nine of 26 shots with five
assists. If he returns, he'll probably move to the shooting guard
position to make way for highly-regarded freshman Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both teams played hard, but Connecticut played
harder,'' said Avery. ``Hopefully, there will be better days
ahead.''

 &HT;    QB Dunn among three to leave Longhorns
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Adam Dunn, enticed by the guarantee that he'll
be holding a bat on a major-league diamond in September instead of
wearing headsets on the Royal-Memorial Stadium sideline, left the
Longhorns on Monday to play full-time for the Cincinnati Reds
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``They guaranteed me a September callup,'' said Dunn, who also
got his original signing bonus of $772,000 (over five years)
sweetened significantly. ``That was the key factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn _ projected as the backup for starting quarterback Major
Applewhite _ wasn't the only Longhorn to announce his departure on
Monday. Backup fullback Josh Spoerl and reserve halfback Eric Tasby
also were granted scholarship releases and intend to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Tasby, a sophomore from Corpus Christi Carroll, was beaten out
by Hodges Mitchell and Victor Ike. Spoerl, a junior from North
Mesquite, was running behind Ricky Brown and Chris Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dunn will likely report to extended spring training in
two weeks and be assigned to either of the Reds' Class A farm clubs
in Burlington, Iowa, or Charleston, W. Va., Cincinnati General
Manager Jim Bowden promised the 6-foot-5-inch, 240-pound
power-hitting outfielder a spot on the major-league roster when it
expands to 40 players on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made him an offer he couldn't refuse,'' said Dunn's
mother, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been substantial. Austin Kearns, whom the Reds
selected with the seventh pick in the first round _ the spot where
they would have likely taken Dunn had he opted for baseball only
and not already been selected by another team_ received a $1.95
million deal. Though a second-round pick, Dunn received a signing
bonus commensurate with selection late in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was so sweet that Dunn said he might have left even if
he had been starting for the Longhorns. ``It would have been a lot
harder to take it,'' he said. ``Still, I would have had to consider
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfishly, I am disappointed to lose as quality of a football
player and person as Adam,'' Coach Mack Brown said. ``The
Cincinnati Reds have offered him a terrific opportunity and one
that if he was my son I would have to advise him to take advantage
of.''
</P>
<P>
   With the transfer of sophomore Greg Cicero after last season,
Dunn entered the spring as the backup and the only player other
than Applewhite on the Horns' roster who was recruited as a
quarterback (two others, incoming freshmen Chris Simms and Adam
Hall, will join the team in the fall). Brown told Dunn he would
have a chance to win the starting job only if Applewhite got hurt
or struggled, which did not happen. Dunn visited the Reds' spring
training headquarters in Sarasota, Fla., during UT's spring break
before returning for the last week of spring football, in which he
received a trial at tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the move to tight end was not a factor in his choice _
his mother said ``it helped in the decision'' _ though he had told
Bowden when he signed with the Reds in June 1998 that he would play
baseball full-time if the Texas coaches tried to switch him to
tight end, which was where many recruiting experts figured he would
play.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked the sixth-best prospect in the Reds' organization, Dunn
hit .288 with 13 RBIs and four home runs in an abbreviated season
for the Reds' Billings, Mont., rookie-league team last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realized that by doing both sports, he could delay
the inevitable, and that is being a big-time power guy in the big
leagues,'' agent Brian Peters of Houston told the Cincinnati
Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dunn was not on scholarship _ the Reds were paying his
way at UT and will continue to do so, should he choose to finish
his education _ the departure of Spoerl and Tasby puts the Horns
one scholarship under the limit of 85.
</P>
<P>
   Spoerl, recruited as a middle linebacker, saw limited time as a
backup his first two seasons before being switched to fullback
midway through the spring. He said he will transfer to a NCAA
Division I-AA school so he will be eligible immediately, and said
joining his younger brother, Jacob, at Texas A&AMP;M-Commerce is a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart has always been at linebacker,'' Spoerl said. ``For
me to play linebacker, I had to transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tasby redshirted his freshman season and worked with the scout
teams last fall. He quickly fell behind Mitchell and Ike and, with
the addition of several highly touted halfback recruits in the
fall, didn't figure to get any playing time. Tasby said he hadn't
decided where he would transfer.

 &HT;    UT's money manager to disclose investments
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Responding to critics, the board that manages
$12.5 billion in public university money agreed Monday to be less
secretive about its higher-risk investments.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas Investment Management Co., a private
corporation the Legislature created in 1995, told lawmakers Monday
that when making future investments with riskier private firms, it
would name all principals, or individual managers, and would
disclose the annual rates of return.
</P>
<P>
   UTIMCO also is asking all of the private firms to which it has
already committed more than $1.6 billion to allow it to release
that information. Permission is needed because of signed
confidentiality agreements, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes a long way toward addressing my concerns,'' said
state Rep. Sylvester Turner, a Houston Democrat who criticized
UTIMCO's policies last week. ``This will provide some comfort as to
how public funds are being managed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, was
responding to a recent article in the Houston Chronicle that cited
alleged conflicts of interest involving UTIMCO Chairman Tom Hicks.
The article said Hicks, a Dallas investor who recently completed a
six-year term as a UT System regent, had directed $252 million to
private funds run by business associates and friends. Another $205
million went to funds run by major Republican donors, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
   The private investments are mainly limited partnerships that
invest in such things as venture capital firms and buyouts. Such
investments have complex business structures, are not publicly
traded and are considered to be a higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   UT System Chancellor William Cunningham, one of UTIMCO's nine
board members, defended Hicks and said he was confident no
conflicts occurred. Hicks was very supportive of the disclosure
changes, which the board approved in a special meeting Friday,
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who testified before the Appropriations Committee on
Monday, provided written testimony outlining the disclosure changes
but they were not discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A state auditor's report in 1996 warned that UTIMCO needed to
strengthen controls to avoid conflicts of interest with private
investments.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up audit will be done this year ``to see how these
funds are being managed and to see if they followed any of our
recommendations,'' audit manager Carol Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   UTIMCO hopes to increase its private investments to as much as
25 percent of the total funds it manages in five years, said Tom
Ricks, president and chief executive officer of UTIMCO.
</P>
<P>
   Ricks added that his organization will not sign any new
confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of
individual names and annual return rates.
</P>
<P>
   Certain other information, such as a firm's investment strategy,
will remain private because it could put the firm at a competitive
disadvantage, Ricks said.

 &HT;    DRUG TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATION INTO MEXICAN GOVERNOR HEATS UP
 &HT;    450&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican federal authorities are reportedly working
around the clock to prove that the governor of Quintana Roo state
-- home of the resort city Cancun -- has assisted some of this
country's biggest cocaine traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver a strong message that no politician is immune, the
Attorney General's office here would like to indict Gov. Mario
Villanueva before his term in office expires on April 5, sources
close to the investigation of the governor say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems very important that governors in Mexico now know that
impunity here is no longer absolute,'' added Guillermo Velasco,
president of Mexico United Against Delinquency, an anti-crime
organization in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spectacular case,'' Velasco said. ``It seems impossible
to me that they would have brought this case this far without good
proof.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Villanueva represents the first time that
federal authorities in Mexico have so vigorously pursued a governor
on corruption charges while he is still in office.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say to make a point, the investigation will continue
even if Villanueva is not indicted by April 5, but authorities
would like to charge him on corruption counts before he steps out
of office.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's justice system requires very strong proof and a judge's
consent to even indict a suspect, so the Attorney General's office
faces a difficult task in its case against Villanueva, Velasco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, a member of Mexico's ruling Revolutionary
Institutional Party, known as the PRI, has strongly denied
allegations that he has consorted with traffickers who use the
Caribbean state of Quintana Roo and Mexico's premiere resort city,
Cancun, as a base of operations. Villanueva is suspected of
allowing traffickers from a Juarez-based cartel to use the
governor's airport hanger in his state to unload and load cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   He is also believed to have offered protection to traffickers in
exchange for gifts, including a car and boats, which Villanueva
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Villanueva defied the Attorney General's
office by refusing to travel to Mexico City to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   After Villanueva challenged authorities to interview him in
Quintana Roo, they agreed to meet on the governor's home turf for
an interview that lasted more than 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Villanueva met again for another round of questioning
behind closed doors, this time in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva reportedly could face 28 allegations of consorting
with the trafficker Ramon Alcides Magana, known as ``El Metro,''
and other leaders of a cocaine cartel based in Juarez, a city on
Mexico's Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the Juarez cartel has moved much of its
operation to Cancun and Quintana Roo, which has become a virtual
``narco-state,'' according to sources following the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The state's long Caribbean coastline has become a prime
trans-shipment region for smuggling cocaine from South America into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel development in the area, too, has proved a reliable way
for traffickers to launder drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying widespread police protection in Quintana Roo,
traffickers are smuggling as much as 15 tons of cocaine a month
into the United States, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   This month, pro-Villanueva protesters gathered outside the
governor's office in the capital city of Chetumal in Quintana Roo
to show support for the embattled governor.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has claimed he is the victim of a political vendetta
because he belongs to a wing of the PRI that is in conflict with
Mexico's current president, Ernesto Zedillo.

 &HT;    A.S. Byatt possesses secret of literary success
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a crystalline spring day at Lullwater, the Emory
(University) president's mansion in Atlanta. Enormous, black-purple
irises have announced themselves in the back garden with the
intensity of a bowl of plums. In front, there's a fountain of
goldfish _ streaks of orange swimming through curtains of olive
murk. A black sedan screeches to a halt in the driveway, and a
wholly ordinary-looking woman steps out and pauses to smile at the
fish and sniff the air.
</P>
<P>
   She is A.S. Byatt, the Booker Prize-winning English novelist who
has become something of a rara avis on the literary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A deeply intellectual author with a magical gift for
storytelling, Byatt crafts gorgeously written books that become
best sellers. In town this week to deliver Emory University's
prestigious Richard Ellmann Lectures in Modern Literature, which
culminate tonight with a public reading, Byatt reluctantly agrees
to spend a day with a reporter. Gradually, she relaxes into herself
to unfurl the complex canvas of a mind bursting with poetry, art,
philosophy and opinion. Good gossip, too.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is a woman who went to school with
Oscar-winning actress Judi Dench, lunched regularly with Iris
Murdoch and once saw novelist E.M. Forster fall asleep at a dinner
party. This is also a woman who has had two marriages and four
children. Who almost died by electrocution in 1961, when she
touched an ungrounded refrigerator while trying to shoo a bird out
of her house. Who lost her 11-year-old son when he was struck by a
drunken driver, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 62, after steeping for years in a highly publicized
rivalry with her younger sibling, the novelist Margaret Drabble,
Byatt has discovered that writing well is the best revenge. Having
amassed an imaginative body of work that includes 10 books of
fiction and four of criticism, she is at the peak of her powers.
She says she has at least a dozen short stories and three more
novels in her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be Danielle Steel to make a very good
living,'' says Byatt, whose mood can switch from dark to light like
flickering shadows. Told that some Atlanta bookstores stock all her
titles, she is thrilled. ``That's rather like winning the lottery.
You can be very good and have that not happen. That's like living
in a fairy tale, because these are not mass-market books.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Antonia Susan Byatt seems to have spent her entire life
in a higher realm of thought. ``Right from the beginning, I sort of
lived in an imaginary world populated by all sorts of creatures and
people.'' Born into a stern Quaker family, Byatt took her
bachelor's degree at Cambridge. She is perhaps the only fiction
writer today who could embroider a resonant image of a bowl of
plums and lemons by weaving together references to T.S. Eliot, van
Gogh, Gauguin, Magritte, Vermeer, Velasquez, Rembrandt, Manet,
Balzac, Dickens, Flaubert, Sartre, Proust and the British food
writer Elizabeth David. (See the novel ``Still Life.'')
</P>
<P>
   She is equally at home writing masterpieces about modern
academics finding love in the ruins of Victorian poetry
(``Possession'') or precisely sculpted fairy tales (``The Djinn in
the Nightingale's Eye''). Embellishing her narratives with the
arcana of the natural sciences, she draws from a well of Western
literature that is deep and wide _ George Eliot, Willa Cather,
Jorge Luis Borges. ``The real English genius is twisting and
unexpected,'' she once wrote. She could have been describing
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, she plans to read from her new book of stories,
``Elementals'' (Random House, $22.95). With other stops scheduled
only for Washington and New York, her Emory visit is likely to be
Atlanta's literary event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So what's on her mind on this dazzling Sunday afternoon in town?
Roast pig, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   Prestigious lecture series
</P>
<P>
   Since its inauguration by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney in 1988,
the Ellmann lectures, named after the late professor and venerable
biographer of Joyce and Wilde, have become legendary in academic
circles. Though British novelist Anthony Burgess died before he
could fulfill his commitment (1992), other participants have
included critics Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1996) and Helen Vendler
(1994). They lectured, respectively, on Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka
and Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham, who in turn came to give
readings (Soyinka is now on the Emory faculty). As a distinguished
critic and writer, Byatt fits both categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.S. Byatt is one of the most formidably intellectual and
erudite writers of our time,'' Emory English professor Ron
Schuchard said, introducing her at her first lecture, a Sunday
afternoon gathering that drew scholars from Oxford University,
Chapel Hill and Dublin. ``She is a novelist who tells a good story,
a critic who shares with us the passion and power of her personal
engagement with language and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Her three academic lectures, which ended Tuesday, were titled
``Fathers, Forefathers, Ancestors: The Surprising Renaissance of
the British Historical Novel.'' They are scheduled for publication
by Harvard University Press in the fall of 2000. ``This has become
a very prestigious lectureship, because they have chosen people who
can speak to a broad audience as well as the academic world,'' says
Margaretta Fulton, the Harvard editor handling the book.
</P>
<P>
   All this made Schuchard's pig pull, a private affair Sunday at
Lullwater, a hot ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great mockery of the redneck professor having a pig
roast for the visiting dignitary,'' says Schuchard, adding more
coals and hickory wood to the pit. His bit of academic self-parody
included an invitation inscribed with a Latin homage to the pig:
Sues pacis in mundum solvite ut bona opera factum eant! (``Let
loose the hogs of peace upon the world to go and do their good
works!'') Pig Latin?
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a crisp, upper-crust accent, Byatt _ whose round
face and square fashion are a mixture of British novelist Anita
Brookner and ``Hazel'' actress Shirley Booth _ can be stiff. But
give her a chance, and the asperity turns to chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us about fellow classmate Dench. Turns out that Byatt
played Antonio to Dench's Ariel in their boarding school production
of ``The Tempest.'' ``She was terribly good, too,'' Byatt says
dryly.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing that really gets Byatt's goat is the fresh rumor
that Dench will play Iris Murdoch in a Hollywood adaptation of John
Bayley's ``Elegy for Iris.'' The memoir, by Murdoch's husband,
describes the brilliant novelist as she deteriorates from
Alzheimer's disease. Murdoch died in February. ``The odd thing is
that Judi could do Iris' voice perfectly, but that would make it
worse, not better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Murdoch, Byatt found a model for what a female novelist of
her generation might be, and she hasn't taken well to Bayley's
sentimental depiction of the genius. ``He was married to her for a
long time, and she loved him deeply, but he presented her as
slightly dotty and very unworldly.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was Murdoch really like?
</P>
<P>
   ``She was rather frightening, even at her best. . . . It was a
bit like talking to Socrates. She would grill you. She would ask
you a question about your life and you had to answer truthfully.
You felt that this person was staring at you, requiring you to be
absolutely accurate in your response. Then she would ask you a more
complicated, worse question. I never minded. But I would have felt
it was presumptuous to ask her any question. It was all rather one
way.''
</P>
<P>
   For a writer of such ambition, Byatt is a generous advocate of
other people's novels. So who's the greatest living novelist in
English?
</P>
<P>
   Saul Bellow, she says. Then there's Salman Rushdie, a close
friend. ``Toni Morrison is another writer I'd put there. I think
`Beloved' is one of the great masterpieces of our time.'' She's
also big on Canadian short story writer Alice Munro and British
novelist Penelope Fitzgerald, whose ``The Blue Flower'' won last
year's National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   What advice has she for aspiring writers?
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not be original if you haven't read everything and
seen what it is that you can do that nobody else is doing. That's
the key to it all. But once you've read something, you've got to
read everything, because otherwise you are influenced by the
`something.' You can't just decide to read Graham Greene and become
a novelist, because you'll end up like Graham Greene! You've got to
read everything that isn't like Graham Greene.''
</P>
<P>
   An interviewer points to a line in the final story of her new
book. ``The world is full of light and life, and the true crime is
not to be interested in it.'' Is this her credo of life?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of gulf between whether people are curious
about the world and whether they complain, really. . . . `They
ought to have made things better.' `They ought to have arranged it
so that my bones don't crack.' Whereas, I like people who are
interested in reasons why your bones are cracking. It makes life
better. They'll crack anyway.''

 &HT;    Bluesman Williams bloomed late _ but great
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Joe Williams got the blues, audiences knew they
were in for a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cordele native, born Joseph Goreed, rose to fame in the
mid-1950s as a featured vocalist in Count Basie's band and three
decades later enjoyed a recurring role on ``The Cosby Show.'' He
was the rare entertainer who kept entertaining almost to the end of
his very long life.
</P>
<P>
   Williams died Tuesday in Las Vegas after collapsing on the
street a few blocks from his home. He was 80. The singer had been
reported missing from a local hospital several miles away, where he
had been treated for a respiratory ailment, said his wife, Jillean.
She survives him, as does a son, Joe, and a daughter, Anne.
</P>
<P>
   Though born Dec. 12, 1918, in Cordele in Middle Georgia,
Williams came of age in Chicago, influenced by spirituals (his
mother played organ in a Methodist church) and leading a gospel
vocal group called the Jubilee Boys. It took years, and stints with
such bandleaders as Jimmy Noone, Andy Kirk, Albert Ammons/Pete
Johnson, Count Basie, Red Saunders and Lionel Hampton before
Williams got a slice of the limelight: a minor 1951 hit, with King
Kolax, called ``Everyday I Have the Blues.'' Four years later, he
hooked up with Basie again, and his silky yet spirited version of
the song helped carry Williams, and the Basie band, to
international prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Jazz Singers,'' critic Will Friedwald puts
Williams in perspective, comparing him with the much-loved Basie
vocalist Jimmy Rushing, who had preceded Williams in the band:
``Unlike Rushing, who seemed to spring fully grown out of the head
of Zeus, Williams was a late bloomer no one outside Chicago had
heard of until he was pushing 40 (most band vocalists became quick
celebs in their teens) and didn't become a truly great singer until
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Williams' achievements was that as the big band era
faded, he was able to continue as a solo artist, refining his voice
while rarely, if ever, seeming to miss an opportunity to revive the
brass, sass and sizzle of the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Even on ``Cosby,'' on which he played the comedian's
father-in-law, Williams was a sagacious presence, spinning yarns
from his Chicago youth. Onscreen as onstage, he projected a vigor
without which the blues could not be half as blue.

   ``This is beginning to get monotonous,'' Bates complained
Tuesday as the Alabama state Senate finally ended its quarrel over
how to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimonious special session was ordered Friday because the
majority-Democrat Senate had wasted 11 days of its regular session
doing nothing but bickering with its Republican leader and his
allies over how to conduct business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 House measures have piled up, including a
constitutional amendment to create a state lottery and a bill that
would allow video poker at Alabama's four dog tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives the Senate a framework for debate when the
regular session resumes April 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Republican Lt. Gov. Steve Windom feared someone from
Gov. Don Siegelman's Democratic majority might usurp his role as
presiding officer if he left to go to the bathroom. So, Windom
relieved himself into a jug under his podium _ this in the same
legislative chamber that requires men to wear coat and tie while on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' said Bates, 67. ``When people ask me
where I'm from, I tell them Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   After bursting a few of its seams, Senate decorum slowly eased
back into shape. Windom left the podium Monday. He returned to
applause as he wiped his hands on a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, senators were swapping compliments like
they were exchanging gifts at an office Christmas party. Members
who in previous days had shouted loud enough at each other to scare
small children now spread cordiality like a cold. Two senators said
they were ready to have Windom over for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The climactic session began at noon Monday. Senators recessed
three times _ including one break that coincided with the end of
the UConn-Duke national basketball championship game _ before
adjourning at 10:45 p.m. They met 86 minutes later at 12:01 a.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned how to do one thing _ recess,'' said George
Vest, the other security guard stationed on the ground floor of the
state house.
</P>
<P>
   When the hands of the dark, wood-trimmed clock behind the Senate
podium reached 3:50 a.m., the 35 senators finally had agreed on how
they would debate bills, appoint committees and record votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very tiring process,'' said Senate President
Pro Tem Lowell Barron, Windom's chief Democratic rival in the
Senate. ``But it's been a very worthwhile process because it's been
hammered on the anvil of equality.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, senators cloistered in small groups and
talked about the 45-page rules document. They inserted. They
deleted. Then they did it all again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep beating a dead horse, we might beat some life into
it,'' said Edward McClain, a Democratic Senator aligned with
Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   The yawn replaced the handshake as the greeting of choice. Staff
members passed around ice cream sandwiches to keep everyone going.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows how hard it is to discuss one word for two
hours,'' Barron said.
</P>
<P>
   With its navy-blue carpet, three oversized TV displays and
modular desks with built-in cupholders, the Alabama Senate chamber
feels more like a modern hotel lobby than a legislative hall. But
there's one thing forever ingrained: raw politics.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Siegelman took a final act as lieutenant governor
before moving to the governor's mansion. He organized the
Democratic-held Senate to give him the best odds of passing a
lottery bill he had advocated throughout his fall campaign. The
rules relegated Windom to little more than a Senate administrator.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of five Democrats and all 12 Republican
senators, Windom reclaimed power March 2. A friendly Democrat
offered a motion giving Windom authority to assign committees and
chairmen. On a voice vote, Windom ruled the changes passed
unanimously, as Siegelman Democrats screamed for a roll call vote.
They were never acknowledged, and almost immediately sued Windom
and boycotted subsequent sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Less combative Tuesday, Windom said, ``We're birthing a
two-party system in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Republican lieutenant governor this century, Windom
has less power than Democrats who came before him. He must consult
with Barron on which committee will hear a bill _ a powerful
lawmaking tool. But on the Senate's two budget committees,
Siegelman must gain support from Windom allies to pass financial
proposals
</P>
<P>
   Just 19 days remain in the Senate session.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than enough time to take care of the budgets and
the lottery,'' Windom said. ``It won't take long to catch up.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm air will cover much of the eastern half of the
nation Wednesday, especially where sunshine is plentiful, from the
central Plains across the southern Great Lakes to the Northeast
Coast. Meanwhile, a pool of high-level chill will drift southeast
over the interior West, resulting in cool and unsettled weather in
much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm conditions will surge from the eastern Ohio Valley
into the Middle Atlantic states and southern new England as breezes
from the southwest increase. The leading edge of the warm air will
be marked by a band of clouds and a few sprinkles or wet snowflakes
over northernmost New England.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will spread steadily toward north through the
Tennessee and southern Ohio River Valley. A few strong
thunderstorms will erupt in the humid air near the Florida
panhandle. Periods of rain will become steadier and heavier during
the day near the southern Appalachians where moist winds from the
southeast ascend the sloping terrain. The clouds and showers will
reach the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Intermittent mountain snow and valley rain showers will be
common over the interior West in the wake of a cold front. Periods
of snow will also develop from northern Montana to the northwestern
Dakotas as cold air seeps south from central Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Coast states, drier air will arrive over Washington
and northern Oregon on breezes from the northeast. Meanwhile, the
deserts of the Southwest will be mainly dry but cooler air and
gusty winds will arrive Wednesday afternoon and night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Chernobyl Concern
</P>
<P>
   Rapid run-off from melting snow has increased concern that the
rising Pripyat River, which flows by the nuclear power plant at
Chernobyl, Ukraine, might pick up radioactive particles left in the
aftermath of the 1986 accident there. The severe winter in eastern
Europe began in November, when outbreaks of Arctic air and heavy
snows started to mount. For much of the winter, low pressure
systems in the upper atmosphere recurrently stalled over Europe,
touching off widespread wintry weather, which included a barrage of
heavy snows that led to deadly avalanches in the Alps. &QL;

   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke on Tuesday of
``unimaginable suffering and barbarism'' in Kosovo. Defense
Minister George Robertson told of Balkan ``killing fields'' created
by Serbian atrocities. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook referred to
``appalling brutality'' and ``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The three separate briefings on the war, the resort to highly
emotive words, and the invocation of war-crimes-tribunal terms were
characteristic of the comprehensive and robust way that Britain has
been framing the rationale for bombing Yugoslavia in moral terms.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other European leader, Blair has stressed a sense
of his country's regional responsibility and yoked it to crusading
summonses to press ahead even more resolutely. ``This is happening
on our doorstep, and we simply cannot stand by and let it happen,''
Blair said in Belfast where he is overseeing talks between warring
Protestant and Catholic communities in a tribal conflict even
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Where some other European leaders are expressing doubts about
the correctness of the mission for NATO, Blair responds with
certainty that the Western military alliance should now be an agent
of retribution against Serbia for its campaign against the Kosovar
Albanians. ``The answer to what is happening is to intensify air
strikes,'' he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The British public has responded with support for the strikes
and, by a lesser margin, for the entry of ground troops if
necessary. A Gallup poll published in Tuesday's The Daily Telegraph
showed that 58 percent backed the intervention and 52 percent would
support sending in ground troops. These are higher levels of
support than similar polls have recorded in France and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for Blair and his effort to mobilize public
opinion, more than two-thirds of those surveyed agreed with the
view that ``recent actions in Kosovo constitute a humanitarian
outrage and should not be tolerated by the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   British networks have been giving graphic coverage to the
refugee crisis in Kosovo, and executives reported that audiences
for prime time news shows were considerably higher than they had
been during the bombing of Iraq in which Britain also participated.
``We are showing places being bombed close to where they have been
on their holidays and that tends to keep the concentration span
going,'' a BBC senior officer told The Times of London.
</P>
<P>
   The British press has been largely supportive, from the
characteristically jingoistic tabloid Sun (``Clobba Slobba'') to
papers on the center left like The Guardian and The Independent,
both of which have championed the intervention and urged Blair to
reconsider his refusal to send in the infantry. Blair has argued
that combat troops are not an option because of the numbers needed
and the time it would take to assemble them.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's aggressive commitment to the air strikes in Yugoslavia
and the passion with which Blair has justified the intervention are
a marked departure from the government of his Conservative
predecessor John Major when confronted with Serbian repression and
violence in Bosnia in the early 1990s. The British then were
reluctant to get immersed in a civil war they were not convinced
affected them and dubious about American involvement there.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming prime minister, Blair established a more assertive
British foreign policy, saying that his purpose was more to follow
a broad international ethic rather than strict national interest.
Britain's continuing arms sales to developing nations and its
involvement in some West African political crises have called that
pledge into question, but in the Balkans the new objective has been
reinforced with military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a strong tradition in the Labor Party
that you should only fight wars for strongly moral reasons,'' said
Vernon Bognador, professor of government at Oxford. ``People do
feel revolted when they see ethnic cleansing, it reminds people too
much of the Nazis, and the traditional Labor Party view is that
Britain has a moral obligation to act.''
</P>
<P>
   In power terms, the size and skill of Britain's military and its
willingness to use force has given it more impact abroad than other
European countries. Britain is trying to assert itself in Europe at
an awkward moment since it is not participating in the continent's
grand new venture, the euro as the common currency.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has been in the forefront of nations calling for the
arrest and trial of war criminals responsible for atrocities in
Bosnia. On Monday, Cook named key figures in the Yugoslav military
and security hierarchy, including President Slobodan Milosevic,
who, he said, would be hunted down and brought before the
International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague for their current
activities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   London's closeness to Washington under Blair has made Britain
suspect in many European capitals, though Blair argues that his
warm relationship with President Clinton should be viewed by other
Europeans as enhancing his influence. Typically, Blair said on
Tuesday that he had spoken on Monday night and again on Tuesday
morning to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, asked about the American-British alliance
in Washington last month, said it was the strongest it's been since
World War II. Blair's assertiveness came in for particular praise.
``Blair himself has a real grasp of foreign affairs, and we've been
able to get around all those lawyers in the Foreign Office,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   By way of illustrating the intimacy the two governments enjoy,
the aide said that among the instant access buttons on the phone of
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger was one connected directly
to Sir John Holmes, his counterpart in 10 Downing Street. ``And
it's used every day,'' he added.

COURT REINSTATES GUN CONVICTION OF ACCUSED KIDNAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People accused in multi-state crime sprees
involving a gun may legally be charged with using the weapon in any
of those states even if they used it in only one state, the Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-2 ruling, the high court reinstated the gun conviction of
a man also found guilty of kidnapping and conspiracy in crimes
stemming from a 1994 drug deal gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling cleared up a nagging confusion among lower courts
over a federal statute that adds five years to a sentence when
someone uses a gun in the course of drug trafficking or committing
a crime of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some courts had ruled that if the initial violent crime or drug
trafficking offense occurred in one state and the use of a gun in
that crime in another, then the defendant should be tried for each
crime separately in the two states. In addition, these courts ruled
that the extra criminal sentence should not be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday said that the two crimes
could be tried in one state and that the enhanced sentence should
apply.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Jacinto Rodriguez-Moreno, a New York
drug dealer, and several others kidnapped Ephrain Avendano of
Houston, the middleman in a cocaine deal, after one of Avendano's
associates took off with 30 kilograms of cocaine without paying
Rodriguez-Moreno for them.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful search for the thieves, Rodriguez-Moreno
and his associates took Avendano from Houston to Middlesex, New
Jersey, where he had an apartment and where his wife and children
lived. They held the entire Avendano family captive there.
</P>
<P>
   Later they took Avendano to White Plains, New York, and then to
Wheaton, Maryland, where prosecutors said Rodriguez-Moreno grabbed
a gun, put it to Avendano's neck and said he was ready to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Avendano managed to escape through the back door to a neighbor's
house. The neighbor called the police, who later entered the house
where Avendano was held captive and found a .357 magnum gun with
Rodriguez-Moreno's fingerprint on it, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Moreno and five other defendants were prosecuted in
New Jersey. He was sentenced to seven years and three months in
prison on the kidnapping charges, plus an extra five years on the
gun charge, to be served after completing the other sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals threw out his conviction on the
gun charge, saying Rodriguez-Morneno could not be charged with that
crime in New Jersey because he used the gun in Maryland.
Rodriguez-Moreno could have been tried on all of the charges in
Maryland, the appeals court noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives criminal defendants the right to be tried
in the state and judicial district where their alleged crimes were
committed, although courts are authorized to switch trial sites to
guarantee that defendants will get a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court
decision. Writing for the high court, Justice Clarence Thomas said
the fact that Rodriguez-Moreno used the gun only in Maryland ``did
not matter ... because the underlying crime of kidnapping had
occurred in four states.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas added, ``A kidnapping, once begun, does not end until the
victim is free. It does not make sense then, to speak of it in
discrete geographic fragments.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defendant ... has been prosecuted for using a gun during
a kidnaping in a state and district where all agree he did not use
a gun during a kidnapping,'' Scalia wrote for the two.

COLUMN: GETTING TOUGH IS TOUGH ON PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, April 8)  
(mk) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend, my husband and I decided to ``get tough'' on our
8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   He's a good kid with a soft heart, but he has some bad habits.
Like leaving his metal scooter and his Star Wars laser guns outside
in the rain. Or staying up late to do his homework and then not
turning it in the next day. Or taking the cover off his tennis
racket and leaving it courtside. Or never filling the dog's water
dish, his one and only evening household chore.
</P>
<P>
   And we were tired of repeating requests, only to be ignored in
favor of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   So last weekend, we were consistent. He was grounded for not
turning in his homework. That included TV, computer and friends. He
also lost any toy he didn't put away. And if he didn't do as we
asked the first time, he was sent to his room. If he acted up, he
lost privileges.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we haven't used all those techniques before, in
moderation. But never with this little slack and this much
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The grounding worked great. Adam remembered all the next week to
turn in homework, with minimal reminders on our part.
</P>
<P>
   But for a forgetful second-grader to have two hovering parents
waiting for a misstep was exhausting for all of us. By Sunday, the
whole family was cranky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling this isn't working,'' I told Jim that night,
after the kids were finally in bed. ``If nothing else, I can't keep
up this level of concentration. And even I am getting confused over
what was taken away and for how long. There's got to be a better
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just tried to do too much, too fast. We've got to
concentrate on one change at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Adam turned 8 last month, we had suddenly decided that he
had passed a watershed of maturity. We expected more from him now.
But he was really just one month older, and not much wiser. Part of
the plan was going to have to be teaching him what the new
expectations were.
</P>
<P>
   Some of our habits would have to change as well.
</P>
<P>
   How long did we run his bath water before we trusted that he was
old enough to operate the spigots without scalding himself? How
long had I opened his cereal, poured his milk, and sliced his
banana before realizing that preparing breakfast was well within
his range of abilities?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can maneuver Mario through a maze of seeping lava,
build a three-dimensional home for his Sim City ants and spend
hours running around the house with weapons drawn fighting
invisible armies, surely has the intelligence, strength and
fortitude to master a garbage run straight up the driveway or to
put a jacket onto a hanger and back in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as I wrapped a warm towel around him after his bath and
went downstairs to fix a snack of grapes and cheese, I thought that
8-year-olds still need a little coddling.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe their moms just like to think that they do.

 &HT;    Atlanta leads nation in new building permits
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlanta logged more building permits for new
single-family houses last year than any other metropolitan area in
the country. In doing so, the area beat its own 1997 record.
Nationwide, building permits also set a record _ barely.
</P>
<P>
   The 45,835 building permits resulted in about $8 billion worth
of construction last year, according to Dick Hearin, vice president
of builder/developer services at Northside Realty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's assuming our average sales price of $174,700 in the
11-county core metro area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta, came Phoenix-Mesa, with 36,641 permits. Third was
Las Vegas, with 21,791. Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham ranked fourth
and fifth, respectively, with 15,759 and 13,939 permits.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranked first among the states, with 69,425 permits.
North Carolina (63,167) and Arizona (50,178) followed.
</P>
<P>
   The report, compiled from preliminary census data by U.S.
Housing Markets, a Michigan-based research journal, noted that
nationally, builders filed for a record 1.18 million permits in
1998, surpassing a 20-year record by 1,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   While demand threatened to outpace supply last year, several
factors kept that from happening. One, said Brian Bragg, editor of
U.S. Housing Markets, was a widespread labor shortage in the
building trades.
</P>
<P>
   Others, Hearin added, included increased costs for lumber and
wallboard, concrete and insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things affect the business,'' Hearin explained,
``along with the increased cost of land and finished lots, to say
nothing of the impact fees (builders) have to pay.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. will now discount Internet access to
customers of its most popular calling plan for local service.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can have all-you-can-surf Net access from BellSouth
for $12.95 _ discounted from the regular $19.95-a-month tab _ so
long as they also choose the suite of phone services known as
``Complete Choice.'' Customers who sign up for the two services can
indefinitely keep the $12.95 rate for Net access.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, industry analysts and executives have touted
the coming of ``one-stop shopping,'' promising a key market
advantage to companies that can ``bundle'' numerous services
together.
</P>
<P>
   From a company's perspective, the notion of packaging is seen as
a way to win as well as retain customers. It is also meant to
convince customers of one service _ like Net access _ to sign up
for another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this packaging will attract many more customers,''
said Sue McLaughlin, president of BellSouth Consumer Services.
``Our customers have been telling us that simplicity and ease are
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of households that use more than one kind of
communications technology would use one company for all
communication needs if given the choice, according to research
conducted by The Yankee Group. And more than 80 percent of all
households do buy some kind of communications besides local and
long-distance telephone service, according to Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   But one-stop shopping has been slow to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Complete Choice, which costs $34 a month in Georgia, includes 22
features, including the most popular, like caller ID, call waiting
and three-way calling. About 4 million residential customers _ 22
percent of the company's total _ have the plan, said Terry
Yarbrough, vice president of marketing for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has about 450,000 Internet subscribers, about
one-third of them customers for Complete Choice.
</P>
<P>
   With the market advantages of bundling in mind, BellSouth has
often complained that denial of its right to enter long-distance
markets allows rivals to offer packages that it cannot match.
However, BellSouth has thus far not even created a single billing
package that includes every service it does provide. For instance,
a customer cannot get BellSouth's wireless cable television service
and local phone service on the same bill.
</P>
<P>
   But McLaughlin said that the company is aiming to wrap many more
services together. ``Stay tuned,'' she said.

   SPACEY-ICEMAN-THEATER (New York) _ Kevin Spacey, resplendent in
black, from T-shirt to running shoes, is sitting amid the empty
seats of the Brooks Atkinson Theater, watching the international
scrum of lugs, louts and losers who frequent Harry Hope's bar in
``The Iceman Cometh'' by Eugene O'Neill. A respected and
prize-winning stage actor, he is probably best known for, and at
times hard to differentiate from, the dark, somewhat mysterious
characters _ all chilly control and sheen on the surface, all
menace and surprise underneath _ that he has played in films. These
include ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Swimming With Sharks,'' ``L.A.
Confidential,'' ``Hurlyburly,'' and ``The Usual Suspects,'' which
won him an Oscar for best supporting actor in 1995. Spacey spent
much of the last year in London playing Hickey in the critically
acclaimed Almeida Theater production of ``The Iceman Cometh'' on
which the current American revival _ opening on Thursday on
Broadway _ is based. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-THEATER (Undated) _ Picture a Mount Rushmore in honor
of the monumental characters of American drama. What faces do you
see there, carved in stone? Willy Loman, Blanche DuBois, Theodore
(Hickey) Hickman and Mary Cavan Tyrone. But has our country yet
produced drama worthy to set beside the Greek tragedians,
Shakespeare, Calderon, Schiller, Ibsen, Chekhov? I think not. By
Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COOKIE'S-FORTUNE-FILM (Undated) _ A proper Southern lady knows
what to do when she finds a relative upstairs in bed with a bullet
through her brain and the pistol still dangling from her right
hand. When this happens to Camille Dixon (Glenn Close, dressed like
a blend of Blanche DuBois, Isadora Duncan and a Talbot's catalogue
cover), she simply rearranges things to make it look like murder. A
lot of things about Holly Springs, the setting of Robert Altman's
new movie, ``Cookie's Fortune,'' seem familiar. But then I grew up
in Vincent, Ala., population 1,200 or so, where ``y'all's'' is an
accepted plural possessive and people still refer to ``passing
away.'' Altman, whose hometown is the very metropolitan Kansas
City, Mo., got a lot of things about small Southern towns right,
but then his screenwriter, Anne Rapp, once lived in Mississippi. By
Anita Gates.
</P>
<P>
   GO-FILM (Undated) _ When the actor Jay Mohr showed up for the
first day of filming the new movie, ``Go,'' a dark, offbeat comedy
about a group of Los Angeles slackers whose lives collide after a
botched drug deal, he had his doubts about the director. Mohr had
never seen Doug Liman's breakthrough film, the 1996 cult hit
``Swingers,'' and when he first met the 32-year-old director, he
thought he looked and acted ``just like Einstein. Doug's IQ is
about 170 but I don't think he even knows how old he is,'' Mohr
said. He wondered if Liman was the right choice to direct a movie
about cynical, disaffected Generation X-ers. ``Go,'' which opens
Friday, takes place during 24 hours in the lives of three groups of
young people and involves everything from a bizarre Christmas Eve
dinner to Las Vegas lap dancing, tantric sex and couple-swapping.
By Dana Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-PSYCHO-FILM (Toronto) _ The humor being aimed for in
``American Psycho'' _ a swipe at the blind narcissism of the
youthful privileged class during the Reagan 80s _ is crucial to the
success of the movie, which may have more prerelease bias to
overcome than any film in recent memory. The 1991 novel by the same
name, on which it is based, depicts scenes of sadistic violence
narrated by Patrick Bateman in a seemingly indifferent manner that
by some literal readings was perceived as amoral. So much so that
many people who failed to recognize (or consider) the satiric
intent of the author, Bret Easton Ellis, thought the disturbing
work should not have even been published, much less made into a
movie. By Bruce Weber.

<P>
   GYPSY-DANCE (New York) _ The Gypsy Caravan, a sextuple bill,
produced by the World Music Institute, comes to City Center on
Friday and Saturday. The Gypsy music and dance heritage stretches
all the way from India to Andalusia. It's a musical diaspora that
has survived poverty and persecution while transforming, and being
transformed by every culture it has touched. By Jon Pareles.

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LE-CID-THEATER (Paris) _ The production of ``Le Cid'' was the
high point of last year's Avignon Festival, almost unanimously
praised by French critics as an intelligent and disturbing fresh
look at a dusty classic. Since then, it has been seen in many
French provincial cities as well as in London in February and most
recently at the Theatredes Bouffes du Nord, the Paris home of Peter
Brook's experimental theater company. Now it is ending its touring
life at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, with seven performances _
accompanied by English-language surtitles _ at the Majestic Theater
from Tuesday through next Sunday. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COUNTERTENORS (New York) _ Time to strike the male alto from the
rare-species list. To appreciate how well established this once
marginal vocal category has become, consider the case of David
Daniels, who makes his Metropolitan Opera debut on Saturday evening
in a revival of Handel's ``Giulio Cesare,'' with an encore
scheduled for April 27 in the form of a recital at Alice Tully
Hall. It was with the premiere of this Met production in 1988 that
Jeffrey Gall and Daniel Dash struck for their brothers the blow
that in 1955 Marian Anderson struck for blacks, opening the doors
of the nation's most visible opera house to a class of artists
formerly excluded. By Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   VENGEROV-MUSIC (Undated) _ The young Siberian Maxim Vengerov
continues to stake out his ground among the most gifted and
engaging violinists of, let's say, the last 25 years. Let's say
that, because ``half-century'' or, indeed, ``modern times'' has an
inescapable ring of hyperbole. Yet Vengerov's magnificent new
recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto, with Daniel Barenboim and the
Chicago Symphony (Teldec 0630-17144-2; CD), immediately brings to
mind classic performances available on compact disk. By Lawrence B.
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   FERNEYHOUGH-MUSIC (Undated) _ Brian Ferneyhough, an English-born
composer who has been teaching at the University of California, San
Diego, for the last 12 years, is a modernist by any definition,
except in his choice of media. He uses conventional instruments and
even has a penchant for traditional groupings, notably the string
quartet, and for historical models. A recent CD of solo works by
Ferneyhough (Etcetera KTC 1206), is played by the extraordinary
musicians of the Australian group Elision. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POP-SONGS-HERITAGE (New York) _ The noble parade of dead
songwriters in Lincoln Center's American Songbook series has begun,
starting with Harold Arlen in February and Richard Rodgers in March
and continuing in the fall with Jimmy Van Heusen and Jerome Kern.
The mission is nothing less than the preservation of our popular
song heritage. But is preservation enough? Clearly, the music of
that melodious roster of songwriting legends from the 1920s to the
1950s, like Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Irving Berlin and their
peers, will remain with us for the foreseeable future. Long-term,
though, their songs, written for a mass market that no longer
exists, employing standards of craft and sophistication that no
longer apply, seem destined for extinction. By Barry Singer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIM'S-PROGRESS-ART (Undated) _ Few art panoramas have
survived, and the ``Pilgrim's Progress'' versions were assumed to
have vanished, worn out from use or discarded once their vogue had
passed. Then in 1995, the traveling edition was discovered at the
York Institute Museum in Saco, Maine, where it had been hidden away
in storage for almost century. The painting was sent to the
Williamstown Art Conservation Center in Massachusetts for
restoration. And about a third of its 1,200-foot length is now on
view through May 2 at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey, in an
exhibition organized by Gail Stavitsky and Diane P. Fischer of the
museum, Tom Hardiman of the York Institute and Kevin Avery of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-BASILICA-ART _ (Assisi, Italy) _ The recent tragedy
at the 13th-century basilica of St. Francis, where the entryway and
the altar collapsed 18 months ago during an earthquake, has been
entirely rebuilt and reinforced. The quake shattered ceiling
paintings attributed to Cimabue and Giotto. By Ken Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AWFUL-TRUTH (Undated) _ In the debut episode of ``The Awful
Truth,'' the new series created by the guerrilla-style documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore, viewers meet Christopher Donahue, a
Florida man with a life-threatening pancreatic illness. Donahue
desperately needs a transplant but his health care provider,
Humana, refuses to pay for the operation. Those familiar with
Moore's work, particularly his breakthrough documentary film in
198, ``Roger and Me,'' and his Emmy-winning series ```TV Nation,''
will recognize that the basic ingredients remain the same in ```The
Awful Truth,'' which has its premiere next Sunday at 9 p.m. on
Bravo. By Warren Berger.

   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;

<P>
   READING-ROOM-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The gloomy winter and the
bright spring have provided the proof. The glorious fullness of
light that the architects John M. Carrere and Thomas Hastings
envisioned 90 years ago for the New York Public Library's main
reading room has returned the Beaux Arts space to its former
splendor. The rescue was realized under Paul LeClerc, the president
of the library, through the largesse of Sandra Priest Rose, a
library trustee, and her husband, Frederick Phineas Rose, a real
estate developer, who gave $15 million to restore the space. By
Rita Reif.

JAZZ SINGER JOE WILLIAMS DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB BLUMENTHAL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Williams, the master of blues and ballad singing whose
vocals were crucial to the success of the ``New Testament'' Count
Basie band, and whose subsequent work on his own made him a
reigning jazz star for four decades, died in Las Vegas on Monday
night. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Admitted to a hospital last week for a respiratory ailment, Mr.
Williams ( scheduled to play the Regattabar in August) had
apparently left without informing hospital staff, and was
attempting to walk to his nearby home when he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and Tony Bennett are the last of what I call the graceful
genre, the folks who wear tuxes and take the time to say hello and
sign autographs,'' young vocalist Kevin Mahogany noted recently.
``They set a standard, especially for singers, and they have
managed to remain graceful after 40 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fortunate enough to have encountered Mr. Williams knew
that this grace was not feigned. He was one of the music's true
aristocrats, and he had worked in obscurity for years before Basie
gave him his crucial break.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams was born Joseph Goreed on Dec. 12, 1918, in
Cordele, Ga., and moved to Chicago at an early age. He broke into
nightclubs with clarinetist Jimmie Noone, and through the 1940s
enjoyed brief affiliations with Coleman Hawkins, Andy Kirk, and Hot
Lips Page, among others. It was his 1955 recordings of ``Every Day
I Have the Blues'' and ``All Right, OK, You Win'' with Count Basie
that finally brought him national attention, and in turn ensured
the success of Basie's recently reorganized orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview, Mr. Williams credited the Basie musicians
with helping him perfect his urbane style. ``I've been surprised
and pleased at how closely they listen to singers,'' he said.
``Benny Powell, one of Basie's trombonists, pointed out to me that,
no matter how softly I wanted to sing, I had to push in on the
diaphragm. It's basically an awareness of what you want from your
voice and what point you're trying to make.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was an all-around singer who also excelled with popular
ballads, Mr. Williams was most influential with his sophisticated
approach to blues material. ``Joe definitely dressed the blues
up,'' Mahogany explained. ``He made it okay to listen to the blues
for those who misperceived what they were all about. He pointed the
blues in another direction from just sitting out in a field and
moaning about your life. His diction was very proper, without a lot
of slang and idioms, and that made a big difference. And as he
aged, he learned finesse, how to be powerful when necessary without
being strong all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basie identification stuck with Mr. Williams, although the
singer had launched a solo career by 1961. Touring with a rhythm
section that has featured pianist Norman Simmons as musical
director for the past two decades, Mr. Williams was a regular at
clubs, festivals, and jazz cruises, where his conviviality brought
many fans back year after year. His Las Vegas home base and
friendship with Johnny Carson also landed Mr. Williams numerous
guest shots on ``The Tonight Show'' that together with a recurring
role as Bill Cosby's father-in-law on ``The Cosby Show,'' made him
perhaps the most widely exposed artist in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The consistent quality of Mr. Williams's performances in the
past decade, which are documented on several Verve and Telarc CDs,
set him apart from many of his aging contemporaries. ``They did a
lot of things that I didn't do and probably had a better time,'' he
joked when asked about his superior staying power in 1994, but it
was the intelligent application of his rare talents that made Mr.
Williams seem to get better with age. ``Here's to Life'' was his
last anthem, and it testifies to the spirit that illuminated his
art to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of his available recordings are ``Every Day: The
Best of the Verve Years'' and ``Ballad and Blues Master,'' both on
Verve. His appearance on Marian McPartland's ``Piano Jazz'' has
also been released on a Jazz Alliance CD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mr. Williams leaves his son, Joe; and
his daughter, Anne.

`OCEAN SEA': A FLAWED GEM OF A NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Almayer Inn, located on some timeless and fabled European
shore, is, like Joseph Roth's earlier Hotel Savoy, a place for the
ingathering of comically or poignantly eccentric characters. The
first one of these in Alessandro Baricco's lusciously mystical new
novel, ``Ocean Sea,'' is a painter named Plasson who uses sea water
to paint the sea, creating all-white canvases. A woman named Ann
Deveria, wrapped in purple and thinking of her husband and her
lover, roams the shore. Soon Elisewin, a fragile teen-age princess
with ``a most beautiful voice _ velvet'' who ``slipped through the
air, so that you could not take your eyes off her,'' is sent to the
hotel by her doting father to cure her congenital frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Others are present, including Ismael Adelante Ismael Prof.
Bartleboom, a daft scientist who writes daily love letters to the
woman he hopes one day to meet. The most enigmatic and darkest of
the guests is a former seaman named Adams, who quietly nurses a
sense of vengeance. And the whole is presided over by a core of
precocious children, who are like the cherubs of a Renaissance
painting: One of them furnishes dreams to the hotel's quaint
inhabitants, another stares from a window ledge at the sea.
</P>
<P>
   These lives, and several others, are going to intersect,
amorously, comically, and murderously, as ``Ocean Sea'' unfolds in
its poetically elliptical way. Baricco is a literary cubist, a
stylist who looks simultaneously at the several sides of things. He
switches from one rhetorical mode to another, from a kind of
symbolist poetry to grand adventure narrative to picaresque comedy,
and the novel is masterfully reincarnated from Italian to English
by the translator, Alastair McEwen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that it's the music that's hard, it's the music
that's hard to find, to say things, there so close to each other,
the music and the gestures, to dissolve the suffering, when there
is absolutely nothing to be done anymore, the right music so that
it may be a dance, in some way, and not a wrench, that going off,
that slipping away, toward life and away from life, strange
pendulum of the soul ...'' and so on for another dozen or so
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   This style of writing can be precious, artificial, a kind of
verbal craftsmanship for craftsmanship's sake, but generally I read
``Ocean Sea'' transfixed by Baricco's linguistic originality, the
boisterousness of his characters, and the skill with which he
weaves the threads of a seemingly disjointed plot into a single
narrative strand. The pleasure of discovering the surprising
qualities in this Italian writer, whose only previous novel was the
erotic love story ``Silk,'' far outweighs the occasional annoyance
of his lapses into mystico mannerism. ``Ocean Sea'' is a flawed gem
of a novel, an accident-prone beauty that took a great deal of
talent and imagination to devise.
</P>
<P>
   The sea provides a constant thematic presence, and there are
shades of ``Moby-Dick'' here: the sea as a void, a blank slate, on
which men and women impose deep meaning. For some of the guests at
the Almayer Inn, it is a cure for everything. Ann Deveria's
cuckolded husband has sent her here because he thinks that ``the
sea air may cool the passions.'' Professor Bartleboom studies it as
part of his vast project, the compilation of an Encyclopedia of the
Limits to be Found in Nature, because, after all, the sea ends
someplace, though that end point may take years of scientific
observation to find.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' history includes a shipwreck off Africa and imprisonment
by a local satrap who made him bark like a dog. He bears a strange
resemblance, explained as Baricco's story progresses, to a seaman
named Thomas whose story is told in what at first seems like an
epic diversion from the main thread. It has to do with a French
naval frigate called Alliance that went aground off the coast of
Africa. A good portion of its crew was abandoned by the ship's
captain and set adrift on a makeshift raft, setting into motion a
savage battle for survival in which Thomas and the ship's doctor,
Savigny, became deadly rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the story of an abomination,'' begins Thomas' version
of this seaborne nightmare. ``I am writing it in my mind, now, with
what strength I have left and with my eyes fixed on that man who
shall never have my forgiveness. Death shall read it.'' Baricco
wraps everything up in a final series of chapters, each devoted to
one of his guests at the Almayer Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these chapters are among Baricco's more enigmatic.
Elisewin's in particular is a fairy tale unburdened with motive or
plausible explanation. The passages on Bartleboom's burlesque quest
for love, in which he delivers a mahogany box full of his
prewritten letters to three women, is the book's comic high
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In these final chapters, various mysteries of identity are
cleared up, as we learn who, exactly, are the people we thought we
had come to know. One reads with a bit of a frisson as Baricco
shifts from a comic to a tragic mode, from the theme of antic love
to that of patiently exacted revenge, with a surprise at the end.
But as with the rest of this novel, Baricco's voice remains
detached, wry, musical, always vaguely parodic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where you take leave of yourself,'' Ann
Deveria writes in a letter to her lover. ``What you are slips away
from you, bit by bit. And you leave it behind you, step by step, on
this shore that does not know time and lives only one day, always
the same one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is among the mysteries of this strangely engaging book that
that is not true. In ``Ocean Sea'' the characters remain very much
themselves as they live out a kind of preordained destiny. But then
Baricco wants to tantalize us with his cubist conundrums, and in
this he succeeds very well.

TIME RUNNING OUT FOR BELFAST PEACE, BLAIR AND AHERN SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Prime Ministers Tony Blair of
Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland continued Tuesday to press
Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders to
compromise on the bitter dispute over the disarmament of the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with party leaders for 4{ hours Monday night, the
prime ministers swept back and forth over this British province in
a military helicopter Tuesday, emphasizing at several meetings that
time is running out for settling the issue, which threatens to
cripple or collapse the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved
last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has set a deadline of this Friday for an
agreement. The sticking point is the insistence by Protestant
leaders that the overwhelmingly Catholic IRA make a ``credible
beginning'' on disarmament before its political wing, Sinn Fein, is
allowed to sit in a new Protestant and Catholic Cabinet of the
Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly is the body that would
carry out the home rule provisions of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet is to be created to pave the way for the return by
the London government, after 27 years, of home rule powers to the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to compromise this week could lead to another delay and
possibly to a return to the widespread sectarian violence the peace
agreement is supposed to end.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for more than 20 months, but
has repeatedly stated that it will not surrender a single bullet or
an ounce of Semtex explosive. Unless it does, Protestant leaders
say, Sinn Fein will be excluded from the new Assembly Cabinet. Sinn
Fein points out that the peace agreement does not require
disarmament before May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As they began their day with short speeches at the Hazlewood
Integrated College, an interdenominational high school in Belfast,
the two prime ministers sounded optimistic. ``After talking to the
parties here last night and again today,'' Blair said, ``I do
believe that we can get there. It is within our grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own religious background, he said: ``On my
mother's side were very strong Irish Protestants. I married a
Catholic, although I am Church of England. We are about to enter
the 21st century. Do these things really have to pull people
apart?''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern, who is from a working-class district of Dublin, used
humor to explain why he opposes a delay in negotiations, which
people here have been calling ``parking the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my end of Dublin,'' he said, ``if you park things too long
they usually get vandalized.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meetings continued during the day in Parliament
buildings, the home of the Assembly in Belfast, and in Hillsborough
Castle, a British residence 20 miles south, an atmosphere of
sectarian discord prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA tried to improve its image among Catholics in a macabre
way.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed guerrilla organization, which has killed more than
1,500 people here since 1969, said it would soon disclose where it
buried nine of its operatives who were secretly executed for being
disloyal to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the grisly logic of Northern Ireland politics, this was to
put a human face on terrorism by returning bodies to relatives who
wanted to give them Christian burials. The IRA statement Monday
night apologized for the delay in returning the victims, but not
for killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was heckled twice Tuesday, first by a Protestant Unionist
Assembly member, Cedric Wilson, who hung out a window and shouted
angrily but unintelligibly at the prime minister as Blair left the
helicopter on the lawn in front of Parliament buildings.
</P>
<P>
   When Blair left the building, surrounded by security men and
accompanied by Ahern, a small group of older people held up signs
attacking terrorism, and shouted, ``God save Ulster'' and ``Never
mind Yugoslavia. Think of Northern Ireland, your own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several well-dressed older Protestant women, who said they were
relatives of IRA victims, seemed to epitomize the fearful hard-line
Protestant views on the IRA disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA will get its united Ireland,'' said one woman.
``They'll still have all their ammunition, all their weaponry. And
united Ireland will mean the ethnic cleansing of the Protestant
people.''

 &HT;    President of internet bank to step down
 &HT;    By Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Donald Shapleigh, Net.Bank president and chief
operating officer, will resign from the nation's largest
Internet-only bank at the end of April, according to a Securities
and Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, Shapleigh, 50, will become director of
sales at Directo, a debit card marketing and management company.
Former Secretary of State Lewis Massey is Directo's chief
executive. Shapleigh will remain on Alpharetta, Ga.-based
Net.Bank's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   D. R. Grimes, Net.Bank's vice chairman and chief executive, says
Shapleigh, like many successful Internet executives thrives best in
the start-up environment of emerging companies. Grimes said
Shapleigh will continue to be available for advice on credit and
lending and banking issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a really great blend of banking and technology
backgrounds. We think it takes both to be successful. I think what
Don really enjoyed was the start-up aspect of Net.Bank. Sometimes
you can look around at even 20 or 30 people and you think, 'gee I
liked it better when it was three or four.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been true as companies grew, they went through
transitions, but in Internet companies it happens really quickly,
but there's nothing between the lines and no falling out,'' Grimes
said. ``There are no problems between us.''
</P>
<P>
   No replacement was named for Shapleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Net.Bank has attracted about 23,000 customers and
over $300 million in deposits over the Internet in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Shapleigh had been president of Net.Bank since January 1996.
Before that, he held various positions over 23 years in the banking
industry, including stints at BankSouth Corp. and SouthTrust Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Bankshares have risen 162 percent this year.

HONG KONG COURT RULES AGAIN MIGRANTS FROM MAINLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a decision reflecting fears about a flood of
immigrants from mainland China, a Hong Kong court on Tuesday ruled
against 17 mainland residents who had claimed the right to live
here.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 are among more than 1,000 mainland Chinese who entered
Hong Kong on temporary visas but now assert they have the right to
stay under a recent court ruling that relaxed immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tuesday's ruling, the high court said mainland residents
must return home first and apply to Chinese authorities to move to
the territory. Otherwise, it predicted a chaotic rush of people
across the border, with potentially millions of Chinese staking a
claim to residency in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unverifiable, unplanned, and unregulated large influx of
new immigrants to Hong Kong will be an unbearable burden,'' said
Judge Wally Yeung, citing a Chinese proverb about sinking ships.
``It may sink Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong government welcomed the ruling, and warned it
would deport anyone who is here illegally. That could mean breaking
up families that have members on both sides of the border. By late
Tuesday, it had already detained 133 people, according to lawyers
for a group of mainland residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``While remaining in Hong Kong illegally, they have actually
broken our laws,'' said Regina Ip, the secretary for security. ``So
we really appeal to these overstayers to return to the mainland
voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement of people between Hong Kong and mainland China has
become a flashpoint between the former British colony and its new
sovereign. In January, Hong Kong's highest court ruled that
children born in the mainland who have at least one parent living
in Hong Kong have the right to residency in the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The decision angered Chinese officials, which viewed it as an
attempt to usurp the authority of China's National People's
Congress. China has sought to keep a tight grip on the number of
people it allows to move to Hong Kong, which still has a higher
standard of living and is a freer society than the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from the Hong Kong government, the court
later clarified its judgment to reassure Beijing it was not
challenging China. That averted a constitutional crisis, but still
left Hong Kong with a logistical problem of potentially vast
dimensions: how to deal with the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials say they believe that at least 1 million
people could claim residency. If even a portion of those people
chose to move to Hong Kong, these officials said, it would place a
huge burden on a city of 6.8 million that is already among the
world's most densely populated.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments about social engineering mean little to the people who
are fighting to stay in Hong Kong. They say its immigration laws
are outmoded and tear apart families. As their lawyers prepared to
appeal Tuesday's ruling, these people reacted with fear, anger, and
a defiant refusal to return to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to go back, it would be very hard for me to apply to
come again,'' said Kong Kwok-fai, a 25-year-old from neighboring
Guangdong province whose mother is from mainland China and whose
father is from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Kong, who was left behind with relatives in the mainland when
his mother migrated to Hong Kong 10 years ago, said the Chinese
authorities would throw up endless hurdles to his effort to rejoin
his parents. ``If we lose this case, I will feel very helpless and
hopeless about having to go back,'' he said.

PENTAGON MAY NEVER REVEAL WHAT DOWNED THE STEALTH JET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four days after a $45 million F-117A stealth
aircraft crashed in Yugoslavia, the Pentagon Tuesday again dodged
questions about what caused the radar-evading jet to plummet from
the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news briefing if he had any further word about what
brought down the jet during a night of NATO air raids against
Yugoslav military targets, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said,
``it's still down.''
</P>
<P>
   The military may never release the details.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that if a surface-to-air missile hit the fighter,
as is suspected, they don't want to admit that a plane once
believed to be virtually invisible to radar is seriously
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the big hole in the wing, it looked very much to me like
a missile hit it,'' said a former NATO commander, referring to the
Yugoslav television footage showing pieces of a U.S. aircraft,
purportedly the F-117A. The official spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon couches the reluctance to discuss the incident in
national security terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon called questions surrounding the downed aircraft ``very
operationally sensitive.'' The Pentagon is conducting a crash
investigation, he said, adding, ``There's a chance that when we
complete this, we won't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the plane, who was rescued by Air Force commandos,
has declined to discuss the crash publicly and the Pentagon has not
released his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some military experts assert that the Pentagon should explain
what is behind the crash of a jet that cost taxpayers billions of
dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't need to know the specific operational
details of the crash, but it has a right to know whether it was an
accident or the result of war,'' said Lawrence Korb, a former
assistant secretary of defense who is now with the Council on
Foreign Relations, a New York think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goure, deputy director for political-military studies at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
believes the public has the right to know if the aircraft crashed
because of a mechanical problem that renders the jets unsafe for
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Goure said, revealing information about the
jet's vulnerabilities could help the Yugoslav military and future
adversaries target other F-117A jets. ``The problem is that the
public's right to know may come at the expense at the safety of the
pilots,'' Goure said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a non-partisan think tank in
Washington, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   `The question here is when does the public's right to know
outweigh the benefits derived for the public's national security,''
Krepinevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Carroll, the deputy director of the independent Center
for Defense Information, said the military is doing the right thing
by not discussing the loss off the warplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, I can't fault the reticence of the Pentagon,''
Carroll said. ``We don't want to tell people how this plane got
shot down because we don't want to tell the Yugoslavs something
that will enable them to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be several reasons why the stealth fighter went
down: mechanical failure, pilot error, or _ the most worrisome
possibility for commanders _ the jet may have been tracked on radar
and struck by Yugoslav missiles or anti-aircraft gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army has sophisticated air defense missiles and
radar that it acquired from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Because the jet can evade radar systems, military planners
turned to the F-117A in the Persian Gulf War and now in ongoing
operations in Yugoslavia to conduct dangerous bombing missions over
heavily defended targets.
</P>
<P>
   The unique design of the triangle-shaped black plane renders it
significantly less visible to enemy radar than other jets, but it
is not invisible to radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was hit by a missile, it would not come as a terribly
great surprise because there is no military system that is entirely
invulnerable,'' Krepinevich said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two F-117As crashed while the jet was a top-secret
project in the 1980s, but what caused the crashes remains
classified. And another crashed during an air show in the suburbs
of Baltimore in 1997. Mechanical failure was blamed for that crash.

<P>
   Last week, American Indians finally won one at the U.S. Supreme
Court _ unfortunately, a rare event. It was a significant but
narrow 5-4 victory that upheld an 1837 treaty between Mille Lacs
Band of Chippewa Indians and the United States. Had the Chippewa
lost this case, hunting and fishing rights of all other tribes off
their reservations would have been jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling should have been unanimous. The issues were that
clear. The Chippewa had filed a lawsuit against the state of
Minnesota seeking an injunction to keep the state from enforcing
hunting and fishing restrictions against band members. The Chippewa
won at the federal district level and again at the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1837 treaty, 12 bands of Chippewa Indians ceded land to
the United States, which later became the states of Minnesota and
Wisconsin, in exchange for money, goods and grain. Article V of the
treaty guaranteed ``the privilege of hunting, fishing, and
gathering the wild rice, upon the lands, the rivers and lakes
included in the territory ceded ... during the pleasure of the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pivotal issues in the case, of course, was the phrase
``during the pleasure of the president.'' In February 1850,
President Zachary Taylor issued an executive order revoking the
tribe's hunting and fishing rights and ordering the Chippewas to be
removed from the ceded lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court notes, in agreement with the court of appeals,
that the ``president's power, if any, to issue the order must stem
either from an act of Congress or the Constitution itself.''No such
authority was granted by Congress. No such authority is granted by
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor writes for the majority of the
court: ``Because the parties have pointed to no colorable source of
authority for the president's removal order, we agree with the
Court of Appeals' conclusion that the 1850 removal order was
unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's attorneys argued that even if the removal order in
the executive order was unauthorized, the revocation of fishing and
hunting rights in the president's order was, nevertheless, valid.
That is, the fishing and hunting revocation clause could be
separated from the illegal portion of the executive order and stand
as good law. Wrong, says the high court: ``We think it is clear
that President Taylor intended the 1850 order to stand and fall as
a whole. The 1850 order embodied a single, coherent policy ... The
order tells the Indians to `go,' and also tells them not to return
to the ceded lands to hunt and fish.'' The removal order was
invalid, and thereby any part of that order is also invalid, the
high court states.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota also argued that a later treaty with the Chippewa,
entered into in 1855, relinquishes the tribe's hunting and fishing
privileges on the lands ceded to the United States in 1837. Not so,
says the court: ``The 1855 Treaty was designed primarily to
transfer Chippewa land to the United States not to terminate
Chippewa ... rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys representing Minnesota made a third and final
argument. They claimed that when Minnesota was admitted to the
Union in 1858, the Chippewas' hunting and fishing rights were
thereby extinguished. The Supreme Court makes it clear that it
disagrees: ``Congress may abrogate Indian treaty rights, but it
must clearly express its intent to do so ... There is no such
'clear evidence' of congressional intent to abrogate the Chippewa
Treaty rights here.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional act that admitted Minnesota into the Union
makes no mention of treaty rights at all. Therefore, states the
high court, Minnesota's admission to the Union has no impact on the
1837 treaty rights to hunt and fish on the ceded land.
</P>
<P>
   This decision is significant, not only for itself, but for the
fact that it overrules a portion of an earlier ruling, Ward vs.
Race Horse, wherein certain treaty rights granted to tribes were
terminated when Wyoming became a state. The logic of that 1896
ruling relied on the notion that a state when admitted to the Union
had the same sovereignty over natural resources as the 13 original
states.
</P>
<P>
   The 1896 Supreme Court saw a conflict between a state's
sovereignty over natural resources and treaties which granted
tribes the right to hunt, fish and gather on state land. This court
sees no conflict: ``Rather, Indian treaty rights can coexist with
state management of natural resources. Although states have
important interests in regulating wildlife and natural resources
within their borders, this authority is shared with the federal
government when the federal government exercises one of its
enumerated constitutional powers, such as treaty making.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas dissented. They
argue that President Taylor's executive order regarding the
termination of hunting and fishing rights had the authority of law
_ even if the removal order was invalid. Fortunately, they were in
the minority. And American Indian tribes finally got an even break.

   SCOTCH-GALORE (Los Angeles) _ You can find about 550 brands of
single-malt scotch whisky at Wine &AMP; Liquor Depot _ ranging in price
from about $16 to $7,000 and in age from relatively young to
venerable. It's enough variety in a decidedly esoteric niche market
to give store owner Howard Meister bragging rights to the largest
supply of single malt in America, or maybe even the world. By

 &HT;    Bring on the Y2K headaches _ as long as there's butter
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Have you figured it out yet? Where you're
going to be when Y2K strikes? Me either, but right now I'm leaning
toward staying at home with the cats and waiting for the lights to
go out.
</P>
<P>
   At crucial times like these, it's a challenge not to reflect on
a more innocent age when, according to the predictions of
Nostradamus and various talk show hosts, all we had to fear from
the year 2000 was Armageddon _ the final battle between good and
evil. For a variety of reasons, not the least being I never met
this Nostradamus guy and for all I knew he was some goofball
smoking funny stuff and taking notes, I haven't been too concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the visitor to the American Consulate in Jerusalem who
claimed to be Jesus and left behind his cell-phone number so they
could get in touch with him when things started coming unglued, I
have not begun to panic. Nor have I rented a cave in West Virginia
and begun stocking it with Spam and automatic weapons. Talk about
an exercise in futility. Who'd want to shoot anybody over a few
tins of reconditioned ham?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the other day I started a list of things to do before
Y2K _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Item 1 was food supply, and that's as far as I got. The last
time I looked, my pantry was as bare as Old Mother Hubbard's
cupboard, except for a year's supply of cat food. The shelves are
lined with little more than shelf paper and even that needs
replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator isn't much better. There's an open box of
baking soda on the bottom rack. Period.
</P>
<P>
   But the freezer is another story. It's filled with butter. I
know that sounds odd, under the circumstances, but it really isn't.
You see, mine was a butter-deprived childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Life was normal around our house until World War II came along
and brought shortages in its wake. I didn't miss coffee because I
was too young to drink it, and a lack of bananas at Mr. Swain's
corner store went unnoticed. But the day I watched my mother unwrap
a one-pound brick of white stuff that looked like a cross between
Crisco and paraffin, and heard her explain that I would be smearing
it on my morning toast, I realized that life as I had known it was
out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Oleomargarine, she called it. ``Tastes just like butter,'' she
insisted as she burst the deep orange ``color button'' that had
come with the pallid mass. I watched in horrified fascination as
she mixed up that first batch. In kid fashion, I reacted.
``Ble-eck! I'm not gonna eat that stuff.'' My mother questioned my
patriotism and explained that some sacrifices were necessary if we
were going to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   Because she suffered from a low boredom threshold, Mother quit
mixing before the color button had done its job. That evening at
dinner when Daddy asked for the butter, she passed him a bowl of
the variegated gunk. His reaction was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris,'' I remember him saying, ``I am a patriotic man. I work
16 hours a day to ensure that our troops are moved on comfortable
trains with good food and a cooling system that functions. I don't
mind driving on smooth tires, and I buy bonds every month. I even
tried to re-enlist but the Navy told me I was too old _ that I'd
already fought my war. No sacrifice is too great for my country,
but I will not eat striped butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother's answer was that oleomargarine was better for us than
butter. My father suggested in that case, it should all be shipped
to the front to save lives and grease axles. The discussion ended,
mother prevailed, and we never again saw real butter on the table,
which explains my freezer stash.
</P>
<P>
   So bring on the big GLITCH! If I survived those years of
Mother's sludge in a tub, Y2K's going to be a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   With butter.

 &HT;    Coke stock takes dive after quarterly announcement
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. has seen better days on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Atlanta-based beverage company said it expects
worldwide case sales to fall in the first quarter because of weak
economies overseas, its stock dropped 2.4 percent in heavy trading
Tuesday. At one point, the stock had been down more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several analysts cut their earnings estimates or
downgraded their opinion of the stock, following Coca-Cola's
announcement after the market closed Monday that case volume will
decline 1 percent to 2 percent in the quarter. That compares with a
gain of 14 percent in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the magnitude of the malaise was greater than
expected,'' said Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Conway.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be another choppy quarter in challenging
markets,'' Conway predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A First Call survey of analysts Tuesday showed a new consensus
earnings prediction at 28 cents per share for the quarter. That is
down from the previous forecast of 31 cents a share. The company,
which earned 34 cents a share in last year's first quarter, is
scheduled to release its quarterly earnings in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts also cut their 1999 earnings per share estimate to
$1.42 from $1.47, and their 2000 estimate to $1.64 from $1.69.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohen of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. downgraded the stock from his
``recommend list'' to ``market perform,'' while analyst Jennifer
Soloman of Salomon Smith Barney downgraded the stock to ``neutral''
from ``buy''.
</P>
<P>
   First Call said there was one ``strong buy'' in its survey, five
``buys'' and five ``holds.'' Those amount to ``meaningfully below
average'' ratings from stock analysts, said Chuck Hill, director of
research for First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola declined to comment on the analysts' actions. Conway
thinks investors should exercise ''near-term caution,'' but he
stands by his year-end price prediction of $75 a share. The stock
closed Tuesday at $63.25.
</P>
<P>
   Conway expects the company to start pulling out of the doldrums
by growing moderately in the third quarter, followed by a stronger
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, Coca-Cola will be reallocating some of
its marketing dollars away from television and other media
advertising, and toward locally-tailored promotions and events, or
those with special themes for niche audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts expect the company to try to drive up sales
overseas by turning to cheaper returnable bottles and smaller-size
containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this environment, it's whatever sells the product
immediately,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company is launching a new promotion for Coca-Cola
Classic this week, targeting 45 million teenagers and young adults
across this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get them to stop and take notice of this brand,''
said company spokeswoman Diana Garza. ``It is about driving
volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after a similar promotion last spring and summer, the
company will be distributing 45 million ``Coke Cards'' that qualify
users for money-saving offers at participating retailers. The
teenagers also get access to a special Coke voicemail system where
they can leave private messages for their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens want to do stuff that's under the radar screen and
independent. They want to feel grown-up,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the cardholder uses the system, the special access
number will expire. So another purchase of Coca-Cola Classic is
required to get another access number and continue on the voicemail
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help generate volume,'' analyst Conway said of
the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and Canada were the only regions where
volume is expectewd to grow in the first quarter, it is below what
analysts had predicted. Coca-Cola said case sales will rise about 2
percent in North America, but analysts had been expecting growth of
4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said the declines in other regions of the world will
range from 1 to 5 percent.

<P>
   MARRAKESH, Morocco _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said tonight that
the NATO bombing in Yugoslavia was necessary to block a planned
``campaign of massive and systematic destruction'' against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton used a speech here on tolerance to add her voice to
the NATO position that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
bears responsibility for the bombing. She accused him of having
prepared to kill or expel ethnic Albanians from Kosovo even as
peace talks were under way earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why my husband and our NATO allies could not stand and
look the other way,'' she said. ``They could not permit this to go
on with impunity until most of the Albanian population was either
dead or displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also why my husband and our NATO allies are determined
to persevere until Milosevic has embraced peace or NATO has
significantly limited his ability to make war.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is 10 days into a 12-day trip through North Africa
to promote education, health care and human rights. On Tuesday she
attended a roundtable with Moroccan women, stopped at an orphanage
and visited a housing development that gets helps from the American
government.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke before more than a thousand people _ most of them
Muslims _ who gathered at sunset in the ruins of El Badi Palace, a
16th-century compound fragrant with orange trees and surrounded by
towering adobe walls. Although she had previously expressed her
support for American service personnel, her remarks this evening on
the fighting were her most extensive.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton accused Milosevic of having tried for 10 years to
fan ethnic and religious hatred in Yugoslavia. ``He did it for his
own personal political advantage,'' she said. ``Tolerance, he
thought, would not give him any advantage. But exploiting the
consequences of division, waging war on his neighbors and his
people, is what he thought was in his own personal interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mrs. Clinton said, President Milosevic is pursuing the same
sort of policy that he carried out in Bosnia, pointedly noting that
most of the Albanians in Kosovo are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, she said, had found waging war easier than building a
modern state. ``It is difficult, very difficult in today's world to
make some of the hard decisions that must be made in peace,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also attacked the treatment of women by the
Taliban, the fundamentalist Muslim group that controls most of
Afghanistan, and recalled the killings of hundreds of thousands of
people in Rwanda in 1994. At the same time, she congratulated
Morocco on a ``tradition of tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   On her stops in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, Mrs. Clinton, who is
traveling with her daughter, Chelsea, has visited several mosques
and repeatedly stressed American support for Islam, even as she has
condemned its fundamentalist strain.
</P>
<P>
   She has also stopped in several churches and synagogues, and she
visited a 440-year-old Jewish cemetery here on Monday evening. ``We
are all children of God,'' she said Tuesday evening. ``We are all
children of Abraham.''

<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ Major League Baseball's first season opener
to be played outside the United States or Canada is scheduled for
Monterrey on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   The game has caused so much excitement that tickets sold out in
three hours when they went on sale here last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican fans hope that the opening game, between the San Diego
Padres and the Colorado Rockies, means that the major leagues could
one day have an expansion team in Monterrey, Mexico's baseball
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Major league executives say only that the game is part of their
campaign to globalize baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making an enormous statement by opening the season in
Mexico,'' a vice president of Major League Baseball, Timothy J.
Brosnan, said. ``Its part of our plan to grow the game worldwide.
Mexico is our neighbor, and there's a great Latin baseball
tradition. We want to bring the game to our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, Mexico's baseball leagues have served as a
training ground for American players and have produced Mexican
greats like Fernando Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   When major league executives decided this year to schedule the
game in Mexico, it was little surprise that Monterrey was chosen
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Monterrey Stadium is Mexico's largest and most comfortable
baseball park, seating 25,000 spectators. The Monterrey Sultanes
are recurring champions, and the city has 50 branches of Little
League, as well as the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The game will open the 1999 season for the major leagues. But
the season for Mexico's summer league, which has 16 teams
affiliated with the U.S.' minor leagues, started on March 17. The
Sultanes met the Saraperos of Saltillo, an automobile-manufacturing
city an hour's drive west through the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mexican opener, fans were not munching hot dogs, but
platefuls of peanuts smothered in chile sauce. Otherwise the
baseball rituals were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Families wept during a scoreboard video tribute to fabled
Mexican baseball stars. An army bugler played Mexico's national
anthem as the sun dipped behind the Sierra Madre over the right
field fence, and the governor of the state of Nuevo Leon's threw
out the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play ball!'' the announcer beckoned in English.
</P>
<P>
   The Sultanes-Saraperos game drew 12,000 fans, partly because
even in Monterrey, baseball in Mexico is overshadowed by soccer.
And many working-class fans poured savings into buying tickets for
the major league opener and could not afford to buy tickets for the
Mexican opener, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for regular Mexican League games, including the March 17
opener, range from 50 pesos, about $5, for seats behind home plate
to 10 pesos, about $1, for the outfield bleachers. Tickets for the
Padres-Rockies game ranged from $60 for the best seats to $10 for
the bleachers, about twice the daily minimum wage earned by many
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got mine,'' said Sigifredo Cantu, 32, the owner of a
trucking company who was seated in a box along the third base line
during the Mexican League opener. ``I watch fun baseball in this
stadium twice a week. But what's lacking here is really great
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has had great baseball in times past. In the 1940s, a
wealthy Mexican team owner, Jorge Pasquel, recruited a string of
American greats to play in the Mexican League _ including Josh
Gibson, Max Lanier, Roy Campanella and Satchell Paige _ at salaries
that were considerably higher than in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After Pasquel began to court Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bob
Feller and others, an infuriated American commissioner, Happy
Chandler, declared the Mexican League off limits to American
players until after Pasquel's death in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, exchanges between Mexican and U.S. baseball have
accelerated. In 1990, the Dodgers, with Valenzuela pitching, played
an exhibition series here with the Brewers, led by a Mexican
pitcher, Teddy Higuera.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, a consortium of Monterrey executives applied
to Major League Baseball for an expansion team, but withdrew the
application when a peso devaluation damaged the Mexican economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Padres and the Mets played a series of regular
season games here, the first time that had happened outside the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the major league opener has revived talk about a Mexican
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the major leagues open their season in Monterrey is a
point of pride for us,'' Gov. Fernando Canales Clariond of Nuevo
Leon said after throwing out the first pitch on March 17. ``We have
great fans and we feel very close to baseball. But the cost of
sustaining a major league team _ well, it's high. So it's a
question of working out the arithmetic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pat Courtney, a spokesman, said Major League Baseball, which has
two teams in Canada, said the corporation had ``no concrete plans
for the foreseeable future'' to expand into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it an area that's talked about?'' he asked. ``Yes, it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sultanes owner, Jose Maiz Garcia, who filed the expansion
application in 1994, said it was too early for Monterrey to think
about refiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' Maiz said, rising to cheer a base hit by a Sultanes
batter as he watched from a box seat behind the plate. ``Our
economy still hasn't gotten back to 1994 levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Ty Gainey, a former Houston Astros center fielder
from South Carolina who plays for the Sultanes, smacked a homer
with two runners on. What did he think of the chances for a major
league expansion club in Monterrey, he was asked later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some major league players probably wouldn't be able to adapt
to living in Mexico,'' Gainey said. ``The food. The water. If you
can play here, you can play anywhere. But an expansion team is
still possible, because Mexican fans really love baseball.''

IT MAY BE ROMANTIC, BUT IT'S NOT A BLUE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Like the countless earthlings who will mistakenly
celebrate the dawn of a new millennium on Jan. 1, 2000, one
researcher says many people will think Wednesday's full moon will
be a ``Blue Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be. For more than a half-century, public opinion has
held that a Blue Moon is a second full moon in any given month,
like the one Wednesday. That mistaken definition can be traced to a
1946 article in Sky &AMP; Telescope magazine, and from there its
acceptance has grown astronomically.
</P>
<P>
   Don Olson, a professor of physics at Southwest Texas State
University at San Marcos, sheds new light on what a Blue Moon is in
an article to appear in Sky &AMP; Telescope in May.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the mistake now has such widespread acceptance that
``it's like a genie that can't be forced back into its bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not necessarily a bad thing,'' he said. ``Rather
than argue over whether to celebrate the dawn of the new millennium
on January 1st, 2000 or 2001, those with the sunniest outlooks will
celebrate twice. Why not treat Blue Moons the same way? Both
occurrences are interesting. I think we can appreciate both.''
</P>
<P>
   The new millennium technically does not begin until Jan. 1,
2001, even though celebrations are being planned a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Olson says a Blue Moon occurs when a particular season contains
four full moons. In that event, the third full moon is the blue
one.
</P>
<P>
   All other full moons of the year are named for seasonal
activities, such as the Harvest Moon, the Lenten Moon or the
Hunter's Moon.
</P>
<P>
   The two-full-moons-in-one-month definition was established by
James Hugh Pruett in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett based his definition on what Olson and others say was a
mistaken assumption from an earlier Sky &AMP; Telescope article, which
took its information from a 1937 Maine Farmer's Almanac. The
almanac called the 13th full moon of a year a Blue Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett wrote that if there were 13 full moons in a year, one
month must have had two full moons. ``This second in a month, so I
interpret it, was called Blue Moon,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong, but other magazines reprinted the mistake. It made
its way to the popular StarDate program on public radio and to the
board game Trivial Pursuit, cementing it in popular culture. Frank
Sinatra once crooned a love song, ``Blue Moon,'' originally written
by Rogers and Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, Sky &AMP; Telescope publisher Rick Fienberg and associate
editor Roger Sinnott located a copy of the 1937 Maine Farmer's
Almanac and found that it called a full moon of Aug. 21 that year a
Blue Moon. Since a lunar cycle is 29-1/2 days, a second full moon
could not have happened on the 21st of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The almanac used a seasonal year _ winter solstice to winter
solstice _ rather than a calendar year, making the Aug. 21 moon,
not the second of the month, but the third of a summer with four
full moons.
</P>
<P>
   The authors found 12 references to Blue Moons in various
editions of the almanac, and none fit the definition based on two
full moons in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable media attention has been focused on the Blue Moon
phenomenon lately because there were two full moons in January and
March this year.
</P>
<P>
   The next real Blue Moon, according to the Olson, will be Feb.
19, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A Blue Moon occurs about seven times every 19 years, using
either definition, but they would not fall on the same dates.
</P>
<P>
   Olson still has not found where the ``blue'' originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on it right now,'' he said. ``No one has ever
been able to find out why they call it a Blue Moon. The almanac
implies that it comes from England and comes from Anglo-Saxon
times. I've checked the few books I could find on Anglo-Saxon
astronomy, but I have not found anything about Blue Moons.''

HIGH-SPEED AMTRAK BEGINS TO ROLL, SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 4)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, when Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ended state financing for
the proposed 320-mile high-speed rail project that would have
linked Miami, Orlando and Tampa, the future of high-speed train
service in the United States suffered an apparent major setback.
</P>
<P>
   But an unlikely savior _ make that an unlikely  &UR; possible &LR;  savior
_ rode toward the rescue in March: Amtrak, that much maligned
national passenger rail system created by Congress in 1971, which
has lost money every year since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (While the cause of the recent Amtrak crash south of Chicago
that killed 11 people and injured more than 100 after colliding
with a truck at an intersection has not yet been determined, it did
not involve high speed rails or high speed trains. And the train
was not exceeding the 79 mph limit.)
</P>
<P>
   In February, Amtrak unveiled the first of 20 high-speed trains
that will go into service later this year along the Northeast
Corridor, the 470-mile strip linking Washington, New York and
Boston. The new trains, renamed Acela, to suggest a combination of
excellence and acceleration, will race along at 150 mph, Amtrak
officials said; their top speed today is 90 mph between Boston and
New York and 125 mph between New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The higher speed, a result of track improvements and technology
that allows the new trains to tilt into curves with little danger
of derailment or of disrupting passengers when the trains bank,
would cut 30 minutes from the present four-hour New York to Boston
trip and up to 30 minutes between New York and Washington. As an
added lure, Amtrak officials said that fares will be 30 percent
lower than walk-up fares on US Airways' and Delta's shuttle
flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That saving presumably would make Acela more attractive to
passengers, especially business travelers. In addition, the new
cars will offer electrical outlets for laptop computers and audio
entertainment, televised news updates, tables to spread out papers
or hold meetings, enlarged lounges and bathrooms, and better food,
drinks and luggage storage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Amtrak's ambitious plans for the Northeast Corridor succeed _
enabling the line to become self-sufficient by 2002, when its
federal subsidy is scheduled to end _ the railroad next plans a $25
million network of high-speed trains linking nine Midwestern states
from Ohio to Nebraska, with Chicago as the hub. Then it hopes to
add other regions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those trains are still some years down the road. Meanwhile,
about a dozen other high-speed routes are already on the drawing
boards or under construction. They range in length from 85 miles,
between Chicago and Milwaukee, to 676 miles, the so-called
California corridor that would link San Diego, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Sacramento. Projected costs for the projects range
from $29 billion for the California corridor to $315 million to
link the Buffalo-Albany portion of the 430-mile Empire corridor
between Buffalo and New York City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trains are expected to exceed 100 mph, with the fastest in
California. One of the two types of train under consideration there
would be capable of 220 mph; the other could run at speeds up to
310 mph. Unlike other projects, which would use existing tracks,
California's proposes a new rail line solely for high-speed
trains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed projections assume that signals are improved,
curves straightened and stations rebuilt. So far improvements have
progressed only in the Northeast Corridor, which carried more than
9 million passengers in fiscal 1997 (7 million on the New
York-Washington portion). Electrification of the final link,
between New Haven and Boston, is scheduled for completion late this
year, with high-speed service to follow soon afterward.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other potential high-speed corridors include Eugene, Ore., to
Vancouver, Canada, and Washington to Charlotte, N.C. There is a
proposal to link Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and one for
Birmingham, Ala., and New Orleans, eventually hooking up with
Houston. The wide-ranging Midwestern project envisioned by Amtrak
would encompass three smaller corridors in which Chicago would be
the linchpin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent General Accounting Office report to Congress said that
most of the proposals for high-speed corridors are unclear about
where the money is coming from and some are still developing
feasibility studies. The agency cautioned that ``high-speed rail
systems are costly, and thus ridership levels may not be high
enough in the United States for systems to cover their costs.''
Equally discouraging, Amtrak has only 0.3 percent of the nation's
total passenger traffic, according to the Amtrak Reform Council,
established by Congress in 1997 to monitor the railroad's progress.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the pessimistic GAO report was issued more than a month
before Amtrak officials pulled the high-speed rabbit out of their
hats. And since that report, Amtrak officials have pointed to the
news from their recently completed fiscal year _ e.g., their
largest ridership increase in a decade, their best on-time
performance in 13 years and their first $1 billion-plus passenger
revenues ever _ as strong evidence that they have turned the
corner.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, especially those in Congress, will probably say they
have heard that before from Amtrak. About the best that supporters
of high-speed rail can do is hope that this time Amtrak is right.  &QL;

 SUGAR, SUGAR: Cane and beet share the same chemistry but act 
 differently in the kitchen  
   
   
 By Miriam Morgan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Carolyn Weil and her crew at The Bake Shop in
Berkeley were hard at work one morning, boiling down large pots of
sugar syrup to make buttercream for the day's buns, cakes and
confections.
<P>
   It was a task the staff had done hundreds of times. But this
morning the normally silky syrup crystallized into large, chunky
granules. Weil tossed it, along with plans for most of the baked
goods she wanted to sell that day.
</P>
<P>
   Not happy with a day's work and income wasted, Weil
investigated, checking her equipment and ingredients and
determining the one variable.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Weil's supplier had substituted another brand and, as it turns
out, another type of sugar altogether. Weil thought she was getting
cane sugar, but instead she got beet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what sugar industry officials claim, beet and cane sugar
are not alike. And the sugar industry isn't bothering to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The labels of most brands of sugars on supermarket shelves
neglect to say whether what's inside is cane or beet. In some
brands, the contents can vary from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle tested and blind-tasted creme brulee, cookies and
cakes made with beet and cane sugar and found that indeed there is
a difference. In all cases, the products made with cane were
superior.
</P>
<P>
   However, many in the sugar industry disregard such results,
because the conventional wisdom is that beet and cane are the same
_ both types are sucrose and chemically identical.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that both kinds are sucrose, but only 99.95 percent,
and that minuscule 0.05 percent _ made up of trace differences in
minerals and proteins _ can have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the 0.05 percent difference comes from the fact that
cane and beets are two different plants altogether. Beets are a
root, growing below ground; cane is a grass, waving in the breeze.
``That alone can account for mineral profile and content
differences,'' says Charles Baker, vice president for scientific
affairs for The Sugar Association, a nonprofit group focusing on
sugar's role in diet and health. Other variations are the result of
processing.
</P>
<P>
   The beet versus cane controversy is a new development. Cane was
once the dominant sugar in U.S. markets, but within the last few
years beet has taken the lead. Beet now accounts for 55 percent of
the 10 million tons of refined sugar consumed in the country each
year. And, according to Ben Goodwin, executive manager of
California Beet Growers Association, the percentage is expected to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that beet sugar is generally cheaper to produce.
It requires just one refining process at a single plant.
Traditional cane refining demands two processes at two different
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Beets can also thrive in a wider range of climates. This large,
homely root _ not anything like a regular beet _ is cultivated in
12 states; cane grows in just four. And while total U.S. cane and
beet acreage has declined dramatically over the last few years,
cane has dropped most precipitously. Hawaii alone has lost more
than 60 percent of its cane fields over the last five years _
victims of urbanization and conversion to better-paying crops like
macadamia nuts and coffee, says Roehl Flores cq &LR; , director of
marketing for C&AMP;H Cane Sugar Co.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry continue to dispute the signifigance of the
shift from cane to beet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell any difference, and I don't think anyone else
can,'' says Joseph Terrell, director of public affairs for the
American Sugar Alliance, a trade association. ``The difference is
where it is grown and some of the processing, but once it becomes
sugar, there's no difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see disaster looming on the horizon. Marion
Cunningham, The Chronicle's ``Home Cooking'' columnist and author
of the ``Fannie Farmer Cookbook,'' says the shift from beet to cane
endangers some traditional American recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters in recipes for baked goods like angel food cake. It
just isn't right with beet sugar. Lazy Daisy Cake, a wonderful old
sponge cake from the past, is a real problem when it's made with
beet sugar. It's coarse. All of those types of recipes are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown sugar can be a particular problem because of the way it's
made.
</P>
<P>
   Brown cane sugar _ a combination of sugar and molasses, both
inherent in the sugarcane plant _ is produced naturally as part of
the process of refining white cane sugar by the traditional method,
crystallization.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sugar from C&AMP;H Sugar Co. and other cane refiners uses the
process, but beet sugar is different. It's made by refining the
sugar all the way to the final white granular stage, stripping off
all the molasses because beet molasses is unfit for human
consumption (it's recycled as cattle feed). Then cane molasses is
added back into the sugar through a process called ``painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Painting coats the granules but does not necessarily penetrate
them _ the molasses can sometimes be rubbed right off.
</P>
<P>
   As with white sugar, these different types of sugars act
differently in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Food staff baked five batches of bar cookies in
our test kitchen, each using a different brand of light brown
sugar. Tasters didn't know which was which. The cookies made with
cane were far superior in taste and texture to those made from beet
(see related story).
</P>
<P>
   We then made a second batch, using just one brand of sugar _ C&AMP;H
Light Brown Sugar _ to see if results would be consistent between
different packages. We used a new bag, right off the store shelf,
and a partly used one that had been stored in a home pantry for
several weeks. Again, there were differences, but they were slight
compared to the ones in the first tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture differences, industry experts say, may account for the
variation in both instances.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is less dramatic with white granulated sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I've used beet sugar for baking cakes, and there have
not been any problems that I know of,'' says The Chronicle's baking
columnist Flo Braker.
</P>
<P>
   However, when we baked four versions of her Butterscotch Pound
Cake _ using white granulated beet sugar, white granulated cane,
light brown beet and light brown cane _ the differences in crumb
texture, appearance and flavor were apparent, although subtle (see
related story).
</P>
<P>
   They weren't subtle in creme brulee, however. In our testing of
white beet sugar we found that it refused to caramelize on top (see
photo on cover page).
</P>
<P>
   We prepared several ramekins of creme brulee, topping them with
either beet or cane granulated sugar. When caramelized with a small
blow torch _ the traditional way of browning the topping _ the cane
sugar became brown and bubbly and the beet burned in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   These are reasons that some professionals specify a type or even
a brand of sugar. Because of her own experiences at The Bake Shop
and as a cooking teacher, Weil always requests C&AMP;H. In fact, Weil
has become so devoted to the brand that she became a spokesperson
for the company after research for this story began.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco confectioner Joseph Schmidt, nationally renowned
for his chocolate truffles and other candy, also prefers cane
sugar. ``I always order C&AMP;H,'' he says. ``When I make caramel, it
seems to be cleaner. And it `snaps' better when I make brittle and
things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers who specify a type or brand of sugar will not
reveal what it is because their recipes are proprietary. But C&AMP;H's
Flores says that some caramel popcorn and cinnamon roll producers
as asking for his company's brown sugar because of its molasses
content and uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, however, don't have the luxury of knowing what
they're getting. Labeling law doesn't require a cane or beet
designation. C&AMP;H is the only mass-market producer to do so; other
refiners decline. The question is why.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Association's Baker suggests that some manufacturers
may consider the beet or cane designation simply ``a marketing
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   oodwin of the state's beet growers' association says he's
puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why beet sugar producers don't label their
sugar.'' He theorizes that perhaps beet producers can't compete
with the ad program of a company like C&AMP;H, which has been touting
its ``pure cane'' product for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cane sugar has a long tradition and beet sugar is starting
from scratch,'' he says. ``I guess the beet sugar people are able
to sell the product through other channels without building
consumer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cunningham argues that the source should be on the label
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, she says, ``people need to know what they're
getting. Otherwise they'll be frustrated. They won't understand why
things are turning out the way they are.''

 To the Body, It's All the Same  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Your body really doesn't care if you dump in white
sugar, honey or some other form of natural sweetener. The bottom
line is your cells read it all as a simple carbohydrate called
sucrose.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And sucrose, or sugar, is a perfectly sound energy source for
most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really wrong with sugar in and of itself,''
says Ann Coulston, president of the American Dietetic Association
and a researcher at Stanford University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refined sugars and most foods we think of in that category _
honey, syrups, fruit sugars and brown sugars _ are almost pure
carbohydrate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hazard, dietitians agree, comes when people get a
disproportionate share of their calories from pure sucrose instead
of from food sources, such as fruits and vegetables, that contain
sucrose and other nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Consuming more than 10 percent of daily calories in the form of
added sugars can be detrimental to health, says a set of dietary
recommendations developed by the U.S. departments of Health and
Human Services and Agriculture. A teaspoon of sugar contains about
15 calories.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. honey producers, whose crop is worth about $145 million a
year, say honey has a lot that sugar doesn't: vitamins,
anti-oxidants and the ability to fight some bacteria. Producers of
turbinado (sometimes called raw) sugar, which is essentially table
sugar grabbed just before the molasses is cleaned from it, say
their product is less processed and therefore better for you.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd have to eat so much of either to gain the benefits,
you'd exceed recommended consumption levels, dietitians counter.
</P>
<P>
   But honey has an edge if you're looking to reduce your overall
intake of added sugar, says Patricia Hart of San Francisco, a
registered dietitian and chef. Because honey has more fructose than
table sugar, you could get away with lower amounts in recipes, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 cup of honey will offer the same sweetening power as
11/4 cups of sugar. But substituting honey for sugar can change the
nature of the food, both in texture and flavor. Sugar contains more
air than honey, so a baked product with honey will be denser, if
nothing else.

 &QL; 
 &UR; Which Is Beet, Which Is Cane &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
For the typical consumer buying sugar off the grocers' shelf,
economics rather than performance determines what they will get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on price from the producers,'' says Judie Decker,
spokeswoman for Lucky Stores, Inc. Lady Lee and Lucky, Lucky's
house brands, can be cane one time, beet another, she admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy from C&AMP;H and from Holly. If the supplier is Holly, it's
beet sugar. If it's C&AMP;H, it's cane. It's random. We never know
ahead of time.'' Lucky does not specify either cane or beet on the
label.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Spreckels, with factories in Woodland and
Mendota, and Holly, with a plant in Tracy, manufacture beet sugar
and sell it under the Spreckels, Albertson's, Best Yet and
Springfield labels.
</P>
<P>
   Spreckels and Holly are owned by Imperial Holly of Sugar Land,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   C&AMP;H, with a sole refinery in Crockett, is the only cane producer
on the West Coast. C&AMP;H also produces cane sugar for the Safeway
label found in Northern California stores. Safeway label brown
sugar in Arizona and the Pacific Northwest is beet sugar produced
by Imperial Holly, according to Bob Baldwin of Imperial Sugar Co.
in Tracy.

 &LR; Sugar, or sucrose, occurs naturally in all fruits and vegetables
as a result of photosynthesis, the process that converts the sun's
energy into food reserves. Sucrose is found in the greatest
quantities in the stalks of sugar cane and the roots of sugar
beets, the two major sources of commercial sugar. There are many
variations of sugar and different levels of refinement, so you
should choose the type of sugar that meets your needs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Granulated white (table) sugar &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beet brands:  &LR; Spreckels, Holly, Springfield, Best Yet,
Albertson's and sometimes Lady Lee and Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cane brands:  &LR; C&AMP;H, Safeway in Northern California, Domino and
sometimes Lady Lee and Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Both cane and beet white sugars are highly purified with no
residual extra flavors and no nutrients, fat or fiber. Both are
refined to 99.95 percent sucrose. The remaining .05 percent is made
up of various trace minerals and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Both are good all-purpose sugars, although many bakers and
confectioners prefer cane. Even though modern refining techniques
have eliminated impurities once found in beet sugar, it may not
produce the expected results in sugar syrups, caramel and some
baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Castor sugar &LR; . A British version of ``extra superfine'' sugar.
Because it dissolves easily, castor sugar is good for sweetening
cold liquids and making meringues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Powdered (or confectioner's) sugar. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beet and cane varieties:  &LR; Same brands as granulated sugars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Granulated sugar that has been pulverized then mixed with
cornstarch to prevent clumping. Powdered sugar is generally used
for decorative purposes or in candy and icings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Invert sugar &LR; . A liquid carbohydrate sweetener thats the
product of sugar refining. Many manufacturers add it to brown sugar
and other products like baked goods and sorbets to retain moisture,
prevent crystallization and promote shelf life. It also are used to
control graining in candy making. It's often found on the
ingredient list of beet brown sugars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brown sugar. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beet and cane varieties:  &LR; Same brands as granulated sugars.
</P>
<P>
   Brown cane sugar is a step in the process of refining white
sugar. Brown cane sugars made by the crystallization process, like
C&AMP;H, retain the natural cane molasses throughout the sugar
crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Brown beet sugars (and some brands of cane sugar) are made by
the process called painting. The molasses is removed (beet molasses
is unfit for human consumption) and then cane molasses is
``painted'' back onto the sugar crystals. The molasses in painted
brown sugars does not permeate the sugar crystals uniformly and can
give uneven results in baking and poor results in caramelizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dark brown sugar has more molasses than light or golden brown
sugar and a more pronounced molasses flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sugar can be substituted for white granulated sugar in the
same amounts, but will change the texture and moisture content and
add molasses flavor to the final product.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Molasses.  &LR; A by-product of the refining process. Sugar cane
processing requires three boilings to extract the juice, producing
molasses. Both light and dark molasses are used for making cakes,
cookies and gingerbread.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Raw sugar &LR; . True raw sugar is inedible. What is sold as ``sugar
in the raw'' in the U.S. is actually turbinado sugar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turbinado.  &LR; Almost completely refined cane sugar, just shy of
the last redissolving process. The crystals are large and crunchy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Demerara.  &LR; A partially refined sugar from Guyana. Both
turbinado and Demerara are generally sprinkled on baked goods for
texture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Muscovado.  &LR; Minimally refined brown cane sugar with a sticky
candylike texture and bittersweet taste. Dark and intense,
muscovado is used in gingerbread, chutney and barbecue sauces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fructose &LR; . Fructose is fruit sugar, a component of sucrose or
refined sugar. Commercial fructose comes from corn. It can be as
much as twice as sweet as sucrose. Fructose is sold in granulated
form but acts very differently than granulated sugar and is not
recommended for baking or caramelizing _ it will simply melt.
Fructose is a component of high fructose corn syrup which is used
for sweetening soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Glucose. &LR;  Derived from cornstarch and sold in syrup form, it is
80 percent as sweet as sucrose. Glucose is used commercially to
increase the sugar content of beer and wine and to make syrup and
jam. It also increases the shelf life of baked goods.

 &HT;    BellSouth Classic: It's gotta be the shoes
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Heavy metal just doesn't quite cut it in golf these
days, and who would have believed it? When non-metal spikes first
appeared in 1993 as plastic swirls questioned by traditionalists,
few figured that by now many of the players on the PGA and Senior
tours would be using cleats that don't click on the cartpaths.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Darrell Survey Co., which provides statistics
for golf equipment manufacturers, 48.1 percent of PGA Tour players
and 68 percent of Senior Tour players are wearing non-metal spikes
this season.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the converted masses are no longer just players
being forced to adapt to local club rules, such as those for
members of the TPC at Sugarloaf in Duluth, Ga., which prohibits
metal spikes 51 other weeks of the year. Many of the best players
in the world are trading in their beloved nails for plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see any steel spikes at all in
five years, and maybe less than that,'' said Marietta's Larry
Nelson, who plays on the Senior Tour. ``All the young kids are
growing up on them. They don't know anything about metal spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Non-metal spikes were introduced during one of
golf's biggest booms as a way to prevent damage to the greens and,
in turn, improve putting. Greenskeepers raved over the new product,
leading many of the nation's courses, including most PGA Tour
venues, including Sugarloaf, Muirfield Village in Ohio, Castle
Pines in Colorado and Augusta National, to mandate non-metal
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're a professional golfer making the tour
stop. The PGA Tour has no rules against metal spikes, and when the
Tour comes to town, its players have the option.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the debate begins on whether non-metal spikes
are a fad or whether they have improved the greens and, in turn,
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you lose is spike marks,'' said former
BellSouth Classic winner Paul Stankowski, a proponent of non-metal
spikes. ``I can't tell any difference. I think once every golf
course in America is banning metal spikes, I think metal spikes are
going to be put out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not everyone feels comfortable using the non-metal
spikes, most golfers say that if Mark Calcavecchia, whose feet
regularly slide at impact, can use them, anyone can.
</P>
<P>
   But Calcavecchia wears metal. He says he only wears non-metal
during rounds at his home course in Scottsdale, where it's
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia isn't convinced that non-metal spikes improve the
greens, except perhaps in summer when bentgrass is pulled up during
periods of high humidity. He said the crescent impressions that
artificial spikes make in soft greens are just as bothersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think they're any more comfortable,''
Calcavecchia said. ``I don't like hitting fairway bunker shots in
them. I don't even really like hitting greenside bunker shots in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia draws a sharp distinction between a tour pro
playing in non-metal spikes and a country club making them
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably better for most clubs, because the greens
will stay smoother,'' he said. ``Those old (people) can't walk in
spikes anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golf Club of Georgia, which hosts the Senior PGA Tour
Nationwide Championship next month, estimates that non-metal spikes
can save as much as $100,000 a year just through decreased damage
to greens, indoor carpets, asphalt areas, steps, wooden trim and
golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Country Club assistant superintendent Mark Douglas said
the non-metal policy the club adopted two years ago means, ``that
at the end of the day you've still got a smooth surface to putt
on.'' But he said members sometimes are duped into believing
non-metal spikes won't scrape the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives members a false sense of, `Hey, I can shimmy-shake if
I miss a putt now,' and they get a little sloppy,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   One ACC member is allowed to wear metal spikes for medical
reasons. ``And you can tell by the greens when that member plays,''
Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Many tour players, including Nelson, started wearing non-metal
spikes because their home courses demanded it, and now they wear
them all the time, for comfort and convenience. Now, hardly anyone
on the Senior Tour wears metal. Lee Trevino, in fact, once
suggested that players wearing non-metal spikes be allowed to tap
down spike marks, thereby rewarding them for not adding to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I kind of saw what they did for the greens, it was
really just a matter of finding the right ones,'' said Nelson, who
wears the ``spider'' spikes with cleats that flare to add traction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first ones they came out with were probably more dangerous
than they were helpful,'' Nelson said, ``but the ones they make now
probably give you better footing than steel spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are players who make particularly large swing
turns, including Tiger Woods, who usually stick with the
traditional metal spikes to remain planted. Atlanta's Stewart Cink,
for example, only uses non-metal when practicing at home at either
East Lake or Sugarloaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried pretty much all of them, and I slip,'' Cink said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, who practices in non-metal spikes because of
requirements at courses near his Phoenix home, wears metal spikes
on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slip quite a few times, especially when I really go after
(the ball),'' Mickelson said. ``I think that they're a real
positive for the game, but I don't want to risk a shot or a
tournament or even dollar amounts on that possibility. I would just
rather go with something that I have more confidence in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think that tour players don't typically have a problem
with spike marks, in that we tend to walk a little more conducive
to not creating spike marks. We don't drag our feet. I'm not saying
a lot of people do, but a lot of first-time players forget that
they actually have spikes on and get a little sloppy.''
</P>
<P>
   Non-metal spikes have improved greens, ``under all conditions
except soft greens,'' Mickelson said. ``And then I think they're
every bit as bad or worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, who started wearing non-metal last year, said his
non-metal shoes feel so comfortable ``that I could go dancing in
these things.'' He plans to take metal and non-metal to Augusta,
``because that grass is cut really tight.''
</P>
<P>
   While the pros have that choice, amateur golfers have been left
out in the cold. Non-metal policies have been adopted at an
estimated 3,000 courses.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson has a short answer when asked if the PGA Tour will
ever mandate a change to non-metal spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Why would we make a rule that guys can't wear
metal spikes? It's our tour.''

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Hawthorne Lane Cod Dresses Up for Dinner  
   
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  At Hawthorne Lane, David and Anne Gingrass combine
Eastern and Western flavors on the same menu. You can get a
Gorgonzola pizza with toasted walnuts and balsamic onions in the
bar, for example, or a crispy duck spring roll in the main dining
room.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Signature dishes include Chinese-style roast duck with green
onion buns, house-smoked salmon and an impressive seafood platter
of spot prawns, lobster, crab, mussels, cockles and clams.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the few Western restaurants to feature a fish
tank for live prawns, which are used in many dishes, including
steamed with curried noodle salad in a chile soy broth.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite dish, however, is the rich, velvety-textured
Miso-Glazed Black Cod. The fish marinates overnight, which imparts
a distinctive flavor. Then it's simply broiled, emerging from the
oven with a caramelized top and just a hint of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   It can be served on its own or with the accompanying sesame
spinach rolls, flavored with lime-soy vinaigrette. It's an
innovative dish you won't find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrasses met when they were students at the Culinary
Institute of America in upstate New York. In the early 1980s, they
moved to California and both wound up at Spago, where Anne was the
chef and David was kitchen manager.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1985 and were tapped by Wolfgang Puck to open
Postrio, his first restaurant outside Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The duo quickly shot to the top rank of San Francisco chefs and,
after working at Postrio more than five years, left to open their
own restaurant, Hawthorne Lane, in 1995. It's one of the most
popular and impressive restaurants in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The loftlike building features an expansive interior with
refined finishing elements, including a polished elliptical bar,
beautiful table settings and splashy modern artwork on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Hawthorne Lane, 22 Hawthorne St. (off Howard Street, between &LR; 
 &LR; Second and Third streets), San Francisco; (415) 777-9779. Open &LR; 
 &LR; for lunch weekdays, dinner nightly. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE SECRET
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Keep the fish moist.  &LR; Black cod is a rich, silky-textured fish that
can lose much of its charm when overcooked. The trick is to get a
deep mahogany color without drying out the fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrasses solved the problem by using a bit of sugar in the
sauce. It's the same technique that is used to give Chinese-style
duck its rich color. The delicate fish browns, yet the fish remains
moist.

</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To prepare the spinach rolls:  &LR; Blanch the cabbage leaves in
boiling salted water until limp. Drain. Spread each leaf
ribbed-side up on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, trim
the thickest part of the center rib flat with the leaf. Blot the
leaves dry and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Select 20 of the best looking spinach leaves (they should be
about the same size) and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saucepan over
medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and shallots;
cook just long enough to release the aroma. Add the remaining
spinach and stir quickly to coat the leaves. Cook until the spinach
becomes completely limp. Season with salt and pepper. Remove
spinach and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Press all the liquid from the spinach; divide in half and roll
each half into a 1-inch-diameter cylinder. Wrap tightly in the
blanched cabbage leaves. Rub the leaves lightly with the remaining
1 teaspoon oil, then roll in sesame seeds to coat.
</P>
<P>
   If made ahead, wrap the rolls in plastic wrap until ready to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the vinaigrette:  &LR; Combine the soy sauce, lime juice,
vinegar, shallot and garlic in a small bowl; season with salt and
pepper. Stir to mix. Slowly add the sesame and peanut oils,
whisking to form an emulsion. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble:  &LR; Toss the reserved spinach leaves in a small
amount of vinaigrette and arrange 5 leaves along the rim of each
serving plate. Cut each spinach roll into 6 slices; arrange 3
pieces on each plate. If serving with the Black Cod, place a fillet
in the center of each place. Serve with the remaining dressing,
either in a small pitcher or in individual dipping bowls.

 QUICK COOK: Pork Takes the Cure to Become Ham  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Have you ever wondered why it's so hard to find a
fresh leg of pork at the meat counter? That's because most of them
are tagged for curing, to produce hams.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's Quick Cook is built on a fully cooked, smoked ham. A
meat that is popular at Easter, ham is easy to make, easy to store
and easy to incorporate into numerous dishes throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Hams fall into two broad categories: Wet-cured, in which the
meat is soaked in or injected with brine; and dry-cured, in which a
salt-spice mixture is rubbed onto the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Country hams, including the renowned Smithfield ham from
Smithfield County, Va., are examples of a dry-cured ham. Country
hams need soaking before they are ready to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Other dry-cured hams include Italy's prosciutto and Spain's
glorious jamon serrano.
</P>
<P>
   Corn cob-smoked hams, ``spiral-cut'' hams and Polish hams are
examples of wet-cured hams. They often are smoked, and are sold
fully cooked. Home cooks can add additional flavor to these hams _
for instance, with a brown-sugar glaze, with pineapple and clove or
with an apricot glaze _ but the meat really requires only
reheating.
</P>
<P>
   A fully cooked, smoked ham is almost effortless to prepare even
though it takes a few hours in the oven because of its size. As in
today's Master Recipe, low heat works best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: SMOKED HAM WITH BOURBON GLAZE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ham is already cooked, so bake it only until it is heated
through.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 smoked, fully cooked ham, 10 to 12 pounds
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup bourbon
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the rind from the fat side of the ham by creating a slit
at one corner with a knife and pulling the rind off with your
fingers. Score the fat with the knife to create a cross-hatch
pattern. Place the ham and any gelee from the wrapping in a
roasting pan. Bake for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whisk together the bourbon, sugar and allspice in a
bowl until the sugar is melted.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes of roasting, brush the ham with the bourbon
glaze. Continue roasting the ham for 21/2 to 3 hours, brushing with
glaze every 30 minutes or so, until an instant-read thermometer
inserted in several spots (away from the bone) registers 140
degrees. If you run out of glaze, you may brush the ham with the
pan juices. If the pan juices threaten to burn, stir in about 1/2
cup water.
</P>
<P>
   When the ham is heated, transfer it to a carving board. Place
the roasting pan over two burners on high heat. Heat the pan
juices, adding 1/2 cup water and scraping up all the bits that
cling to the bottom of the pan. Strain the juices, degrease and
serve with the ham. There should be about 3/4 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly carve 24 to 32 slices of ham; serve with the pan juices.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, cover and refrigerate the remaining ham for up to 5 days.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8, with leftovers.

 &UR; MORE IDEAS FOR LEFTOVERS &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A 10- to 12-pound baked ham will yield plenty of leftovers for
use throughout the week. Here are only a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ham and Collards: &LR;  Saute enough chopped onion and diced ham for
4 people in a little oil until the ham and onions are caramelized.
Deglaze the pan with a cup of water and boil for 2 minutes. Add a
10-ounce package of frozen, defrosted collard greens. Simmer for 5
minutes. Season with salt, if necessary, and hot sauce to taste.
Mixture should be soupy. Serve over rice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ham Steaks with Stewed Fruits: &LR;  Chop some dried apricots,
pears, dates and pineapple. Combine them in a small pan with water
to barely cover, a 2-inch piece of split vanilla bean, a small
piece of cinnamon stick and sugar to taste. Simmer until the liquid
is reduced by half. Add a little bourbon and simmer until the
alcohol burns off. Let stand, covered, until mixture is lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Cut steaks from the leftover baked ham _ make them about
3/4-inch thick. Saute in a large pan, turning once, until they are
heated through. Serve topped with a spoonful of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ham and Bliss Frittata: &LR;  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Boil red
Bliss potatoes in liberally salted water until they are tender.
Slice about 1/4-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Dice some baked ham, onions and a little green pepper. Saute
with the potatoes in olive oil until the vegetables are limp and
the potatoes begin to brown. Season well with salt and pepper.
Spread the mixture evenly in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly beat together 10 eggs, 1/4 cup water and a pinch of
salt. Pour the eggs over the vegetables. Cook over medium heat,
lifting the sides of the frittata periodically to allow the
uncooked egg to run underneath, until the eggs are almost set.
Sprinkle 1/2 cup coarsely grated Swiss cheese over the top. Finish
the frittata in the oven until the eggs are set and the cheese is
melted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ham Bone Soups: &LR;  When most of the meat has been taken from the
ham bone, simmer the bone and whatever ham bits remain in water to
cover for an hour. Add diced carrots, onions and a little diced
celery. Continue to simmer until the broth has a rich ham flavor.
Strain the broth.
</P>
<P>
   Ham is a good match with almost any bean or legume, so use the
broth as the basis for ham and black bean soup; ham and white bean
soup with sage; split pea soup; lentil, sauteed cabbage and ham
soup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ham and Cheese Bread Pudding: &LR;  Dice some baked ham and onions;
saute until the onion is wilted. Cool and combine with a generous
amount of coarsely grated provolone cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Cube some day-old French or Italian bread; combine the bread
with the ham mixture. Spread the bread mixture in a buttered baking
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together eggs, half-and-half, salt and pepper. Pour over
the bread, submerging the bread in the custard so it absorbs the
liquid. Let stand for 5 minutes. After standing, there should be
enough custard to just skim the top of the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 350-degree oven until the custard is set and the top
is browned, about 1 hour. Cool briefly on a rack before cutting and
serving.

 AT THE SOURCE: Creme de la Creamery _ Marin Maker Specializes in 
 Delicate Fresh Cheeses  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 POINT REYES STATION, Calif. _  Remember the diet plate of the '70s?
Hamburger patty, iceberg lettuce, tomato slices and a scoop of
cottage cheese? And in midcentury, cottage cheese and canned fruit
salad?
 &HT;    ``Cottage cheese was popularized in Great Britain and America _
and then it went out of fashion,'' Sue Conley says. After a moment,
the former chef/partner of Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley, who
is co-owner with Peggy Smith of Tomales Bay Foods, adds with a
chuckle, ``It's my favorite.''
 &HT;    It also has become the favorite of customers who have
rediscovered this simple fresh cheese from Tomales Bay's Cowgirl
Creamery, which Conley runs.
 &HT;    She makes all cheeses from organic milk shipped from the Straus
Family Creamery in Marshall 10 miles to the north, not in tanker
trucks but in old-fashioned 10-gallon stainless-steel cans.
 &HT;    Identified as clabbered cottage cheese, it is made in small
batches from cooked curds with buttermilk cultures, resulting in a
fresh, slightly tangy taste and creamy texture that are a far cry
from standard grocery-store cottage cheese.
 &HT;    Similar but a little drier is nonfat quark, a central and
northern European cheese made from uncooked curds with yogurt and
buttermilk cultures. Bill Straus remembers it from his German
childhood as ``a thick, tart spread ... smeared on toast in the
morning, plopped on baked potatoes in the evening and scooped onto
fresh fruit for dessert.''
 &HT;    Cowgirl labels its product Ellen's Nonfat Quark, named for Bill
Straus' wife, who bakes cheesecakes for Tomales Bay Foods most
weekends, using a mixture of quark and creme fraiche.
 &HT;    Cowgirl's creme fraiche has the rich and buttery, slightly nutty
quality that distinguishes this traditional soured cream in France.
 &HT;    The other French-inspired cheese, fromage blanc (literally
``white cheese''), is a cousin of American cream cheese. Made from
uncooked curds with buttermilk cultures, vegetable rennet and a
little creme fraiche, this has found its way onto the menus of many
Bay Area restaurants. Because it is made from whole milk rather
than cream, it has less fat than mass-produced cream cheese _ a
fact you wouldn't guess from its rich taste.
 &HT;    A favorite with supply-shopping picnickers is Olema Valley
Rounds. These cute little cheeses are fromage blanc coated with
organically grown parsley, tarragon and thyme, plus a little
pepper. When a wedge is cut from a cheese, a layer of herbs is
revealed like a bright green ring.
 &HT;    Just the other week, Conley reintroduced mozzarella, which she
stopped making in the fall: ``Can't have tomato season without
mozzarella,'' she says, laughing.
 &HT;    Cowgirl Creamery operates in the front of the charming, barnlike
Tomales Bay Foods store in Point Reyes Station. Depending on the
time of day, visitors can watch Conley at work through big windows.
A deli, presided over by Conley's business partner, former Cafe at
Chez Panisse chef Smith, is toward the back of the long space, near
a wine shop and shelves with packaged specialty organic foods and
bread from next-door neighbor Bay Village Bakery.
 &HT;    Almost as an afterthought, Conley points to a freezer chest with
half pints of house-made ice cream _ chocolate, blood orange and an
ethereal vanilla the day of our visit.
 &HT;    The use of top-notch organic ingredients and the labor-intensive
hand production methods mean that Cowgirl's offerings cost more
than mass-produced dairy products _ the ice creams are $2.75 each;
cottage cheese retails for $6 to $7 a pound _ but quality is of the
old-fashioned kind that would win the approval of the dairy
ranchers who pioneered west Marin in the 1800s.
 &HT;      Cowgirl Creamery products are sold at Tomales Bay Foods, 80 
 Fourth St., Point Reyes Station. Open 11 a.m.-6 p.m. 
 Wednesday-Sunday. Some cheeses are available at Ferry Plaza 
 Farmers' Market in San Francisco and stores including Whole 
 Foods branches throughout the Bay Area, Rainbow Grocery in San 
 Francisco and the Pasta Shop in Berkeley and Oakland. For 
 mail-order and more information, call (415) 663-9335. 
 &HT;

 A SHORT HISTORY OF CHEESE  
 
Fresh soft cheeses are probably the world's oldest: Some
prehistoric householder found a bowl of milk that had gone sour. It
didn't smell bad; in fact, it smelled rather pleasant. So somehow,
she got the idea to drain off the watery stuff, separating curds
from whey. &HT;    Add cheese to the human food chain.
 &HT;    Today, some form of soured milk product can be found in
practically all societies that raise milk-producing animals, from
yogurt to cottage cheese, quark and ricotta; sour cream and its
sophisticated cousin, creme fraiche to plain old clabbered milk or
cream.
 &HT;    So Cowgirl Creamery, the dairy branch of Tomales Bay Foods in
Point Reyes Station, Calif., builds on a long tradition. However,
with its all-organic commitment, it actually goes back in history,
creating soft cheeses as they were made before mass production
methods introduced animal rennet, stabilizers and all manner of
additives.
 &HT;    Sue Conley, co-owner with Peggy Smith of the 2-year-old west
Marin store, is a chef who became so fascinated with cheese making
that she took a course on the subject at Washington State
University.
 &HT;    Conley likes to make these dairy products _ about 300 pounds a
week _ and she also loves to eat them. Her idea of a perfect
breakfast is cottage cheese, a piece of toasted hearty bread and a
drizzle of honey. She says cottage cheese and quark are agreeable
companions to any kind of fresh fruit; fresh mozzarella has great
affinity for tomatoes; fromage blanc is equally suited to fruit or
fresh vegetables _ think cucumbers and radishes.
 &HT;    Quark, or fromage blanc, is the main ingredient of Liptauer, a
Hungarian/German spread that also contains creme fraiche (or sour
cream), sauteed onions, a stronger-flavored cheese (Camembert or
Gruyere), salt, pepper and paprika.
 &HT;    In addition, many fresh cheeses take to hot dishes. Quark is a
standard European companion to baked or boiled potatoes and also
works well as an addition to enchilada or taco fillings. Conley
loves the German-Austrian combination of buttered wide noodles with
cottage cheese, often accompanied by stewed dried fruit. In some
Eastern European kitchens, the noodle-cottage cheese combination is
enhanced with poppy seeds lightly cooked in browned butter.
 &HT;    At Bette's Oceanview Diner in Berkeley, where Conley was a chef/
partner for many years, cottage cheese pancakes are a favorite. In
West Marin, Ellen Straus of the Straus Family Dairy, which provides
Cowgirl with organic milk, bakes a European-style cheesecake for
Tomales Bay Foods on weekends. She started with quark and a little
creme fraiche, ``but now she's using a 50-50 mixture,'' Conley says
with a laugh. ``It's fabulous.''

 GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN: Mix It Up  
 
 By Georgeanne Brennan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Fresh cheeses, such as quark, cottage cheese and fromage blanc, can
be mixed with savory ingredients, such as herbs, salt and pepper,
and vegetables. They also may be combined with sweets.
<P>
   &UR; Quark and Sour Cherries.  &LR; Toast a piece of rye bread, then
spread it with quark and top with sour cherry or other cherry jam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Savory Cottage Cheese.  &LR; Mix cottage cheese with salt, pepper,
chopped parsley or basil, minced cucumber and a little red chile
powder. Serve on a leaf of butterhead lettuce topped with several
tomato slices, or fill a scooped-out tomato with the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fromage Blanc With Honey.  &LR; Thin fromage blanc with a little
milk or cream to an easily spoonable consistency. Drizzle over it a
distinctively flavored honey, such as lavender or eucalyptus, and
serve for breakfast or dessert with thin slices of walnut bread.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roasted Peppers Stuffed with Garlicky Fromage Blanc.  &LR; Drizzle
several heads of garlic with olive oil; sprinkle with salt, pepper
and fresh thyme, and roast at 275 degrees until tender, about 45
minutes to an hour. Remove the soft interiors of the cloves. Mash
together the soft garlic with some fromage blanc, fresh thyme, salt
and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Roast a red bell pepper or two. Remove the skin, slit in half
lengthwise and remove the seeds. Spread each half with a layer of
the fromage blanc mixture. Broil the pepper halves for a few
moments, just to warm the cheese through. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fresh Mozzarella, Chicken and Bread Salad.  &LR; Dust small pieces
of boneless, skinless chicken with a seasoned breadcrumb mixture,
then fry in vegetable oil. Drain, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely chop several tomatoes; put in a bowl with fruity
extra-virgin olive oil, chopped fresh basil, minced garlic and a
little salt and pepper. Mix well. Add some freshly made
garlic-rubbed croutons and the cooked chicken; toss. Add cubed
fresh mozzarella, and turn gently. Add more olive oil if desired.
Garnish with basil.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Brown Sugar From Cane Draws Sweet Critiques  
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  We know that baking with cane or beet sugar yields
different results, but can you see and taste differences in the
sugar itself?
<TEXT>
<P>
   We put our tasting panelists to the test, giving them samples of
each of five brown sugars _ two cane, two beet and one that
alternates between cane and beet based on availability. The panel
also tasted each sugar incorporated into a creme anglaise made
without vanilla so the flavor of the sugar would dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists admitted that all but one of the sugars looked and
tasted very similar, but the remaining panelists found dramatic
differences.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C&AMP;H Pure Cane Sugar Golden Brown &LR;   &UR; Sugar &LR;  (2-pound plastic bag,
$1.39 at many supermarkets) took top honors. One panelist described
the flavor as deep and rich with a pleasant molasses taste. All
would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Safeway Light Brown Sugar &LR;  (2-pound
plastic bag, $1.19), cane sugar made by C&AMP;H, according to Debra
Lambert, public relations manager for Safeway. One panelist
complained that it was a bit dry; another thought it was pale in
color. Others liked the granular texture and pleasant caramel
flavor. Four would buy it; one might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to &UR; Lucky Golden Brown Sugar &LR;  (2-pound plastic
bag, $1.39). This sugar is sometimes made from cane and other times
from beets, according to Judie Decker, spokeswoman for Lucky
Stores. We do not know which was used for the sugar our panel
tasted. One panelist thought it lacked flavor, but two others
particularly liked the mildness. One also liked the way the
granules separated. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on  &UR; Springfield Light Brown Sugar &LR; 
(1-pound box, $1.19 at Andronico's), which is made from beets. Two
thought it tasted too mild, and another detected a ``stale
finish.'' Two would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Best Yet Light Brown Sugar &LR;  (1-pound box,
89 cents at Piazza Fine Foods in San Mateo), also made from beets.
Even the panelists who noticed little difference between the other
sugars didn't care for this sugar; they thought it had an
artificial quality. One panelist noticed the caramel color could be
rubbed off with his fingers. One would buy it, one might buy it,
and three would not.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS:  
 Palo Alto Grill Keeps Shaking and Rolling  
   
 By Tilde Herrera  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; PALO ALTO, Calif.  &LR; _ A word to the wise: Don't take any wooden
nickels unless they were issued by the Peninsula Fountain and
Grill. These babies will get you a thick, ambrosial milkshake, the
same sort of shake that has been thrilling customers for seven
decades.
<P>
   Customers like 86-year-old Orman McGill, who as a 10-year-old
attended the grill's grand opening in 1923. He's stopped in for a
milkshake nearly every day for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-blended milkshake is Peninsula Fountain's claim to
fame. Servers in the 1940s-style eatery even wear kitschy
customized T-shirts alluding to it (``I'm All Shook Up,'' ``Still
Shakin''). And the fountain itself takes the soda fountain decor to
the max _ checkered floor tiles, &UR;  &LR; Formica tables and oldies music
played on a 1957 Seeburg jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   This Palo Alto landmark at the corner of Hamilton and Emerson
streets has been peddling ice cream and its famous milkshake since
it wasopened by Howard Cobb and Axel Raven, who operated it as a
counter-service fountain, then known as the Peninsula Fountain and
Creamery. In 1936, cold sandwiches and cold breakfast dishes were
added to the menu, and in the 1960s, omelets and other hot
breakfast dishes joined the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The fountain was sold in 1987 to Diane Naylor, &UR;  &LR; a local hair
salon owner who, ironically, introduced the fountain to Rob Fisher,
the present owner. Naylor told him about the business during a
haircut, they became friends, and he bought the fountain from her a
year later. He changed the name to the Peninsula Fountain and Grill
so it wouldn't be confused with the Peninsula Creamery, which
operates today as an ice cream distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher credits the celebrated milkshake for ``introducing'' him
to his wife, Jan. After Fisher purchased the restaurant, she became
a fan of the milkshakes and a fountain regular. ``The rest is
history,'' Fisher says sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, Fisher has made several changes, such as renovating
the building and introducing table service. He introduced a dinner
menu featuring comfort food like Yankee pot roast, updated
favorites like a ``salad'' version of Southern fried chicken and
hash brown pie (a delightful potato, bacon, tomato and cheese
concoction, served with two eggs), and homemade pies, buns and
rolls. Beef comes from quality producer Niman Ranch _ and often at
prices much lower than the same cuts served at fancier restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Families, who flocked to the grill after it became a non-smoking
restaurant in 1989, before the law required, still make up the bulk
of the clientele. Stanford University students, Palo Alto residents
and downtown business people are also frequent customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher marvels at the feeling of ``public ownership'' expressed
by the community. &UR;  &LR; ``We have such a great clientele, the people of
Palo Alto have been so supportive,'' he says. ``I've heard people
describe this place as the `center of the universe,' a melting pot
where people of all walks of life can converge.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to keep intact the long-lived motto _ ``Great Food,
Great Shakes, Reasonable Prices'' _ because it's led to success for
nearly a century.

 story package.  
   
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The Chronicle Food staff baked five batches of the
Brown Sugar Walnut Squares recipe on this page, each using a
different brand of light brown sugar. Tasters didn't know which was
which when they sampled. Here are our results:
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Best Yet (beet sugar).  &LR; Cookies were very chewy, with
unpleasant grainy texture and brittle crust.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Springfield (beet sugar).  &LR; These cookies had a datelike ``dark,
sticky'' flavor, with a very crunchy top and bottom and lots of
separation between top, interior and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway (cane sugar).  &LR; Softer and moister than Best Yet and
Springfield, notas sweet, clean tasting with no date flavor, lots
of nut flavor and a buttery quality and unform texture. It was some
tasters' favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C&AMP;H (cane).  &LR; More depth of flavor than Safeway, with a hint of
molasses, most uniform texture and golden brown color, no
separation. Many tasters' favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lade Lee/Lucky (unknown source).  &LR; Dark, dense, sticky, with a
raisinlike texture, red-brown color and distinct separation between
top, interior and bottom.
</P>
<P>
   We also baked four batches of Butterscotch Pound Cake, each
using a different sugar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spreckels white granulated (beet).  &LR; Pleasantly crunchy top,
relatively coarse, dry crumb, yet gummy when chewed. Very sweet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C&AMP;H white granulated (cane).  &LR; Finer, more even texture than
Spreckels, with moister crumb and better flavor. Less sweet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C&AMP;H light brown(cane).  &LR; Nice flavor and texture, more golden
than first two cakes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Springfield light brown (beet).  &LR; Top is crunchier than C&AMP;H, but
appearance and flavor not significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BROWN SUGAR WALNUT SQUARES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   These chewy cookies show off the flavor of brown sugar. The Food
staff baked several versions with different brands of brown sugar,
and found that each was very good but that cane sugar produced the
most even texture and best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat the sides of an 8-inch
square pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar, vanilla and egg in a mixing bowl, stirring
until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add
this to the sugar mixture, stirring well. Stir in the walnuts.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until lightly golden.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool in the pan, then remove and cut into 16 squares.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 16 bar cookies.

 &UR; BUTTERSCOTCH POUND CAKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from The Baker columnist Flo Braker is a
nontraditional pound cake because it is baked in a tube pan. You
may substitute white sugar for the brown, if you like; If you do,
omit the baking soda. The cake will have a slightly more delicate
crumb and lighter color. Served with sliced sweetened strawberries
and a dollop of softly whipped cream, it makes a perfect Easter
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 cups brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, whisked to combine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Have all ingredients at room temperature. Adjust rack to lower
third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a
10-inch tube pan or other 12-cup decorative tube pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt onto a sheet
of wax paper.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, preferably with a paddle attachment,
cream the butter at medium speed until it is smooth and creamy.
Maintaining the same speed, add the sugar in a steady stream. When
all the sugar has been added, stop the machine and scrape the
mixture clinging to the sides of the bowl into the center of the
bowl. Continue to cream at the same speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or
until the mixture is very light in color and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in the eggs,
cautiously at first, tablespoon by tablespoon. If at any time the
mixture appears watery or shiny, stop the flow of eggs, and
increase the speed until a smooth, silken appearance returns. Then
decrease the speed to medium, and resume adding eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and scraping the sides of
the bowl occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   When the mixture looks fluffy, white and increased in volume
(adding the eggs and incorporating them into the mixture takes 3 to
4 minutes), reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture in
4 additions alternately with the milk in 3 additions. Scrape the
sides of the bowl often, and mix until smooth after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla at the end. Spoon the batter into the pan and
spread it level.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Invert the
cake onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing thinly with a
serrated knife.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 16 to 20.

 &UR; CREME BRULEE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Flo Braker developed this recipe for ``The San Francisco
Chronicle Cookbook,'' by Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin (Chronicle
Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups granulated cane sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Grand Marnier (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Place a sieve over a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cream and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan and
heat just to dissolve the sugar. Do not boil.
</P>
<P>
   Blend the egg yolks and vanilla in a mixing bowl; add the warm
cream, stirring with a whisk to combine. Pour the mixture through
the sieve. (The sieve will catch any cooked egg yolk particles and
deflate bubbles that may occur from the stirring.) Pour the custard
into 8 ungreased, round, 3-ounce porcelain ramekins. Place the
ramekins in a baking pan. Pour hot water into the pan to come
halfway up the ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 25 minutes, or until the custards are just set. Do not
overbake. Remove the ramekins and set aside to cool a bit, then
refrigerate (the custards will firm as they cool).
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, adjust the rack 5 to 6 inches from the broiler
unit; preheat the broiler about 10 minutes before glazing the
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   At serving time, gingerly blot the surface of each chilled
custard with a paper towel, then sprinkle the remaining 1 cup sugar
in a thin layer over each custard. Gently pat with your fingertips.
Set the ramekins in a baking pan filled with ice water to come
halfway up the ramekins. Place under the preheated broiler and
broil just until the sugar is golden and melted.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, or refrigerate until chilled and serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, crack each sugar crust before serving and pour a
teaspoon or so of Grand Marnier on top.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BWINDI IMPENETRABLE FOREST, Uganda _ The wound on the old male's
silver back, inflicted in a fight with another group of gorillas,
looked like it was healing. He studied his fingertips. Two of the
little ones raced up and down a tree, stripping loose a shower of
leaves that fell to the jungle floor.
</P>
<P>
   This band of 16 mountain gorillas _ among the last 620 alive in
the wild _ seemed healthy. But their future is far from guaranteed
since the war in the Great Lakes region of East Africa spread to
their neighborhood here in early March and took its latest victims:
a game warden and eight foreign tourists, including two Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists and people living around the park, still
stunned by the killings, are also trying to determine what it will
mean for this place, the last corner on Earth where scientists and
tourists could safely see mountain gorillas in the wild. In the
last several years, a complex relationship had evolved that made
local people's survival largely dependent on the money the gorillas
attract.
</P>
<P>
   The gorillas' survival is in turn largely dependent on the good
will of local people who have, at times reluctantly, agreed not to
cut trees or clear land for farming, in exchange for a share of
that money.
</P>
<P>
   If tourists stop coming, will local people stop helping to
preserve the gorillas' habitat? And will the gorillas' numbers thus
dwindle even further toward extinction?
</P>
<P>
   There are already hints of the answer. Ignatius Byamugyisha, 30,
who was beaten and held at gunpoint when Hutu rebels attacked the
park, said he was not about to put the gorillas' welfare above his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are important when they bring in tourists,'' said
Byamugyisha, who watched the attackers loot and swig beer and soda
from his tourist shop just outside the park's gates. ``If not, they
are not. If the tourists don't come, we will try our luck in the
forest. Before this, we were good timber cutters.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries of the African Great Lakes _ Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi and Congo _ have been at war in various ways since the
early 1990s. This region holds some of the world's most precious
forests, with rare plants and animals, but it has also seen some of
the worst human tragedies in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in Rwanda, more than half a million Tutsi and moderate
Hutu were killed in 100 days by Hutu extremists. Two rebellions
have sprung up in eastern Congo, most recently last August. It was
Hutu who fled Rwanda after the 1994 massacres, now loyal to Congo's
president, who attacked the tourists here March 1, saying they
wanted to punish Uganda for aiding Congolese rebels, and the United
States and Britain for being allies with Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on tourism, which the rebels aimed to cripple, was
immediate: Though Uganda quickly beefed up security, both the
United States and Britain issued strong travel advisories against
visiting. Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, one of the largest tour companies in
Uganda, reported that three-quarters of its 1999 bookings had been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest are not looking too confident at all,'' said Patrick
Shah, general manager for Abercrombie &AMP; Kent Uganda, whose camp at
Bwindi was one of three attacked that night.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on conservation will probably be immediate as well.
Gorilla tourism subsidizes all 11 of the national parks in Uganda,
providing 70 percent of the revenue to the fledgling national park
system.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on previously peaceful Bwindi underscored how badly
conflict has ravaged wild areas. Refugees have settled in
two-thirds of Akagera, the largest park in Rwanda, conservationists
say. The forests on the Congo side of Bwindi and its smaller sister
park to the south, Mgahinga National Park, are slowly losing their
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Wabbes Candotti, a program officer for the World Wildlife
Fund in East Africa, compared the Great Lakes' natural areas to
``someone half sinking but still breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are areas on the brink of being spoiled and damaged
irreversibly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several mountain gorillas have also been killed in Rwanda and
Congo, one possibly by a land mine and several others caught in
crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about the gorillas prompted Uganda, along with many
foreign governments and international aid groups, to develop a
program over the last decade to give residents a stake in the
animals' well-being. About 300 gorillas are in Bwindi and another
320 in the forests around the Virunga volcanoes, a spectacular
range that runs through Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an easy sell. Local people barely scraping by had
been accustomed to farming in the forests, fishing, cutting timber,
rooting for mushrooms and cutting bark for medicine to kill
intestinal worms. Farmers were evicted from the park. In heated
meetings, many asked: Are gorillas more important than people?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not happy,'' said Gabriel Muhigirwa, a 60-year-old
farmer outside Kisoro, near Mgahinga National Park. ``We became
poorer because we lost our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Muhigirwa has been elected to supervise one of 33 spigots
that bring clean water from inside Mgahinga to 40,000 people
outside the park. The water system was one of many projects aimed
at using money from the parks and donations from international
groups to improve local people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   In projects coordinated by CARE International, schools, roads
and health clinics have gone up. At Bwindi, local people earn money
as porters and drivers for tourists tracking gorillas, sell
tourists food and stage traditional dances. In Kisoro, which was
empty when gorilla tourism began here six years ago, there is a new
airstrip and regular flights from Kampala, a new gas station, a row
of shops and even a satellite dish on one of the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Mutebi, a biologist and local project manager for CARE,
said that before the attack, people around Bwindi and Mgahinga had
begun to see tangible benefits of tourism.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``They had seen conservation as something that is contributing
to their welfare,'' Mutebi said. ``Now tourism stops, and the money
stops. At this time we can't tell what is going to be the reaction
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bakinahe, a 40-year-old farmer standing on a slope that
leads up to Mgahinga park, summed up the ambivalence: ``It is good
to have gorillas; I would like to have even more.'' But, he added,
``if I were allowed, I would go back to farm'' in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kagoda, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Tourism,
Trade and Industry, said Uganda is committed to preserving the
forest and protecting the gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an international obligation to insure the safety and
security of these animals,'' he said. ``And precisely because of
that, we have decided that we will do whatever it takes to conserve
this species, even if we do not receive a single visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that may be difficult in a poor country.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Uganda suspended tourism for a month, in
respect for the dead and to improve security. Tourism is scheduled
to begin again on April 1, though it is far from clear how many
visitors will come.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the killings, the guides who track the
gorillas with the tourists have been following animals that have
slowly become accustomed to the presence of humans, to make sure
they have not been harmed. On a recent day five trackers, protected
by two Ugandan soldiers with machine guns, spent nearly five hours
hiking the steep slopes of Bwindi, hacking through the bush with
honed machetes, until they found one of the groups of gorillas in a
dark and chilly patch of the forest buzzing with millions of flies.
</P>
<P>
   The old male, Riuhondeza, was lazing on his back, with his legs
crossed genteelly. One of his sons, an 8-year-old named Madaraka,
rushed playfully close to the trackers, then beat his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in good shape,'' said one of the guides, Steven
Migyisha, 34. ``They have not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how long can that last?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could declare them _ what is it? _ war-free zones,''
Stephen Asuma, the warden in charge of tourism at Bwindi, said
before his voice trailed off. ``It is the only dream we can have.
It is very disheartening to see species that are almost extinct
further threatened by wars.''

 &UR; BROWN SUGAR WALNUT SQUARES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   These chewy cookies show off the flavor of brown sugar. The Food
staff baked several versions with different brands of brown sugar,
and found that each was very good but that cane sugar produced the
most even texture and best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat the sides of an 8-inch
square pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar, vanilla and egg in a mixing bowl, stirring
until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add
this to the sugar mixture, stirring well. Stir in the walnuts.
Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until lightly golden.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool in the pan, then remove and cut into 16 squares.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 16 bar cookies.

 &UR; BUTTERSCOTCH POUND CAKE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This recipe from The Baker columnist Flo Braker is a
nontraditional pound cake because it is baked in a tube pan. You
may substitute white sugar for the brown, if you like; If you do,
omit the baking soda. The cake will have a slightly more delicate
crumb and lighter color. Served with sliced sweetened strawberries
and a dollop of softly whipped cream, it makes a perfect Easter
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 cups brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, whisked to combine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Have all ingredients at room temperature. Adjust rack to lower
third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a
10-inch tube pan or other 12-cup decorative tube pan.
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt onto a sheet
of wax paper.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, preferably with a paddle attachment,
cream the butter at medium speed until it is smooth and creamy.
Maintaining the same speed, add the sugar in a steady stream. When
all the sugar has been added, stop the machine and scrape the
mixture clinging to the sides of the bowl into the center of the
bowl. Continue to cream at the same speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or
until the mixture is very light in color and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in the eggs,
cautiously at first, tablespoon by tablespoon. If at any time the
mixture appears watery or shiny, stop the flow of eggs, and
increase the speed until a smooth, silken appearance returns. Then
decrease the speed to medium, and resume adding eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and scraping the sides of
the bowl occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   When the mixture looks fluffy, white and increased in volume
(adding the eggs and incorporating them into the mixture takes 3 to
4 minutes), reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the flour mixture in
4 additions alternately with the milk in 3 additions. Scrape the
sides of the bowl often, and mix until smooth after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla at the end. Spoon the batter into the pan and
spread it level.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Invert the
cake onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing thinly with a
serrated knife.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 16 to 20.

 &UR; CREME BRULEE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Flo Braker developed this recipe for ``The San Francisco
Chronicle Cookbook,'' by Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin (Chronicle
Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups granulated cane sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Grand Marnier (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 300 degrees.
Place a sieve over a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cream and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a saucepan and
heat just to dissolve the sugar. Do not boil.
</P>
<P>
   Blend the egg yolks and vanilla in a mixing bowl; add the warm
cream, stirring with a whisk to combine. Pour the mixture through
the sieve. (The sieve will catch any cooked egg yolk particles and
deflate bubbles that may occur from the stirring.) Pour the custard
into 8 ungreased, round, 3-ounce porcelain ramekins. Place the
ramekins in a baking pan. Pour hot water into the pan to come
halfway up the ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 25 minutes, or until the custards are just set. Do not
overbake. Remove the ramekins and set aside to cool a bit, then
refrigerate (the custards will firm as they cool).
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, adjust the rack 5 to 6 inches from the broiler
unit; preheat the broiler about 10 minutes before glazing the
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   At serving time, gingerly blot the surface of each chilled
custard with a paper towel, then sprinkle the remaining 1 cup sugar
in a thin layer over each custard. Gently pat with your fingertips.
Set the ramekins in a baking pan filled with ice water to come
halfway up the ramekins. Place under the preheated broiler and
broil just until the sugar is golden and melted.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, or refrigerate until chilled and serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, crack each sugar crust before serving and pour a
teaspoon or so of Grand Marnier on top.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ Its carefully laid bombing

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Kukes, Albania) _ Listening to the stories of
the refugees: In the darkness, the little villages in the rolling
hills and river valleys around the Kosovo city of Dakovica emptied
out this morning, rushing _ literally, for their lives _ to beat
the 5 a.m. deadline set by Serbian forces. Even as some 60,000
ethnic Albanians streamed into this border town, mostly from around
a main highway to the northeast, Serb forces were methodically
going from village to village in an entirely different area to the
northwest, the Has District, telling the villagers they must leave

has fled either into neighboring countries or into the countryside.
The overall exodus, one of the worst since world war II, has
brought the seeds of destablization to Albania and Macedonia, a
crisis the allies had said their bombing campaign sought to avert.

 &HT;    Tech companies look to do business with learning institutions
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes said Tuesday that Georgia will spend
$1.7 million to quickly double the number of software developers
graduating from Georgia Tech and aid high-tech companies struggling
to find enough workers.
</P>
<P>
   Three companies that pushed for a bigger pool of graduates say
the governor's decision bolsters their plans to expand in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree, an electronic payment processor, will spend $20
million to expand its Norcross headquarters and will hire 300 new
technology workers over the next five years, Chief Executive Pete
Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   Kight took part in the governor's announcement, along with the
CEO of Internet Security Systems and the general manager of Nortel
Networks, a Northern Telecom unit that has nearly 2,000
telecommunications employees in Alpharetta. The three companies
worked closely with the state and suggested what skills their
workers most need.
</P>
<P>
   Kight said without the additional funding and the help of
businesses ``there isn't any possibility that the educational
system by itself can keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Noonan, the chief executive of ISS, said he expects his
company, based near Perimeter Mall, to grow from 200 to 600 metro
Atlanta workers within two years _ if he can find enough high-end
workers here.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage in the high-tech labor pool is a national problem
and has pushed employers to intensify their search for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ISS opened research and development operations last year in
California, Britain and Japan in order to tap other labor pools.
But Noonan said, ``Our preference is to expand here.'' He wrote to
University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen Portch a year ago
warning of shortages in the number of graduates his business
depends on.
</P>
<P>
   New funding announced by the governor will help grow Georgia's
technology business, Noonan said, but he said millions of dollars
more will be needed to come close to keeping pace with the demand
for graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is listening. ``We will invest whatever is
necessary to ensure we have high-tech graduates to fill the
high-tech jobs'' Georgia attracts, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditure Barnes announced Tuesday will allow Georgia Tech
to buy additional equipment and hire new faculty members, some of
whom have already recently joined the school. Some of the funding
began a month and a half ago. Georgia Tech president Wayne Clough
said that by the spring of 2001 the school will graduate 200
computer science students annually, double what it now produces.
The first additional graduates may include part-time students and
people who left school without completing their studies.
</P>
<P>
   Half the school's computer science graduates now leave the state
for jobs elsewhere. Georgia Tech officials say they hope to raise
the percentage of graduates who stay to 65 percent by spring of the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ISS, CheckFree and Nortel have committed to hire at least 40 of
Georgia Tech's computer science graduates each year and create 50
new coop positions for the school's students. The companies also
agreed to have their senior executives give lectures at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The funding will come from the existing budget of a
three-year-old program that allows the university system to break
out of slow-moving academic cultures so that it can quickly educate
people to meet specific needs of companies creating so-called
knowledge jobs. The program is shaped as a public
private-partnership to satisfy high demand for graduates in low
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Intellectual Capital Partnership Program, or ICAPP,
the program was the biggest carrot Georgia used in 1996 to convince
credit card processor Total Systems Services to remain in Columbus
and build a new $100 million headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prototyping how to quickly adapt and meet the needs of
quickly changing 21st century companies,'' said Annie Hunt Burriss,
an assistant vice chancellor of the University System and architect
of the ICAPP program.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's announcement is his second in three months that
involves major efforts to expand Georgia's pool of high-tech
workers. In January, the state unveiled the Yamacraw Mission, a
campaign to make Georgia a center for high-paying, fast-growing
microchip design firms for the telecommunications industry.

League has made it work in the real world, only there are no corn
fields to be found here in the Arizona desert. The Cactus League is

CHARITIES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Americans become increasingly comfortable shopping online,
it's a pitch many succumb to: Buy an Elmo toy or a Stephen King
novel through our Web sites, and part of the purchase price will go
to the charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already like to shop online,'' said Sissy Brunk, who
patronizes one of the half-dozen sites making this pitch. ``It
makes you feel good that while you are shopping, a little bit goes
to a worthy cause.'' By stopping at www.igive.com, she is convinced
she is helping a children's charity she admires.
</P>
<P>
   Like credit cards that promise to give a sliver of whatever
amount is charged to a favorite cause, these Web sites appeal to
Americans' charitable side. They claim to have raised hundreds of
thousands of dollars for groups ranging from the Humane Society to
Hands on San Francisco, a volunteer group.
</P>
<P>
   But once you buy Elmo online, what happens to the few dollars
you thought was speeding its way to a good cause? While many
charities are getting checks directly from these sites, it is
impossible to know in every case. It may not end up in the
charity's hands as fast as you imagined _ if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Amounts may fall below some trigger point the retailer or Web
site has set before it will send a check. Money may not be credited
to the charity because of computer glitches. Or shoppers may fail
to follow somewhat burdensome instructions. IGive even carries a
disclaimer, deep in the electronic fine print, that it may be
impossible to guarantee that the charity gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks illustrate some pitfalls:
</P>
<P>
   _ IGive prides itself on letting shoppers name any cause they
fancy, and since the site was born in November 1997, they've
identified more than 4,300 of them. But in interviews, the site's
founder said not even half met the $10 threshold required by IGive
that a charity needs to raise through shoppers' purchases before
the site will cut a check. And IGive has not verified half of those
that qualify. The upshot: fewer than a quarter have been paid or
can expect a check soon. IGive, which said that it has written
checks for $200,000 of the $300,000 earmarked for charity, said
that it will do its best to make sure every charity gets its money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another site, www.charityweb.com, divides any money that has
been pledged to 20 causes that ostensibly have ``peace, life and
love'' in common unless shoppers e-mail other instructions. Those
20 include a Stanford University day-care center, where the site's
founders, a 1996 Stanford MBA and his wife, send one of their
children. The day-care center is one of only two causes that have
received money, only a couple of hundred dollars, so far. The
founder, Kurt Hansen, said that he included the center because he
is on its board but that the site is largely composed of causes he
has no connection with.
</P>
<P>
   _ One site that was full of promise only weeks ago,
www.charitymall.com, has temporarily shut down. Another,
www.socialgoods.com, has been absorbed by a rival,
www.4charity.com. These disruptions raise questions as to what will
happen to money already pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Some charities choose not to participate and object to how their
names are sometimes being used. American Red Cross, for instance,
agreed last year to conduct pilot programs with three new Web sites
that seemed to have financial backing and reputable managers:
Shop2Give.com, 4charity.com and Toysrweb.com. Recently, it bowed
out of the pilot program after it failed to generate the desired
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   And until contacted by a reporter, the Red Cross was unaware
that it was also listed on two other sites, igive.com and
MyCause.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dilutes the brand, and it can be very confusing,'' said
Bill Blaul, a Red Cross spokesman. He said the group will probably
ask the Web sites to desist, a request that might not be honored
given the experience of at least one charity that tried to wriggle
off the lists.
</P>
<P>
   To the entrepreneurs behind the Web sites, these hiccups are
just growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   These sites, serving as a middleman between the retailer and the
charity, promise a stream of revenue to charities. Typically, the
money the sites say will go to charity comes from commissions they
earn from online retailers like Amazon.com and J. Crew in exchange
for referring customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites keep part of the commission, but those that send
it all to charity can still make money by selling advertising and
product placement, finding corporate sponsors or hawking
information about shoppers' habits to market researchers. Many
sites promise not to reveal personal information without
permission, though it is too early to know whether they keep their
word.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet holds huge potential for charities. Nonprofits can
use it to reach donors as never before, e-mailing them about
initiatives, creating forums where donors can meet, and inviting
donations at a fraction of the cost of mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, for example, lets visitors to its site
learn about relief efforts and make online donations. It was also
one of the first to post most of its tax return on the Web _ all
but top executives' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of these shopping sites say they, too, are helping
reinvent charity. ``We have become part of the fabric of a large
number of nonprofits,'' said Robert Grosshandler, who founded IGive
in Evanston, Ill., after selling his software company. IGive, 18
months old, appears to be the oldest site, and perhaps the largest,
claiming 43,000 registered shoppers doing what it calls
``Technogiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites' popularity is growing as charities tell donors to
check them out, as shoppers tell other shoppers about them and as
people surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great medium for this kind of giving,'' said
Fiona Swerdlow, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a research
firm in New York. ``It should be something that appeals to a lot of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention charities. ``This kind of thing helps a lot,''
said Lenna Silberman Scott, a spokeswoman for Families of Spinal
Muscular Atrophy in Libertyville, Ill., which said the $600 it has
received out of the $1,300 it has been promised from IGive will
help fund research and provide wheelchairs and other medical
equipment to families in need.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The shop-for-a-cause sites are quick to promote this lofty role.
But the half-dozen or so that have opened in recent months are all
very much for-profit businesses, although two that send all of the
commissions to charity say they are seeking nonprofit status. Some
were created by successful entrepreneurs, some by freshly minted
business school graduates. They tend to be mom-and-pop operations
with little venture capital or corporate backing. And as private
businesses, they divulge almost nothing about how well they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences,'' said William P. Massey,
president of the National Charities Information Bureau, a watchdog
in New York that says shoppers can easily stumble unless they
understand how each site works.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from clear what rules, if any, apply. The Web sites,
technically affiliates of the retailers, which play no significant
role in their charitable activities, do not consider themselves
traditional fundraisers or solicitors, governed by state laws. Only
a few have registered with state regulators. And none appear to be
posting bonds or creating other backstops to insure that money
pledged doesn't get diverted.
</P>
<P>
   Two already appear to be having difficulty. One,
www.charitymall.com, has temporarily gone dark. Run by two brothers
from New York, both electricians, the site hopes to convert itself
to nonprofit status to make itself more attractive to sponsors.
This was the one site whose retailers had agreed to pay charities
directly, so the money raised so far isn't at risk, one brother
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another, www.socialgoods.com, created by two 1998 Harvard MBA's,
had considered closing down at the end of the month but has been
absorbed by www.4charity.com., a rival started by a 1998 Stanford
MBA. Socialgoods.com's founder, William Morrison, said causes will
get any money they were promised.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of such sites represents ``the beginning of the
problem,'' said Michael DeLucia, director of charitable trusts for
New Hampshire and president of the National Association of State
Charity Officials. ``It is a perfect opportunity for a classic
telemarketing charity scam.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are consumers to do? With hundreds of thousands of
charities _ many with similar-sounding names _ pleading for help
the old-fashioned way in mass mailings and cold calls, giving money
away is already tougher than it should be. Confusion over how
electronic transactions work, how much actually goes to charity,
and who, if anyone, might claim a tax deduction, is not helping.
Even the simplest question _ which site delivers the most to
charity _ is not obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Buying an item from most sites yields only half as much for a
worthy cause as purchasing the same item through 4Charity.com,
which funnels all money it receives from retailers to the
charities. 4Charity, which is seeking nonprofit status, can do this
because it relies heavily on volunteers and plans to pay its bills
by selling information about collective shopping habits to
companies, according to Scott Dunlap, its founder. But consumers
would be hard-pressed to figure this out without hours of research.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, sites like Shop2Give.com and MyCause.com, which
offer shoppers hundreds of thousands of charities to choose from,
raise some of the thorniest issues.
</P>
<P>
   Information may be dated or wrong, since the Web site can't
reach out to every charity. The sheer number of choices also makes
it harder for any one charity to meet a site's minimum threshold.
And consumers may have trouble picking and choosing, given what's
presented. Interested in finding a worthy cancer cause? IGive
provides 35 choices, ranging from three chapters of the American
Cancer Society in Texas, to Cancer Care of Ridgewood, N.J., to
Cancer Caring Center in Pittsburgh, to the Cancer Curing Society in
Bonita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thus some consumer advocates say Web sites with fewer choices
might have more appeal. 4charity.com goes to great lengths to
enlist the support of the 25 charities it highlights, while
Greatergood has signed contracts with all 14 of its charities. So
while consumers may not get as much latitude, there is some
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 4,000 causes to keep tabs on, Grosshandler of
IGive said he counts on shoppers to inspect his work. The site
provides each shopper with a detailed accounting of how much the
causes selected by that shopper have ``earned.'' The shopper is
then free to contact the charity to make sure a check was sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have a million auditors,'' said Grosshandler. But
whether charities can or want to handle inquiries concerning
trivial sums is another matter. ``The site is abrogating its
responsibility,'' in expecting consumers to question the charities,
said Blaul of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites also leave the impression that the process is as
quick as a mouse click. Greatergood.com, for instance, asserts,
``At least 5 percent of whatever you spend will go to the
not-for-profit you choose, automatically. It's that easy!''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were. Most retailers make the sites generate a
certain amount in referral commissions. J. Crew, for example,
typically requires a site to earn $250 in commissions before it
writes a check. Thus, a site entitled to a 5 percent commission
would have to generate $5,000 in sales _ perhaps 150 polo shirts _
before it could expect payment.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Because the sites often set their own minimums,
starting at $10, any one charity has to inspire shoppers to buy the
equivalent of six or seven polo shirts _ or even a dozen _ before
it sees a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Hands on San Francisco, for example, has been told it is
entitled to more than $100 through 4Charity but must be patient;
the site makes payments only four times a year. The group is also
waiting for a check from IGive, a delay chalked up to a clerical
error.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tracking individual donations is not always easy. During the
holidays, one retailer, Cyberian Outpost, had computer problems and
for several weeks lost information about which commissions were
owed. While the retailer said it paid the sites what it estimated
it owed them, sites like Shop2Give and 4Charity had no way of
knowing how much they owed various causes unless shoppers contacted
them to reconstruct their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites also require shoppers to take multiple steps to
ensure that their cause gets credit. IGive requires an electronic
proof of purchase via e-mail, but 10 percent of members never send
it. ``We consider that 10 percent a failure,'' said Grosshandler,
adding that the unaccounted funds still go to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use our best efforts to make sure that your worthy
cause gets the appropriate credit,'' the site's fine print warns,
``but in some instances the information provided to us by the
merchant may make that impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites dance around facts consumers might want to know,
particularly those that might remind shoppers that the sites have
mercenary motives and might dip into any money they receive from
retailers to pay their own bills.
</P>
<P>
   MyCause.com leaves visitors with the impression that it is
``sustained by an additional commission paid by our affiliate
retailers,'' implying that its fees are not coming at the
charities' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Shop2Give, for its part, implied that retailers call all the
shots. The site allows the retailer ``to decide the amount to be
donated,'' it told shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some big merchants like J. Crew say they did weigh in, but in at
least one case involving a major retailer, Shop2Give had more
influence than that. ``We would have no voice in what an affiliate
partner does with the revenue stream,'' said Ben Boyd, a spokesman
for Barnesandnoble.com, one retailer on Shop2Give's site. The site
is ``mischaracterizing our commission as a pledged donation.''
</P>
<P>
   After being made aware of the conflicting accounts, Shop2Give
said it was changing its language. ``Shop2Give then determines how
much of this total commission will go to a nonprofit
organization,'' the site now tells shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also be forgiven for thinking they are eligible
for a tax deduction. They're not. Yet, only two sites, MyCause and
Shop2Give, make that clear. And Shop2Give even tells shoppers not
to lose hope _ it is ``actively working on finding a solution that
can accommodate tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see how. Whatever money goes to charity is the
result of the site diverting some, or all, of what it gets from the
retailer. Most telling: Even the Web sites typically consider the
money they remit to charity a marketing expense, not a charitable
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear of state regulators and charity watchdogs is
that many sites are accountable to no one. Only a few, Greatergood,
Shop2Give and 4Charity, say they have registered under state law to
do cause-related marketing. Other sites like IGive and MyCause say
they do not fall under existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   State laws also come into play when sites raise money without
the charities' cooperation. When the American Camping Association,
for example, found itself on MyCause.com, it requested information
about the site's activities, to no avail. Though the group has not
asked to have its name removed, ``we feel very removed from it,''
said Bob Shultz, the director of development.
</P>
<P>
   Another educational charity, which requested anonymity, has
sought to remove itself from IGive, only to be told it has no say
in the matter. IGive members decide which causes to include.
</P>
<P>
   Use of a charity's name without its approval may violate laws in
many states. In Pennsylvania, no one can solicit on behalf of a
charity without its consent, said Karl Emerson, director of the
Pennsylvania bureau of charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   For every bona fide charity that ends up participating over its
objections, regulators also worry that imposters could seek out
listings and bombard shoppers with e-mail, imploring them to make
them the beneficiary. ``There is the distinct possibility that a
questionable charity will appear on one or more of these sites,''
said Massey of the National Charities Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   While Greatergood.com requires charities to be on the list the
Internal Revenue Service keeps of nonprofits that qualify for
tax-deductible gifts, it is one of the more stringent. Other sites
say they make case-by-case determinations, while IGive merely
requires causes to affirm they are nonprofits and engage in good
works, one reason it lists many lesser-known causes.
</P>
<P>
   Some like the Broken Nose Fund in Portland, Me., have neither
applied to the IRS for permission to accept tax-deductible
donations nor registered with charity regulators in their home
states. ``I am not registered because I am trying to make money for
myself, because I need surgery,'' said Ashley Lenartson, who is
looking to raise $15,000 to fix his own nose for the third time.
While he believes his is a legitimate cause, the only way consumers
could conceivably learn more about it would be to write to an
address he supplies IGive and wait.
</P>
<P>
   IGive's Grosshandler acknowledges that some groups on its site
are not bona fide charities and says the site's job is not to play
Big Brother. He suggested that it's possible that someone may have
registered a cause close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's their favorite worthy cause, it's great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the dilemma. If these Web sites survive, they will
come to resemble electronic shopping malls with as much to show for
themselves as the credit card companies that pioneered the
help-a-favorite-cause pitch. Nearly 6 percent of the $596 billion
in Visa and MasterCard volume last year went to cards that diverted
a fraction of purchases to worthy causes, according to the Nilson
Report, an industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But there are key differences. Credit card issuers are often
well-established companies that have earned consumers' trust. They
enter contracts with every charity they represent. And while
Internet companies often fall between regulatory cracks, banking
has always been well monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these shop-for-a-cause sites become a permanent part of
the scene depends a lot on what kind of results they deliver for
charities and consumers. What worries Dunlap, the founder of
4charity, is that some sites _ ones that mislead consumers or
alienate charities _ ``will ruin it for the rest of us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an age when television shrinks the globe and
transports the world's wonders into the living room, the circus,
like grand opera and kabuki, may exist more as an embodiment of
cultural tradition and spectacle than as a source of novelty.
</P>
<P>
   But still, as proved by ``The Living Carousel,'' the 129th
presentation of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus,
it remains a grand tradition and a lavish spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   This polished and glittering Feld Entertainment production, at
Madison Square Garden through April 11, is replete with top-of-the
line performers, including a few guaranteed to wow circusgoers
young and old who think they've seen everything.
</P>
<P>
   While a warring world waits for the lion to lie down with the
lamb, the cat and the bird coexist peacefully and acrobatically in
Svetlana Shemsheeva's menagerie, where a dove rides a Persian cat
that jumps through a hoop; a cat crosses a high wire on its front
paws, and doves and cats otherwise defy the probabilities of
friendship while extending the boundaries of amusement.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to remarkable feats on high wires, there is no
rival to the Cloud-Walking Carillos, who perform backward leaps and
backward somersaults and compound the customary perils by risking
life and limb over a cage filling with Bengal tigers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, while flashing an occasional fang, flailing a clawed
paw or emitting an ominous growl, the sleek tigers sit, roll over
and array themselves on the command of young Mark Oliver Gebel,
smoothly carrying on the family tradition under the watchful eye of
his father, Gunther Gebel-Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition continues, too, with graceful equestrian acts,
mischievous dogs, masses of teeterboarders, clowns in a (shaving)
cream pie fight, and the Wuhan Flyers, an aerial act from China
whose members ratchet up the complexity of their trapeze work till
it reaches the triple inverted pirouette.
</P>
<P>
   In the more modern vein of circus arts, there are the Urias,
spinning on motorcycles like angry bumblebees inside a latticed
globe, and Wilson Dominguez, trying to keep his balance 40 feet
over the ring on his spinning, gleaming Wheel of Wonder. And there
is plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   With three rings going most of the time, the circus' new
ringmaster, Johnathan Lee Iverson, keeps the proceedings moving
briskly. He draws the crowd into the action and provides a generous
helping of singing to accompany the parades that circle the arena
with the armies of glittering-costumed performers, camels,
elephants, alpacas, ostriches, zebras and other exotic animals and
props that make this venerable circus a generous and rewarding part
of springtime in New York.

 &HT;    Pilgrimage to Passover: A tireless Orthodox rabbi calls faithful
to Palm Beach
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Passover package in Palm Beach allows
the faithful to check in for the weekend and cover all the ritual
bases.
</P>
<P>
   They can celebrate the ancient Jewish festival that begins at
sundown tonight and stay through Sabbath on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Passover seder, all other meals and services are part of the
plan. And no one has to drive on the holidays, which is forbidden
to observant Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Orthodox Synagogue meets in the ballroom of the
Palm Beach Hotel on the resort island. Rent a room for three days
and immerse yourself in the rituals of Orthodox Judaism for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passover is Thursday and Friday and then we go into Shabbat,''
said Rabbi Moshe Scheiner, 30, the energetic rabbi serving his
first synagogue. ``So we're going to offer all the meals in
addition to services. We have a kosher-for-Passover plan from
Wednesday night through Saturday lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   That is part of Scheiner's aggressive campaign to market his
faith and promote Orthodox Judaism as a user-friendly religion
available to all Jews.
</P>
<P>
   He expects about a dozen people will rent rooms and that more
than 100 will take part in the Passover celebration at the hotel.
They are part of the community of 140 families and single Jews that
came together less than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passover is the birth of our nation,'' Scheiner said. ``That's
when we became a people. God brought us out of Egypt and said, `You
will no longer be servants of man. You'll be servants of me.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Scheiner, who this year marks his first Passover as a
full-time rabbi, has wrestled with a personal passover to determine
whose servant he was to be.
</P>
<P>
   He began his pilgrimage as a medical equipment salesman
commuting from Miami to a Palm Beach minyan of about 10 men who met
for prayer once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives in Palm Beach and offers daily services morning
and night. A religious school meets twice a week. He runs home
Torah study groups, an educational program called ``Tea and
Torah,'' bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah instruction for youngsters,
and the Torah Learning Center, which exists to reach out to
nonmembers.
</P>
<P>
   Scheiner has helped raise more than a $1.5 million to build or
buy a place for a synagogue on the island and faces the challenge
of another Orthodox synagogue setting up shop on the island. But
his fans are loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there because of the rabbi,'' said Lisa Schierer, a
synagogue member from North Palm Beach. ``He's phenomenal. He's
incredibly intelligent. He's nonjudgmental, and he has the ability
to create a link between the Torah and our everyday life. It's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheiner was born into an observant Orthodox family in Boro
Park, Brooklyn, the son and grandson of rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   One brother is a rabbi in Colorado. Another is in school
preparing to be a rabbi. His sister is married to a rabbi. Scheiner
also prepared to be a rabbi and was ordained, but only to keep his
options open, he said. He planned to help part-time in a synagogue,
but he wanted to work in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Dina, 26, through a matchmaker. She grew up in
Crown Heights and was also raised in the Lubavitch Orthodox
tradition in which contact between single boys and girls is
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is not prearranged,'' Scheiner said. ``A
matchmaker is someone who knows you and knows her and says I think
you'd be good together.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1993 and came to Miami the following year.
Scheiner took a job with a medical equipment company supplying
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, he was called to Palm Beach to lead a weekend
service for a group of people starting a synagogue. His
Colorado-based brother had given his name to a Palm Beach resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for exactly that,'' Scheiner said. ``Bingo. But
I was looking for something close to Miami, not an hour and a half
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly he drove to Palm Beach and took the service, spent
the night and returned Sunday. That went on for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Then the synagogue began to grow. He was needed more often.
Still a part-time rabbi, he moved to Palm Beach and commuted every
day to his full-time job in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   That arduous journey went on for nearly four years as the
synagogue grew apace. In July, he gave into his destiny, quit his
daytime job and became a full-time rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a good job,'' said Rabbi Leonid Feldman at the
Conservative Temple Emanu-El on Palm Beach. ``He's very loved and
respected. It's not easy to create a community on Palm Beach. He
deserves credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most members of his congregation are not observant Orthodox
Jews. Many drive to services on Sabbath. Others are observant in
only some parts of Orthodox life.
</P>
<P>
   Scheiner welcomes them all, urges full obedience to Orthodox
tradition but accepts whatever degree of observance each person
follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some rabbis throw barriers between you and the pulpit,'' said
Bill Matheson, 63, from Palm Beach. ``This rabbi reaches out. I can
learn more and do more here.''
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Judaism has become so popular on Palm Beach that other
rabbis may be planning to start congregations. Rumors abound that a
socially popular New York Orthodox ``rabbi to the stars'' may be
coming to the island for winter seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rabbi, Marc Schneier, feels strongly that he has a
following here,'' Feldman said. ``It will be a fascinating
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheiner, understandably, sees no need for a second Orthodox
congregation and is concerned that his community may be falsely
described as an ultra-conservative group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're modern. We're open,'' he said. ``I am Lubavitch. The
synagogue is not. Most of our members come from Conservative and
Reform traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scheiner is committed to helping each member find a fuller
expression of Judaism as God leads them to deeper understanding.
And that, he suggests, has roots in the ancient festival they
celebrate tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passover is an ongoing process,'' Scheiner said. ``Any time a
person reaches a greater degree of spirituality in their life, it's
a sort of passover.''

REHNQUIST URGES CONGRESS TO KEEP JUDICIAL BRANCH OUT OF CENSUS
DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is urging
Congress to keep the federal court system out of a raging partisan
spending debate over the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the federal judiciary and the departments of
Commerce, State and Justice is contained in the same appropriations
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Commerce Department is carrying out the
controversial 2000 Census, the subject of a highly partisan debate,
Congress gave itself until June 15 to resolve its differences and
pass the appropriations bill for those departments. After June 15,
the judiciary and the three Cabinet departments will receive no
federal funds unless a bill is passed.
</P>
<P>
   The heated disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over
how to conduct the Census has made it possible that Congress will
miss its own mid-June deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, citing the partisan rancor, urged lawmakers to
disentangle funding for the judiciary from the Commerce Department
legislation, for the good of the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judicial branch should not, and does not, have any role in
this debate, as the resolution of this issue very properly rests
with the political branches of government,'' Rehnquist wrote in a
March 17 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee leaders, which the
Supreme Court released Tuesday. ``The judiciary's appropriations
should, therefore, also be free from entanglement in this political
dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the panel's top Democrat, were traveling
in Utah and Cuba, respectively, and could not be reached for
comment, their spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress fails to appropriate money by June 15, Rehnquist
said, every sector of the judicial branch will be harmed, including
judicial officers who supervise 120,000 released criminals and
those accused of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public will be denied the services and the protections
they expect and to which they are entitled,'' Rehnquist wrote.
``Respect for a separate and co-equal branch of government suggests
that the judiciary be assured it can continue its full level of
operations at the funding level already approved.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal judiciary includes the Supreme Court, the 13 U.S.
circuit courts of appeals, the Court of International Trade and 94
district courts and their bankruptcy-court units. More than 49,000
cases were filed last fiscal year in the courts of appeals, more
than 282,000 criminal and civil cases were brought in district
courts and more than 1 million individuals and businesses filed for
bankruptcy, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rehnquist's plea for a separation between courts and
politics, it was the Supreme Court that helped fuel the ongoing
dispute between Democrats and Republicans on the Census issue. In a
January decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Census must be
conducted by a traditional head count of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling marked a defeat for Democrats who wanted to
complement the traditional calculation with a statistical method to
account for millions of people they say the standard Census misses.
Republicans successfully countered that the federal Census Act
prohibits anything but an actual head count during the decennial
population survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high court's decision, the debate rages in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would like the Commerce Department to conduct two
censuses: one, a traditional count of the U.S. population that
determines how the 435 seats in the House of Representatives will
be apportioned among the states, and a second one that uses a
statistical formula to account for people missed in the standard
method, primarily minorities and poor people, historically strong
voting blocs for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The latter calculation would be used to determine the
distribution of state House seats and for doling out federal funds.
Republicans, by contrast, say the traditional head count is the
only valid, constitutionally permissible accounting of the U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing debate has made Republicans reluctant to provide the
additional funding for the Commerce Department that Democrats want.
As a result, the legislation, which includes funding for the
judiciary, is stalled.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Rehnquist noted that Congress passed special
funding legislation during the 1995 government shutdown to ensure
that the federal courts would remain open, even though lawmakers _
mired in a partisan dispute over federal funding _ refused for
several weeks to pass legislation to finance U.S. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same spirit which has motivated that action, I urge in
the strongest possible terms that funding for the judiciary quickly
be made available for the remainder of this fiscal year,''
Rehnquist wrote.

PRIMAKOV OFFERS A HELPING HAND _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton found himself Tuesday in the same
situation as President George Bush in 1991 _ weighing the impact of
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's dramatic rush into a war
zone to talk peace with a Soviet-era ally.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo crisis, Clinton rejected any suggestion that the
Primakov's six-hour summit with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade Tuesday had yielded enough concessions for
the allies to call off their bombing campaign against Yugoslav
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when Primakov flew to Iraq eight years ago seeking to
avert an allied ground war against Saddam Hussein's forces by
securing concessions from Saddam, Bush said that the effort ``falls
well short of what would be required.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose administration said it welcomed Primakov's
diplomatic foray into Yugoslavia, nevertheless condemned Milosevic
for continuing to press his ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign against
``completely innocent'' ethnic Albanian Muslims in Kosovo. More
than 120,000 refugees have fled the onslaught to neighboring
nations in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected as ``unacceptable'' Milosevic's statement
following his summit with Primakov in which he pledged to ``accept
Russia's suggestion'' to ``start decreasing the presence'' of
40,000 Yugoslav forces in the breakaway province of Kosovo ``after
the bombing stops.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton argued that ``President Milosevic began this brutal
campaign; it is his responsibility to bring it to an immediate end
and embrace a just peace. There is a strong consensus in NATO that
we must press forward with our military action.''
</P>
<P>
   In words similar to those used by Bush in 1991, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said Milosevic's offer fell ``far short of
what is necessary in order for NATO to stop its air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added, ``Our position is clear: Milosevic must halt the
offensive against the Kosovar Albanians, withdraw his forces, and
embrace a settlement based on the (peace plan that Milosevic
rejected before allied bombing began last Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Milosevic, Primakov flew to Bonn to brief
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, chairman of the 15-nation
European Union, who called Clinton about Milosevic's blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also rejected Milosevic's response as ``no basis for a
political solution'' after hearing from Primakov that the Yugoslav
leader had agreed to cease attacks on ethnic Albanians and withdraw
some forces from Kosovo only if the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) halts its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, a former Russian foreign minister and chief of the old
Soviet spy organization, the KGB, has built his career in the
post-Cold War era by sweeping into hostile settings to try to
negotiate dramatic peace agreements with the leaders of nations
once allied with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Serbs were allied with Russian Serbs to fight
Ottoman Turkish rule for six centuries before World War I. Both
Serb populations are Orthodox Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this decade of communal bloodshed in the former
republics of Yugoslavia, the Russians have worked to ease western
allied pressure on the Yugoslav Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over as Russia's foreign minister in 1996,
Primakov flew to Belgrade to urge Milosevic to keep the promises he
had made in conjunction with the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace
agreement for Bosnia in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After having lunch with Milosevic in Belgrade on May 30, 1996,
Primakov said the Yugoslav leader was ``doing his best to fulfill
completely all the Dayton agreements'' including turning over
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military
commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who had been indicted as war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost three years later, the two remain free.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's most dramatic missions came before and during the
Persian Gulf War, when he repeatedly flew to Baghdad to urge Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his occupation forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1990, the U.N. Security Council _ giving Primakov
one last chance to persuade Saddam _ delayed its proposed Jan. 1,
1991, deadline for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait until
Jan. 15 of that year.
</P>
<P>
   But Primakov's last-ditch mission failed, and the Soviet Union
did not exercise its veto in the U.N. Security Council so that the
15-member council could approve the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the allied air war against Saddam got under way on
Jan. 17, 1991, Primakov continued his efforts to avert the
impending allied ground attack on Iraqi forces. Primakov helped
draft a new rendition of the Soviet peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined to Iraqi Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow on Feb.
18, 1991, the plan called for a cease-fire, complete withdrawal of
Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait and cessation of international
economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The United States rejected the proposal. Bush, poised to launch
a massive ground campaign to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait,
faulted the plan for failing to require Iraq to pay reparations to
Kuwait or to restore Kuwait's royal family to power.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Primakov's effort fell ``well short'' of what he
would accept, Bush said he did ``appreciate'' the Russian effort.
But he added, in tones similar to Clinton's on Tuesday: ``Let me
just reiterate, as far as I'm concerned there are no negotiations.
The goals have been set out; there will be no concessions. We're
not going to give.''

LIKE MOST OF THE WEB, IT'S BUYER BEWARE WHEN GIVING TO ONLINE
CHARITIES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This is an abridged version of ONLINE-CHARITIES.)

 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Americans become increasingly comfortable shopping online,
it's a pitch many succumb to: Buy an Elmo toy or a Stephen King
novel through our Web sites, and part of the purchase price will go
to the charity of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel good that while you are shopping, a little
bit goes to a worthy cause,'' said Sissy Brunk, who patronizes one
of the half-dozen sites making this pitch because she is convinced
she is helping a children's charity she admires.
</P>
<P>
   But once you buy Elmo online, what happens to the few dollars
you thought was speeding its way to a good cause? While many
charities are getting checks directly from these sites _ which
claim to have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for charity _
it is impossible to know in every case. It may not end up in the
charity's hands as fast as you imagined _ if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Amounts may fall below some trigger point the retailer or Web
site has set before it will send a check. Money may not be credited
to the charity because of computer glitches. Or shoppers may fail
to follow somewhat burdensome instructions. One site,
www.igive.com, even carries a disclaimer, deep in the electronic
fine print, that it may be impossible to guarantee that the charity
gets the money.
</P>
<P>
   The last few weeks illustrate some pitfalls:
</P>
<P>
   _ IGive prides itself on letting shoppers name any cause they
fancy, and since the site was born in November 1997, they've
identified more than 4,300 of them. But in interviews, the site's
founder said not even half met the $10 threshold required by IGive
that a charity needs to raise through shoppers' purchases before
the site will cut a check. And IGive has not verified half of those
that qualify. The upshot: fewer than a quarter have been paid or
can expect a check soon. IGive, which said that it has written
checks for $200,000 of the $300,000 earmarked for charity, said
that it will do its best to make sure every charity gets its money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another site, www.charityweb.com, divides any money that has
been pledged to 20 causes that ostensibly have ``peace, life and
love'' in common unless shoppers e-mail other instructions. Those
20 include a Stanford University day-care center, where the site's
founders, a 1996 Stanford MBA and his wife, send one of their
children. The day-care center is one of only two causes that have
received money, only a couple of hundred dollars, so far. The
founder, Kurt Hansen, said that he included the center because he
is on its board but that the site is largely composed of causes he
has no connection with.
</P>
<P>
   _ One site that was full of promise only weeks ago,
www.charitymall.com, has temporarily shut down. Another,
www.socialgoods.com, has been absorbed by a rival,
www.4charity.com. These disruptions raise questions as to what will
happen to money already pledged.
</P>
<P>
   Some charities choose not to participate and object to how their
names are sometimes being used. American Red Cross, for instance,
agreed last year to conduct pilot programs with three new Web sites
that seemed to have financial backing and reputable managers.
Recently, the Red Cross bowed out of the pilot program after it
failed to generate the desired financial results.
</P>
<P>
   And until contacted by a reporter, the Red Cross was unaware
that it was also listed on two other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dilutes the brand, and it can be very confusing,'' said
Bill Blaul, a Red Cross spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   To the entrepreneurs behind the Web sites, these hiccups are
just growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   These sites, serving as a middleman between the retailer and the
charity, promise a stream of revenue to charities. Typically, the
money the sites say will go to charity comes from commissions they
earn from online retailers like Amazon.com and J. Crew in exchange
for referring customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most Web sites keep part of the commission, but those that send
it all to charity can still make money by selling advertising and
product placement, finding corporate sponsors or hawking
information about shoppers' habits to market researchers. Many
sites promise not to reveal personal information without
permission, though it is too early to know whether they keep their
word.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet holds huge potential for charities. Nonprofits can
use it to reach donors as never before, e-mailing them about
initiatives, creating forums where donors can meet, and inviting
donations at a fraction of the cost of mass mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of these shopping sites say they, too, are helping
reinvent charity. ``We have become part of the fabric of a large
number of nonprofits,'' said Robert Grosshandler, who founded IGive
in Evanston, Ill., 18 months ago. IGive appears to be the oldest
site, and perhaps the largest, claiming 43,000 registered shoppers
doing what it calls ``Technogiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites' popularity is growing as charities tell donors to
check them out, as shoppers tell other shoppers about them and as
people surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a great medium for this kind of giving,'' said
Fiona Swerdlow, an analyst for Jupiter Communications, a research
firm in New York. ``It should be something that appeals to a lot of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention charities. ``This kind of thing helps a lot,''
said Lenna Silberman Scott, a spokeswoman for Families of Spinal
Muscular Atrophy in Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The shop-for-a-cause sites are quick to promote this lofty role.
But the half-dozen or so that have opened in recent months are all
very much for-profit businesses. Some were created by successful
entrepreneurs, some by freshly minted business school graduates.
They tend to be mom-and-pop operations with little venture capital
or corporate backing. And as private businesses, they divulge
almost nothing about how well they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are significant differences,'' said William P. Massey,
president of the National Charities Information Bureau, a watchdog
in New York that says shoppers can easily stumble unless they
understand how each site works.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from clear what rules, if any, apply. The Web sites do
not consider themselves traditional fund-raisers or solicitors,
governed by state laws. Only a few have registered with state
regulators. And none appear to be posting bonds or creating other
backstops to insure that money pledged doesn't get diverted.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of such sites represents ``the beginning of the
problem,'' said Michael DeLucia, director of charitable trusts for
New Hampshire and president of the National Association of State
Charity Officials. ``It is a perfect opportunity for a classic
telemarketing charity scam.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So what are consumers to do? Confusion reigns over how
electronic transactions work, how much actually goes to charity,
and who, if anyone, might claim a tax deduction. Even the simplest
question _ which site delivers the most to charity _ is not
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers can also be forgiven for thinking they are
eligible for a tax deduction. They're not. Yet, only two sites,
MyCause and Shop2Give, make that clear. And Shop2Give even tells
shoppers not to lose hope _ it is ``actively working on finding a
solution that can accommodate tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fear of state regulators and charity watchdogs is
that many sites are accountable to no one. Only a few say they have
registered under state law to do cause-related marketing. Other
sites say they do not fall under existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   State laws also come into play when sites raise money without
the charities' cooperation. When the American Camping Association,
for example, found itself on MyCause.com, it requested information
about the site's activities, to no avail. Though the group has not
asked to have its name removed, ``we feel very removed from it,''
said Bob Shultz, the director of development.
</P>
<P>
   So whether these shop-for-a-cause sites become a permanent part
of the online scene depends a lot on what kind of results they
deliver for charities and consumers. What worries Scott Dunlap, the
founder of 4charity.com, is that some sites _ ones that mislead
consumers or alienate charities _ ``will ruin it for the rest of
us.''

MARKET BACKS OFF A DAY AFTER TOPPING 10,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after finishing above 10,000 for the first time
in history, the Dow Jones industrial average slumped Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The index declined 93.52 points to 9913.26, erasing half the
gains that propelled it to a record high of 10,006.78 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The market's inability to sustain this milestone for even one
day prompted money managers and investment specialists to revisit a
question they have asked themselves over and over in recent months:
How strong is the bull in this market?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the narrowness of this market is healthy. I
don't think it's good that 50 or 100 companies have propelled the
S&AMP;P 500 over the past two years,'' said Claudia Mott, director of
small-company research for Prudential Securities Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While blue-chip stocks, led by US computer companies, have
soared nearly 8 percent this year, small-company stocks have not
been lifted by the rally. In fact, they have actually declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000, an index that tracks the performance of small
companies, has lost 5 1/2 percent this year, while the Dow is up
nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.42 points, closing at 1300.75,
while the Nasdaq, the index of the country's booming technology
industry, was down 12.55 points, closing at 2480.29. The S&AMP;P's and
Nasdaq's declines, like the Dow's, amounted to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mott said investors who are profiting from the blue-chip bull
market are defying the age-old investment advice to diversify. They
``own a bunch of Internet stocks and a bunch of blue chips and
think that's all they need.'' At some point, she said, this
``economic nirvana is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But pessimistic voices like Mott's are being drowned out by a
chorus of Wall Street money managers, economists and stock gurus
who see few reasons why a sky-high market cannot continue rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, after its periodic meeting Tuesday to
discuss interest rates, said there would be no changes. The agency
also did not reveal whether it was leaning toward tightening or
loosening the money supply at a time when asset-price inflation and
a booming market are as much a concern as the fear the economy
could slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no meaningful changes'' in the factors driving
the market, said Easton Ragsdale, director of quantitative research
for State Street Research &AMP; Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters is that the economy here in the US has
been strong. If anything, it's been going from strength to
strength,'' Ragsdale said, citing low interest rates, low
inflation, and higher consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The good news rolls on. The Conference Board reported that
consumer confidence leaped more than expected in March to 133.9,
from a revised 133.1 in February.
</P>
<P>
   If investors perceived that ``the economy couldn't keep growing
or the Fed would tighten a lot, the market would be worried,'' said
Robert Mellman, a vice president and senior economist in New York
for J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of economic weakness came on Monday with a slip in
February US new-home sales, the third straight month numbers have
fallen after a strong performance in 1998. Economists said the
housing market may be cooling, though there is little evidence of
that in Boston's surging real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   Housing ``has been strong but now it looks like it's starting to
roll over,'' in part because interest rates have risen slightly,
said Ragsdale. ``If rates come up a little bit, that's also
something that's negative for the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that is crystal clear in this market is that big
companies keep charging ahead. Although the reasons for it are less
clear, analysts have some theories.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the huge increase in recent years in the amount of
money is flowing into stocks, from baby boomers saving for
retirement and from from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Just as prospects that the Dow would hit 10,000 have been a
powerful magnet for Americans, Mellman says it has also attracted
money from Europeans, Asians, and other overseas investors.

SUPREME COURT REINSTATES CONVICTION IN MULTISTATE KIDNAPPING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A drug deal that went bad in Houston five years ago
ended at the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that the revenge kidnapping of a mid-level
dealer, whose boss stole 30 kilograms of cocaine from a Houston
drug distributor, can be tried in any state through which the
kidnapper drove his hostage. In its 7-2 decision, the high court
broadly interpreted a federal criminal law, as well as
constitutional provisions that require trials to be held in the
same state and district where the crime was allegedly committed.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, ruling in a case that wound up in New Jersey, said
kidnapping is a continuing offense that can be tried in any state
where the hostage was held. Based on that rationale, the high court
said violations of the federal law barring gunplay ``during and in
relation to'' a kidnapping can also be tried in any state where the
hostage was held _ even if the weapon was actually used in a
different state involved in the kidnapping, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   The multistate odyssey that the justices resolved began when a
New York drug dealer stole the cocaine in 1994. The angry drug
distributor hired Jacinto Rodriguez-Moreno to kidnap the dealer's
middleman, Ephrain Avendano, and find the thief.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Moreno, a few cohorts and Avendano drove from Texas to
the hostage's New Jersey apartment, then to a house in New York and
finally to a home in Maryland. By this time, Rodriguez-Moreno was
ready to abandon the search for the New York drug dealer and just
kill Avendano.
</P>
<P>
   So Rodriguez-Moreno took possession of the homeowner's .357
Magnum revolver and held it against Avendano's neck, but withdrew
the weapon at the request of his cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   Avendano later escaped through the back door and ran to a
neighboring house. The neighbors called the police, who arrested
Rodriguez-Moreno and his cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Moreno was charged with, among other offenses, using
and carrying a firearm ``during and in relation to'' the kidnapping
of Avendano. The federal government tried Rodriguez-Moreno in the
U.S. District Court for New Jersey, which convicted him. He was
sentenced to seven years in prison for kidnapping, and 5 years in
prison for the gun offense.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Moreno appealed his conviction, arguing that the New
Jersey federal court had no authority to rule in his case because
he had committed the gun crime in Maryland, not New Jersey. The 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed and overturned the district
court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court reinstated Rodriguez-Moreno's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The justices conceded that he had used the gun in Maryland but
said the weapon was used ``during and in relation to'' a kidnapping
that occurred not just in Maryland but also in New Jersey, Texas,
New York and states in between. Hence, the defendant was properly
tried in New Jersey, the court said in United States vs.
Rodriguez-Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kidnapping, once begun, does not end until the victim is
free,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court's majority.
``It does not make sense, then, to speak of it in discreet
geographic fragments.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting from the decision, Justices Antonin Scalia and John
Paul Stevens assailed their colleagues for their broad reading of
the federal law, saying the statute limits criminality to the use
of a gun during a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   The only state in which Rodriguez-Moreno used a firearm was
Maryland, and that is the only place where he can be tried, the
justices said.

HONG KONG RULING STYMIES IMMIGRANTS FROM MAINLAND 
</HEADLINE>
 KONG-CITIZENS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a ruling intended to block an influx of hundreds
of thousands of new immigrants, a local court said Tuesday that
mainland Chinese who can claim Hong Kong citizenship must go home
and wait their turn. The system involves years of delays.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew an outcry from plaintiffs who have lived
separately from their families for more than 20 years, and who had
hoped to stay here on temporary visitor's permits while applying
for resident cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge says he `understands' that I applied to come here 22
years ago and have not yet been able to join my father, my mother,
my siblings, and now my husband,'' said Lin Li, 28, holding back
tears after the ruling was announced. ``For 20 years of suffering,
he uses one word: `understand.' Is that all? How many 20 years does
one have in a life?''
</P>
<P>
   The final decision on this case will have broad constitutional,
social, and economic implications for this rich, free-wheeling
former British colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 under
an agreement that it would enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy.''
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities worry that a flood of poor
mainlanders seeking a better life would drag down this prosperous
financial center that has been an engine for growth on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, 100 demonstrators claiming to be eligible
migrants or relatives of eligible migrants waited quietly for the
ruling and mourned the result. Many wore placards indicating the
years they have waited. Last month, 382 mainlanders who overstayed
visas held a two-week vigil outside government offices until they
were permitted to stay pending Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the ruling, Hong Kong immigration authorities
detained 132 of an estimated 1,200 mainlanders who have overstayed
visas and announced plans to deport them. Another 28 agreed to
voluntarily return. Authorities warned illegals of penalties of up
to three years in prison. The 17 plaintiffs are appealing Tuesday's
ruling, and can stay pending its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids should have the right to be with their families _ they
haven't done anything wrong,'' said Lam Shiao-lian, 49, a legal
resident of Hong Kong whose 26-year-old daughter, Cheng
Liang-liang, has been applying to leave China since 1978. Of Lam's
four children, only one has received permission to move here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit letting us all come would have an impact on the
economy, but what about my rights and what's guaranteed in the
Basic Law?'' Lam said, referring to Hong Kong's post-colonial
constitution, which says children of Hong Kong's permanent
residents have the right to live here.
</P>
<P>
   With estimates of eligible migrants ranging from 300,000 to 3
million people, many here fear mainland migrants with little
education and menial skills could not contribute to a modern,
high-tech economy. Critics say they would strain schools,
hospitals, and other services in a city of 6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But defenders of migrants point out that Hong Kong has always
been a city of migrants, that it grew from the sweat of mainland
refugees. Hong Kong evolved from a trading port to an industrial
center thanks to refugees from the mainland's communist revolution
50 years ago, and recent migrants have manned the territory's
service sector.
</P>
<P>
   Today, half of Hong Kong's residents are refugees from the
mainland, and the other half are descendants of mainland refugees.
Last year, under the daily quota of 150 mainland migrants, more
than 50,000 settled here legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did we do in the '50s and '60s with all those
immigrants?'' asked Pam Baker, an attorney for the migrants. ``We
need those kids. Birth rates are dropping, people are living
longer, there aren't going to be any taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The migrants' case was filed after Hong Kong's highest court
ruled two months ago against the government's attempt to limit
migrants' eligibility. The Court of Final Appeal said even children
born out-of-wedlock or before a parent became a permanent resident
have the right to live here. The court added that it had ``a duty''
to strike down any Chinese laws that conflict with Hong Kong's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That sparked a row with Beijing and a virtual constitutional
crisis that was settled only when Hong Kong's high court issued a
``clarification'' last month stating that they were not challenging
China's authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a constitution before _ we've always envied
you guys,'' said Baker, a longtime Hong Kong resident. ``Now that
we've got one, we've got to jolly well defend it. And this ruling
is unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Yash Ghai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said
it was inappropriate for a court to balance the rights of
prospective migrants against the welfare of the city. ``Some kinds
of rights can be balanced _ like free speech and public safety. But
in this case, either you're a citizen or you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mainlanders, ethnic Chinese from the United States,
Canada, Taiwan, or nearly anywhere else in the world are allowed to
come here and apply for rapid residency, raising questions about
discrimination against one group.
</P>
<P>
   It is also widely acknowledged that corruption plagues the exit
system in China, enabling people with money and connections to come
here faster, creating a two-tiered system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many who see the logic of Tuesday's lower court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Legislator David Chu, who grew up partly in Boston, compared
Tuesday's ruling to regulations on Americans' constitutional right
to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to carry a weapon, you have to get a permit. These
children clearly have the right to live in Hong Kong, but in order
to do that, you must get the permit. And according to the rules,
this must be done in China.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ It was in the air: the thrill of the illicit and the
new, the excitement of discovery and the charge of an encounter
with idols. And it didn't take place on a baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   Just after the Baltimore Orioles broke ground by playing a Cuban
team here, musicians by the score and fans by the thousands poured
into the Karl Marx Theater on Sunday night in this city's elegant
Playa district for the Music Bridges concert, the biggest
convergence of foreign and Cuban musicians since the revolution.
Before that came a week of impromptu collaborations outdoors and in
makeshift studios.
</P>
<P>
   From the United States came singers like Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy
Buffett, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Joan Osborne, Lisa Loeb, Burt
Bacharach and more. The Cubans brought together musicians from the
folk, rock and popular dance music scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the all-star concert at the Karl Marx flickered and
droned, the lead-up concerts had people dancing and cheering, and
the future of this enterprise, musical or otherwise, seemed as hazy
and unpredictable as anything else involving Cuban-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Music Bridges, an organization that specializes in concerts in
politically sensitive countries, had spent a year and a half
pulling together the legal and practical permission from the United
States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Music Bridges, with its 40-some participating American
musicians, had come to Havana and taken more than 120 rooms in the
Hotel Nacional, overlooking the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The organization filled the sixth-floor executive offices and
the presidential suite, along with three rooms that had been
converted into recording studios. For a week Cuban and American
musicians were to collaborate on songs and to present the works on
the final night in a long concert at the Karl Marx Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At events around the city American musicians were getting a feel
for the power of Cuban music and its bacchanalian spirit. In the
wee hours of Thursday night at La Cecilia nightclub, Michael
Franti, a rapper and band leader from San Francisco, mounted the
stage with Cuba's version of the Rolling Stones, Los Van Van, a
30-year-old institution playing hard-rocking dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Franti started rapping and repeating a phrase, and Pedrito, one
of the group's singers, entered the fray; the two swapped nonsense
syllables, but with rhythm. It would have brought down the roof,
but La Cecilia is outdoors. Members of the audience _ made up of
faranduleros, the habitues of Havana's night life scene, Music
Bridges staff members and performers, and journalists _ were
impressed and they danced.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at the Charlie Chaplin Theater in the Vedado
district, Americans and what remains of members of Cuba's
intellectual culture had the chance to hear the Buena Vista Social
Club play cha-cha-chas, mambos and boleros that have mostly fallen
into disregard.
</P>
<P>
   The performance, which was not part of Music Bridges, offered an
opportunity to hear music with extreme grace and humor, one of the
great musical syntheses of the New World, where classical, jazz and
African music merged into something special. Played by old, weary
and worn musicians, the music reflected the prerevolution grandeur
of Cuban society, as does the best architecture of the city, also
worn, weary and prerevolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   The American producer of the Buena Vista band, Ry Cooder, who
was in Cuba for a screening of a new documentary about the group
directed by Wim Wenders, said of the music: ``I've never seen any
scene explode as quickly as this. That's good, and that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it was one of the greatest windfalls of positive
publicity the Cuban government has had in its post-Batista history.
Though the economic embargo of Cuba, the Helms-Burton Act, leaves a
loophole for cultural exchange, nothing of this size had been
attempted before.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban side, which has everything to gain from such
exchanges, regularly proclaimed its happiness with events like this
one; the American side was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the American musicians had barely a clue about
either Cuban music or Cuban-American relations, the predominant
view seemed to be that antagonistic relationships between the two
countries did little for Cubans or Americans. Ms. Raitt, who came
fully informed and loaded for bear, brought 37 guitars to give
away, and a pile of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that the embargo the American government has
placed on Cuba just hurts the Cuban people,'' Ms. Raitt said. ``So
I went to my guitar company and bought a bunch of guitars at cost,
and I'm going to give lots away to the music school here, and the
rest to people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year Cuba has cracked down on the casual
prostitution prevalent on the streets and in the dance clubs. Where
clubs with live music were once almost too numerous to count, now
nearly all have been closed by the government. One result is that
the best bands no longer play regularly, and one of the world's
great music scenes is moribund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Havana seems to be undergoing renovation for tourists,
and Old Havana is flooded with new hotels and stores that suggest
that the economy is doing well. Unfortunately the average Cuban is
not allowed to enter the hotels and has little or no access to the
dollar economy that has sprung up alongside the peso.
</P>
<P>
   In a seeming effort to ensure that the city is safe for tourism
and to reduce crime, the police, on nearly every corner, were
stopping Cubans and checking identification. Some residents
associated with the music exchange said that many Cubans from
outside Havana were being shipped to jail or back home.
</P>
<P>
   While generally unaware of the politics, American visitors were
stunned by the skills of their Cuban counterparts. Some musicians
stayed at the Nacional and worked with their Cuban partners.
Others, like N'Dea Davenport, the former lead singer from the
British group the Brand New Heavies, stayed and worked in Old
Havana with her writing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here regardless of the hardships,'' said Ms.
Davenport, who now lives in New Orleans. ``The reason I love New
Orleans is that there's music everywhere, and it's the same here.
Everybody sings or dances or plays an instrument. It's changing my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Cuban musician, taught from age 7 in government-run
conservatories, is among the best trained and musically literate in
the world, schooled in classical music, pop and jazz. While the
American musicians were discovering the riches of Cuban music, the
Cubans were learning plenty from the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of their countrymen, Cuban musicians receive only bits
and pieces of information from the outside world. They look to the
United States for musical cues but get music from the most powerful
stations in Miami or New Orleans, which guarantees a view of a
music world heavy on Kenny G and the worst pop. Other information
comes from furtive conversations or secondhand accounts of people
who have seen bands in Europe. And maybe they will get the
occasional recording.
</P>

   ``The most amazing thing about this encounter is the ability to
hang out with our idols, to learn what's behind the music that
we've heard all our lives,'' said Luis de la Cruz, guitarist,
composer and leader of the band Bolsa Negra (Black Market). ``It's
one thing to hear a bit of music on the radio, but to actually sit
down with somebody we admire and ask questions and collaborate on
something intimate like the writing process is really incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Varela, one of Cuba's most important singer-songwriters,
collaborated with the Indigo Girls. He has played in the United
States a few times and has flirted with major record labels. But
Cuba's isolation, apart from the infatuation with the island
internationally, almost guarantees the failure of an international
career. For him the weeklong stay was important for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to the United States the next time, I have a hundred
telephone numbers of musicians to call, new friends I've made,'' he
said. ``People want me to come to collaborate, to write and record
with them. For that reason alone this is invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chucho Valdes, the dean of Cuban musicians, pianist and leader
of the group Irakere, thought the encounter was going to leave a
permanent impression on the Cuban music scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Valdes, who is also
the director of the nearly annual Havana Jazz Festival, which
usually attracts a handful of American musicians. ``The things that
we lack, a formal sophistication in pop music and harmonic sense,
we're learning right now. And the way to produce sound, to get a
good sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the final Music Bridges concert was pretty much an
artistic disaster, unlike the weeklong exchange. Generally American
pop musicianship is, to be kind, basic. The Cubans were often
reduced to being the professional hired hands backing the
illiterate boss.
</P>
<P>
   Most songs were in English, with Americans leading the bands.
The Americans were mostly white, mostly folk-oriented and mostly
second rate. It is an old history. The recordings of the concert,
and the music made at the Hotel National may be released, depending
on legal restrictions imposed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few good moments. Ms. Davenport tore the place
apart with a song she and the Cuban singer Rene Banos sang called
``Que Importa,'' in which they listed the differences between them,
including their beer-brand preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Osborne, backed by Manolito y Su Trabuco, sang a deep and
funny blues that had the audience on its feet. There were some
mildly political songs _ Ms. Raitt sang ``Cuba Is Way Too Cool'' _
but most performers stuck to ``We Are the Worldisms.'' (One tune
was called ``One World.'')
</P>
<P>
   But most people, though the musicians had worked hard on the
songs, weren't really looking for an end. The means, in this case,
was sufficient.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember the first Ford Taurus? When the car was
introduced in late 1985, its smooth, aerodynamic curves shook up
the design of midsize sedans. And despite fears that its radical
look would turn off car buyers, sales took off almost immediately.
Moreover, its success was one of the early signs of the resurgence
of Ford Motor Co. that has brought it today to the brink of
surpassing General Motors Corp. as the largest automaker in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ford unveiled the new Taurus on Tuesday at the New York
International Auto Show. But do not look for any surprises. While
it may sell well if it is priced cheaply enough, it is unlikely to
win any contests for style. Indeed, the most distinctive thing
about the new Taurus is probably how indistinguishable it is from
all the other look-alike midsize sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives, while acknowledging that the design of the
Taurus is cautious and conservative, say it will offer the comfort,
competitive price and numerous safety features that consumers want
in midsize cars these days. ``More than the styling, it's the total
package: quality, value, safety,'' said James O'Connor, Ford's
president for Ford brand cars and light trucks. ``I think the
consumer in general doesn't make styling the No. 1 preference in
that segment, as opposed to, say, the Mustang segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Automotive design experts say that the 2000 model year Taurus
represents something of a milestone. It is the last of the once
stylish, high-volume midsize sedans to take on a new, more generic
look as Ford and other automakers put most of their automotive
styling efforts elsewhere. After reigning for decades as the main
focus of automotive design in the United States, midsize sedans are
losing their primacy to sport utility vehicles and to an ever
growing array of so-called crossover vehicles that combine features
of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, station wagons and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from the 2000 Taurus are many of the quirky external
features that made earlier models, including a 1996 redesign, so
distinctive. The oval rear window, oval dashboard and many of the
other features that distinguished the Taurus sedan for the last
three years have been replaced with plain, rectangular designs for
windows and dashboard alike.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the sheet metal, remarkably little has been changed,
allowing Ford to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses
for engineering work and new factory tooling. The whole underbody
of the vehicle has been left virtually untouched, while the engine
is the same other than a few tweaks to improve its horsepower. Ford
did not even bother with the time and cost of designing a new rear
window for the wagon version of the new Taurus, leaving an oval
rear window on it even while the rest of the vehicle has assumed a
more rectangular look.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons, experts say, why midsize cars have
become so indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Americans who value distinctive automotive styling are
increasingly choosing sport utility vehicles and crossover
vehicles, like Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus RX-300, rather than
buying midsize sedans. A growing proportion of new cars are also
being purchased by households with three or more vehicles, and
these households tend to choose plainly designed sedans to go with
more fashionable vehicles in their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, midsize car prices are slowly falling because of an
excess of factory capacity and a glut of late-model sedans coming
off leases or being sold by rental companies. This encourages
automakers to cut engineering costs and limits their ability to add
fancy styling touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't as many people in sedans who are willing to pay
for styling,'' said Susan Jacobs, the president of Jacobs &AMP;
Associates, an auto consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J. ``It's wise
for the styling dollars to go into the fun vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   In marketing focus groups, buyers of midsize cars also tend to
disagree with each other about what they want, unlike buyers of
sport utility vehicles, so car designers must make many compromises
between conflicting demands, said Jerry Hirshberg, president for
North American design at Nissan Motor Co. ``We've gotten a bit
risk-averse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, of course, say they are not especially
interested in automotive styling and would be perfectly happy with
vehicles that simply provide comfortable, reliable transportation.
But auto executives and market analysts say that Americans' buying
decisions do not back up such statements.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles sell briskly even though most buyers do
not use them for off-road driving, while vehicles that evoke the
image of sport utilities, like the Pontiac Montana minivan, are
increasingly popular. A few imaginatively styled midsize sedans,
like the Volkswagen Passat and Pontiac Grand Prix, have been
successful, garnering praise from the automotive media and consumer
evaluators alike. But they occupy relatively low-sales niches in
the overall market for midsize sedans.
</P>
<P>
   John Waraniak, a managing director of Benchmarking Partners, an
automotive consulting firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said he had
spread out photographs in his kitchen of four new, high-sales
sedans going on sale this year and early next year: Ford Taurus,
Oldsmobile Aurora, Chevrolet Impala and Nissan Maxima. His wife,
Terri, was unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `They all look the same to me,' and she's the kind
of person, about 40 years old, who might switch from a sport
utility if there were something exciting to switch to,'' Waraniak
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth sedan, Saturn's first midsize car, will also go on sale
soon but GM has not released photographs of it. The midsize Saturn
LS, which is being introduced Wednesday at the New York auto show,
has styling that does not depart significantly from other similarly
sized sedans on the market, according to John Middlebrook, GM's
vice president for vehicle brand marketing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Midsize cars are important. Close to $100 billion worth are sold
each year in the United States, making it the biggest single
segment of the American auto market. It is almost as big a business
as the world's passenger airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the midsize sedan market has been eroded by the success of
sport utility vehicles and minivans, falling to 27 percent of the
family vehicle market last year from 33 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Auto engineers object to suggestions that their midsize cars are
boring, but they seldom suggest that their offerings are on the
cutting edge, either. David Marinaro, the chief program engineer
for the 2000 Taurus, said the car ``was designed around
functionality, the whole car was designed around that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Taurus is also designed so that Ford can build it and
sell it for no more money than a current Taurus and possibly for
less. Although Ford has not yet decided on the actual price,
everything is geared to keeping down costs. By keeping the
underbody and the door openings the same as for the previous
Taurus, for instance, Ford can continue to use a lot of the same
factory equipment to build it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to be actually equal to or lower in cost'' for
manufacturing the new model, Marinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The more modest design of the new Taurus partly reflects the
difficulties Ford had in selling the model that is about to be
phased out. Ford spared no expense in redesigning the Taurus for
the 1996 model year, hoping to repeat the success of the original
1986 Taurus. The 1986-style Taurus produced enormous profits for
Ford, becoming the nation's best-selling car from 1992 through
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1996 redesign bombed. Many people complained that the
new vehicle looked too unusual. Perhaps more seriously, Ford also
had to raise the price by $1,000 to cover the extensive engineering
expenses and the cost of features like waves in the sheet metal on
the side. Ford was not prepared to compete on price a year later
when Honda Motor Co. and Toyota, respectively, introduced
less-expensive models of the Accord and the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of radical styling and an increased sticker
price soon cost Taurus its leadership of the American car market.
The last two years, it has trailed the Accord and the Camry _ two
sedans renowned for reliability and functionality over distinctive
design _ by a large and widening margin.
</P>
<P>
   While the new midsize cars may be dull, that does not mean that
automakers are producing bland vehicles overall. Ford, GM, Nissan
and other automakers are all making separate plans, for example, to
start selling sport utility vehicles with open pickup truck beds at
the back. Indeed, soaring sales of sport utility vehicles,
minivans, pickups and crossover vehicles have produced a wave of
innovation in these market segments.
</P>
<P>
   All of these vehicles, including the crossovers, are regulated
as light trucks, which means they are partially or entirely exempt
from the regulatory straitjacket _ rules on fuel-economy, air
pollution, bumper-heights and the like _ that tends to produce car
designs that fit the same mold.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto designers think that midsize cars can be made exciting
again. DaimlerChrysler AG already makes the striking Dodge Intrepid
and Chrysler 300M, which are actually full-size cars, and is
putting a lot of effort into redesigning midsize cars, like the
Plymouth Breeze, to make them more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle changes like changing the curve of the windshield or the
width between a car's wheels could make a styling difference
without necessarily hurting affordability, said Thomas Gale, the
executive vice president for North American design at
DaimlerChrysler. ``You have to find ways which make things
exciting,'' Gale said, ``and still do it in ways which are
perceived as adding value.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg of Nissan said it would take a completely new yet
practical midsize sedan design to revive one of the oldest segments
in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's dead,'' he said. ``It's just going to take
someone who comes in and nails something fresh, as Ford did with
the first Taurus.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ The flow of refugees from Kosovo is
overwhelming neighboring countries, leading to long delays at the
borders and, in some cases, refugees are being ordered to turn
back.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees who fled Kosovo for Albania have been
spilling into Macedonia, where border officials have turned them
away, and there were reports on Tuesday that a trainload of people
coming from Kosovo was also sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Kiprijanova, speaking at a news
conference on Tuesday in Skopje, the capital, said that the country
could not cope with more refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Security Council of Macedonia has said we can
accommodate 20,000 refugees, not more,'' she said. ``We are waiting
for other countries to take refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that some 23,000 had already arrived in Macedonia.
Beyond those who have fled to Macedonia and Albania, refugees from
Kosovo have also entered the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our best to try to accommodate them all,'' Ms.
Kiprijanova said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and photographers said that they saw an unscheduled
train arrive from Kosovo at mid-morning on Tuesday. It was inside
the country when it was surrounded by armed riot police in helmets
and bullet-proof vests who trained their weapons on the passengers,
preventing them from leaving the carriages.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists watched as the engine was detached from the front,
and placed on the other end; the train was then sent back the way
it had come. Photographers followed it back to the border and
watched it return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official explanation for the turning back of the
train, according to an article in Dnevnik, the local daily
newspaper. The article also said that the train carried 1,000
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kiprijanova said that she did not know anything about the
train and denied that the Macedonian border had been closed down.
</P>
<P>
   An American diplomat making a visit to the border played down
the Macedonian reaction to the flow of refugees. ``It is a typical
reaction of any government suddenly being swamped by refugees,'' he
said. ``They say they cannot cope with the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But aid workers were more forthright, suggesting that the
Macedonian government had a lot to fear from a large influx of
ethnic Albanians, which could upset the delicate ethnic balance in
Macedonia, where, according to the government 25 percent of the
population is ethnic Albanian and 45 percent is Macedonian. Ethnic
Albanians, however, assert that they comprise 35 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it, they don't want them here,'' said
one aid official visiting the border area, who asked to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   At the border on Tuesday, ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing a
five-day ordeal of terror and bombing in Kosovo, were put through a
final test of endurance by Macedonian police.
</P>
<P>
   Two sisters, Luljeta and Nafie Hamdiu, struggled through on foot
with heavy bags and five small children. Their faces creased with
strain, eyes hollow, they said they had waited 28 hours to pass
into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Cars were backed up at least five miles, said Berat, a
22-year-old engineering student who walked out of Kosovo. He
estimated at least one thousand cars were waiting, with some five
people to a car sleeping overnight in their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gutmann, a doctor with the aid group International Medical
Corps said on Tuesday: ``It is worse than yesterday; it is hardly
moving at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, a Serbian anti-aircraft gun opened up, firing
away over the heads of the refugees into the hills behind.
</P>
<P>
   The border police at Blace refused to comment on their slow
processing of arrivals, referring all questions to the Interior
Ministry in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   For the refugees it was a cruel test. Ali Muriqi, an assistant
at the engineering faculty of Pristina University, said:
``Virtually everyone who had the possibility wanted to get out of
that nightmare. For me, none of the choices were safe. I thought we
should go, if we could survive the journey. Because if we stayed,
there was a big chance of dying, or being taken by the police. That
was a constant possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Leman, both ethnic Albanians, had not dared
leave the house for five days, as they listened to Serbian police
and paramilitaries driving around, loosing bursts of automatic
gunfire and setting off explosions around the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just waiting for the police to come and take me, to
finish me off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, all tell
the same story. At 6:30 every evening, the electricity would go
out, leaving the city in blackness. They would wait for the NATO
bombing, and as soon as the first explosions came, the Serbs would
begin to shoot and set off explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was afraid of the NATO bombings, the problems were from
the Serb side,'' Muriqi said.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who would only identify himself as Berat, had
mounted a lookout with his neighbors in Kosovo and described
watching civilian jeeps driving around town, apparently setting off
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw came on Tuesday morning when they watched houses
in the suburb of Dragodan, across the hill, burning. They gathered
with neighbors to form a convoy to drive out.
</P>
<P>
   Still frightened and unsure whether to risk the checkpoints on
the one hour drive to Macedonia, they made up their minds quickly
when loud gunshots rang out nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The journey was uneventful. A single police checkpoint extorted
money from them, but at others, the army and border guards waved
them through.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the Macedonians who would not let the car through.
The Muriqis came through on foot, exhausted, hungry and
traumatized. Their car and their friends were still stuck in no
man's land.

FUND-RAISING DEADLINE POSES EARLY TEST OF CANDIDATES' STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Presidential candidates, who always seem
desperate for money, have been racing around the country even more
feverishly in the last several days, hitting up contributors at
back-to-back fund-raising events and twisting arms even tighter
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 15 days, former Vice President Dan Quayle has hopped
to big money events in Orlando, Naples and Sanibel Island, Fla.;
Chicago; New Orleans and Lafayette, La.; Louisville, Ky.; Omaha,
Neb.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; and, Tuesday night, Portland, Ore. In the
past week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has hunted for money at
events in New York, Washington, New Orleans, Los Angeles and Santa
Ana, Calif., and, on Tuesday night, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopefuls are scrambling to meet a daunting
deadline: They want to amass as much money as they can by the close
of business on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This frenzy has been set off because first quarter fund-raising
reports that candidates file with the Federal Election Commission
cover the period through March 31. Since there are few tangible
ways to gauge a candidate's strength 10 months before the first
votes are cast, these first filings have taken on outsized
importance.
</P>
<P>
   The hope among campaigns is that they can demonstrate, through
raw dollars, their credibility among party leaders and in the
press. Even before most voters have focused on the campaign,
candidates are trying to spur further donations and political
support in the crucial early months of the presidential season.
Early money is particularly vital in the 2000 race because with a
compressed calendar of contests, most contenders will have to
collect the bulk of their war chests this year.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are highest, of course, for the two early
favorites, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore.
It is in their interest to play up the importance of early money.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview here Tuesday how crucial the first quarter
report will be, Bush said, ``It's the first bit of real hard news
there is in a campaign.'' His finance chairman said Bush would
probably take in about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Quayle, whose advisers said expects to raise $2
million, played down expectations. ``We're going to have the
necessary money to get our message out,'' he said. Recalling how
former Texas Gov. John B. Connally spent $13 million in the
Republican primaries in 1980 and won just one delegate, he added,
``This idea that you need to be No. 1 in fund raising _ well
President Connally found out that wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as in the case of Connally and another Texan Republican
four years ago, Sen. Phil Gramm, reading too much into these
reports can be an arbitrary exercise. Many campaigns have just
gotten underway. Elizabeth Dole, for one, has scheduled her first
big fund raiser for late April.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometimes these early filings are quite telling. ``It shows
you're in the game,'' said Rick Wright, the national finance
director for former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Michael Dukakis collected more money, earlier, than any
other Democrat. His fat bank account forced political professionals
and prospective supporters to take him seriously _ and those early
perceptions helped him win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all want to look good,'' said Stan Huckaby, a consultant
who is advising several Republican presidential candidates on how
to set up their fund-raising structures. ``But I don't think in the
first quarter you really know anything. If you had a candidate who
raised a small amount of money by the 31st of March, to know how
he's really doing you should ask specific questions such as: Does
he have major fund raisers planned in April or May that didn't show
up in the report?''
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped campaigns from instructing their staffs to
be sure to deposit every check by March 31. (The quarterly reports
do not actually have to be filed with the Federal Election
Commission until April 15.) And it has not stopped campaigns from
trying to lower expectations about how much they will raise.
Advisers to Gore, for example, have been telling reporters in
recent days that his only rival for the Democratic nomination,
Bradley, has been wildly successful in raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, chairman of Bush's national finance committee, said
in an interview Tuesday that he expects to report roughly $4
million by the end of the quarter. That would likely be higher than
other Republicans. Evans said the Bush campaign did not begin
soliciting contributions until three weeks ago. The second quarter
will be even more telling, he said, explaining that he hoped to
raise ``between 10 and 20'' million by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, an old friend of Bush who runs an oil and gas business in
Midland, Texas, said there was such enthusiasm for the governor
that people are giving money without even being solicited. At a
meeting with the governor nearly two weeks ago, he said, 500 people
showed up to volunteer to help him solicit money in Texas alone. He
said he expects to pull in a record $10 million from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not twisting arms _ we're responding to the energy and
enthusiasm for the governor,'' Evans said. ``There's people calling
in, saying, `Can I send money?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the importance of early money, Bush said, ``People
said, `Oh we're for you.' It's important for me to see what, `I'm
for you' means. Will people step up and write a check?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been raising money longer than Bush, and his advisers
said they expect to take in as much as $7 million. As part of the
vice president's end-of-the-quarter hectic push for money, his
campaign mailed a solicitation to 500,000 people on March 17 and
held fund raising events in Chicago and Birmingham, Ala., on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most other campaigns have had to hustle even more bluntly.
McCain, for one, integrated the quarterly reports into his pitch.
``At the end of March, we will file an FEC report,'' he said at a
breakfast in Washington last week. ``That will be the next judgment
that the chattering class around here will make. We will have
raised a sufficient amount of money to be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever mindful of Bush, he added, ``We're not going to raise the
most money.''
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Sen. Robert Smith, R-N.H., also was already
making excuses even before the end of the filing period.
``Unfortunately, we didn't start raising money until the end of
February, literally.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could get by anyway because ``I'm a very frugal
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate seeking the Republican
nomination, can afford to watch the rush for money with detached
amusement: He is financing his campaign mostly with his own
fortune. He plans to turn down federal matching subsidies so he
does not have to adhere to spending limits _ something Bush is also
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all scrambling to show, `We are credible. We are in
the game,' '' Forbes said. ``So you do get what I call artificial
stimulants. Instead of doing a fund raiser in April, you get it in
March.''
</P>
<P>
   It reminded him, he said, of corporate executives trying to take
quick action before their next stockholders' meeting. ``It's like a
fund manager getting rid of his dog holdings,'' he said.

   &QL;  BOTTLED WATER NOT SAFER OR CLEANER THAN TAP WATER, STUDY SAYS.
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Fine
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The picture on the bottle shows pristine mountain
tops. The label says ``pure.'' Your faucet does neither. So you pay
around a $1 to drink bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   But a study released yesterday says bottled water is not
necessarily any better than the nation's tap water. In fact, it
might even actually BE tap water, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because water comes from a bottle doesn't mean it's any
cleaner or safer than what comes from the tap,'' said Erik Olson,
the study's principle author and a senior attorney for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, a Washington D.C.-based
non profit group of scientists, lawyers and environmental
specialists, reported that 33 percent of the 103 brands of bottled
water they tested exceeded some industry and state guidelines for
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The study found 22 percent of brands violated guidelines from
California, which has the most strict regulation of all states.
</P>
<P>
   The violations were caused by contaminants found in the water
including: synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria and arsenic. If
consumed over long periods of time, some of these contaminants can
cause cancer or other health problems, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the water was high quality and did not threaten the
health of the general population. But the study's authors said the
water with contaminants that exceeded guidelines may be hazardous
to people with weakened immune systems - the frail elderly,
infants, AIDS patients. Officials from the International Bottled
Water Association said bottled water is safe to drink and the study
itself pointed out that most was high quality.
</P>
<P>
   We know it comes from a bottle. But before that? The study said
that marketing techniques sometimes mislead consumers about the
source of the water.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 to 40 percent of bottled waters are re-packaged tap
water, which may have been purified further, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi Co.'s ``Aquafina,'' features a picture of mountains on
the label and does not mention the fact that its source is tap
water from 11 different cities including Houston, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If a company takes tap water and does no further treatment to
it, the FDA requires it indicate on the label that it's from a
municipal or community source. But Aquafina is ``purified'' tap
water, and therefore exempt from that rule, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization said if a bottle's label says ``from a
municipal or community water system,'' it means tap water. Also the
study's authors recommend that consumers call or write the bottler
for the information if it is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The bottled water industry suffered a blow in the early 1990s
when benzene contamination was found in Perrier water, which was
recalled from stores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Americans drink an estimated 4 billion gallons of bottled
water a year.
</P>
<P>
   The group, conducted the study as part of its efforts to
petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have the agency
step up its oversight of bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA regulates only about 30 percent of bottled water, and
does not cover carbonated water - or water sold within a single
state, which makes up about 65 percent of bottled water.
Frequently, regulation falls mostly to the individual states.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA does not require bottlers to report any violations of
contamination problems to state or federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency,
not the FDA. The organization asks the FDA match federal standards
for tap water.
</P>
<P>
   States have widely varying water bottle regulation programs.
California's is the most stringent and accepts lower levels of
contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection did a
survey from 1992 to 1995 of 50 brands of water. It found no
violations of federal standards. But the survey raised ``concerns''
over three brands that showed elevated nitrate levels.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrates at elevated levels can cause harm to infants.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials responded to the organization's study by saying
bottled water is safe to drink and does not present a significant
health risk.

MAJ. RICK EASLEY CHOSEN FOR KC POLICE CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ The Kansas City Board of Police
Commissioners on Monday chose Maj. Rick Easley over two
higher-ranking finalists to become the city's 40th police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Easley will succeed Chief Floyd Bartch. He beat out Deputy
Chiefs James Nunn and Dennis Shreve.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting final interviews, the board voted 5-0 for
Easley. It was the first time since 1973 that the board picked
someone beneath the rank of deputy chief to be police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the best of the candidates,'' said Commissioner
Joe Mulvihill. ``I think he's going to be someone the police
officers respect and he'll be innovative and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley said the appointment would take a while to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of overwhelming,'' he said Monday night. ``It puts a
whole new meaning on March Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley said his first goal as chief is to meet the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be one of those chiefs who are out in the community
on a regular basis,'' he said. ``I'm going to attend some community
meetings as soon as I can and get to know community leaders across
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley said he always knew he had a chance because he was
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leader's a leader,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter whether
you're a major or a colonel.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, Easley will shadow Bartch for a week to learn
more about the job. A swearing-in ceremony is scheduled Friday
morning at police headquarters. The board had not decided on a
salary package for Easley.
</P>
<P>
   The three finalists were picked from a list of 42 applicants and
then six semifinalists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Jeff Simon said he hoped the deputy chief finalists
would support Easley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Nunn and Dennis Shreve have both put in 27 years to the
department, and the success of this department is going to depend
on their contributions in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   During the search, Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, a board member, and
some community members said the next police chief should be a
minority or someone with connections to minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, who is white, has said he has connections with minority
groups and, as chief, will strengthen those relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from my neighborhood remember him,'' said Acting Board
President Stacey Daniels-Young, who is black. ``He has the
contacts. He's not afraid to go out into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officers say he gets along well with minority officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter that he's not a minority, because he's
viewed as being fair,'' said Homicide Capt. Darryl Forte, who is
black. ``I worked for him in the personnel division and he made
decisions based on qualifications and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood and civic leaders, in general, supported the
board's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming City Councilman Alvin Brooks, with the Ad Hoc Group
Against Crime, acknowledged that there has been a widening gap
between black neighborhoods and the law enforcement community, but
he said communities now need to work with the new chief.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 Northland residents were debating a concealed-weapons
proposition in the Northland Neighborhoods Inc. office when word
came about Easley's selection. Neighbors who had been arguing
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a wonderful person. He will do a great job,'' said
Executive Director Carolyn Vellar, who recounted that Easley helped
form roughly 50 neighborhood watch groups.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Hartsfield, the minister at Metropolitan Missionary
Baptist Church, said he was disappointed that Nunn was not chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped that we had gotten to the point where a minority
would be selected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral candidates George Blackwood and Kay Waldo Barnes said
they would have supported any of the three finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new chief began Dec. 22, after Bartch announced
his intention to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, news broke that Nunn had paid a $35 traffic ticket in
February for Cleaver's wife. Cleaver said he didn't know that Nunn
paid the ticket until reporters started looking into the matter. He
said Nunn's favor did not affect his vote on chief. A department
spokesman said Nunn's action did not violate department policies.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting publicity prompted Daniels-Young to ask that the
board restart the search process. She said people were leaking
sensitive department information to try to kill Nunn's candidacy.
Daniels-Young initially said she wanted a leader from outside the
department, but changed her mind Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels-Young has suggested Nunn was a frequent target because
he is black, but Nunn's critics disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   They said Nunn was unpopular because of poor judgment that they
say was exhibited in Cleaver's traffic ticket and a botched
undercover investigation in 1983. That incident resulted in Nunn
receiving a 10-day suspension. Nunn said he learned from the
episode and became a better police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Shreve's career suffered a setback in 1991 when police officers,
under his command, raided the wrong house. Shreve said he changed
his management style to avoid similar mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   To help select a chief, the board surveyed officers about whom
they liked among the semi-finalists. Of the three finalists, Shreve
garnered the highest percentage of support at 25.3 percent, Easley
received 12.7 percent and Nunn 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, who grew up on the city's East Side, joined the Kansas
City Police Department in 1974 and held various positions in the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said Easley possessed all the qualities the board wanted
in a chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands the needs of the department. He's accomplished
and experienced in community policing,'' Simon said. ``He also has
a demonstrated ability for dealing with state and local government
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Dennis Eckold said Easley was very clear-cut in his
plans for the department.
</P>

overall,'' Eckold said. ``He's just a solid person. A policeman's

MINORITY WOMEN OFTEN DISCOURAGED BY LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   A recent survey of minority women at Fortune 1000 companies
confirmed what a lot of us suspected _ that a lot of talented
people are leaving corporations because of racism, lack of
opportunity and difficulties balancing work and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real wakeup call,'' said Leslie R. Wolfe, president
of the Center for Women Policy Studies, which recently released
``No More `Business as Usual': Women of Color in Corporate
America.'' ``The women in our study who are the most dissatisfied
are the high flyers. These are the ones who are likely to say, `I
don't have to do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 women from 17 Fortune 1000 companies completed
the survey. The average age of respondents was 37, average income
$51,000, and average tenure with their companies nine years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most alarming figures was that 42 percent of the
women believed that they do not have the same opportunity to be
promoted as others with similar qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Another disturbing finding was that the women with the most
training and seniority also were the ones most frustrated and
likely to leave their companies. Nearly half the women poised to
crack the glass ceiling said they felt they had to play down their
race or ethnicity to succeed, and 37 percent believed they had to
play down their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Another shocking finding was that despite several lawsuits, the
majority of the women _ 61 percent _ said they heard sexist and
sexual jokes. More than 50 percent also reported hearing racial and
ethnic jokes. Even women in senior management and executive
positions experienced this.
</P>
<P>
   Like most women in the workplace, those surveyed said their
greatest challenge was balancing work and family responsibilities.
Nearly two in three women (62 percent) reported that limited career
advancement opportunities are a big barrier to balancing their work
and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organizations need to realize that the brain power that is
walking out is having a real impact,'' said Linda Cooper Kee,
president of LGC &AMP; Associates, a Kansas City, Mo., firm that
specializes in diversity management training, consulting and
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   So what can companies do? Two-thirds of the women said flexible
scheduling would make a significant difference. Women also wanted
career advancement programs, mentoring programs and increased
educational and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies who don't implement these policies will, in the long
run, pay a far greater price. They will lose the money they have
spent training these talented individuals, along with the earnings
lost because these women won't be there to provide new solutions.

WEDNESDAY MARKS THE END OF A CABLE TV REGULATION ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's been six years since the federal government
began, with considerable fanfare, deregulating cable television
rates. On Wednesday, the effort will come to a quiet end.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission will no longer control how
much cable companies charge for expanded basic cable packages. That
service, which typically includes local channels and such popular
add-ons as CNN and TNT, is the package that most cable TV
subscribers buy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the end of federal controls is near, the debate simmers
over how consumers will fare. It will be up to free-market
competition _ not regulators _ to price the popular tier of
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor the approach say the growth of satellite
television proves that consumers are getting a choice. By contrast,
government controls allowed cable rates nationally to go up 22
percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to let the government back off a little bit,'' said
Carol Rothwell, a vice president for Time Warner Cable in Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are those who say that little competition to
cable TV exists. Satellite television is an option, but equipment
costs and rules that bar satellites from offering local broadcast
stations have kept it from becoming a full-fledged competitor,
these critics say.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers
Union's Washington office, people will end up with two choices:
paying higher cable rates or dropping the service. To him, it's
appropriate that the first full day of deregulated rates is April
Fools' Day.
</P>
<P>
   If rates increase, most area consumers won't see them for a
while. The area's two largest cable systems _ Time Warner and Jones
Intercable _ say that their rates went up earlier this year for
various program packages and that it will be next year before they
can go up again.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increases earlier this year were permitted under the
price controls that cable companies have been operating under since
1993. Those rules were required by Congress when it passed
legislation to re-regulate the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation reversed federal laws of the early 1980s that
deregulated the cable industry. The intervention enjoyed wide
support amid complaints about rising cable TV prices as the number
of cable subscribers continued to soar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, 18 million households were cable TV customers. In 1993,
the number more than tripled to 59 million households, or nearly
two-thirds of homes with televisions. Last year, it reached 68
million households.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional initiative gave the FCC the responsibility to
control charges for the expanded-basic packages. Local governments
have a say in the charges for basic cable, equipment and
installation, and those responsibilities will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The brave new world of cable rates resulted from the
Republicans' taking control of Congress and in 1996 pushing
legislation to again deregulate the cable industry. The Clinton
administration signed on, and the changes became law.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry is approaching the new era carefully for fear
that prices will sharply escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies are very much aware that they need to act with
restraint,'' said Decker Anstrom, president of the National Cable
Television Association.
</P>
<P>
   But in the longer run, economics will have its say. The
three-year wait was designed to give the cable TV industry a chance
to develop competition to keep cable rates down.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that Martha Hogerty, Missouri's public counsel, has
heard before in other industries. Not long ago there was talk about
telephone companies offering cable TV, but not much came of it, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hype,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, satellite television is cable's competitor. Tom
Krewson, a spokesman for Jones Intercable in Independence, Mo.,
said that the majority of customers who decided to stop their cable
service with Jones said they were buying a satellite dish and that
more probably would do so if cable rates became too high.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television has grown in the past five years with a new
service called direct broadcast, which allows pizza-size receiving
dishes to capture satellite signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a viable competitor to cable,'' said Robert Mercer, a
spokesman for DirecTV, the largest provider of satellite
television. Last year DirecTV bought a competitor, United States
Satellite Broadcasting Co. Inc., and DirecTV is in the process of
buying another one, Primestar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But satellite customers have equipment costs that cable
subscribers don't have. These receivers originally cost as much as
$700, but they are now available for less than $200 and often come
with discounted installation fees. Additional equipment costs can
be imposed when more than one television is equipped to receive
satellite signals.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite television also doesn't deliver local stations. A
separate antenna has to pick them up. Congress is considering
legislation that would permit satellite television to carry local
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman, of Consumers Union, said that because of some of
those costs and obstacles, satellite television was a more suitable
option for the economic ``upper tier'' cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when satellite television or other providers offer the
vast majority of cable subscribers an alternative that meets their
needs will cable companies be forced to bring down prices,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Major leagues a major letdown for Parris
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The harsh and unfair realities of the business
side of baseball snarled at Steve Parris Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, the Cincinnati Reds decided they
didn't like Par(r)is in the spring-time.
</P>
<P>
   And this time it was undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after Parris held the world-champion New York
Yankees to no earned runs, two hits and struck out five in five
innings, he was handed the proverbial bus ticket to Indianapolis _
optioned to the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Parris wasn't facing a bunch of minor-leaguers, either, during
the Reds 4-2 victory in front of a standing-room only crowd of
7,517. Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez,
Jorge Posada, Shane Spencer, Chad Curtis and Scott Brosius waved
bats at Parris.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year-old right-hander was victimized by two factors:
The Reds are keeping only 10 pitchers and Parris has options left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I won a spot, thought I pitched well enough to win a
spot,'' Parris said. ``Apparently not. I can't say what I really
think _ it'll get me in trouble. But I'm very disappointed. Because
I have options. . .no doubt that's why I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   In six appearances this spring, Parris gave up only 10 earned
runs in 22.2 innings (3.97 earned run average), 26 hits, walked
only one until his six more Tuesday, and struck out 16.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, yes, Parris deserved the bus ride.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched twice for the Reds, giving up 11 hits and 10 earned
runs in only 1.1 innings, a 67.50 earned run average. Rather than
curse his misfortune, Parris lit 'em up in Indianapolis _ 6-1, 3.84
in 13 starts and was summoned back to Cincinnati, where he thought
he established squatter's rights.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last season, he was the most reliable starter _
5-2, 2.61 ERA in his last eight starts and that, alone, should have
placed him in this season's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Reds added Denny Neagle and Steve Avery, and they
need only four starters for nearly the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they needed to get me out of here now, because you
have to stay in the minors 10 days after you're optioned out, so if
they later need 11 pitchers they can get me back,'' Parris said.
``(General manager) Jim Bowden told me I would spend a lot time in
the big leagues this year. But I might not spend another day here
if they make another trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his start Tuesday against the Yankees, Parris said, ``It was
a rough one. I struggled. Six walks is terrible and my curve was
awful. . .and you can quote me. I'm not disappointed, though,
because I made pitches I had to make and got away basically
unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   He did give up two unearned runs in the fifth when a wind-blown
drive by Jeter to right bounced off Dmitri Young's glove. But a
home run by Mark Sweeney tied it, 2-2, in the fifth, and the Reds
scored twice in the sixth on a two-run single by catcher Eddie
Taubensee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parris threw pretty good,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``He
walked too many guys, but he pitched a strong five innings. All of
our guys pitched pitched well. As I've said, we get decent
pitching, we win. . .even if we make too many errors (three) and
give up too many walks (six).''
</P>
<P>
   John Hudek pitched a scoreless inning, Danny Graves put up two
scoreless innings, and 23-year-old rookie Scott Williamson closed
it out in the ninth for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Parris pitched well. Now he'll have to do it in
Indianapolis.

AN ARM IS WORTH MORE THAN A WIN
</HEADLINE>

(Resending for Austin American-Statesman) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kid was pitching a one-hitter in Chaminade
High School's season opener. It was the fifth inning, and he
appeared just as strong now as he did to start the game.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing would have been to let him finish the game. He
earned it, it was his game. Why shouldn't the sophomore close it
out, maybe have a nice memory to look back on?
</P>
<P>
   But a rule is a rule, and Jason Urquidez had reached his
team-imposed maximum pitch count. Even if Urquidez was throwing a
perfect game, it wouldn't have changed Eagles coach Scott Drootin's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to take him out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Urquidez was upset when Drootin came to the mound and
took the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   But Drootin didn't budge. He has a pitch count to protect his
pitchers, not stand in the way of their glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to the kid and hope he understands you're looking out
for his best interest,'' Drootin said. ``I told him he was pitching
a great game, but that it wasn't worth throwing any more pitches
and risking injury. Maybe later in the year, when he's stronger and
the weather is warmer, it would be different. But I've got to look
out for the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to know somebody was. Three years ago, when Chicago
Cubs phenom Kerry Wood was pitching for Grand Prairie High during
the Texas State Playoffs, that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Grand Prairie won the state championship, Wood
pitched all seven innings in the first game of a doubleheader and,
after a 30-minute break, pitched two innings of the second game.
More disturbing was Wood's pitch count _ a staggering 175.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Grand Prairie won the title and Wood proved he was
Superman, but at what cost? Less than four years later he's got an
elbow ligament so mangy it might take all of this year and next
until he's able to throw a ball again. Whether he regains that
97-mph fastball won't be know for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain if Wood's current troubles started in high
school, but the Cubs were disturbed enough with his nine-inning
performance that they practically shut him down after signing him.
The Cubs limited Wood to 71/3 innings of professional ball that
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how serious injuries occur,'' general manager Ed Lynch
said at the time of coach Mike McGilvray's decision. ``I'm sure
that, counting warm-ups, he threw over 300 pitches. It's beyond
belief that the coach would risk his future. That's very
short-termed thinking. We're very concerned with this.''
</P>
<P>
   McGilvray defends his use of Wood, even the 175-pitch marathon
in the playoffs. During 14 games that year, Wood pitched 72
innings, and rarely pitched more than five innings per start. In
addition, he pitched just one game per week and was regularly
monitored by a former college trainer.
</P>
<P>
   As far as McGilvray is concerned, the Cubs are making him a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to point to that one day,'' McGilvray said.
``But prior to that, we treated Kerry with kid gloves and took
every imaginable precaution. I can see if we used him like that on
a consistent basis, then we're talking about a problem. But it was
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but 175 pitches for a 17-year-old in one day is simply
too much. And is it a coincidence that that less than a year later
while pitching at Single-A Daytona, Wood went on the disabled list
with elbow soreness?
</P>
<P>
   RISKY DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   What would you do if you desperately needed to win one game, but
your best pitcher wasn't 100 percent or was showing signs of
fatigue?
</P>
<P>
   For Scott Muckey, it's a simple question with an equally
uncomplicated answer. ``There isn't a championship out there worth
a kid's arm,'' said Muckey, Crespi High's veteran coach.
</P>
<P>
   What if you had a once-in-a-lifetime talent like Wood, so
dominant it seemed unfair when he faced high school batters.
Wouldn't you want to use him as much as possible, as much as the
rules allowed?
</P>
<P>
   Not if it meant even remotely jeopardizing Wood's future,
according to Muckey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the kid has a chance to make a lot of money, I'm not going
to stand in the way of that,'' Muckey said.
</P>
<P>
   For Muckey, and other area coaches, the thought of letting one
pitcher throw a complete game, then two innings of another on the
same day is so outrageous, it's not even worth considering. They
understand a high school coach is burdened with two priorities, and
how important it is to keep them in the proper order. The first is
to develop and protect players. The second is to win games.
</P>
<P>
   For pitchers, coaches use safeguards such as pitch counts,
studying mechanics to easier determine fatigue levels, bullpen work
on off-days and conditioning. They also get to know their players,
because each pitcher is different, each arm unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys bounce back quicker than others, and guys have
different pain thresholds,'' Muckey said. ``As a coach, you need to
know that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At Chatsworth, Tom Meusborn has a simple rule: If a pitcher is
hurt, tired or just sore, he doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get talked out of many things,'' Meusborn said. ``And
in this case, it's pretty clear how I feel. Look, we appreciate
your competitiveness and it's great that you want to play. But we
also want to look out for you and always remember the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   California high schools operate under the 10-inning maximum
rule, which means individual pitchers can't throw more than 10
innings per week. When Wood pitched in both games in 1995, he was
still one-inning short of Texas' high school limit for one day. So,
technically, McGilvray was within the rules. But to allow a pitcher
to throw that many pitches on the same day is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't think of doing that,'' Muckey said. ``You
need to be careful, and we as coaches need to know better than to
do that. I've always said that, when in doubt, less is always
better.''

MAJOR Y2K GLITCHES MAY OCCUR THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Forget about year 2000 computer problems causing
havoc at your New Year's Eve party or disrupting bowl games on Jan.
1, 2000. The biggest Y2K glitches may come this year around the
Fourth of July and Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
   Although many computer problems are likely to occur on or after
Jan. 1, about 25 percent of all year 2000 computer problems will
occur before the new year, said Lou Marcoccio, one of the leading
researchers studying Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked all the time, `If I get up at 4 a.m. on Jan. 1, am
I going to see the lights going out for miles?' '' Marcoccio said.
``The failures are not going to happen at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, problems that occur this year _ including a few
possibly on Thursday _ have the greatest likelihood of disrupting
business.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of U.S. corporations and 46 states have fiscal
years that begin July 1. Marcoccio believes that will spark Y2K
problems that could disrupt key functions like payroll, billing and
inventory control.
</P>
<P>
   ``In July, the volume (of Y2K failures) is going to go up
dramatically, and in October it's going to go up even more,'' said
Marcoccio, research director for GartnerGroup, a Connecticut-based
research firm that has nine researchers studying the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, the federal government begins its fiscal year _ as do
another third of American corporations. In addition, three-month
computer forecasting programs will kick in, causing computers that
haven't been reprogrammed to get sidetracked while trying to make
sense of a new calendar year ending in ``00.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccio believes American companies are planning for problems
and shortages on Jan. 1 but haven't taken their planning to the
next step.
</P>
<P>
   He said about 5 percent of Y2K problems occurred before Jan. 1,
1999, 25 percent will occur this year, 55 percent will occur
throughout 2000, and 15 percent will crop up during 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 8 to 10 percent will be occurring within a two-week
period of Jan. 1, 2000,'' Marcoccio said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with four other Y2K specialists found that
in-the-trenches programmers are as concerned about the last six
months of the year as they are about Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts are watching more than 30 ``trigger dates'' but
several already have passed with few, or no, problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``1-1-99 was always a wild card,'' said Roleigh Martin, a
Minnesota consulting software engineer and Y2K author who has
listed 31 potential trigger dates.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems occurred as companies, government agencies and
schools made projections for the coming 12 months, ``but the word
on the programming street was that it was containable,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Jan. 1, the focus shifted to Feb. 5, the day when travel
agents could begin selling airline tickets for Jan. 1, 2000. But
the nation's complex airline, hotel and cruise line reservation
system made the shift without a glitch.
</P>
<P>
   But experts aren't particularly encouraged that trigger dates
have caused few severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather seen a strong wakeup call on 1-1-99, so
that it would be an alert for Y2K, instead of being lulled into
thinking that nothing is going to happen,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts now are watching for some problems on Thursday, when
both the state of New York and Canada begin their fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   New York has repaired six key computer systems that could have
been affected by the fiscal year changeover, said Gary Davis, a
spokesman for the New York State Office for Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Davis expects the day to pass without incident. ``We're most
focused on the end-of-year date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another trigger date occurs on April 9, but experts believe the
rumors and speculation are far worse than the potential reality.
</P>
<P>
   April 9 is the 99th day of the year, and older computer programs
that ignore the month and only look at the number of days in the
year will read that as 1999-99.
</P>
<P>
   In some computer programs, especially older programs, a string
of nines is a signal for the computer to stop processing
information _ or even purge data.
</P>
<P>
   Another trigger date being discounted by experts is Sept. 9 _
``9-9-99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sept. 9 has become urban legend,'' said Jim Lord, a Maryland
software consultant and author of ``A Survival Guide for the Year
2000 Problem.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because computers look for six numbers in the date field, Lord
said, they will read that date as 09-09-99, not as a string of
nines.
</P>
<P>
   But some trigger dates could cause problems:
</P>
<P>
   The first of every month for the rest of the year, as corporate
fiscal years begin.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1, as schools and colleges deal with records for classes
that will be completed in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 31, 1999, which may have been used by programmers to
terminate programs or clear out data files.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also will be watching for problems throughout the last
quarter of 1999, particularly in December, as software companies
are forced to release Y2K-compliant software upgrades that haven't
been properly tested or debugged.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe many companies already have experienced year
2000 problems, but most of those have been minor and haven't
generated any notoriety outside information technology departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's going on in computer rooms around the
country,'' said Lane Core Jr., a Pennsylvania computer programmer
who writes about the Y2K problem. ``The last thing corporations
want anyone to know is that they're having Y2K problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Information Technology Association of America reported that
about half of American corporations had experienced some kind of
Y2K problem by March 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond Jan. 1, researchers are focusing on one date in
particular _ Feb. 29, 2000, leap day.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that haven't been programmed to recognize the extra
day in February are likely to lock up, or refuse to process data
that day.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord said leap year 2000 isn't worth worrying about.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time,'' he said, ``we are either likely to realize Y2K
is not a serious problem, or be so jaundiced to all these systems
failing it doesn't matter.''

DON JOHNSON'S SAN FRANCISCO SINECURE
</HEADLINE>

 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Don Johnson &LR; 's coasting along in ``Nash Bridges,'' wrote  &UR; Paul &LR; 
 &UR; Brownfield &LR;  in a profile in Sunday's Los Angeles Times, but his
acting career's in a ``peculiar state of limbo.'' Never mind: He's
engaged, he's employed, he's edgy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson on Johnson's work: ``There aren't any of those
(expletive) actors that are better than me. None of them. Nobody.
Not De Niro, not Brando, not Jack, not anybody. I have the goods.
They have the material.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson on Johnson's drinking rehabs: ``Life's too short not
to enjoy a good bottle of wine. ... One of the definitions of
alcoholism is, does it make your life unmanageable. ... For me, and
only for me, I have found a place that I'm comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson on Johnson's fiancee, Kelley Phleger: ``That woman
doesn't care about anything else in the world except me. And her
love for me and my love for her and our babies. My babies, with any
of my other relationships. She's an angel woman.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnson on Johnson's admirers: ``You walk out there on that
street right now, go up to two people, ask them what they feel
about Don Johnson. You got a 50-50 chance of someone saying, `Who?'
and the other person saying, `He's a god.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONNIE CHUNG LENDS HIM HER EAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A ``very special moment'' on the A &LR; pril 1 &LR;  installment of
``Maury'' is described in an advance press release:
</P>
<P>
   Host Maury Povich's guest is Adam, a 13-year-old dyslexic boy
who says he has no friends. ``The only thing Adam's confident about
is playing the piano, and his one lifelong dream has been to play
the piano for  &UR; Connie Chung &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Through the magic of television and the miracle of
marriage, ``Adam gets the surprise of his life when Maury walks
Connie into the studio.'' Much puddling up is forecast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Chris Jehle  &LR; and his partner were having dinner at Spago in
West Hollywood over the weekend when the maitre d' stopped by their
table to ask how everything was. They reported that the food was
excellent but the waiter had too much attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later the waiter stopped by to offer his apology:
``I'm sorry if you think I'm cold and aloof, but I'm in the midst
of an apartment search.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Raquel Welch &LR; , who said she was an expert because she'd been
taking them for years, testified last week about the regulation of
nutritional supplements to a House subcommittee on government
reform.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sir  &UR; Nigel Hawthorne &LR; , a British actor, revealed to the Mirror
last week that when he was knighted by  &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR; , she
thought he was the character he had played _ Sir Humphrey Appleby,
a civil servant _ in a British TV series that had a long run in the
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   The actor said that when the queen encountered him at theatrical
events after that, she would ask him what he was doing there. ``And
I'd say, `I work here,' and she'd say `You do? ''
</P>
<P>
   _ An inventive form of computer spam: A ``personal'' letter
addressed to a person who is not the e-mail recipient (it seems to
have gotten into the mailbox by mistake) thanking the fictitious
recipient for ``turning me on'' to an online auction site. ``You
were right,'' says the letter, after giving the address, ``they do
have incredible deals on some pretty amazing products.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, obviously touting the site, goes on to conclude,
``Hope everything is well with you and the kids. Come over for
dinner with the family again some time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At the Safeway on Taraval Street in San Francisco,  &UR; Byron &LR; 
 &UR; Thurber  &LR; noticed the impish positioning of a Teletubbies display
next to condoms. And Swanson is celebrating the 45th anniversary of
the TV dinner by selling limited-edition packages that use the
product's original design, with aluminum tray and TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``There I stood, my four legs planted firmly on the floor, tail
a-swish, understanding that the entire history of 20th century art
has been dreamlike, and that you humans have been given a hundred
years of art whose meaning can be interpreted but never known for
sure. Then, I defecated. In the horse world, this can be quite a
compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Martin in ``Toby Looks at Art,'' a short story that
appears in April's ARTnews, in which Toby, the talking horse,
analyzes art.

 &HT;    Same story, different teams
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ We have seen this story before, as
recently as two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coach brings his team to the Final Four. Coach has reputation
that he can't win the big one. Coach wins game anyway and expunges
the tag he didn't deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it was Lute Olson and Arizona. The Men of Cactus
had a long history of losing when they should and losing when they
shouldn't in the NCAA Tournament, the common thread being the
losing.
</P>
<P>
   But one magical March night in Indianapolis, Arizona beat
Kentucky in overtime, and Olson's career was notarized.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night in Tropicana Field, the dome with the Leaning Tower
of Florida roof, Jim Calhoun rewrote Olson's story almost word for
word. Calhoun's Connecticut Huskies took down favored Duke for
college basketball's national championship and removed the shroud
that had been fastened to his resume (12 NCAA appearances, 12
exits).
</P>
<P>
   The two coaches have more in common than just winning national
titles after repeated failures.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's father died when he was 5; Calhoun's when he was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Both were college basketball stars in obscure places _ Olson at
Augsburg College in Minneapolis; Calhoun at American International
College in Springfield, Mass. Both traveled the high school
coaching trail before finding a hole and crawling into the college
game, Olson at Long Beach (Calif.) City College; Calhoun at
Northeastern in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, although players win games, Calhoun
outcoached Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, the man considered college
basketball's best.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut was able to both double-team Duke's inside hulk,
Elton Brand, and also defend the three-point arc. In general, a
team can do one or the other but not both. That Coach K hasn't yet
taught Brand to pass figured prominently.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Krzyzewski was a victim of his allegiance to his
favorite player, Trajan Langdon. ``Absolutely, positively, we were
going to win or lose with Trajan,'' Coach K said.
</P>
<P>
   But that strategy ignored Langdon's single weakness _ quickness.
Langdon is a great college player, but he's not going to beat a
good, quick defender one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Duke had been in so few close games _ its average margin
of victory was 26 _ that it had almost no experience in tight,
end-game situations.
</P>
<P>
   So down one point, 75-74, inside 20 seconds, Coach K went to his
leader, Langdon, for better or worse. The problem is that didn't
take into account that UConn's Ricky Moore is one of the nation's
best defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon dribbled to the left of the key, but Moore cut him off.
Langdon then turned his back to the basket and tried a spin move
into the lane, but picked up the ball too quickly and traveled as
he spun.
</P>
<P>
   With one more chance, down 77-74, Duke repeated the same
mistake. With 5.2 seconds left, the ball was inbounded in the deep
backcourt, again to Langdon, again with Moore harassing him.
</P>
<P>
   The only ways to get the ball upcourt in 5.2 seconds are with a
long pass or with a quick guard who can't be cut off. Langdon was
cut off twice by Moore, forced to change directions and he
eventually lost the ball just after coming across centercourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no better coach than I was three weeks ago and no worse,''
Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   No, but like Olson in 1997, he's a lighter one. The rap of not
being able to win the big one has been left in the hot sun of
Florida, never to be seen or heard again.

MONTENEGRO APPEALS FOR HUMANITARIAN AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ As NATO warplanes roared overhead in an
intensified bombing campaign against the regime of Slobodan
Milosevic, the republic of Montenegro appealed Tuesday night for
humanitarian aid to cope with the masses of refugees flooding
across its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Help is needed to feed, shelter, and provide emergency medical
care for the ethnic Albanian refugees pouring in from the
neighboring province of Kosovo, said officials here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is getting so much worse it is now impossible to
care for the huge numbers of innocent people,'' said Health
Minister Miomir Mugosa, as air-raid sirens blasted and the
occasional crack of anti-aircraft fire reverberated from nearby
mountains. ``We cannot especially cope with even those who have
come to us in just the past 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugosa implored the American Red Cross to provide ``urgently and
desperately needed'' aid, an explicit request and a signal that
Montenegro regards the Serb-dominated regime in Belgrade, not
American warplanes, as the real villain in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of refugees surging into Montenegero seemed
to confirm reports that the neighboring nation of Macedonia to the
south was closing its borders to desperate Albanians seeking to
flee the killing grounds of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rampaging Serb paramilitary forces have uprooted tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanians and killed numbers of them in a
brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing that NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
described as ``a modern-day great terror,'' according to refugee
accounts and scattered reports from inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Podgorica and Western diplomats said Tuesday that
the greatest numbers of refugees are now apparently heading to
Montenegro, not Macedonia or their ancestral homeland of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible change,'' Mugosa said, ``and if the world
will not come to the rescue of the victims we are trying to help,
the suffering will be even more terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some international relief agencies appeared to be responding
Tuesday to the human disaster spiraling out of control in the
Balkans. Most aid workers fled Yugoslavia at the outset of
hostilities on March 24, but Tuesday a small column of vehicles
from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees made its way Tuesday
into the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Yugoslavia is going from bad to disastrous,''
said Jann DeKerk, a Dutch aid worker in a convoy of relief
vechicles that crossed at dawn into the embattled country at a
remote mountain pass from Croatia. ``In a sense, we are hoping to
do the same thing the military from the US and Europe is hoping to
do _ save Albanians from the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it may be the world is again too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling along on foot or carried by horse-drawn cart, dazed
refugees from Kosovo were crossing into Montenegro at an estimated
rate of about 1,000 per hour, a stunning influx for a tiny province
with a population of only about 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro officals fear that the arrival of so many ethnic
Albanians will trigger violence in a region that thus far has been
spared the murderous furies that have made the Balkans a byword for
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees entering the province have generally been treated
kindly by local officials and guarded by police. But tensions have
been exacerbated by NATO airstrikes against military facilities in
Montenegro, and by increasing numbers of people starting to despise
the US and Western Europe as a common enemy _ and blaming Kosovo
Albanians for bringing on the attacks.

NEW HAMPSHIRE HOUSE REJECTS INCOME TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire's House of Representatives, facing
a Thursday deadline to come up with a plan to fund public schools
more equitably, rejected a bill Tuesday to impose the state's first
income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The 211-to-168 vote all but ensures that the state will not meet
the April 1 deadline imposed by the state Supreme Court 15 months
ago when it ruled that the current system of paying for public
education mainly through local property taxes is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   With defeat of the income tax measure in the House, where
Republicans hold the majority, the Democrat-controlled Senate will
now try to fashion a compromise that may include business taxes, an
increase in the cigarette tax, and an expansion of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Any plan will either have to win the approval of Governor Jeanne
Shaheen, or muster enough support in the Legislature to sustain the
two-thirds majority needed to override a Shaheen veto. In both her
campaigns for governor, Shaheen took New Hampshire's traditional
pledge to veto any broad-based tax, and during the current crisis
she has repeatedly said she would reject any income tax proposal.
But Shaheen also has been under intense pressure from longtime
supporters who consider an income tax the fairest way to reform a
system that has led to some of the highest property tax rates in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Representative Elizabeth Hager, a prime sponsor of
the income tax bill, which would have established a 3.5 percent
levy, said Shaheen deserves 90 percent of the blame for Tuesday's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The votes we are losing are people who all say that they know
this is the best solution but they don't want to delay things, or
they'll say, `I don't want to embarass the governor.' And those are
Republicans saying that,'' Hager said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's proponents tried to persuade legislators to vote for
it despite the governor's opposition. Tuesday, subdued lawmakers
slowly took their places before the vote to hear Representative
Jean Wallin, an income tax supporter, say, ``Today, we do the
political equivalent of a root canal.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wall Street bond rating services watching and the
collection of the school portion of local property taxes due to
become illegal Thursday, a plan based on one proposed by Shaheen
has been evolving, but is not yet on paper.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said to contain increased taxes on business,
legalization of video slot machines, increased cigarette taxes, a
capital gains tax, and an unspecified entertainment tax. Despite
Tuesday's vote, all options, including an income tax, remain at
least remote possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the House narrowly passed a version of the
income tax bill. The Senate then modified it and returned it to the
House. This time, however, Shaheen joined Republican House Speaker
Donna Sytek to help kill a measure that would have ended what many
call ``the New Hampshire advantage.''

   KUKES, Albania _ In the darkness, the little villages in the
rolling hills and river valleys around the northwestern Kosovo city
of Dakovica emptied out Tuesday morning, with the residents rushing
_ literally for their lives _ to beat the 5 a.m. deadline set by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Serbian forces methodically went from village to
village in what is called the Has district, the refugees said. The
troops told the villagers that they had to leave or they would be
killed in the morning, and so the villagers fled toward Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They joined the 60,000 ethnic Albanians who came the day before
and who had apparently been forced to flee from another area of
Kosovo, to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Halilaj, 27, came to the border today. ``They came
yesterday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,'' he said. ``They said if
we were still there at 5 o'clock in the morning, `We will kill
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so in Damjan, and the other villages, ethnic Albanians
packed what they could _ wooden baby cradles elaborately painted in
folk patterns were common _ and climbed into carts pulled by farm
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., about 10,800 had crossed the border and officials
estimated they were coming at the rate of 2,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the long columns of tractors, a very few cars and people on
foot came across the border, the only difference in their accounts
was the time the Serbs arrived. They were told to leave, they were
robbed, their identity documents were taken away and they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came at 10 o'clock in the morning,'' said Gezim Sela of
the village of Gershin. ``They said if somebody was found in the
village after 5 o'clock in the morning, they would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the accounts were virtually identical, pointing to
the methodical, well-organized nature of what appears to be a
government campaign to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, who
make up 90 percent of the population. The refugees fear the troops'
past record of atrocities. There was no question in the villagers'
minds that they had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 10 tanks and 5 military minibuses,'' said Ymer
Pnishi, 65, from Damjan, driving one of the tractors in a long
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers told us to leave the village by 5 o'clock,'' he
said. ``We have nothing with us, no bread, no water. Nobody was
killed, but they burned the village. They looted the homes and took
everything of worth, and after, they burned the village.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo thus far have
been attributed to special Interior Ministry policemen or
paramilitaries or to the private armies of ultra-nationalists like
Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan. But some refugees today
said they thought that some of the warnings were delivered by
soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army. This could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   While the warnings alone were enough to set off the exodus of
villagers, refugees also gave accounts of killings and other
atrocities in the last few days, giving weight to their fears.
While these also could not be independently confirmed, there
appeared to be a pattern of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed my 10 brothers, and I am alone,'' wailed Naxhije
Zymi, 55, as a group of refugees rested by the side of the road
leading from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Her account of a mass killing in the village of Krushe Evogel on
Friday conformed with other accounts given by refugees and with
accounts that the observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe here have also heard from refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday the police came early in the morning _ they executed
almost 100 people,'' Ms. Zymi said, mimicking the spraying of an
automatic rifle. ``They killed them all _ men, women and children.
They set a fire and threw the bodies in the fire and put car tires
on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Halilaj, a university graduate in economics, said three of his
cousins, all with the family name of Osmani, had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he said, as the NATO bombing was beginning,
a group of six Serbian men wearing ski masks over their faces
entered one neighborhood in the city of Dakovica and burned down
about 50 Albanian-owned shops and 35 houses.
</P>
<P>
   They separated the men from the women and children and killed 11
men, he continued, leaving their bodies in the street in the
morning for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city was very scared,'' he said, and added that more than
10,000 people in the city of roughly 60,000 had fled southward, but
he said that most of them are trapped on the road near the village
of Raqa, about a mile away from Dakovica, surrounded by Serbian
forces and unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Under gray, chilly skies at the border post, 64-year-old Dull
Gunxi lay on a tractor cart, wrapped in a blanket, his face a mask
of cuts and crusted blood from a tank shell that hit his home in
Damjan on Sunday. His wife and children had similar wounds.
</P>
<P>
   They fled to the home of friends in the nearby village of
Tepnish seeking safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Tepnish, Monday's order to leave came at 4 in the afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Priceline.Com, the Web site that hired Star Trek's
William Shatner as its pitchman, saw its stock price fly off to a
distant galaxy in its first day of trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's shares jumped from an offering price of $16 a share
on the Nasdaq market to a high of $85 before setting at $69, a more
than fourfold increase. That gives Priceline, which lets consumers
bid on airline tickets, cars and other items, a market value of
$9.8 billion, the highest first-day value ever achieved by an
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline, which lost $114 million last year selling $35 million
worth of airline tickets, is now worth more than United Airlines,
Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines combined. That value is
all the more astounding because Priceline has only been in business
for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, from
doubling the proposed price, to give the company a value of $2.3
billion in the offering of 10 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has accorded Jay Walker, Priceline's founder,
paper wealth of $4.3 billion. Walker's previous claim to fame was
that he started Newsub services, which sells magazine subscriptions
in credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   The offering comes amid a buying frenzy in the shares of nearly
any company involved in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what these companies do or how they are
priced,'' said David Simons, who runs Digital Video Investments, an
advisory service. ``Each new Internet IPO is nothing more than red
meat to the mad dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number of analysts praised the company for its unique
sales method. Priceline calls itself a ``demand collection system''
in which customers name the price they want to pay for a trip to a
certain city, for a certain model car and so on. If Priceline can
find someone willing to sell what the customer wants at the
specified price, the customer is committed to buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Priceline's business model,'' said Peony Kao, an
analyst with Renaissance Capital, which runs a mutual fund that
invests in initial public offerings. ``It can be expanded from
airline tickets to loans, cars and a lot of other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kao said she was impressed with Priceline's growth, with
revenues expected to increase fivefold this year to $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a lot of potential,'' she said, ``but whether
it's worth $10 billion remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Internet companies, Priceline has spent far more on
building its systems and marketing than it has generated in
revenue. But the nature of its business adds a number of unusual
risks.
</P>
<P>
   It's biggest constraint has been the unwillingness of most major
airlines to undercut their existing prices by selling through
Priceline. Priceline had tried to make the restrictions for buying
tickets so onerous that it would not attract any high-margin
business travelers. For example, buyers have to be willing to fly
at any time on the travel day they specify, on any airline, and to
accept at least one change of planes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, only TWA and America West sold tickets through the
service at first. Last fall, Northwest and Delta agreed to
participate. But in order to induce Delta to join, Priceline
granted it warrants to buy 18.9 million shares of the company's
stock, a stake worth $1.3 billion on Tuesday, or 13 percent of
Delta's $10 billion market value.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the addition of these airlines, Priceline was only
able to sell about 25 percent of what it termed ``reasonable
bids,'' which it defines as those no more than 30 percent less than
the lowest fare for a particular route. And to satisfy even that
many customers, the company has had to sell many of its tickets for
prices below what it pays the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make up some of those losses selling credit
cards and other products to people while they are bidding. The
company's prospectus indicates that even these moves may not be
enough to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unlikely to make significant profits unless we make new
or complementary products and services and a broader range of
existing products and services available through the Priceline
service,'' the company wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other people have found near instant paper wealth as
a result of the Priceline offering.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Braddock, the former president of Citicorp, who became
Priceline's chief executive last August, now owns shares worth $980
million.
</P>
<P>
   General Atlantic Partners, a venture capital firm in Greenwich,
Conn., saw its $28 million investment turn into a stake worth $1.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Nicholas Jr., the former co-cheif executive of
Time-Warner, owns stock worth $264 million.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday that he was increasingly jeopardizing
his claim to keep Kosovo as a province of Yugoslavia with his
assault on the ethnic Albanian population there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that atrocities by Serbian forces in Kosovo would
put at risk international support for a plan that would keep Kosovo
an autonomous part of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president said, ``He will see that his military will be
seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the
prospect for international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo
increasingly jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to pursue air attacks against Serbian targets in
Yugoslavia until Milosevic ceases the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions,'' Clinton
said at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the culmination of more than a decade of using ethnic
and religious hatred as a justification for uprooting and murdering
completely innocent peaceful civilians to pave Mr. Milosevic's path
to absolute power,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a later statement, the president firmly rejected a proposal
from Milosevic to withdraw some of his forces from Kosovo in
exchange for a halt in allied bombing. Clinton called the offer
``unacceptable'' and said peace would come only when Milosevic
ended what the United States says is a campaign of terror in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of a peace agreement signed this month at
Rambouillet, France, by Kosovar Albanians but not by Milosevic,
Kosovo would gain autonomy for three years from the central
Yugoslav government in Belgrade. NATO forces would guarantee the
agreement. After that, the two sides would negotiate Kosovo's
long-term status.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and European nations who oversaw the peace
talks have consistently opposed immediate independence for Kosovo,
a province whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Western
leaders have said they do not want to see the further dismemberment
of the remnants of Yugoslavia into a collection of small ethnic
states with limited economic prospects and no history of
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said previously that the only way to
guarantee that Kosovo remained part of Yugoslavia was for Milosevic
to accept the autonomy arrangement that was being negotiated at
Rambouillet. The alternative, officials have said, is continuing
insurgency by Albanian separatists and intervention by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton suggested publicly for the first time since the
allied bombing began last week that the Western position was
shifting toward independence for Kosovo under some sort of
international protection.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that Clinton did
not intend to announce a new policy Tuesday. Rather, Lockhart said,
the president was describing a change in world opinion as Serbian
fighting spreads through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our policy that Kosovo should be independent,''
Lockhart said. ``But Milosevic's continuing on a campaign of
atrocities had radicalized the people to such an extent that he
forfeits any claim to it and loses international support for Kosovo
remaining part of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a Balkan specialist at the Brookings Institution
who formerly served on the National Security Council, said that
Clinton was making an implicit promise to protect ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo from Serbian atrocities. The only realistic way to
accomplish that, Daalder said, is by creating an enclave in Kosovo
protected by NATO and American forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a widening of the war aims, but bringing the war aims
to their logical conclusion,'' Daalder said. ``The only way we can
fulfill our political objectives is by giving the Kosovars a
territory of their own. My only regret is that we should have made
this an explicit claim from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also said Tuesday that the American and NATO air
attacks would continue until Milosevic's ability to carry out his
campaign of repression was ``seriously diminished'' and critical
parts of his military machinery were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allies are united in our outrage over President
Milosevic's atrocities against innocent people,'' Clinton said
Tuesday. ``We are determined to stay with our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the Serbian offensive was planned before the
NATO air strikes began a week ago. He accused Milosevic of
pretending to negotiate with Kosovar Albanians and European leaders
this winter even as he moved ``from village to village and atrocity
to atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is clear that as the Kosovar leaders were saying yes to
peace,'' Clinton said, ``Mr. Milosevic was planning a new campaign
of expulsions and executions in Kosovo. He started carrying out
that plan as the talks ended, increasing our sense of urgency that
the air strikes NATO had threatened for some time must begin.''

RULING IN SALVI ATTACKS IS CALLED POSITIVE FOR CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART AND PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury verdict this week absolving a landlord of liability in
the December 1994 attack on two Brookline abortion clinics sends a
powerful message that clinics _ and the property owners who rent to
them _ are not responsible for the unpredictable acts of
``terrorists,'' providers and advocates said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinics are prepared for levels of violence, but can you say
that such an act is foreseeable?'' said Vicki Saporta, executive
director of the National Abortion Federation in Washington, D.C,
which has more than 350 members. ``Clinics should not be held
liable for the actions of terrorists, which by their nature are
unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a swift verdict, a Norfolk, Mass., Superior Court jury on
Monday absolved the owners of a Brookline building of
responsibility for gunman John Salvi's attack on abortion clinic
security guard Richard J. Seron of Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for slightly more than two hours, including
the lunch hour, before ruling that 1842 Beacon Street Associates
was not negligent for failing to ensure that Preterm Health
Services, where Seron worked, had a uniformed police officer on
duty at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at the clinics in December 1994 was a violent
tragedy,'' said Ellen Zucker, a Boston lawyer and president of the
local chapter of the National Organization for Women at the time of
the shootings. ``The question is who should bear the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Seron, 49, the security guard who was wounded by a .22-caliber
bullet fired by Salvi on Dec. 30, 1994, claimed in a lawsuit that
the landlord should have enforced a condition of its lease with
Preterm requiring the clinic to hire a uniformed police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Walton, a second security guard on duty that day who was
not wounded, settled with the landlord for an undisclosed amount
before the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Seron nor his lawyer, Michael J. Heineman, returned
telephone calls Tuesday seeking comment. But in an interview with
The Patriot Ledger, Seron said the landlord tried to settle out of
court for $200,000, but Seron wanted $350,000. Seron said his
numerous media interviews, as well as a proposed book and
screenplay and his prison correspondence with Salvi, turned the
jury against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have been cheated and I am bitter about it,''
said Seron, adding that he has not been able to work since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Franchek, the attorney who represented 1842 Beacon
Street Associates, declined to comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the rampage, Seron was guarding the second clinic
Salvi invaded that day. Earlier, Salvi had gone into the Planned
Parenthood Clinic, also on Beacon Street, and killed receptionist
Shannon Lowney. He then drove to Preterm and killed receptionist
Leanne Nichols. He also wounded five people, including Seron. Seron
fired at Salvi but missed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits that target clinics and their landlords are a new, and
distasteful, phenomenon, said advocates. But Saporta and a lawyer
for the federation said they were unaware of suits like Seron's,
where juries were asked to decide whether clinics or their
landlords are liable for violence by a third party.

NEW MAP PINPOINTS TEXAS COASTAL BIRDING TRAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CINDY HORSWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ A colony of 500 white pelicans forms a
flotilla, bobbing gently on the waves that lap the shore of the
Bolivar mud flats, a thin strip of land on Texas' Gulf coast.
</P>
<P>
   When hungry, some move into a line and herd their prey by
beating the water with their 8-foot wings. The birds then use their
pouches, which can hold up to 12 quarts of water, to scoop up the
corralled fish.
</P>
<P>
   Great blue herons stand motionless nearby on tall, stiltlike
legs, watching. Timid spoonbills with their rosy-pink plumage wade
into the salty water away from the crowd. Piping plovers _ small,
brownish birds listed as a threatened species _ skitter across the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 10,000 birds, representing 50 species, congregate on this
tranquil 500-acre Galveston Bay marsh. It's the Houston Audubon
Society's Shorebird Sanctuary, annually attracting visitors from 17
countries and every state.
</P>
<P>
   It also is one of the 125 sites listed on a new map showing
where to ``bird watch'' in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   The map, which covers the upper coast from Texas Point National
Wildlife Refuge near Beaumont, to the San Bernard National Wildlife
Refuge near Brazoria, is part of the Great Texas Birding Trail
being developed along the state's 500-mile coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Though some might think nature would be lost amid Houston's
petrochemical complexes and smoke stacks, the opposite is true,
said David Dauphin of Baytown, president of the Texas
Ornithological Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 450 different bird species have been found on the
upper coast. Only two of the 50 states can claim that statewide.
One is Texas, which has recorded the most of any state, or 600
species, and the other is California,'' said Dauphin, co-host of an
educational TV series, ``On the Birding Trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a birding trail was conceived in 1995 when the U.S.
Department of Transportation gave Texas a $2.5 million grant to
develop its natural resources, said Madge Lindsay with Texas Parks
&AMP; Wildlife Department. The first of three maps for the trail, which
will run the length of the Texas coast, was released in 1997 and
covered only the state's central section.
</P>
<P>
   The second map _ for the upper coast _ should be available from
Houston-area chambers of commerce, tourist bureaus and the Texas
Department of Transportation in April, Lindsay said. The third map,
covering the lower coast, is expected to be finished by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   While the Houston-area birding trail snakes along the coast, it
also includes 15 loops that meander deeper into the countryside to
spotlight unique scenery or special hideaways, said consultant Ted
Eubanks of Austin, who has visited each site and helped design the
map.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have arranged the sites so that there's never more than an
hour's drive between each one. That should make it easy for
travelers to see quite a few sites in one day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-and-white signs that picture a tern winging past the sun
are posted at each location on the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites aren't only designed for the avid birders, but for
anybody who enjoys the outdoors and wants an excuse to enjoy
wildlife. There are 70 million people like that,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages those following the trail to contact area chambers
of commerce to learn of historical sites or other points of
interest to visit while following the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks particularly enjoyed visiting the 19 sites on the ``Big
Thicket Loop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about seeing the Big Thicket, but not many people
know how to do it. It's more extensive than the natural preserve,''
he said. ``This loop goes from the Louisiana border, north along
the Sabine River to Toledo Bend and then wanders through the piney
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the birds, Eubanks also was impressed by wild
azalea thickets, long-leaf pines, cypress swamps and private
hideaways not usually seen by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the really remarkable sites in Newton County is owned
by a large timber company who maintains it as a wilderness park.
It's a canyon with rocky cliffs filled with wild azaleas. It's
other-worldly,'' he said. ``Another place is Boykin Springs north
of Jasper. It's a natural spring that creeps from a swampy lake.
It's part of a national forest that has sphagnum moss and
carnivorous pitcher plants that eat insects.''
</P>
<P>
   The map gives directions to the 125 sites, notes the best
seasons for viewing and lists special birds that might be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the birding destinations, one that might be the most
surprising is the loop centered on downtown Houston, Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that John Audubon, the naturalist famed for painting
North American birds, made a trip to Houston soon after the city
was founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Audubon wasn't that impressed with the `mud hole,' he
reported seeing more ivory-billed woodpeckers here than he ever did
the rest of his life. He also wrote in his diary about the wonders
of wildlife along Buffalo Bayou,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Birding is still possible in Houston's urban setting, Eubanks
insists.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, birds can become so disoriented amid the
skyscrapers during spring migrations that they cluster in pocket
parks around the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Buffalo Bayou Loop'' is designed for visitors who want to
stay within walking distance or a short drive of downtown Houston
and the Texas Medical Center, about five miles from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks and other experts agree that the single most spectacular
birding destinations on the upper coast are the High Island
sanctuaries on the ``Bolivar Loop'' during spring migration.
Beginning in mid-March, thousands of rainbow-colored songbirds
vacate their winter homes in Mexico and Central and South America
to travel to their summer homes in the northern U.S. states and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``These birds must have traveled 850 miles across the Gulf of
Mexico. Then they start looking for a resting place. They end up
funneling through High Island because it sits atop a salt dome, a
tiny pimple of ground with a forest of live oak trees. That's
because 40 miles in either direction is nothing but a flat,
treeless marsh,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these birds have flown through storms and stiff winds
and are so exhausted when they arrive that they may literally fall
out of the sky and land wherever they can.
</P>
<P>
   For the thousands of tourists who descend on High Island during
migration, bleachers have been installed at the end of boardwalks
for observing the birds, especially during the peak of the season,
April 19-23, Dauphin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to start birding is a field guide for bird
identification and some binoculars. It's easy and can be done in
conjunction with other outdoor activities,'' Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Burkett, the Houston Audubon Society's sanctuary manager,
said the birding trail also should lead to an appreciation for the
area's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing habitat all the time with the destruction of the
rain forests in the tropics. We've seen some bird populations drop
by 50 percent in the last 20 years,'' Burkett said. ``That's why
it's so important to protect what we've got and acquire more
strategic sanctuaries, like the mud flats at Port Bolivar.''

EARNINGS WORRIES FORCE DOW TO RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average retreated from its
one-day perch above 10,000 Tuesday on renewed concerns about
corporate earnings, as other major market measures also slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The worries about first-quarter earnings were set off when
Coca-Cola told securities analysts after the closing bell on Monday
that it expected world-wide sales to show a slight decline in the
first quarter. It cited weakness in each of its international
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, an analyst at Goldman Sachs lowered her first-quarter
sales estimates for Gillette, citing weak demand in foreign
markets. And investors were not pleased to read in The Wall Street
Journal on Tuesday that at a meeting with securities analysts,
General Motors' president, G. Richard Wagoner, had said that the
automaker was not likely to meet its most optimistic target for net
income for its European operations.
</P>
<P>
   Additional weakness developed in the afternoon, when an Oregon
jury ordered Philip Morris to pay a record $81 million to the
family of a man who died of lung cancer after smoking Marlboros for
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Those developments outweighed the Federal Reserve Board's
announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to leave
short-term interest rates unchanged. The decision had been widely
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are coming under pressure,'' said Anthony Conroy, head
of stock trading at Bankers Trust. ``Traders and portfolio managers
are looking for earnings to support these prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals are fairly strong,'' he added. ``Inflation is
low, and so are interest rates. But I would not be surprised to see
a 2 percent to 3 percent correction before the market moves
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow had fallen 93.52, or 0.93 percent, to
9,913.26. Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index dipped 9.42,
or 0.72 percent, to 1,300.75, and the Nasdaq composite index lost
12.55, or 0.50 percent, to 2,480.29. The Russell 2000 index of
small company stocks declined .98, or 0.2 percent, to 398.79.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was quite light, with about 729.03 million shares
changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. With equity markets
scheduled to be closed on Good Friday, the pace of activity is
likely to slow further as the week, which includes Passover,
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the Dow closed above 10,000 for the first time,
``it was almost as if investors decided for one day to ignore all
the problems we face,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer
at First Albany Corp. ``Coke's announcement means the global
economic crisis was still around in the first quarter, and was a
reminder we are entering the earnings season, which can be a very
treacherous time.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke, down 1 9/16 at 63 1/4, and Philip Morris, off 3 7/16, to
37 3/4, were the biggest contributors to the Dow's drop Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gillette, a component of the S&AMP;P 500 index, shed 3
3/8, to 60 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of America Online, the most active stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, soared 12 points to close at 144 1/2, after the
company announced an Internet commerce alliance with Sun
Microsystems. Sun Microsystems gained 1 7/16, to 125 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet stocks also gained.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com jumped 15 1/16 to 164 11/16 on optimism about its
fledgling online auction business.
</P>
<P>
   And Priceline.com, which runs an Internet site where consumers
bid for airline tickets and hotel rooms, catapulted 53, to 69 a
share, in its first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous activity and strong demand in the Internet
stocks,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, which was the lead manager on the Priceline
offering. ``But with prices quite high in certain sectors of the
market, it is quite reasonable to seem some consolidation,'' he
added.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Acknowledging that airstrikes have failed to
halt the assault in Kosovo or sufficiently damage the Serb
military, the United States on Tuesday urged NATO to authorize an
escalated campaign that could target government buildings in
downtown Belgrade, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks, which could include government centers like the
interior and defense ministry buildings in the Serbian capital as
well military targets elsewhere in the country, would represent a
major change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has largely limited its bombing to air defense
systems, factories and defense installations on the outskirts of
Belgrade and forces directly involved in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that even an expanded bombing campaign would be
considerably less violent than the airstrikes aimed at the
political leadership of Iraq during the Gulf War when American
bombers targeted Saddam Hussein's palaces and the headquarters of
his political party. Officials said, however, that any attacks on
the densely populated center of Belgrade would require pinpoint
accuracy to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   American officials appeared hopeful that the request for
authority to bomb a much broader range of targets throughout
Yugoslavia, made at a closed door meeting of NATO ambassadors,
would be granted, diplomats reported. But NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said in an interview that he was not convinced the
time had come to dramatically broaden the strikes, reflecting
continued strains within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The American move to escalate the combat came on a downbeat day
here, as NATO's commanders received bad news from every direction.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces continued to advance virtually unopposed on the
battlefield and the refugee crisis threatened to spiral out of
control, with NATO officials estimating that one-third of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had been forced from their
homes. The alliance was forced to beat back an attempt by Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to open negotiations on terms
dictated by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said Tuesday night that the alliance
raids had been stymied by a Yugoslavian air defense that has proved
more resilient than anticipated, new tactics that involved
dispersing Milosevic's forces in the field and extremely bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the alliance was eagerly waiting to deploy
A-10 ground attack planes that they hoped would strike directly at
Serbian troops in Kosovo and knock out tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The A-10s took off Tuesday but returned without attacking their
targets because of thick clouds and rain, a NATO official said. The
A-10s could not fly below the clouds because of the risk of
exposure to anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had an impact on the infrastructure, but the impact on
their operations is a different matter,'' the NATO official said.
``Whether we can stop it or not we'll find out. A lot of people
have real doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   With the alliance excluding the use of ground forces, airpower
appeared to be the only tool NATO has to influence the Yugoslav
leadership. But the air attacks have been constrained by political
considerations, despite the West's increasingly vociferous charges
that Milosevic is engaged in a brutal campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing plan was developed months ago
when alliance officials anticipated that a modest air raid or two
would be enough to nudge a recalcitrant Milosevic back to the
negotiating table. But the scale and intensity of the Serb attacks
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have caught the alliance by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even we have been shocked by the sheer enormity of what is
going on in Kosovo at the moment,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with hundreds of thousands of refugees and reports of
murders, NATO's planners have begun to talk belatedly about the
need to ``adapt'' their bombing plan.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, officials say, has a three-part bombing plan. The
first stage is to attack Yugoslav's anti-aircraft systems, an
effort that is still under way.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, which has recently been launched, involves
strikes on the Serb forces south of Yugoslavia's 44th parallel,
units which have been pressing the attack against the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a third, more aggressive phase of the NATO
bombing plan, which officials here have been reluctant to discuss
in detail and which had not previously been approved.
</P>
<P>
   It would give NATO commanders the authority to launch a broader
range of attacks against Yugoslavia's military leaders, command and
control centers, weapons depots, heavy weapons and fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The American proposal to expand air attacks came as Serb forces
continue to press their attacks against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, NATO officials estimated that 118,000 ethnic Albanians
had been forced out of Kosovo since March 24. Serb tanks have been
surrounding villages and towns. Women and children have been
separated from the men and then forcibly bused to the frontier.
Afterwards, their homes are burned to the ground so that they
cannot return.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Pec, which used to have a population of some
100,000, has now been almost totally destroyed. Along with the
daily handouts touting its airstrikes, the NATO press office now
distributes a daily report on ``City Torching'' by Serb forces.

   WASHINGTON _ As NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia entered
their second week on Wednesday, the weather-hampered mission
appeared to be shifting dramatically from a surgical campaign
targeting equipment and buildings to a harrowing assault on flesh
and bone.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of the supersonic B-1 and its cargo of
armor-piercing cluster bombs, ground-buzzing A-10 tank busters,
weather-proof surveillance drones and possibly even Apache attack
helicopters, NATO seems ready to take its punches directly to the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   After a week in which harsh weather conditions have given
Serbian troops and thugs cover to rampage across the towns and
villages of Kosovo, the landscape is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO and American officials continuing to rule out the use
of ground troops in Kosovo, the new mix of NATO aircraft into the
war zone suggests the next phase of the assault on Yugoslavia will
target enemy soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are increasingly going after the (Serbian) army and the
(Serbian) police,'' Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson, director of
intelligence for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the
Pentagon late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's comments came hours after it was disclosed that five
B-1B Lancer bombers are being sent from Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D., to beef up the NATO bombing mission and that A-10 Warthog
planes are being moved from European locations to an area closer to
Kosovo, Yugoslavia' southernmost province.
</P>
<P>
   Both aircraft would significantly enhance NATO's ability to
strike at troops on the ground in Kosovo. The B-1B is capable of
carrying 30 anti-armor cluster bombs and is effective in striking
concentrations of troops. The low-flying, hard-diving A-10 carries
up to eight tons of ordnance and is extremely effective against
slow-moving ground targets, such as tanks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO is enhancing its surveillance capabilities in
the region to help pinpoint targets and monitor Serb troop
movements. It soon will begin using Predator surveillance aircraft,
computer-controlled drones that transmit live images to ground
controllers. It already has at least two E-8C Joint Stars, an
airborne surveillance system capable of detecting troop movements
as far away as 120 miles. The Joint Stars system was instrumental
in tracking Iraqi troops and Scud missiles in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon's acknowledgement that it is considering the
use of Apache helicopters in Kosovo is the clearest indication that
the smaller units of Serbian ground troops are to be struck harder
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apache comes the closest to being a firepower system that
would be able to find and engage small units effectively without
having ground troops there,'' said David Ochmanek, a former Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and currently a senior
defense analyst at the Rand Corp.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas's Apache helicopter, which was used heavily
against Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War, is widely regarded as the most
lethal and survivable helicopter in military aviation history. It
is capable of operating during the day or night. It is equipped
with anti-tank missiles, rocket launchers and a 30 millimeter
automatic cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the Apache helicopter in Kosovo would require approval by
NATO's political arm, the North Atlantic Council, according to
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. Introducing the Apache to the
Kosovo war zone would indicate an escalation of the conflict, a
``Phase Three'' of ``Operation: Allied Force,'' the formal name of
the NATO bombing mission.
</P>
<P>
   All of the new weapons en route to Kosovo -- or under
consideration by NATO for use against the Serbs -- are capable of
operating in adverse weather conditions, an increasingly important
factor in NATO planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather has not been great, but there are pockets of
better weather, or less bad weather, that allows us to attack
certain targets under certain conditions,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Admiral Scott Fry, director of operations for the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said weather and geography have been the
``two main allies'' of the Serbian ground troops. He acknowledged
that the weather has gotten ``more difficult'' with each successive
night of bombing, with laser-guided weapons affected the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had instances where sorties were unable to complete
their missions in their target areas because they were weathered
out,'' he said during the Pentagon briefing with Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insisted, ``we have managed to get packages into the
target area every night.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Genocide, which the State Department has accused
Yugoslavia of committing in Kosovo, is one of the most
emotion-laden words in diplomacy and international law.
</P>
<P>
   It is defined in a treaty that was promulgated after World War
II in response to the Holocaust and signed by both the United
States and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as the Convention on Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide, defines genocide in such a way that
offenses need not rise to the level of the Holocaust to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations made genocide a crime in 1946, and the treaty
went into force in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty's critics have contended that the definition is too
broad and open-ended.
</P>
<P>
   Genocide is defined in the treaty as ``any of the following acts
committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
ethnic, racial or religious group, such as: a) killing members of
the group; b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of
the group; c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of
life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or
in part; d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the
group; e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Although rape is not explicitly included in the behavior covered
by the treaty, most scholars have come to accept it _ especially
systematic rape of a population _ as a form of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty allows individuals charged with genocide to be
prosecuted as war criminals and obliges signers to prevent genocide
within their borders. It does not provide for any armed
intervention by a country or alliance to prevent or stop genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Gidon A.G. Gottlieb, a professor of international law at the
University of Chicago, said, however, that the treaty could be
useful in defining the kind of violations of human rights that
would justify armed intervention.

 A Nose for Business

   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A boutique is set to open next week on San Francisco's upscale
Union Street that specializes in something other than antiques,
apparel and edibles.
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite, the brainchild of former Clorox brand manager
Soon-Chart Yu, will sell a full line of products to help folks
breathe better.
</P>
<P>
   The allergy business is nothing to sneeze at. Each year,
Americans spend more than $6 billion on medications, respiratory
devices, cleaners, filters and other products to clean the air and
clear their lungs and sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   But the launch of Gazoontite is not so much a tale of numbers as
it is about what it takes to create a new business. For Yu, 33, it
culminates years of planning and sacrifice. It meant switching
careers, returning to school to get an MBA degree, becoming a
manager at a giant consumer products company and then taking a job
as a low-paid retail clerk to gain sales experience.
</P>
<P>
   His persistence illustrates the extent to which people will go
to become entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Yu didn't always dream of waging war against allergens. He was
born in Taiwan, and at 3 he moved to Davis, where his dad was an
agricultural geneticist. Yu received a degree in electrical
engineering from the University of California at Davis and then
worked at Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   But he yearned to deal more with people than computers, and he
went to work at the Bain &AMP; Co. consulting firm in San Francisco.
For nearly two years, he thought it was fun wearing a suit and tie
and having an office in a downtown highrise. But it slowly dawned
on Yu that he wanted to create his own business.
</P>
<P>
   But before doing so, he figured he needed a lot more experience.
Yu received an MBA from Stanford University's vaunted business
school in 1993 and then went to Clorox to gain more general
management experience.
</P>
<P>
   As a brand manager for toilet bowl and Formula 409 cleaners for
four years, Yu said he enjoyed not only the profit-and-loss
responsibilities, but the pressure to stay on top of consumer
trends. One of these, he discovered, was America's increasing
interest in air quality.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the time Yu, who comes from a family of allergy
sufferers, began to think of opening his own business to help
people with their allergies.
</P>
<P>
   But before he could do that, Yu figured there was one more
important lesson he needed to learn, namely how to be a salesman.
So in late 1997, he left his management position at Clorox to take
a ``sales associate'' job for six months at Crate &AMP; Barrel. Yu said
he took an 85 percent pay cut but gained a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you get into a new field like retailing, it is
important to try it out,'' he explained. ``I was surprised by how
demanding it was both physically and emotionally. After seven hours
on your feet, you still have to treat the person coming in the door
the same as you would the first customer of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   To assure himself that his allergy-products concept would work,
Yu then conducted market research. Rather than paying someone else
to conduct a survey and paying malls for the right to interview
their patrons. Yu simply showed up at shopping centers in Corta
Madera, Stonestown and Stanford and queried shoppers until mall
managers kicked him out.
</P>
<P>
   Next was the challenge of what to call the business. Gesundheit,
which in German means health, was Yu's first choice. But most
people couldn't pronounce or spell it correctly, so he went with a
phonetic translation.
</P>
<P>
   Then he wrote a business plan and sounded out investors. Yu
raised $1.1 million, largely from wealthy individual investors and
Baccharis Capital, a Menlo Park venture capital firm that
specializes in socially responsible, consumer-product related
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Yu maintains that his shop will fill an important niche in the
market. Although many products _ from inhalers to vacuum cleaners
to bedding supplies _ are available to allergy sufferers, he said
it is difficult to find them all at the same store.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the online side of the business to compete with.
One-stop shopping now is possible through a dozen or so catalog,
mail-order and online merchants such as Allergy Control Products
and Priorities. Yu, however, said there's a drawback to the online
approach: Consumers can't touch and test the products before they
buy, or get quick answers to their questions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Abba Terr, a medical adviser to the company and director of
the allergy clinic at the Stanford University Medical School,
believes that there is a real need for a store like Yu's. ``Twenty
to 30 percent of the population is allergic to something and need
gadgets as well as medications,'' he said. ``They can get these
things by mail order, but I think it's important that a retail
store can also provide information.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite's tiny staff includes Cindi Ersek, another former
Clorox brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   Among its wares, Gazoontite will sell Honeywell's new Quietcare
air purifier, which reportedly is 30 percent more quiet than other
models, for $160; Miele and Nilfisk vacuum cleaners, including
backpack models for $399 to $549; silky pillow covers for $17; and
hypoallergenic stuffed toys like Gund's Classic Pooh for $20.
</P>
<P>
   Although vacuum cleaners and filters marked HEPA (for high
efficiency particulate arresting) are more expensive than
conventional models, they do a much better job in trapping
bacteria, mold, dust mite scat and other particles as small as 0.3
microns. Traditional vacuum cleaners without special filters simply
blow microscopic allergens out the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite plans to launch its catalog and Web site in May and
then open additional stores, starting in a Peninsula or East Bay
shopping mall.

 Golden State Bancorp to Cut 1,100 Jobs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Golden State Bancorp, the corporate parent of California Federal
Bank, cut about 1,100 jobs in connection with its $1.8 billion
takeover in September of Glendale Federal Bank, the thrift
disclosed in a regulatory filing earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the job cuts took place when Golden State shut Glendale
headquarters and its data centers in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The thrift got rid of only nine slots in the Bay Area,
spokeswoman Mary Rische said.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks, equaling 13 percent of Cal Fed and Glendale's
combined workforces, took place through a combination of firings
and attrition. They were in line with projections that Cal Fed of
San Francisco made in February 1998 when it agreed to buy Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State's purchase of Glendale created the second-largest
savings and loan in the United States, with $55 billion in assets.
Ronald Perelman, the New York financier who also owns big stakes in
Revlon and Sunbeam, holds about a third of the thrift's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State used to be the name of Glendale's parent company.
Cal Fed took the title for its own corporate parent when it
completed the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   After closing 56 overlapping Cal Fed and Glendale branches in
November, the thrift has 358 offices in California and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 16 branches, including five in the Bay Area, will
be shut in May, Rische said.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, the Internal Revenue Service has told Golden
State it owes additional taxes in connection with Glendale's
federal tax returns from 1993 to 1997, the thrift also disclosed in
its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is challenging tax losses Glendale took in connection
with its 1993 secondary stock offering, a recapitalization that
saved it from insolvency and a federal takeover near the peak of
California's economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State said the IRS position is ``preliminary'' and that
discussions with the agency are still taking place. It said it
doesn't how much, if anything, it will owe in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still investigating and they don't have a number,''
Rische said.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Gray, an analyst with the New York brokerage Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said he didn't know about Golden State's tax
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would change our investment opinion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray rates Golden State ``outperform,'' Bernstein's highest
grade, based on what he said was the thrift's strong earnings
potential and its attractiveness to potential acquirers, mainly
large banks that want to come in to California on a big scale.

 Column: Scouting Out Executive Positions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  For 24 years, I was general manager of a wholesale
distribution company that I ran from startup to sales of $30
million with 60 employees. It was sold last year, and I would love
to find another entrepreneur who has started or is starting a
business and needs someone to handle day-to-day operations. Have
you any suggestions on how to get in front of these types?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  It sounds as if your networking skills might have
gotten a little rusty. But that's an easier problem to fix than
someone who has lots of contacts but few business skills.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what type of business you were in or feel
comfortable with, but most every industry has a national
organization with regional chapters. Elaine Biech, a Wisconsin
business consultant who published ``The Business of Consulting''
last fall, suggests attending the next local, regional or national
meeting. If you built a company, you also might have a good story
to tell. If so, contact the conference committee and submit a
proposal for a presentation before the group or write an article
for the organization's trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   If you did a great job at your previous company, Biech suggests
that you might ask former colleagues or the new owners for
introductions or tips about potential chief operating officer jobs.
The same applies to former competitors, bankers, accountants and
others you have dealt with over the years.
</P>
<P>
   You also might narrow your search by checking out specific
companies online, in the library or through news publications and
business journals. When you find ones for which you might like to
work, write a short letter summarizing: 1) why you like the
company, 2) what you have done and 3) what you can do for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Local chambers of commerce and other small-business
organizations also are a good way to make contacts. They are easy
to find online and in the phone book. You might want to check out
the Service Corp.  &LR; Corps of Retired Executives, which is sponsored
by the U.S. Small Business Administration. No doubt you could
volunteer your services and find interesting leads to new
management opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   You also might check out executive search firms, which help
companies find seasoned executives and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Search
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a venture capital group to take a look at a
concept I have developed on the Internet. Where can I find a
listing of firms and their special interests? And beyond the names
and addresses, how do I get in the door?
</P>
<P>
   A: A good source of contact information is
PricewaterhouseCoopers' quarterly Money Tree Survey of close to 500
venture capital firms and their latest investments
( &LR; www.pwcmoneytree.com &LR; ). Unlike many other databases, it's free
and it contains a wealth of information, including ``custom
searches'' by industry, region, state of development and stage of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent source is the Venture Capital Resource Library
 &LR; (www.vfinance.com &LR; ), which provides an extensive directory of
resources, including links to venture firm home pages, and related
services and articles. The National Venture Capital Association
 &LR; (www.nvca.com &LR; ) provides similar information.
</P>
<P>
   There also are subscription services that provide annual
directories and monthly newsletters for a price. Technologic
Partners  &LR; (www.tpsite.com),  &LR; publishes a handy $195 VentureFinance
directory of venture capital firms specializing in high-tech
investing, including names of partners, investment categories and
recent initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Capital Journal ( &LR; www.nvst.com./vcj &LR; ), published by
Securities Data Publishing in New York, produces a $385 directory
of VC firms, including their areas of expertise and criteria for
making investments.
</P>
<P>
   Several publications such as Red Herring ( &LR; www.herring.com &LR; ) and
Upside ( &LR; www.upside.com &LR; ) also cater to entrepreneurs seeking
capital and building companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are organizations that try to connect entrepreneurs
with wealthy ``angel'' investors. The Small Business Administration
is trying to do this at its fledgling ACE-Net Angel Capital
Electronic Network ( &LR; www.sba.gov &LR; ). Another popular site is
Garage.com, started in Palo Alto by former Apple executive Guy
Kawasaki to help connect entrepreneurs with investors
( &LR; www.garage.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Now, the second and more difficult part of your question:
getting through the door and getting money. If you are an
entrepreneur with a string of successes, have an MBA from Stanford
University and know all the VCs on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park,
it's no sweat. But for entrepreneurial first timers without
credentials and contacts, it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   You might try venture firms that specialize in early stage
investments, like Sausalito's Artemis Ventures as well as angel
investor groups and various forums.
</P>
<P>
   MIT/Stanford Venture Lab is a public forum where entrepreneurs,
managers and executives can learn about starting and growing
companies. The Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at
the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business
has monthly forums where budding entrepreneurs are given 60 seconds
to pitch their ideas to venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Garage.com CEO Kawasaki suggests that regular forums held in the
Peninsula by the Churchill Club and Band of Angels are good places
to make contact. He also offers these ``guerrilla'' tips for
getting past the receptionist at the venture capital firm:
</P>
<P>
   _Shorter is better. I've never seen a company not get financing
because the business plan or executive summary was too short.
</P>
<P>
   _Have someone else do the heavy lifting. Top law and accounting
firms that work with VCs may be expensive, but they don't just
print documents, they open doors. If you want a hearing with
potential VC or angel investors, don't hire Uncle Joe the divorce
lawyer.

UNEXPECTED HIT: SO NOW WHAT? 
WHERE THE YOUNG ARE 
THE IRAN PRECEDENT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can setting a ratings record with a new show ever create a
sticky dilemma for a television network?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask executives at the Fox network, who find themselves with
what ought to be the supremely pleasant problem of pondering how to
take best advantage of the unexpectedly strong performance last
Sunday of its new animated comedy, ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   The new show from Matt Groening, the creator of Fox's perennial
(and basically only) comedy hit, ``The Simpsons,'' not only built
on the rating for that show as its lead-in but also scored the best
rating of any comedy following ``The Simpsons'' in the network's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Futurama'' was the highest-rated show in all of television
last week among male viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, one of
the most important categories for advertisers. It was also the most
popular show of the week among all teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   So where's the problem with any of this?
</P>
<P>
   Only in the fact that virtually no one at Fox expected this of
``Futurama.'' Several of the network's program executives had
considered the show something of a disappointment, especially when
compared to the two other animated shows the network had in its
plans for this season, ``The PJs'' and ``Family Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening had fought vocally inside Fox executive suites for the
right to place his show on Sunday after his other hit and was
rather grudgingly (said one executive) granted a two-week window on
Sundays before ``Futurama'' was shipped off to Tuesdays, where for
the rest of this season it is to play adjacent to the now
struggling ``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The animated show Fox executives have been far more enthusiastic
about is ``Family Guy.'' How much better an indicator of true love
than the fact that ``Family Guy'' got the designated hit spot after
Fox's coverage of the Super Bowl this season?
</P>
<P>
   Fox is bringing back ``Family Guy'' on April 11, after
``Futurama'' gets one more Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if it doesn't put up the kind of rating numbers
that ``Futurama'' has? Will Fox be forced to reconsider its early
lukewarm reaction to Groening's new comedy?
</P>
<P>
   Groening can surely be counted on to remind the Fox executives
whose show has been a hit on their network for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks will give the Fox programmers some thorny, if
potentially cheery, questions to ponder when they put together
their schedule for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ABC programmers are much happier this week that they may have
some additional shows to fit into their thinking for next fall. Two
new ABC comedies, ``The Norm Show'' and ``It's Like, You Know,''
scored promising ratings in their first outings last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norm Show'' held onto most of the audience that watched
ABC's hit ``Drew Carey,'' something few ABC shows have been able to
do. ``It's Like, You Know'' had a tougher time because it had to
follow President Clinton's address on the bombing in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ABC was thrilled because the show brought in hordes of young
female viewers who had shown no interest in bombs or ethnic
cleansing once they learned their favorite, ``Dharma and Greg,''
was being pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   They did return for ``It's Like, You Know,'' however, which ABC
executives foresee as a good sign for the network, if not the
nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hyams, the vice president for audience analysis at ABC,
said the network ``can really use these shows'' in light of the
fact that its biggest hit comedy, ``Home Improvement,'' will be
gone next season.
</P>
<P>
   _ By BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE YOUNG ARE
</P>
<P>
   The major broadcast networks are wringing their hands about the
loss of hordes of 18-to-34-year-old viewers this season _ at least
6 percent of that age group _ and even accuse Nielsen Media
Research of faulty measurement (a charge Nielsen denies).
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word of where at least some of those young viewers
have gone: to Univision, the Spanish-language network. Sparked by
its hugely popular prime-time ``telenovellas,'' Univision is the
fastest-growing network, broadcast or cable, among
18-to-34-year-olds. And Nielsen research has helped it grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nielsen has only been measuring Spanish households for around
seven years, and we're learning to use the numbers to understand
the Hispanic consumer better,'' said Mario Rodriguez, Univision's
vice president of programming. ``As we learn what they like and
don't like, we tailor our programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual Hispanic viewers used to watch the same prime-time
sitcoms and dramas on ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox as English-language
viewers; now Univision typically attracts 92 percent of prime-time
viewers in Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   Creating this appeal are three telenovellas. Commonly, and
mistakenly, described as Spanish soap operas, they are actually
dramatic mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like TV novels, not soap operas,'' Rodriguez said.
``Soap opera is Susan Lucci having hundreds of boyfriends or
husbands. The novellas change stories every four months, with a new
book, a new tale, new actors and actresses. Also, they are
original, first-run episodes year round _ no repeats ever _ and our
viewers know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the average audience each quarter-hour during prime
time, the Univision study of Nielsen data showed Univision had an
average of 960,000 viewers among 18-to-34-year-olds this season, up
from 719,000 last season, an increase of 241 percent. The next
fastest growth came at the WB network, which was up 154 percent, to
1,265,000 from 1,111,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next fastest-growing networks among that age group were, in
order, ESPN, VH1, the Sci-Fi Channel and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   Although they still have by far the largest audiences, the
broadcast networks had the biggest losses among 18-to-34-year-olds.

<P>
   THE IRAN PRECEDENT
</P>
<P>
   Brian Williams should beware: This is how Ted Koppel began, in
1979, with a late-night show intended to provide news of the
American hostages being held in Iran. ``ABC News Nightline'' has
been on the air ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Now Williams, the anchor of a regular 9 p.m. newscast on the
cable network MSNBC, has added a half-hour program at 11 p.m.
designed to give updates on the fighting in Yugoslavia. For a
self-described news addict like Williams, it is a welcome addition
to his schedule, in part because he enjoys the jolt of providing
live news.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night was the program's first night (it replaces a rerun
of an earlier talk show, ``Equal Time''), and Williams, as he had
anticipated, found himself ignoring the Teleprompter to read
breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we came on the air, and within seconds I was
reading a Reuters flash bulletin that Serb radio claimed they had
shot down a British Harrier jump jet,'' Williams said Tuesday,
referring to Monday night's debut of the 11 p.m. program. ``Within
two minutes, we went to the Pentagon, which knocked down the story,
and we continued the broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the only star on MSNBC, the cable network started by
Microsoft and NBC News almost three years ago. The network's
prime-time ratings have declined this season, and the Fox News
Channel (available in nine million fewer households) has begun
outranking it, with an average of 223,000 households during prime
time in the first quarter of 1999, to an average of 201,000 for
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   But since the crisis in Kosovo began, MSNBC has seen its ratings
jump by a bigger margin than Fox's or CNN's; for the first five
days of NATO bombing, the prime-time average audiences were 367,000
for MSNBC, 264,000 for Fox and 1.18 million for CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mindful that this is how our good friend Koppel
started,'' Williams said. ``However, I don't expect to be saying,
`This is Day 247' of this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if this is about to become a regular feature on our
prime-time schedule I have yet to hear it.''

<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ After two days of intensive
negotiations, Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie
Ahern of Ireland failed on Tuesday night to persuade Protestant and
Roman Catholic leaders to compromise on the bitter dispute over the
disarmament of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the prime ministers, working against a Friday deadline, said
they would resume talks with the leaders on Wednesday morning.
Blair stayed overnight near Belfast and was said to be prepared to
go to London on Wednesday afternoon to answer questions in
Parliament about Kosovo, then to return here later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   When the negotiations ended Tuesday night, several participants
said there had been no breakthrough, and they disagreed on how
much, if any, progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with party leaders for 4{ hours on Monday night,
the prime ministers swept back and forth over this British province
in a military helicopter Tuesday, emphasizing at several meetings
that time is running out for settling the issue, which threatens to
cripple or collapse the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved
last April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has set a deadline of this Friday for an
agreement. The sticking point is the insistence by Protestant
leaders that the overwhelmingly Catholic IRA make a ``credible
beginning'' on disarmament before its political wing, Sinn Fein, is
allowed to sit in a new Protestant and Catholic Cabinet of the
Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly is the body that would
carry out the home rule provisions of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet is to be created to pave the way for the return by
the London government of home rule powers to the province after 27
years.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to compromise this week could lead to another delay and
possibly to a return to the widespread sectarian violence the peace
agreement is supposed to end.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for more than 20 months, but
has repeatedly stated that it will not surrender a single bullet or
an ounce of Semtex explosive. Unless it does, Protestant leaders
say, Sinn Fein will be excluded from the new Assembly Cabinet. Sinn
Fein points out that the peace agreement does not require
disarmament before May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As they began their day with short speeches at the Hazlewood
Integrated College, an interdenominational high school in Belfast,
the two prime ministers sounded optimistic. ``After talking to the
parties here last night and again today,'' Blair said, ``I do
believe that we can get there. It is within our grasp.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own religious background, he said: ``On my
mother's side were very strong Irish Protestants. I married a
Catholic, although I am Church of England. We are about to enter
the 21st century. Do these things really have to pull people
apart?''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern, who is from a working-class district of Dublin, used
humor to explain why he opposes a delay in negotiations, which
people here have been calling ``parking the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my end of Dublin,'' he said, ``if you park things too long
they usually get vandalized.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meetings continued during the day in Parliament
buildings, the home of the Assembly in Belfast, and in Hillsborough
Castle, a British residence 20 miles south, an atmosphere of
sectarian discord prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA tried to improve its image among Catholics in a macabre
way.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed guerrilla organization said it would soon disclose
where it buried nine of its operatives who were secretly executed
for being disloyal to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the grisly logic of Northern Ireland politics, this was to
put a human face on terrorism by returning bodies to relatives. The
IRA statement Monday night apologized for the delay in returning
the victims, but not for killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was heckled twice Tuesday, first by a Protestant Unionist
Assembly member, Cedric Wilson, who hung out a window and shouted
angrily but unintelligibly at the prime minister as Blair left the
helicopter on the lawn in front of Parliament buildings.
</P>
<P>
   When Blair left the building, surrounded by security men and
accompanied by Ahern, a small group of older people held up signs
attacking terrorism, and shouted, ``God save Ulster'' and ``Never
mind Yugoslavia. Think of Northern Ireland, your own country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several well-dressed older Protestant women, who said they were
relatives of IRA victims, seemed to epitomize the fearful hard-line
Protestant views on the IRA disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA will get its united Ireland,'' said one woman.
``They'll still have all their ammunition, all their weaponry. And
united Ireland will mean the ethnic cleansing of the Protestant
people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the town of Ballycastle, a pipe bomb was thrown through a
window Tuesday into the home of a Sinn Fein city council member,
James McCarry. It was small device that exploded without injuring
anyone in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The police also confirmed that several hundred Catholics threw
stones at people arriving at Waterfront Hall here on Monday night
for an exhibition on Protestant Orange culture.

EYE-POPPING `MATRIX' IS FIRST-RATE SCI-FI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood has not given us a futuristic, action-filled,
special-effects-o-rama as imaginative and fun as the Wachowski
Brothers' ``The Matrix'' in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rare example of a big science-fiction film that's
actually based on an intriguing premise. Indeed, it demands a
certain level of concentration _ and mental toil _ to even
completely ``get'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, this premise is that our world _ everyone, everything
we see around us _ doesn't exist. It's a ``computer-generated
wonderland,'' an illusion, a ``matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, this is not 1999. It's the late-21st century, after a war
between human beings and artificial intelligence _ machines run
amok _ has devastated the planet, and the machines have won.
</P>
<P>
   But since the machines need people for ``energy'' _ consuming
them like batteries _ people are bred in giant hatcheries, and
deluded into thinking they're still living in the lost paradise of
the pre-war, late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the tip of the iceberg of the highly original story
idea, which could be as intricate as any sci-fi movie plot ever
concocted, and just keeps getting more involved as it moves along.
</P>
<P>
   And we discover the premise in stages, through the eyes of a
computer nerd named Neo (Keanu Reeves), who is kidnapped by a band
of rebel humans who have escaped the Matrix and battle their
mechanized overlords.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the resistance (Laurence Fishburne) believes Neo
is the ``chosen one'' _ the messiah foretold by a great oracle _
who will beat the machines and lead the human race to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   So Neo is gradually indoctrinated into the reality behind the
Matrix, and programmed to be a fierce warrior capable of going
one-on-one with the humanoid machine-men who police the virtual
world.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, it all works. Even though they have zero background
in sci-fi, Andy and Larry Wachowski (``Bound'') turn this premise
into a genuinely thrilling, smartly acted, and only occasionally
silly sci-fi genre piece.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Joel Silver has loaded down the proceedings with his
typical blazing action sequences, and noted Hong Kong fight
coordinator Yuen Wo Ping provides a succession of dizzying martial
arts sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The film's lavishly gritty, space-noir production design (by
Australia's Owen Paterson) evokes films such as ``Blade Runner''
and ``Alien,'' and its range of visual effects are both eye-popping
and integral to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most memorable thing about ``The Matrix'' is its
challenging storyline _ which is laid before us with such
originality, visual flair and cerebral dexterity that the film
often seems positively Kubrickesque.
</P>
<P>
   The Matrix. Directed and written by the Wachowski Brothers.
Produced by Joel Silver. Cast: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne,
Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano. Warner Bros. 120
minutes. Rated R for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+.

FED MAINTAINS STEADY STANCE ON RATE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve's top officials left interest
rates unchanged Tuesday, and passed up an opportunity to signal any
concern about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of the Fed's governors and regional bank presidents,
all members of the policy-setting Open Market Committee, came at a
time when inflation has been remarkably tame despite the robust
economy. And there is unlikely to be much upward pressure on prices
as long as labor costs do not accelerate significantly and Europe
and Asia remain in the economic doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure most members of the committee think everything is
going rather beautifully,'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton
University economist and a former Fed vice chairman. ``They have
not allowed themselves to be provoked into some sort of pre-emptive
action against inflation and, in hindsight, their patience has
proven to be correct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Fed sometimes raised interest rates before any
rise in the inflation rate, contending that an increase was
necessary to discourage borrowing and thus slow a strong economy
before companies raised prices in response to shortages and rising
wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy has boomed for over three years and forecasts of
higher inflation have proved wrong time after time. So Fed
officials have switched tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they take any action, they are going to wait for the
inflation rate to actually pick up,'' said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey Lanston &AMP; Co., a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has another tool at its disposal that it chose not to
use Tuesday. At times, even at sessions when it did not change
rates, the central bank has signaled its future intentions through
a directive stating that it was shifting its ``bias'' in one
direction or another. Traditionally, such preferences have been
kept secret until the minutes of each meeting are published six
weeks later. But recently the Fed said it would usually announce
such directives when they were adopted, rather than make the
financial markets guess. There was no announcement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed affects a whole range of interest rates by changing its
target for the federal funds rate, the overnight borrowing cost
that banks and other financial institutions charge each other.
Rates on car loans, mortgages and home equity loans, for example,
tend to move up and down with the federal funds rate. The central
bank left its target at 4.75 percent, the level it has been since
the Fed last cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market may also have been a factor in the Fed's
decision not to take any action Tuesday. While a small rise in the
federal funds rate might slow the rise in stock prices, it might
also provoke a sharp, damaging decline, said Albert Wojnilower, a
Wall Street economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries Fed officials when the stock market runs away,'' he
said. Still, ``they don't see it going up in a runaway fashion, but
even if it were,'' Wojnilower added, ``they prefer the market
running away than taking a dive, which they would have to do
something about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The stock market, in the view of many economists, has been a
major driver behind the economic boom, encouraging people to borrow
and spend and fostering a high level of consumer confidence. The
Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of consumer
confidence rose in March by eight-tenths of a point, to 133.9 from
a revised 133.1 in February.
</P>
<P>
   For all the strong growth, low unemployment and labor shortages,
the inflation rate has fallen over the last two years, defying
traditional relationships. Many economists explain the conundrum by
pointing to a weak global economy and a relatively strong American
currency, which has resulted in a flood of inexpensive imports that
helps to hold down the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things may be beginning to turn around overseas,'' said
Kenneth Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc.,
a forecasting service in St. Louis. ``But the Fed has time before
there is any real improvement and Fed officials will wait until
they get much stronger signals before they consider tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   A competing explanation for the unusual combination of strong
growth and shrinking inflation has been offered by Alan Greenspan,
the Fed's chairman. He has suggested that the nation's productivity
growth rate _ which measures the ability of workers to turn out a
greater quantity of goods and services in a given period of time _
has finally started to improve after a quarter-century of
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity statistics issued by the government do show recent
improvements, thus allowing workers, in effect, to pay for their
own wage increases rather than force employers to raise prices or
squeeze their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   But while many economists say the improvement is probably
temporary, Greenspan has argued that it reflects the growing
effectiveness of computers and other new technologies in the
workplace. And lately some other Fed governors have expressed the
same view.

JURY AWARDS $81 MILLION TO OREGON SMOKER'S FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state jury in Portland, Ore., Tuesday ordered the largest
award in a smoking-related lawsuit, ruling that Philip Morris Cos.
must pay $81 million to the family of a man who smoked Marlboro
cigarettes for four decades before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, coming just a month after a San Francisco jury
awarded $51 million in another case brought by an individual smoker
against Philip Morris, could indicate that the tobacco industry's
legal fortunes may have shifted, analysts said. In recent years,
the public has witnessed a constant drumbeat of documents damaging
to cigarette makers, which industry analysts say may be a factor in
the jury decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in both cases involving Philip Morris, the juries
called for large punitive damages, which are meant to punish a
company for its behavior. In Tuesday's decision, the jury awarded
$79.5 million in punitive damages and $1.6 million in compensatory
damages to the family of Jesse Williams, a janitor who died in
1997, five months after lung cancer was diagnosed. In the San
Francisco case, the jury awarded $50 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Mayola, said Tuesday that he had had a dying
wish. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies stop lying about the
health problems of smokers,'' she told The Associated Press. ``This
jury agreed with his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which is appealing the California verdict, said
Tuesday that it would also appeal the Oregon verdict. Higher courts
have thrown out the few previous victories by smokers in
cigarette-related lawsuits, often on procedural grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No verdict has ever withstood an appeal, and we don't believe
this will be a first one,'' said Gregory Little, the associate
general counsel for Philip Morris, which is the country's largest
cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco industry analysts said Tuesday's decision was a
particular setback for cigarette makers because state product
liability laws in Oregon are far tougher than those in California
or Florida, the other states in which producers have suffered legal
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, a smoker is barred from receiving an award if a jury
determines that he or she bore more than 50 percent liability for
the problem over which a suit was brought.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette company lawyers argued that Williams was aware of the
health risk when he decided to continue smoking. The jury
determined that Williams and Philip Morris equally shared
liability.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York, said that added to the California decision,
Tuesday's verdict suggested that the industry's $206 billion
settlement last year with 46 states had failed to put its legal
troubles to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, which resolved lawsuits brought by the
states to recover health care expenses related to smoking,
individual smokers and groups of them can still sue. Four states
had earlier settled their claims in deals with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has got to get its head out of the sand
and stop believing that the settlement got them closure,'' Black
said. ``With all the documents and whistleblowers out there, juries
are increasingly going to award damages.''
</P>
<P>
   In trading following the verdict, Philip Morris stock fell
$3.4375 a share to close at $37.75.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the California case last month, the jury ordered Philip
Morris to pay $51.5 million to Patricia Henley, a California woman,
who said that her lung cancer had been caused by more than 35 years
of smoking. That verdict was the largest award of its kind until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette industry officials have portrayed that case as an
aberration, pointing to a number of recent legal victories. Earlier
this month, a federal jury in Akron, Ohio, ruled that tobacco
companies did not have to repay to dozens of union health and
benefit plans in that state the costs of treating smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that the back-to-back losses by Philip Morris
in individual cases suggested that cigarette makers were likely to
see more defeats and escalating awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to appear in the last two cases that the juries
wanted to punish Philip Morris and the industry,'' said Bonnie
Zoller, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon lawsuit was brought by the wife and children of
Williams, a former janitor in the Portland school system who was 67
when he died. It charged that Philip Morris knew cigarettes caused
cancer and misrepresented that information. It sought $101 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In making its finding, the Oregon jury also had to conclude that
the misrepresentations Philip Morris was accused of took place over
the past decade because state law limits the time for which
plaintiffs can seek damages.
</P>
<P>
   Little, the Philip Morris lawyer, said he believed that despite
the two recent decisions, tobacco producers would continue to
prevail in the courtroom. ``The industry has been very successful
defending individual cases,'' he said. ``And we continue to believe
that we will continue to be successful defending them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 500 smoking-related lawsuits pending against
Philip Morris. President Clinton also announced earlier this year
that he had directed the Justice Department to begin preparing a
lawsuit against cigarette makers to recover Medicare and other
federal money spent treating illnesses related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Black said a federal lawsuit could be in the industry's interest
because it might provide a way to resolve individual cases as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has got to make a decision,'' Black said. ``They
have to recognize that the tide has turned and decide they have to
get some type of settlement. Either that or they have to build in
the anticipated price of litigation in the cost of cigarettes.''

NATO REJECTS MILOSEVIC'S CALL FOR CEASE-FIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders Tuesday rejected Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's call for a cease-fire as the alliance warned
that the aerial bombardment, in its seventh day, could be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remain steady and determined with the will to see this
through,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO was ``prepared to go
as long as it takes'' to wear down Milosevic's military and police
forces and to stop their rampage against ethnic Albanians in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will take much longer to degrade the forces as much
as we think we need to do,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said that Milosevic,
during talks in Belgrade, proposed reducing his troops in Kosovo in
exchange for a halt to NATO airstrikes on his Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov flew from the Yugoslav capital to Bonn, where the
proposal was rejected by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany,
whose nation currently holds the rotating presidency of the
15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no basis for a political solution,'' Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   His view was endorsed by other leaders of NATO nations,
including Clinton, who renewed the call for Milosevic to accept the
alliance-dictated truce that ethnic Albanian leaders have signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I share the view of Chancellor Schroeder that President
Milosevic's proposal is unacceptable,'' Clinton said in a statement
issued by the White House. ``President Milosevic began this brutal
campaign: It is his responsibility to bring it to an immediate end
and embrace a just peace. There is a strong consensus in NATO that
we must press forward with our military action.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, speaking at a State Department ceremony, Clinton
indicated that the current NATO view that Kosovo should be an
autonomous province of Serbia, within Yugoslavia, could change.
Clinton said that as a result of aggression in Kosovo, Milosevic
will see ``the prospect of international support for Serbia's claim
to Kosovo increasingly jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac suggested that Milosevic may
become a NATO target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot accept on its soil a man and a regime that for
10 years has conducted ethnic cleansing,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, said Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering,
Milosevic is ``a prime candidate'' for indictment as a war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground in Kosovo, ``Serbian ethnic cleansing has reached
new heights,'' said Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain's Royal
Air Force, the NATO air commander.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Pec, Kosovo's second largest city
and once home to about 100,000 people ``has been almost totally
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Shea said, 570,000 Kosovar Albanians, or
about 30 percent of the province's population, ``have been uprooted
from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Milosevic's forces of ``burning whole cities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems particularly mindless,'' Shea said. ``What he's
doing is simply vastly increasing the cost to Yugoslavia of having
to reconstruct the place one day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the air attack, despite some poor weather, the chief target
quickly has become Serbian military and police forces in Kosovo,
NATO and Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have basically shown, through a combination of strikes and
electronic suppression flight tactics, that we can achieve a degree
of air superiority with acceptable risk, which allows us to carry
out our missions as planned, if the weather permits,'' Bacon said.
``We are now beginning to focus more precisely on the troops on the
ground in Kosovo and the troops stationed just outside of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton will fly Thursday to Norfolk, Va.,
to meet families of U.S. sailors and Marines participating in the
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, the White House said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the president's message is expected to be that the
mission will not be a short one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that a knockout punch would not come quickly,'' said
Bacon, one of several NATO and Clinton administration officials who
spoke about the length of the engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to warn everybody against expecting an instant
solution,'' Shea said. ``This situation is complicated. It's been
going on for a long time. It predates the beginning of NATO's air
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the State Department ceremony, spoke about NATO
solidarity and determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allies are united in our outrage over President
Milosevic's atrocities against innocent people,'' Clinton said.
``We are determined to stay with our policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions.'' Clinton
said. ``The NATO air campaign is designed to raise the price of
that policy. For a sustained period, he will see that his military
will be seriously diminished; key military infrastructure
destroyed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Increasingly dejected by the inability of
their dazzling weapons to bring Slobodan Milosevic to heel and stop
the ethnic purge of Kosovo, NATO leaders are wondering, what next?
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president has been impervious to a week-long
battering by cruise missiles, smart bombs, stealth planes,
high-tech bombers and other state-of-the art weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   An armed invasion has been effectively ruled out, NATO officials
said, and the existing strategy has only one more option left --
bombing the Yugoslav president's nerve centers in the heart of
Belgrade, with all the risks that carries of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, NATO's top civilian official said Tuesday,
would be to acknowledge that the basic premise behind the bombing
strategy, that a sufficient show of air power would batter
Milosevich into accepting Western prescriptions for Kosovo, was
fatally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in turn, would mean admitting that the world's most
powerful alliance, with the world's most powerful air force at its
disposal, was helpless to curb the authoritarian leader of a small
Balkan country from killing and victimizing his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have the means to stop it, but we have shown we
have the will to try,'' NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, other allied officials here began talking
privately about the possibility that the bombing strategy might not
work. That was not the view of Gen. Wesley Clark, the top allied
commander, who would not comment Tuesday on reports that he had
requested but not been given permission to strike the ministries in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview, he acknowledged that Milosevic had
proved to be no pushover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up against an intelligent and capable adversary who is
attempting to offset all our strategies,'' General Clark said.
``There are risks and no certainties in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The only certainty, the general said, was that the Serb police
and military forces would continue to be ``attacked, degraded, and
disrupted'' by the bombing unless Milosevic called off the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failure of this strategy so far to check Milosevic,
General Clark maintained a resolute stance. ``The political
consensus is building, political will is building, and resolution
is strengthening,'' he said of the allies.
</P>
<P>
   But with that allied strategy coming under question in many
European media, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov made a
lightning diplomatic mission to Belgrade on Tuesday to see if
Milosevic was ready to talk peace. He was, Primakov reported this
evening to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Bonn, but with
the defiant condition that the allies would first have to stop
bombing. The proposal was summarily rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of the proposals was: Stop NATO attacks first, then
we'll negotiate,'' Schroeder said after the Russian Prime Minister
left Bonn to fly back to Moscow. ``We could not accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the allies where they have been for the past week,
hoping that punishing attacks from the air would persuade Milosevic
that he had no choice but to accept their terms.
</P>
<P>
   But if that did not work, as Solana explained in the interview,
there was little NATO could do except say that at least it had
tried. It was too late, Solana said, for NATO to send in ground
troops to fight the marauding Serbian forces even if any of the
allies wanted to do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not prepared for a force on the ground,'' he said,
except after a peace settlement agreed to by the Serbs. Planning
for a combat operation to fight their way in, he said, would take
time the allies couldn't afford if they hoped to spare further
agony to the civilian population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, from Washington to London, Paris, Bonn and Rome,
President Clinton and other allied leaders have repeatedly promised
their publics that it would never happen.
</P>
<P>
   The only way U.S. and European troops would be prepared to enter
Kosovo, the allies all agree, is as part of an allied peacekeeping
force, with the consent of both the Albanians who live in Kosovo
and the Serbs who rule over it.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's refusal even to discuss peacekeepers dashed American
efforts to mediate such a deal, including an 11th-hour mission to
Belgrade by an American special envoy, Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   But a week ago, they were insisting that Milosevic withdraw his
forces from Kosovo and sign the peace agreement that was worked out
in France last month in negotiations at Rambouillet castle, outside
Paris. The agreement, not accepted by the Serbs, provided for
autonomy for the province, under Serbian rule, for a three-year
transition period, and 28,000 NATO peacekeepers to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Serbs rejected the agreement, Milosevic's forces
stepped up operations in Kosovo, systematically driving Albanians
out of towns and villages. Even as NATO bombs began falling, Serb
army soldiers and police continued laying waste to Albanian
settlements, pushing tens of thousands of people into Albania,
Macedonia, and Montenegro, and leaving the fate of thousands of
others unclear.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Now, Solana said, ``All our energy should be concentrated now on
stopping the killing and helping the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue the bombing until we can guarantee
that the killings stop and will not restart,'' he said. ``The first
objective was always to stop the killing on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solana suggested that the allies might no longer insist that
Milosevic would have to sign the Rambouillet agreement before the
bombing stopped. ``I think the Rambouillet agreement was a good
agreement, and probably the best chance Milosevic had to get a good
agreement, but we will have to see how it evolves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Reuters reported that a White House official
said, ``We wouldn't wait for a signature to stop the bombing
necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   (END TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO diplomats here suggest that so much has happened on
the ground in Kosovo since the Albanian negotiators signed the
accord March 18 that the Rambouillet agreement may no longer be
applicable anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL GRAF FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Far from backing off when the bombs started falling, as he did
four years ago in Bosnia where he showed little evidence of
sentimental attachment to the Bosnian Serb cause, Milosevic is
instead doing his best to turn the bombing to his advantage. The
wholesale flight of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo has led many NATO
officials to suspect that Milosevic's scheme is to claim much of
the province in any future peace deal as Serb-only territory.
</P>
<P>
   (END TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials here are on the defensive, insisting day after
day that it was not their bombing that sparked the Serbian attacks,
or the huge civilian forced exodus from Kosovo, but a long-planned
Serbian ``ethnic cleansing'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a master plan that was conceived and well on its
way to being executed before the first NATO bomb was on its way to
a military target,'' the alliance's spokesman, Jamie Shea, said
Tuesday, comparing the Serb campaign to Stalin's Great Terror purge
in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the alliance's plan was to prevent that scheme and bring
Milosevic to his knees through bombing, it was based on a
misjudgment of his determination.
</P>
<P>
   He caved in Bosnia but, as Holbrooke made clear in his memoir on
that war, Milosevic appeared to have nothing but contempt for
Bosnian Serb leaders and, most importantly, did not feel much
emotional attachment to the lands they were fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly does feel emotionally attached to Kosovo, where he
celebrated the 600th anniversary of a Serb defeat at the hands of
Turkish invaders in 1989 with a ringing appeal to Serbian
nationalism. As President of Serbia then, he also ended the
province's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long the impasse might continue, Solana said that he
was sure the bombing would be over before the planned April 23
start of a summit meeting in Washington to celebrate NATO's 50th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a problem that was created in 24 hours,'' he said,
``and it will not be solved in 24 hours.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Relieving some of the political pressure for
reform, the government released new actuarial studies Tuesday
extending the date at which Medicare can be expected to run out of
money by seven years and Social Security insolvency by two years.
</P>
<P>
   The improved financial position of the Medicare and Social
Security trust funds is largely the result of the strong economy
over the last year, the trustees of the funds said in their annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the latest long-range estimates of factors like
national economic growth, worker productivity, inflation,
unemployment, immigration and birth rates and retirement patterns,
the actuaries still expect the government's two largest programs to
require more tax money or a reduction in benefits as the number of
baby boomers in retirement mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But without any changes in law, the trustees found, the Medicare
system should have enough money to pay full benefits until 2015 and
the Social Security system should be in the black until 2034. Last
year at this time, they projected the insolvency dates to be 2008
for Medicare and 2032 for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in the Rose Garden, President Clinton insisted
that despite the good news, legislation strengthening the programs
should still be enacted this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to make those changes,'' Clinton said. ``Now
when our economy is strong, now when our people have renewed
confidence and now when we have time on our side so that modest
changes today can have major impacts in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans in Congress issued similar statements. ``We
cannot let this good news make us complacent,'' said Sen. William
Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, which
has jurisdiction over Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, economists of all political persuasions generally
agree that the sooner the necessary changes are made to shore up
Social Security and Medicare, the less abrupt and painful those
changes will seem to taxpayers and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But the president and the Republicans who control Congress are
so far apart on how the two programs should be fixed and the
politics of the matter are so delicate that the odds are already
against enactment of comprehensive legislation this year. The
effect of Tuesday's announcement postponing a crisis was to make a
search for compromise less urgent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``These are actuaries from heaven,'' said James A. Thurber,
director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies
at American University here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes pressure off all the players on the Hill and the
president,'' Thurber said, and makes it safe for them to leave the
problem for the next president and the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, the politically savvy lobbyist for the American
Association of Retired Persons, which favors enactment of Social
Security legislation this year, said, ``I'm not going to throw in
the towel.'' After a pause, Rother added, ``Publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The six trustees of the trust funds include three Cabinet
members: Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. The
others are Kenneth S. Apfel, the Social Security commissioner, and
two experts who were appointed by Clinton: Stephen G. Kellison, an
actuary, and Marilyn Moon, an economist who specializes in health
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are political appointees, their annual report is,
by and large, the work of career government actuaries and
economists. The reports were also reviewed by outside actuaries who
signed statements saying the methodology and assumptions were
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The projections that the Medicare fund would be insolvent in
2015 and the Social Security fund in 2034 were based on what the
trustees called an intermediate set of estimates about the economic
and demographic factors.
</P>
<P>
   The economic assumptions were quite conservative. The trustees
estimated, for instance, that economic growth between 2010 and 2050
would average less than 1.5 percent a year. That is approximately
half the average growth rate of the last 75 years, but the trustees
were taking into account the fact that the country's labor force is
not expected to grow as fast in the 21st century as it has in the
20th.
</P>
<P>
   The report offered for comparison's sake two other projections.
One based on less favorable assumptions showed Medicare running out
of money in 2007 and Social Security in 2028. Another based on more
favorable conditions showed that neither program would become
insolvent in the next 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, projections indicated that the
Medicare fund would run out of money in 2001. Shalala said Tuesday
that the improved situation was the result of a stronger economy
and of changes the president and Congress made in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. That law shifted some of the cost of home
health care out of the hospital insurance trust fund and reduced
Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and other health-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 report forecast that Social Security would become
insolvent in 2029. Last year's report said the reserves would be
exhausted in 2032. The brighter picture is almost entirely the
result of the flourishing economy over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Even with reduced pressure to act, the president and Congress
are sure to continue to debate what to do with Social Security and
Medicare _ right through the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Social Security, the president and the
Republicans favor setting aside much of the budget surplus over the
next 15 years to strengthen the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans want to use the money to allow workers to
establish private retirement accounts that they would invest in
stocks and bonds. The president wants to allow some Social Security
money to be invested in the markets, but he would have the
government control the investments.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, Republicans are generally supporting a marketplace
system under which retirees would be given a fixed amount of money
that they could use to buy private health insurance or the
government's program.
</P>
<P>
   The president and most Democrats oppose this idea and favor
setting aside money from the budget surplus to strengthen Medicare
and provide new funds to cover prescription drugs.

REMAKE OF BARD'S CLASSIC DETERIORATES INTO FORMULAIC PAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh woe! Petrucchio and Katherine from Shakespeare's ``The Taming
Of the Shrew'' these kids are not. Yet this modernized version of
the Bard's classic, which has been made into a film five previous
times and was adapted into the musical, ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' by Cole
Porter, certainly has its merits.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it was shot in Seattle and at Tacoma's Stadium High
School, and shows both cities off to their best advantage. But it
doesn't follow Shakespeare's bawdy comedy very closely. It's more
akin to the recent teen angst movie, ``She's All That,'' in which
an unpopular girl is transformed into a beauty and the plot
climaxes with a confrontation at the prom.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Baz Luhrmann's ``Romeo + Juliet'' made a splash at
the box office, the Bard has been fodder for every interpretation
imaginable. There's a version of ``Othello'' called ``O'' in the
works, as well as Ethan Hawke's update of ``Hamlet.'' As a film,
the least popular of Shakespeare's plays, ``Titus Andronicus,''
stars Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins and bears an
ultra-high-tech tone. ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opens in
theaters later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' which starts quite well, owes
more to its adult cast than its teenagers. The quartet of young
talent pales next to Allison Janney as the scene-stealing Ms.
Perky, the libidinous high school guidance counselor, and comic
Larry Miller, who plays Walter Stratford, father to two very
different daughters, Katarina and Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   Katarina (Julia Stiles) is a rebellious, anti-social brain. Her
younger sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), is pretty and popular and
desperately wants to date. But dad has a rule: Bianca can date when
Kat does. With Kat's alienating personality, that doesn't seem
likely any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca hatches a scheme to pair her big sis with an equally
petulant suitor: Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). He's walking bad
news whose reputation precedes him. Was he in prison for a year?
Did he really sell his own liver on the black market? Why is he
always in detention?
</P>
<P>
   He's a perfect match for the dour Kat. With the help of Joey
Donner (Andrew Keegan), a vain egomaniac who wants to date Bianca
for one reason only, the plan is put into action. Joey enlists
Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the boy who really likes Bianca, to
make contact with Patrick. Cash exchanges hands, sparks fly and
Bianca is on her way to the prom and Kat is about to have her
sullen personality re-arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what begins as a rowdy, clever, even a little
racy movie soon deteriorates into formulaic pap. Oleynik and Levitt
have little chemistry or presence and only Julia Stiles, who played
Harrison Ford's daughter in the dismal ``The Devil's Own,'' makes
much of an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Director Gil Junger, who is best known as a TV director of tepid
series such as ``Empty Nest,'' falls into every trap in the teenage
movie genre halfway through. We've seen this stuff in ``16
Candles'' and ``Can't Hardly Wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the film opens with bite and acerbic, scathing wit, it
quickly erodes into mediocrity with its betrayals and romantic
break-ups and predicatable make-ups.
</P>
<P>
   10 Things I Hate About You. Directed by Gil Junger. Written by
Karen McCullah Lutz, Kirsten Smith. Cast: Julia Stiles, Heath
Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Larisa Oleynik. Touchstone Pictures.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin told Russian political leaders
Tuesday that the country ``will not allow itself to be drawn into
military conflict'' in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president's words came at the start of his annual speech to
lawmakers and Cabinet members on the state of the nation. He
presented Russia as a country at a critical and historic juncture,
in danger of being relegated to a second rank of nations if it
failed to overcome its political divisions and economic weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin again condemned the NATO strikes against Yugoslavia,
which in the last week have drawn a belligerent reaction from
Russian opposition leaders. They have called for renewed military
aid to Yugoslavia and for the sending of volunteers to fight on the
Serbs' side in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the president appealed Tuesday for responsible actions,
rather than ``emotional assessments.'' He added, ``More and more
political leaders understand that in such situations brute force
does not achieve anything. Russia has made its choice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin spoke in the Kremlin before both houses of Parliament
and members of his government, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
arrived in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, accompanied by top diplomatic,
military and intelligence officials, on a mission to bring about a
political settlement of the Kosovo warfare.
</P>
<P>
   While the outcome of those talks hung in the balance, Yeltsin
told his audience that in trying to bring peace to the Balkans,
Russia was not neglecting its ``prime duty,'' which he said, ``is
to prevent any discord inside the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our weight in the world arena depends on how we solve our
problems at home,'' he said. ``This means that we need order in
government, accord in society, stability in the economy and the
social sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Yelstin's appeal came as the first wave of anti-Western
outbursts, which peaked on Sunday with the shelling of the American
Embassy here, seemed to be subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of Russia's dependence on international good will,
Primakov on Monday struck an agreement with Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the broad
outlines of a plan to relieve Russia's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   And in Russian newspaper and television reports Tuesday, more
information was provided about the reasons for the mass exodus of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, as refugees gave eyewitness accounts
of being rounded up by Serbian policemen and forced out of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, official Russian spokesmen insisted that the refugees
were fleeing NATO bombs and that reports of ``ethnic cleansing''
were nothing but Western rumors and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a steady voice, Yeltsin described Russia Tuesday as
a country ``stuck halfway'' between two economic systems. ``We've
created a freakish model,'' he said, ``a hybrid of the two
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Primakov-led Cabinet, which he credited with
having stopped an economic downturn, to move ahead with an economic
program. ``It is just six months before the start of elections,''
the president said. ``This time will have to be used not only to
patch up holes. It is high time to identify the new priorities,
chief among them Russia's economic competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the causes of Russia's financial collapse last summer,
he pointed the finger at Parliament's Communist-led lower house,
which he said had sent ``a bad signal to investors'' in rejecting
the government's fiscal program.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other remarks did not go down well with leaders of the
opposition to Yeltsin's government, who criticized the speech for
its empty phrases and finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the old song about how everything was done right and
how the Duma spoiled everything,'' said the Communist Party chief,
Gennadi Zyuganov, using the Russian name for the lower house.
Nikolai Ryzhkov, a former Soviet prime minister, described the
speech as ``absolutely useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin pledged to keep his distance from political battles as
Russia prepares for critical elections, first for Parliament in
December, and next year for the presidency, which he is obliged to
vacate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that clean, unstained people will come to the
new Parliament, not professional patriots but patriotically minded
professionals,'' he said pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to many today that Russia has grown weak, that it
doesn't have the strength even to deal with its own problems, and
therefore one can discount it,'' he said. ``They are mistaken. No
temporary difficulties can put Russia in the category of
second-rate powers.''

   JERUSALEM _ Criticized for his government's muted response to
the expulsion and killings of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday condemned mass murder by
anyone in the conflict and said Israel would send aid to the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of an explicit government condemnation of the
Serbian campaign has set off debate in Israel on the moral
obligation of the Jewish state to speak out against atrocities that
some people say are reminiscent of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the political opposition and some commentators have
argued that the searing Jewish memory of the Holocaust should have
prompted an unambiguous and emphatic Israeli denunciation of
Serbian ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu's words Tuesday were carefully chosen. ``Israel
condemns all mass murder, committed by the Serbs or by any other
element,'' he said. ``We condemn it because of our history and our
moral view.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has also limited himself to a
general denunciation, avoiding expressions of support for the NATO
airstrikes. He said that Israel takes ``a grave view of the
terrible acts there, especially against innocent civilians'' and he
urged an immediate resumption of negotiations. His remarks were
welcomed by the Yugoslav ambassador as an expression of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   There were varying explanations for the cautious Israeli
response. ``The situation there is complex, and we don't want to
take sides,'' said Raanan Gissin, an aide to Sharon. ``It's
simplistic to say that one side is good and the other is bad. We
don't want to get into that. We condemn any genocide and any
attacks on innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Haaretz, citing an unnamed adviser to Sharon, said
that he was in fact motivated by a sense of historic debt to
Yugoslavia, whose partisans helped Jews and fought with them
against the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The paper added that Sharon was apparently also interested in
smoothing Israel's budding relations with Russia, an ally of
Serbia, and that he had rebuffed subordinates who urged him to
explicitly condemn the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Shlomo Avineri, a a former director-general of the Foreign
Ministry, said in a radio interview: ``You can't be neutral between
a murderer and his victim. That's the criticism that we, as Jews,
as Israelis, have always leveled at foreign nations, including the
Swiss.''

REPORT CRITICIZES AIRLINES ON TREATMENT OF THE DISABLED

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disabled air travelers are often mistreated by
airline personnel and denied special accommodations including
access to wheelchairs and escorts in violation of a 1986 law,
according to a report by the National Council on Disability.
</P>
<P>
   The federal advisory agency's report recommends changes in the
law and in enforcement efforts by the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the National Council on Disability, released last
week, said that enforcement of the 1986 law, the Air Carrier Access
Act, was ineffective, that public education efforts on the needs
and legal rights of disabled air travelers was inadequate, and that
there was not enough money or staff at the Department of
Transportation dedicated to investigating complaints.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the council, there are weaknesses in the law
and the fines are not effective. Under the law, the maximum civil
penalty is only $1,100 for each offense.
</P>
<P>
   When an individual files a complaint with the enforcement office
of Transportation Department and the airline responds, the complain
is either dismissed or the department may file its own complaint
against the airline and try to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, an administrative hearing is held. From 1987
to 1998, $28,000 in civil penalties have been imposed on airlines
under the Air Carrier Access Act.
</P>
<P>
   People with disabilities are often unwilling to file a lawsuit,
especially when compensatory damages and even lawyer fees are not
assured. Of 17 formal complaints filed in the last 12 years, a
dozen have garnered a total of less than $150,000 in damages,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Meenan, senior vice president for industry policy at the
Air Transport Association said: ``This is an extensive report
dealing with a wide range of complicated issues. We are very
interested in resolving those concerns regarding air travelers with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The report followed an 18-month review by the council of the
treatment of disabled air travelers. That review revealed serious
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative experiences of disabled travelers go beyond the
typical hassles all air travelers encounter,'' said Marca Bristo,
chairwoman of the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are dropped or mishandled by poorly trained staff who
treat you like an inconvenient piece of luggage, when you can't get
critical information because it is not in an accessible format, you
are left with the feeling that you don't count, that your dignity
as a human being has been violated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first in a series of four that will review
overall enforcement not just transportation of civil rights laws
for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bristo, in her introduction to the report, noted some of the
basic accommodation problems that disabled people face: deaf
travelers who continue to miss flights when last-minute flight and
gate change information is announced only through public address
systems, children with disabilities who are often denied seating
next to companions on whom they rely for assistance and blind or
visually-impaired people who must often request wheelchairs to
obtain assistance or an escort.
</P>
<P>
   For some people with disabilities, ``flying is so unbearable
that any alternative means of transportation will be used,'' Ms.
Bristo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a progress report sent to President Clinton and Congress in
February, a prelude to last week's report, the council found the
the Department of Transportation ``critically lacking in key areas
of compliance monitoring, complaint handling, and leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bristo said, ``Although things have improved since ACAA was
passed in 1986, people with disabilities continue to encounter
frequent, significant violations of their civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the disability council officials did work with
Secretary Rodney E. Slater of the Department of Transportation
during the review. And in a March 18 letter to Ms. Bristo, Slater
wrote that he would ``assure that disabled travelers will not face
discrimination or barriers in using our transportation system.''

RAYTHEON CHIEF WAS PAID $26.8 MILLION FOR SIX MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon chief executive Daniel P. Burnham received about $26.8
million in compensation last year for the six months he worked at
the Lexington, Mass., defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who joined Raytheon July 1, received a salary and bonus
of $1.9 million last year, according to the company's proxy
statement filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. His other compensation included a stock grant worth
$21.8 million, which Burnham will receive over the next seven
years, regardless of how the company's stock performs.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said much of Burnham's pay package replaced
compensation he was to have received at his previous job as vice
chairman of Allied Signal Inc., and was needed to lure him. Toni
Simonetti, Raytheon's spokeswoman, said Burnham's pay should be
weighed against that of chief executives at other large companies.
Compared to them, she said, ``Dan Burnham is a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pay details come at a sensitive time for the company,
which faces accusations that a recent layoff of 1,200 workers
violated the spirit of an agreement under which it obtained a state
tax cut in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Susan Fargo, a Democrat from Lincoln, charged that
the compensation package, and one given to Raytheon chairman Dennis
Picard, showed the company could afford to hire back many
employees. She is sponsoring a bill in the Legislature that in
effect would require it to do so to keep the tax break. ``They're
making out like bandits,'' she said. The company's 1998 executive
pay ``underlines the need for them to do more for their workers,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Simonetti reiterated the company's position that the layoffs are
needed to help it remain competitive with rivals like Boeing Co.
and Lockheed Martin Corp. Asked about Fargo's comments, Simonetti
said, ``I don't see the connection at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham's annual salary was set at $850,000, of which he
received $425,000 after joining Raytheon. He also received a $1.5
million bonus and the $21.8 million in stock awards, most of which
was meant to replace stock benefits he was due to receive at Allied
Signal, Simonetti said. In addition, he received options to buy
250,000 Raytheon shares at set prices, which the company valued at
$2.76 million.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, a compensation expert and critic of executive
pay, said it was ``reasonable'' of Raytheon to compensate Burnham
for benefits he lost by leaving Allied Signal. However, Crystal
said he was surprised by the amount of stock granted to Burnham
outright rather than given as options, whose value depends on
management boosting the company's stock price. ``To pay him that
much strikes me as being rather outlandish,'' Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
   Picard earned $4.5 million in salary and bonus last year. He
also received options to buy 450,000 shares of Raytheon stock at
set rates, which the firm valued at about $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's annual shareholders' meeting will be held April 28 in
Tucson. Shares of Raytheon fell 7/8 to close at 56 7/8 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

U.N. PANEL SEEKS TO EASE SUFFERING OF IRAQ'S PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Concluding that Iraq has gone from ``relative
affluence to massive poverty'' since economic sanctions were
imposed against it after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, a new report to
the Security Council recommends several steps aimed at alleviating
its people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by one of three special panels convened
in January to overcome the political divisions over Iraq on the
Security Council and to help devise a common policy. It did not
recommend that sanctions be lifted, but it did suggest easing them
with specific modifications, some of which the United States said
Tuesday it might oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member panel of senior U.N. officials recommended, for
instance, that oil companies be allowed to invest directly in Iraqi
oil fields to increase Iraq's production, which is currently at 2.5
million barrels of oil per day. This would enable Iraq to free up
funds for food that it now spends buying new oil equipment and
repairing and replacing spare parts in its oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   While Iraq is now permitted, under an oil-for-food program, to
sell $5.256-billion worth of oil every six months and to use some
of the proceeds to alleviate suffering caused by the sanctions, it
has been unable to produce that much, given depressed oil prices
and the state of its fields.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report suggests that the Security Council
authorize foreign companies to invest in Iraqi export industries,
such as fertilizer, sulfur, and dates, that are unrelated to
military production. In both cases, the report states, the added
funds would be monitored by the United Nations to ensure that they
are only used for buying essential goods.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommends that the council consider reducing
temporarily the amount of money that Iraq pays into a fund that
compensates victims of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which also
comes from the oil proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the panel's view that under current conditions the
humanitarian outlook will remain bleak and become more serious with
time,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infant mortality rates in Iraq today are among the highest in
the world,'' it says. ``Low infant birth weight affects at least 23
percent of all births, chronic malnutrition affects every fourth
child under 5 years of age; only 41 percent of the population have
regular access to clean water; 83 percent of all schools need
substantial repairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report added that it would take $7 billion just to bring the
country's power base to generate electricity to where it was before
the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gravity of the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people
is indisputable and cannot be overstated,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was disputed, only hours after Celso L.N. Amorim,
Brazil's representative, who heads all three panels, gave it to the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats noted, for instance, that many of the report's
statistics about the situation of the Iraqi people _ such as infant
mortality rates _ relied heavily on data provided by Iraq, much of
which had not been independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington is concerned about alleviating the suffering,
said A. Peter Burleigh, the American representative, ``the basic
responsibility for their plight lies with Saddam Hussein,'' Iraq's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions were still in place ``because Iraq has not disarmed
itself of weapons of mass destruction'' or honored other
commitments to the United Nations. Several U.N. agencies contend
that Iraq has not spent the money it has on food and medicine, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to ensure that any additional funds for
Iraq would help Iraqis, not their government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Burleigh was not willing to single out the proposals that
troubled him, other American officials cited, for example, the
report's recommendation that contributions to the Iraqi victims'
compensation fund be temporarily reduced, or borrowed to enable
Iraq to buy more goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proposal was sponsored by Britain, America's closest
ally on the council, one official said that the United States might
hesitate to help one group of victims, the Iraqi people, at the
expense of another _ people from many different countries who were
working in Iraq when it invaded Kuwait.

350 US SOLDIERS FIND THEMSELVES CLOSE TO WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETROVEC, Macedonia _ If Sergeant William Ellis needed any
reminder that he was in one of the most dangerous corners of the
world, one slammed into a hillside a few miles from the ridge where
he and other members of the 1st Squadron of the 4th US Cavalry were
standing Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Two cruise missiles, fired by NATO forces, exploded into the
forest of southern Kosovo, where Serb troops may or may not have
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that loud,'' Ellis said nonchalantly. ``They were
pretty far away.''
</P>
<P>
   But, suddenly, the 350 US troops here at Camp Able Sentry, not
far from the Kosovo border, find themselves close to the cutting
edge of a Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from 100 US Marines temporarily guarding the US Embassy in
the Macedonian capital of Skopje, the Army soldiers and airmen at
Camp Able Sentry are the only US troops on the ground near Kosovo.
Since the NATO bombing began, they have dropped their roles as UN
border observers to become responsible for protecting some 11,000
NATO troops on the ground in Macedonia from Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   At this former Yugoslav air base, they are literally peeling the
blue UN patches off their uniforms and repainting their armored
vehicles standard Army green from UN white.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they have assumed a position of importance in much
greater proportion to their numbers or military capabilities. The
British, French, German, Italian, and Dutch soldiers who have been
here for the past month believe the presence of the Americans
deters even further the threat of a Serb attack.
</P>
<P>
   The American commander, Lieutenant Colonel James Shufelt Jr.,
acknowledged as much Tuesday, sitting in his office, the constant
drone of CNN in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at risk. If they decide to hit us, we're in range,''
Shufelt said. ``I don't think they'll do that. But we're ready if
it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, there will be hell to pay, soldiers at Camp Able
Sentry say. It is an opinion informed not so much by swagger as by
the belief that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has already
realized his mistake in defying the Western powers, and that he'd
be, as one soldier put it, ``crazy to make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and airmen here are well aware of geopolitics.
Since 1993, their mission here had been to man the observation
posts along the Macedonian border with Kosovo. Although troops from
Nordic countries carried out the same duties, it was the American
presence that provided the ultimate deterrent to Milosevic trying
to recapture Macedonia, which quit the Yugoslav Federation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the squadron is available to provide protection
to the NATO forces here is because the Chinese, as members of the
UN Security Council, vetoed renewing the squadron's mission in
retaliation for Macedonia's recognizing Taiwan. The squadron took
up their new duties the day the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Harking back to their frontier origins, cavalry soldiers are
known in military parlance as scouts, surreptitiously checking
enemy positions. While they do that, they also keep alert for Serb
sympathizers who regularly stone their vehicles as they drive
through Serb strongholds in Macedonia, such as Kumanovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three weeks, we saw more than we did in the
previous three years,'' said Shufelt. ``Before, you'd see a
smuggler with three mules. A few weeks ago, we saw the Yugoslavs
put a battalion of 500 to 600 men into position. They wanted us to
see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombing began, Camp Able Sentry has gone on
heightened alert. Soldiers are required to wear their flak jackets
and helmets, and to always have their weapon at their side.
Tuesday, soldiers walked to and from the 24-hour gym, equipped with
treadmills and two full-length basketball courts, their M-16 rifles
at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Kimberly Nash, 24, a self-described Army brat
from Kansas, said soldiers call their state of readiness ``full
battle rattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, a West Point graduate and three-year veteran of the Army,
said there is little nervousness, despite being within easy
striking distance of the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick on Americans, you'll have a whole lot of mad coming
down on you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant James Tighe, a Massachusetts native, is
similarly convinced that the Serbs would be foolish to fire across
the border. Still, Tighe said his fiancee worries about him.
</P>
<P>
   Tighe, 24, a platoon leader who flies Blackhawk helicopters,
said he knows that his aunts and uncles back in Massachusetts watch
the news and see a threat that he thinks is not there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tighe said he just finished reading a book on the Balkans
and was overwhelmed by the history of conflict, and how it was
still playing out centuries later. He said he is bothered by the
pictures of refugees fleeing Kosovo and wishes he could do more to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sitting here, eating chow, we have shelter, and you see
these people with absolutely nothing, running for their lives,'' he
said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   US soldiers admit they cannot fathom the depths of hatred that
fuel the perpetual instability of the Balkans. One of them who
can't understand it is Specialist Bounheng Insisiengmay, 23, from
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Insisiengmay is the son of Laotian immigrants. One generation
after Americans bombed his parents' country, he was among the first
20 American soldiers to restore order at the US Embassy in Skopje
after it was attacked by Serb sympathizers last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have to do here,'' Insisiengmay said, wearing
gym clothes and carrying his M-16 after a weightlifting workout.
``We're ready.''

 Column: Robertson Stephens Snatches a Bevy of Bankers
From  Montgomery 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
And now for another edition of ``As the Investment Banks Churn.''
</P>
<P>
   In our latest installment, it is NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities' turn, yet again, to be raided. BancBoston Robertson
Stephens (soon to be plain ol' Robertson Stephens after Fleet
Financial finalizes its purchase of BankBoston) is hiring away a
top-producing team of private bankers from BankAmerica's Montgomery
unit, says managing director Joe Piazza, who heads Robertson
Stephens' financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hired a group of people that have worked together for a
number of years, (and) they are substantial producers,'' says
Piazza, who was hired in November to build Robertson Stephens'
nascent private banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Montgomery founder Thom Weisel left the bank in
September, the BankAmerica unit has been roiling. Various bankers,
brokers and financial analysts have been abandoning ship as
Montgomery's new management under BankAmerica attempts to chart a
new course.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latest group of defectors is Robert Tishman, a
seven-year Montgomery veteran who will stay in Boston and manage
Robertson Stephens' private client business there. A senior
managing director at Montgomery, he is being brought on board as a
managing director at Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Tishman in the switch from Montgomery is John Schnugg,
who also was hired as a managing director. Schnugg will work in San
Francisco with two other former Montgomery colleagues, Matthew
Klein and Michael Vigo. Together, the three bring more than 30
years of Montgomery experience with them.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, Andrew Blau, a 10-year veteran of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is being hired to run the division's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens' Piazza is no stranger to the Montgomery
crew. He built that bank's private client business during his
five-year stint at Montgomery earlier this decade. Piazza, who
spent three years with ING Barings between his Montgomery job and
current post, says if his new hires produce at the levels they did
at their previous employers, Robertson Stephens' financial services
unit should see a 75 percent increase in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The entire private banking services sector is on fire. It
targets high net-worth individuals who are often top officers of
companies that they run or helped start. With so much personal
wealth being created in the stock market, investment banks are
trying to persuade their corporate customers to also do their
personal banking with them or consult them on such things as
employee stock plans.
</P>
<P>
   To put it succinctly, ``we want to be all things to certain
people,'' Piazza says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAT FEES &LR; : CS First Boston expects to rack up some sweet fees
for being the sole adviser on Computer Associates' proposed $3.5
billion cash purchase of Platinum Technology.
</P>
<P>
   CS First Boston's technology group, which is led by Frank
Quattrone, is expected to grab more than $20 million in advisory
fees from the deal, investment bankers say. The acquisition is
billed as the largest (non-Internet) software transaction ever.
</P>
<P>
   While Platinum was advised by CS First Boston, Computer
Associates negotiated without a Wall Street banker. However, CS
First Boston was the only underwriter of a $4.5 billion credit line
for Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Is it rare to double dip in the M&AMP;A advisory game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen every day of the week,'' notes Joe
Josephson, a CS First Boston banker who worked on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROUND THREE: &LR;  Looksmart of San Francisco, an Internet
directory, has completed its third round of funding _ a $60 million
private equity placement. Looksmart says it's the largest amount
ever raised by a private Internet media company, bringing the
company's funding to $79.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the most recent round include: Amerindo Investment
Advisors, Citicorp Equity Capital, Cox Interactive Media, Essex
Investment Management, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, Macquarie Bank (an
Australian investment bank that acted as an adviser), New
Millennium Partners and Sand Hill Capital.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IPO CANAPE: &LR;  Is hedge-fund manager Jim Cramer setting the table
for Goldman Sachs' initial public offering?
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, yes. Cramer is the co-founder of TheStreet.com
financial Web site, which is expected to go public this spring. As
it turns out, TheStreet's shares are slated to get priced during
the week of April 26, according to SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs, the lead manager in TheStreet's offering, is
expected to take itself public just about a week after Cramer's
venture floats its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like a little Internet hors d'oeuvre to whet Wall
Street's appetite prior to the main course, eh?

   DONATIONS MADE ON LINE MAKE IT TO CHARITIES
</P>
<P>
   In a new twist on Internet commerce, at least a half-dozen Web
sites are offering to sell goods to online shoppers and send a
portion of the purchase price to charity. Although the sums have
been modest thus far, many charities see it as an important
fund-raising development. But it is impossible to know in every
case what happens to the few dollars that customers thought were
going to a good cause. Though many charities are getting checks
directly from the sites, money may not end up in the charity's
hands as fast as shoppers might imagine _ if at all.

   NO PLANS FOR RENAULT NAME IN U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Having agreed last week to buy a little more than a third of
Nissan Motor, Renault may start selling Renault cars under the
Nissan name in the United States someday. But it has no plans to
revive the Renault name in the American market because its
reputation is so weak, the company's chairman and chief executive,
Louis Schweitzer, said at the New York International Auto Show.

 Power Deregulation _ A Year Later
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
California entered uncharted waters one year ago today, when it
deregulated the electric industry and let an open market set
competitive prices for power.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge undertaking. Lawmakers cast aside the tightly
regulated system in which utilities built and operated power plants
and had exclusive access to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, they created a system that dispersed power plant
ownership, put control of the electricity superhighway in the hands
of a disinterested third party and created an open auction where
power can be purchased at the lowest price. For the first time
since the industry's earliest days, consumers can pick their own
power suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Mainline utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. were
reduced to power-delivery companies and their unregulated sister
companies went on a power plant buying binge in other deregulated
states.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants feel the first year went remarkably well _
``especially if you remember the objective was to get the new
system up and running and seek perfection later,'' says Gordon
Smith, chief executive of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary, the unabashed goals of the bold move _
lower prices for all, greater reliability and robust technical
innovation _ are within reach. However, observers now think it was
unrealistic to expect to achieve the desired end without perfecting
the means.
</P>
<P>
   What's clear is that the tool for change, the state's 1996
deregulation law, was less a blueprint than an Etch-a-Sketch.
Deregulation still is very much a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The new system has worked flawlessly from an engineering
standpoint. Getting a smooth-running market has been trickier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want things to be perfect from the start but we don't have
a finished product yet,'' says state Senator Steve Peace, D-El
Cajon (San Diego County), one of the authors of California's
deregulation law. ``Even so, it's been a spectacular success.''
</P>
<P>
   On the price front, results are mixed. &LR;   &LR; Small consumers got a
10 percent rate cut 15 months ago, but it was achieved by
refinancing their share of utility debts.
</P>
<P>
   Only green marketers have gone after small consumers in
meaningful numbers, and they've been surprised by how slowly the
market has developed. Only 1 percent of residential customers have
switched suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a `California effect' that would supercharge the
green power movement and sweep across the country,'' says Kevin
Hartley, an executive vice president at Green Mountain Energy, the
biggest marketer of renewable power. ``We've learned that we have
to convince people to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, green power cost 10 to 20 percent more than generic
power. Last week, Green Mountain said it would begin selling its
power at a 5 percent discount to generic power.
</P>
<P>
   Green devotees think that will catalyze consumers and make it
easier to ``aggregate'' or combine the load of many small users
under a single contract. The Episcopal Diocese of California, for
example, is negotiating for the best deal, right now, that it can
take to its 87 Bay Area churches and 15,000 parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches aren't wealthy institutions. The fact that prices are
coming down helps,'' says the Rev. Sally Bingham, head of
environmental ministries at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Big users haven't needed much convincing to switch. They have
had plenty of companies offering them volume discounts. Nobody
knows how much money big users have saved, since most contracts are
confidential, but 1,000 industrial customers representing 30
percent of the state's industrial load have switched so far.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, utilities have divested $3 billion worth of power
plants at prices that far exceeded expectations. That's
significant, since _ dollar for dollar _ the money obtained through
asset sales reduces the utility debt that ratepayers must shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Asset sales have gone so well, in fact, that San Diego Gas &AMP;
Electric Co. says it expects to lower rates 20 percent for its
customers this summer, a year earlier than policymakers expected.
</P>
<P>
   With electricity now a market-based commodity, power generating
companies are rushing to build new plants. Twenty plant proposals
have come forward. That's more in-state generation than has been
planned in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing things are happening,'' says Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning economist whose latest book, ``The Commanding
Heights,'' recounts the rejection of centrally planned economies
around the globe for free markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most complex industry to go through the hard
process of becoming market-based,'' says Yergin. ``Since it
controlled 10 percent of all the fixed assets in this country, the
legacy of New Deal regulation persisted longer than in any other
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The inefficient system set aside was one in which consumers paid
a hand-picked group of utility generators whatever it cost them to
make electricity. That ``cost of service'' regulation meant
consumers paid for botched projects like PG&AMP;E's Diablo Canyon
nuclear plant with $5 billion worth of cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, if huge mistakes are made in the future, it'll be
investors who bear the cost, not ratepayers,'' says Alfred E. Kahn,
the ``father of deregulation'' and Cornell University economist
who's been watching California's grand experiment with keen
interest.
</P>
<P>
   That experiment has resulted in the expenditure of $400 million
to create two new power agencies to run the state's high-voltage
transmission grid and conduct a daily electricity auction. For both
the Independent System Operator in Folsom (Sacramento County) and
the Power Exchange in Pasadena (Los Angeles County), the mandate is
to ensure fair competition and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Just how well the market is working is debatable. Prices at the
Power Exchange appear slightly high. An analysis by economists at
the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley
concluded that prices have been 17 percent higher than what a truly
competitive market would have offered. The report says that
resulted in a $500 million windfall to generators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's unclear whether that's due to a market power problem
posed by having too few bidders or the inexperience of market
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Power generators, who once produced electricity with little
concern for costs, now must decide how to price their product and
where to sell it _ a daily market, an hourly spot market, an
emergency market or a soon-to-be-launched futures market.
</P>
<P>
   Even designers of this new market now see that electricity is
unlike any other commodity. Unlike corn and wheat, electricity
can't be stored in a silo. It must be consumed when it's created.
There aren't ready substitutes and demand doesn't track prices, at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Without a good model from other commodity markets, the designers
are trying to fashion one that works for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people went into deregulation thinking electricity
was just another commodity,'' says Severin Borenstein, head of the
Energy Institute at UC Berkeley and a member of the power auction's
governing board. ``It turns out it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When market problems are identified, it's hard to make fixes
since there's no longer a single central regulator like the state
Public Utilities Commission that is in charge. Rules governing the
operations of the Power Exchange and Independent System Operator
are created by the organizations' governing boards that seek
consensus among 25 to 30 members and then must garner approval of
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates
interstate power sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although the boards are balanced to represent different
interests _ utilities, generators, power marketers and consumers _
the consensus approach has slowed the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have people benefiting from flaws in the market who
have great ability to slow down fixes,'' says Mike Florio, an
attorney for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network in San
Francisco and a member of both boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The composition of these boards has me concerned,'' says state
Senator Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County), chair
of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. ``I'm
leaning toward believing there's too much industry involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many participants believe that, given time, these issues will be
resolved. Both agencies _ the ISO and Power Exchange -_are engaged
in talks with neighboring states to see about expanding their reach
to become regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had one year of a market versus 100 years of
regulation,'' says Elena Schmid, a supervisor in the PUC's Office
of Ratepayer Advocates and a member of the ISO board.
``Participation of so many players is messy. It was easier when
regulators were making the calls. But a variety of players will
mean a variety of choices for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the markets are perfected, big questions remain about
where the industry is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-mergers are a strong possibility in America's largest
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fragmented industry,'' says Kenneth Lay, chairman
of Enron Corp. of Houston, the biggest marketer of electricity in
America. ``Name me another major industry with 300 major players.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the potential for unlimited profits in a deregulated
market, unregulated affiliates of utilities are shopping for
divested plants. Last week, an affiliate of Southern California
Edison agreed to pay a staggering $5 billion for the cast-off
plants of Commonwealth Edison in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   US Generating Co., an affiliate of Pacific Gas and Electric,
already has bought &UR;  &LR; $1.6 billion worth of New England power plants
and is angling to buy the utility's vast hydroelectric generating
system in California.
</P>
<P>
   Power companies aren't the only ones sorting out what their
roles are in the new marketplace. State regulators are trying to
figure out what authority is left to them and how best to regulate
the commodity that doesn't act like other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is grappling with what the role should be of the
state PUC, the California Energy Commission and the new power
agencies. Peace, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is
conducting hearings to clarify future roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we need a merger or something between some of
these agencies,'' says Peace. ``What you don't want is a lot of
agencies only able to tackle little pieces of a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much in motion, some consumer advocates worry about the
voyage on which California has embarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it looks like utilities are on a luxury cruise,''
says Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN. ``Meanwhile, small
consumers are on a raft with a small-craft warning up ahead.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After pounding Serb targets for seven days, NATO
officials admitted Tuesday that they were shocked and surprised by
the continuing atrocities ravaging Kosovo, warning grimly that
there was no quick military solution to the humanitarian
catastrophe unfolding there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have anticipated that it would be
quite as bad as it seems now to be becoming,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters in Brussels, as hordes of horrified and weary
refugees streamed toward the borders of neighboring countries. ``I
think we can talk about a modern-day Great Terror going on in
Kosovo at the moment,'' Shea said, in a reference to purges by
Joseph Stalin that left some 2 million Russians dead six decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing their campaign of violence, pillage and destruction to
the heart of Kosovo, Serb troops and special police forced
thousands of ethnic Albanians to abandon their homes in the
provincial capital of Pristina, even as around-the-clock NATO air
strikes punched at the forces underpinning the repression.
</P>
<P>
   As the air assault entered its second week, however, U.S. and
NATO officials conceded that poor weather, difficult terrain and
the threat of Serb air defenses continued to hamper the mission,
forcing bombing runs to be scuttled in mid-air and blunting the
effectiveness of high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never supposed or reported that we had a silver bullet that
would bring this to a halt,'' asserted U.S. Naval Vice Adm. Scott
Fry, director of operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be hard,'' Fry told reporters at the
Pentagon. ``We are grinding it out.''
</P>
<P>
   With a NATO victory not yet in sight, President Clinton told the
nation to brace for ``a sustained period'' of continuing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the 19-member NATO alliance to stick with the
mission, saying the wholesale persecution of Albanians since the
allied attacks began has only underscored the necessity of striking
the forces commanded by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions,'' Clinton
said. ``We must remain steady and determined with the will to see
this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, military officials said future strikes would
bear down increasingly on the individual troops and tanks carrying
out the hostilities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In strikes Monday and Tuesday, NATO warplanes bombed Serb army
garrisons in Pristina, army barracks just north of Kosovo and an
array of fuel and ammo depots scattered across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and London showed reporters images of
the Pristina headquarters for the Serb special police and also for
the army, both of which have conducted brutal campaigns against
ethnic Albanians. Both headquarters operations appeared to be
destroyed by coordinated strikes from multiple NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of treatment which Milosevic can now
increasingly expect,'' said Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of
staff for the British Defense Agency. ``The focus of the air
strikes has now shifted firmly towards military forces in Kosovo
and the facilities directly supporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officers said, however, that heavy cloud cover
and the continuing threat of Serb air defenses had seriously
compromised the pace of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying U.S. A-10 tank busters, for instance, flew missions
Monday night but returned without firing on their targets, said
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots have at times been unable to fire laser-guided
bombs, which perform poorly in cloudy conditions, out of fear of
unleashing a bomb that could land wide of its target and perhaps
injure civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying Harrier attack jets were able to strike their targets
on only two nights out of the first six of the campaign, British
officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart technology is affected by poor weather, and we have
had a run of very poor weather,'' Guthrie told reporters in London.
``What we do not want to do is to create any more collateral damage
than we have, we do not want to kill innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing as ``unacceptable'' a tepid Russian-brokered offer by
Milosevic to talk peace in exchange for a halt in the bombing,
Clinton instead upped the diplomatic ante for Belgrade, saying
Milosevic risks losing Kosovo altogether by persevering with a
military sweep that has put an estimated 600,000 ethnic Albanians
to flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sustained period, he will see that his military will be
seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the
prospect of international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo
increasingly jeopardized,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to independence for
Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million, 90 percent of whom are ethnic
Albanians, in southern Serbia, and State Department spokesman James
Rubin stressed that this position hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, however, were clearly meant to send the
message to Milosevic that the longer he stands up to NATO, the
greater the chance that his defiance and oppression will ultimately
cost him the province at the center of his dispute with the
powerful U.S. and European alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for NATO tenacity -- made during a State
Department ceremony to unveil a portrait of former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher -- echoed earlier statements from the
British government, in what appeared to be a coordinated effort to
demonstrate NATO unity and resolve in the face of a difficult and
widening air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has got the determination and the stomach to see this
through,'' British Defense Secretary George Robertson assured
reporters in London. ``The killing fields of Kosovo are not going
to remain as some memorial for Milosevic to sneer over, and we are
determined to make sure that the violence is stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robertson and Clinton spoke, however, much of Kosovo was in
flames. Serb troops under Milosevic's command were pressing forward
with a concerted program of terror that invited flashbacks to the 3
1/2-year war between Serbs and non-Serbs in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials displayed intelligence photographs of
buildings burning near the town of Brestovac, where special Serb
police units were active, and Dobrido, where Serb army troops were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Other images were shown documenting the forced evacuation of
towns and villages across a wide swath of north-central Kosovo,
where fleeing civilians left their homes to be destroyed by the
torches of Serb forces, and of similar activities near towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   NATO received unconfirmed reports of artillery and tank attacks
on large groups of refugees fleeing toward the Albanian border from
population centers in southwest Kosovo. By late Tuesday, U.S.
officials said they could not confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told by tens of thousands of fleeing refugees,
however, are being largely confirmed through intelligence sources
-- U.S. spy satellites and three high-altitude U-2 spy planes are
actively monitoring the region, as are, presumably, U.S. and NATO
contacts on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the evidence points to a catastrophe of epic
proportions unfolding across the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know President Milosevic's record, but I think that
even we have been shocked by the sheer proportions of what we see
happening in Kosovo today,'' Shea, told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whole towns and villages, tanks are first surrounding the
site, then paramilitaries are going in, rounding up civilians at
gunpoint, separating young men from women and children,'' Shea
said, describing in hauntingly familiar detail a reprise of the
pattern Serb troops and paramilitary thugs used to force an
estimated 3 million Muslims and Croats from their homes during the
civil war in Bosnia. ``The women and children are then expelled
from their homes and then sent towards the border. And after they
have left, the villages, the towns, the homes, are looted and then
systematically torched.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said the movements of ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo and
along its borders had become so widespread and frenetic that
accurate numbers on displaced people were no longer attainable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated, however, that roughly 94,000 ethnic
Albanians had fled the country just since the NATO air strikes
began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimated -- guessed, really -- that nearly 600,000
Kosovar Albanians have been displaced in 15 months of conflict.
Roughly half are believed to be hiding inside Kosovo or desperately
trying to get out, and the rest have made their way to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we haven't seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the mid
1970s,'' Shea said.

   Low-flying Harrier attack jets were able to strike their targets
on only two nights out of the first six of the campaign, British
officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart technology is affected by poor weather, and we have
had a run of very poor weather,'' Guthrie told reporters in London.
``What we do not want to do is to create any more collateral damage
than we have, we do not want to kill innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing as ``unacceptable'' a tepid Russian-brokered offer by
Milosevic to talk peace in exchange for a halt in the bombing,
Clinton instead upped the diplomatic ante for Belgrade, saying
Milosevic risks losing Kosovo altogether by persevering with a
military sweep that has put an estimated 600,000 ethnic Albanians
to flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sustained period, he will see that his military will be
seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the
prospect of international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo
increasingly jeopardized,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to independence for
Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million, 90 percent of whom are ethnic
Albanians, in southern Serbia, and State Department spokesman James
Rubin stressed that this position hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, however, were clearly meant to send the
message to Milosevic that the longer he stands up to NATO, the
greater the chance that his defiance and oppression will ultimately
cost him the province at the center of his dispute with the
powerful U.S. and European alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for NATO tenacity -- made during a State
Department ceremony to unveil a portrait of former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher -- echoed earlier statements from the
British government, in what appeared to be a coordinated effort to
demonstrate NATO unity and resolve in the face of a difficult and
widening air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has got the determination and the stomach to see this
through,'' British Defense Secretary George Robertson assured
reporters in London. ``The killing fields of Kosovo are not going
to remain as some memorial for Milosevic to sneer over, and we are
determined to make sure that the violence is stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robertson and Clinton spoke, however, much of Kosovo was in
flames. Serb troops under Milosevic's command were pressing forward
with a concerted program of terror that invited flashbacks to the 3
1/2-year war between Serbs and non-Serbs in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials displayed intelligence photographs of
buildings burning near the town of Brestovac, where special Serb
police units were active, and Dobrido, where Serb army troops were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Other images were shown documenting the forced evacuation of
towns and villages across a wide swath of north-central Kosovo,
where fleeing civilians left their homes to be destroyed by the
torches of Serb forces, and of similar activities near towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   NATO received unconfirmed reports of artillery and tank attacks
on large groups of refugees fleeing toward the Albanian border from
population centers in southwest Kosovo. By late Tuesday, U.S.
officials said they could not confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told by tens of thousands of fleeing refugees,
however, are being largely confirmed through intelligence sources
-- U.S. spy satellites and three high-altitude U-2 spy planes are
actively monitoring the region, as are, presumably, U.S. and NATO
contacts on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the evidence points to a catastrophe of epic
proportions unfolding across the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know President Milosevic's record, but I think that
even we have been shocked by the sheer proportions of what we see
happening in Kosovo today,'' Shea, told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whole towns and villages, tanks are first surrounding the
site, then paramilitaries are going in, rounding up civilians at
gunpoint, separating young men from women and children,'' Shea
said, describing in hauntingly familiar detail a reprise of the
pattern Serb troops and paramilitary thugs used to force an
estimated 3 million Muslims and Croats from their homes during the
civil war in Bosnia. ``The women and children are then expelled
from their homes and then sent towards the border. And after they
have left, the villages, the towns, the homes, are looted and then
systematically torched.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said the movements of ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo and
along its borders had become so widespread and frenetic that
accurate numbers on displaced people were no longer attainable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated, however, that roughly 94,000 ethnic
Albanians had fled the country just since the NATO air strikes
began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimated -- guessed, really -- that nearly 600,000
Kosovar Albanians have been displaced in 15 months of conflict.
Roughly half are believed to be hiding inside Kosovo or desperately
trying to get out, and the rest have made their way to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we haven't seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the mid
1970s,'' Shea said.

JOE WILLIAMS, 80, URBANE JAZZ SINGER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Williams, whose urbane bass-baritone and suavely heartbroken
songs made him one of the most important singers in jazz, died on
Monday in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Williams collapsed on a city street a few blocks from his home
after walking out of Sunrise Hospital, where he had been admitted
last week for a respiratory ailment. The hospital had reported him
missing several hours before his body was found. ``He's an adult
and chose to leave,'' Ann Lynch, vice president for human services
at the hospital, said. ``We don't confine people here. Upon finding
him missing, the facility was checked, and then the police were
notified to continue the search.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Flud, the Clark County Coroner, said Williams had apparently
died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   As a blues and ballad singer, Williams was widely admired for
his heartfelt tone and impeccable timing. ``He sang real soul blues
on which his perfect enunciation of the words gave the blues a new
dimension,'' Duke Ellington wrote in his autobiography, ``Music Is
My Mistress.'' ``All the accents were in the right places and on
the right words.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams traded supple syncopations with big bands and small
groups and gave ballads a tender authority; his voice could also
reach raw blue notes and breaking, ululating inflections that
harked back to the music's African roots. As the singer with the
Count Basie Orchestra in the 1950s, he carried the group to its
commercial peak, beginning with what became his signature song,
Memphis Slim's ``Every Day (I Have the Blues).''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought the blues from the country to the city,'' the jazz
singer Cassandra Wilson said on Tuesday. ``His voice is rich and
it's bittersweet, but it's a very composed sound. Everything is
well-formed in his mind before he opens his mouth, and it's
flawlessly executed. He reminds me of autumn. His voice is bronze
and burnt sienna and golden, warm and enveloping, just an
incredible instrument. It's a life's work to create that kind of a
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams reached his broadest audience in the 1980s with
occasional television appearances on ``The Cosby Show'' as Grandpa
Al, whose reminiscences about Chicago were often drawn from his own
life. But his recording career continued into the 1990s. His album
``Nothin' but the Blues'' (Delos) won him a Grammy Award in 1984 as
best jazz vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   He was named Joseph Goreed when he was born to a teen-aged
mother on Dec. 12, 1918, in the small town of Cordele, Ga. When he
was 3, his grandmother took him to Chicago, where his mother had
gone to work as a cook; he lived with his mother and aunt, who both
played the piano. He sang in church, learned some piano and
listened to jazz and opera on the radio, particularly to Ethel
Waters, whose precise diction and deep emotion left a lasting
impression on his style.
</P>
<P>
   He started singing with a teen-aged gospel quartet, the Jubilee
Boys, when he was 14. A year later, he was found to have
tuberculosis and had to have a lung collapsed for treatment, but
his voice was undamaged. At 16, he got his first job as a pop
singer, performing for an all-white audience in a club called Kitty
Davis', where he cleaned latrines and sang for tips. He dropped out
of high school to work and changed his last name to Williams. He
sang in clubs around Chicago with bands led by Joe Long and Erskine
Tate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Williams joined the band led by the clarinetist Jimmie
Noone, which was broadcast nationally on the CBS network. He toured
the Midwest with the Les Hite band between stints with Noone, and
in 1941 he joined the Coleman Hawkins big band, which dissolved in
1942. For steady work, Williams became the stage doorman at the
Regal Theater in Chicago, where he met the leading musicians on the
jazz and rhythm-and-blues circuit. He joined the Lionel Hampton
band during its engagement there, working alongside Dinah
Washington, and went on to tour with the band. He sat in for six
weeks, replacing Big Joe Turner, in a blues show with Pete Johnson
and Albert Ammons, and went on to join Andy Kirk's big band.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He was married twice in the 1940s: to Wilma Cole from 1943 to
1946 and to Ann Kirksey from 1946 to 1950. Williams suffered a
nervous breakdown in 1947, and spent a year in a state hospital. He
then sold Fuller Cosmetics door to door before returning to
performing. He worked around Chicago, building a strong local
reputation at the Club DeLisa, and sang with George Shearing's
quintet. He married Lemma Reid in 1951, but that marriage foundered
after the birth of their daughter, JoAnn, in 1953; after years of
separation, they were divorced in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sat in regularly with a septet led by Count Basie when
it came to Chicago in 1950. Four years later, Basie had put
together a new big band, and after it came through Chicago, Basie
invited Williams to join. He became a member of the band on
Christmas Day in 1954. ``He told me he couldn't pay me what I was
worth,'' Williams said in an interview with The New Yorker, ``but
as things got better for him they would get better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got better quickly. Williams chose not to sing material
associated with the Basie band's former vocalist, Jimmy Rushing,
and introduced his own blues repertory. He had been singing ``Every
Day (I Have the Blues)'' in his club dates, bringing sets to a peak
with its mournful incantations. He had recorded it in 1951, backed
by a Chicago band, and it became a local hit. In 1955, he recorded
a new version, arranged by Ernie Wilkins, that became the Count
Basie Orchestra's first major hit in 15 years; it appeared on the
album, ``Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings'' (Verve). He made
his first network television appearance on CBS's ``Music 55.'' With
the Basie band, he toured the United States and Europe, sometimes
singing alongside Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald; he also made
albums on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, the Basie band became the first black performers to
appear at the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf-Astoria. There,
Williams met an Englishwoman, Jillean Hughes-D'Aeth, whom he went
on to marry in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His vocal style was changing. When he began singing, he often
performed without amplification, belting above the band. But during
his years with the Basie band, he listened to tape recordings of
his nightly performances, and he honed his style, paring away
nonessentials, improving his intonation and adding new subtleties.
His role with the Basie band was as a blues singer, but he was
increasingly drawn to ballads.
</P>
<P>
   By 1960, Williams was losing interest in the routine of the
Basie band. Basie agreed to let him go and offered strategic career
advice. After playing a final engagement with the Count Basie Band
in January 1961, Williams embraced Basie on the stage at the Apollo
Theater in Harlem _ they had never even shaken hands before _ and
started his solo career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams formed a small group featuring the trumpeter Harry
(Sweets) Edison, who had been a Basie band member. While many jazz
musicians struggled in the 1960s as rock took over popular music,
Williams worked steadily. He appeared frequently on television
shows, notably the ``Tonight'' show with Johnny Carson. He settled
in Las Vegas with his wife, though he was on the road about 40
weeks a year, usually working with small groups. Through the years,
his accompanists included the pianists Junior Mance, Ellis Larkins
and Norman Simmons. Williams also worked during the 1960s with the
Thad Jones-Mel Lewis band.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he collaborated with the saxophonist Julian
(Cannonball) Adderley on the album ``Joe Williams Live'' and he
sang the role of John Henry in ``Big Man,'' Adderley's ``folk
musical.'' He reunited with the Count Basie Orchestra in 1974 for a
Newport Jazz Festival concert in New York City that drew rave
reviews and appeared frequently with the group until Basie's death
in 1984. In 1978 and 1979, Williams and the trumpeter Clark Terry
toured Africa, sponsored by the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Williams toured with Edison and other Basie
alumni, as well as with his own trio. His star was placed next to
Basie's on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983, and in 1984, he sang
Duke Ellington's ``Come Sunday'' to a hushed crowd at Basie's
funeral. In 1989, he had his own tribute concert as part of the JVC
Jazz Festival, backed by Frank Foster conducting the Count Basie
Orchestra. In 1992, ``Every Day (I Have the Blues)'' was added to
the Grammy Awards Hall of Fame for recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recorded in the 1980s for Verve and in the 1990s for
Telarc Records; his last album, a set of spirituals called ``Feel
the Spirit'' (Telarc), was released in 1995. More recently, he
recorded duets with a young singer, Nicole Yarling, for the
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild label; they have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Well into the 1990s, Williams was one of the most dependably
moving performers in jazz. Standing nearly still, perhaps with his
hands folded in front of him, he would make ballads sound like
resonant, intimate conversation, then open up a blues with a voice
that was both knowing and heartsick. ``There is nothing wrong,'' he
told an interviewer, ``with singing a song the way it is written,
with making a song say, `Please like me.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and daughter.

US SOCIAL PROGRAMS GET A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social Security and Medicare will run out of money
later than previously projected, trustees of the two programs said
Tuesday in a report that could take pressure off Congress to enact
money-saving reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to the robust economy, Medicare's hospital
insurance trust fund will remain solvent until 2015, seven years
later than in last year's forecast. It was the second year in a row
that the trustees added seven years to the expected life of the
fund, which pays for hospital, hospice, and home health care for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security will remain solvent until 2034, two years later
than in the trustees' previous forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, called the report ``excellent news.'' Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said it resulted from ``our current strong economic
conditions, what many consider to be the best in recent memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress and President Clinton are trying to find ways to shore
up Social Security and Medicare, which will face severe financial
strains early in the next century as the wave of baby boomers
begins to retire. But there are few signs that they can reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A congressionally chartered Medicare study panel recently
disbanded without making a recommendation to Congress. The group
split largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up Social Security, Congress and the president have
agreed to divert $2.8 trillion of future budget surpluses to the
retirement program, which would keep it solvent until 2055. But
Clinton and lawmakers have not begun serious talks on other
changes, such as benefit cuts or a higher age of eligibility, which
might be needed to keep the program stable longer.
</P>
<P>
   Though an economic downturn could bring back the earlier, less
optimistic, forecasts for the two programs, Tuesday's report could
reduce the urgency for lawmakers to make tough political decisions
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the pressure off a Medicare agreement in the sense
that lawmakers will say, `We have seven more years than we thought
to develop a solution to this very complex problem, and let's not
act hastily,' '' said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office, who is now with the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer said the trustees' report will not affect the Social
Security debate much, because the two-year delay in insolvency is
minor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the prospects for a deal on long-term changes to
Social Security are ``between nil and very, very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have made similar comments in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say there's less than a 50 percent chance'' for a Social
Security deal, Representative Nick Smith of Michigan, a leading
Republican advocate of Social Security overhaul, told the
Associated Press last week.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security's projected insolvency was pegged for the year
2029 before the trustees moved it to 2032 a year ago, and then to
2034 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Apfel, commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, said the latest change was mostly because of the
booming US economy, as lower unemployment, higher wages, and low
inflation are expected to put more tax dollars into the trust fund.
About one-quarter of the new forecast was because of changes in the
way the government measures inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The new projection also cuts the size of Social Security's
unfunded obligations to retirees in the next 75 years to 2.07
percent of taxable payroll, compared with last year's estimate of
2.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said three factors were responsible for the big delay in
the date of Medicare's insolvency. They include the strong economy
and a crackdown on waste and abuse by hospitals and other service
providers, which she said returned $1.2 billion to the Medicare
trust fund in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The third factor was the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997,
which cut Medicare payments to hospitals, home health providers and
service providers.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, hospital groups have claimed that those
cutbacks have been too severe, leading to layoffs and financial
losses, particularly at teaching hospitals. The cutbacks enacted in
1997 cost Massachusetts hospitals an estimated $1.7 billion over
five years, the Massachusetts Hospital Association has said. On
average, hospitals rely on Medicare for 30 percent of their
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security and Medicare trustees include Shalala,
Rubin, Apfel, and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, as well as two
public members.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Tuesday, the two public members urged a
go-slow approach to changing Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The recent collapse of the bipartisan Medicare commission
``raises the issue of whether it is wise to focus on finding one
overarching solution to the problems these programs face, or
whether to seek instead incremental changes,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Without endorsing the idea, the two public members also
suggested lawmakers consider indexing Social Security benefits to
changes in population trends or the economy. For example, if US
life expectancy rises, Social Security might raise its age of
eligibility. Or if wages rise slowly, Social Security benefits
might rise at the same slow rate. This approach might end the
``political gridlock'' paralyzing the debate, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The two public members are Stephen Kellison, chief actuary and
vice president of a Houston life insurance company, and Marilyn
Moon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Frustrated by the war propaganda that
passes for news here, a small but significant minority of Serbs
spend long hours every day watching satellite television,
exchanging e-mail and surfing the Internet. But few find the
Western version wholly convincing.
</P>
<P>
   They say that NATO's media manipulation is simply more subtle
than Belgrade's official blunderbuss, that Serbian interests in
Kosovo are ignored or trivialized and that Serbs are being
demonized to justify the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Kostic, an economic journalist and an open opponent of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, spends several hours a day
watching Sky News, BBC televsion news and CNN, listening to the
banned Belgrade independent radio station, B-92, on satellite,
exchanging e-mail around the world and reading Western newspapers
on the Web, through her two Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is offering free use of the Internet during the war,
and Mrs. Kostic fears that the Milosevic government will find some
way to shut the providers down.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, ``the West is not pushing a campaign against
just Milosevic anymore, but against the entire Serb people,'' and
she is offended by the content and the tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the West is more reliable, but it's not wholly reliable
_ that I also know,'' she said. ``It's better than our stupid
propaganda, but it's obvious the West is also conducting a
propaganda war, a public relations war, and it knows how to do it
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliable information is scarce, she said. ``You can't know
what's true. How many planes have been shot down? Is Fehmi Agani
dead or alive?'' she said, referring to the moderate Albanian
professor and negotiator who NATO says was killed by Serbs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kostic was arrested by Milosevic's government in 1994 and
sentenced to three months in jail, which was reduced to a year's
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Serb police are terrible,'' she said. ``I'm
frightened of them. But it's not only Albanian human rights at
stake, it's mine as well. Milosevic is already moving against the
independent press and the opposition. This bombing will mean
keeping that creature in power another 100 years and destroying the
opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she believes Western accusations of atrocities in
Kosovo, she sighed. ``I do believe Serb forces are pushing out
Albanians,'' she said. ``I hope they are not slaughtering
civilians, but I do believe they are intimidating them to go out. I
don't approve of it, but I understand it. When you're in a war, you
can't afford to have people shoot you in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch the Western news stations, she said, ``You wouldn't
know that there is an Albanian army fighting against the Serbs,'' a
reference to the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's terrible now,'' she said, ``but Milosevic didn't
create Kosovo. He made it worse, but the riots started in 1981. The
Albanians had a state within a state already, but they wanted more.
Now the West is fighting for their independence while claiming that
Serbia will keep sovereignty. It's the hypocrisy I hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dusan, 21, a student of electrical engineering in Novi Sad,
northwest of Belgrade, spends hours on the Internet, exchanging
information with friends about what sites are hit by the bombs,
tracking down rumors and monitoring Western media. He is a
pro-democracy demonstrator, a member of Otpor, the Student
Resistance Movement. He was reached by telephone after he attached
it to an e-mail message, but fearing mobilization into the army, he
insisted that his surname not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against Milosevic, and I don't think I'm a victim of
propaganda by either side,'' he said. ``I watch and read our media
and the international media, including The New York Times and The
Washington Post, and I'm in touch with students all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dusan complains that Serbs are being demonized and that the
world talks of Nazis now to justify an act of aggression on a
sovereign country fighting an insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO says this is the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe
since World War II,'' he said, ``but three years ago a half-million
Serbs were cleared out of Krajina. But it wasn't in the interests
of the U.S. to put Croatia down, so there was less information and
no outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand NATO must justify its actions, but the bombing of
Yugoslavia is wrong. I know Slobodan Milosevic is doing bad things,
and lots and lots of people in Serbia hate Milosevic. But there are
also a lot of innocent people here, and now his regime is stronger
than ever. Horrible things are happening, but horrible things have
happened all through the Balkans.''

   Radio 021, the only independent media outlet in Novi Sad,
Serbia's second-largest city, was also shut down. ``Everything will
be shut down, and then what?'' Dusan asked. ``It will be another 20
years before democracy comes here, and there's a bigger
humanitarian crisis than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Micovic, like Dusan, is a student leader who published his
phone number on the Internet. Students use the World Wide Web and
e-mail almost exclusively to exchange information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the authorities don't even know what e-mail is,'' he
said. ``During the student protests our Web page was popular, and
the police broke in and said, `Where is that Internet?' as if they
could confiscate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Micovic, 23, uses the Yugoslav Internet service provider EUnet
and a university provider called Afrodite. In Novi Sad, he said, it
can take four hours to get a connection.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people in Yugoslavia use the Internet or
e-mail. A study financed by the U.S. Agency for International
Development suggested that perhaps 50,000 in this country used
e-mail; Belgrade alone has nearly two million people.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for EUnet, who would not give his name, said that
his company and the various other providers had about 60,000
subscribers in Yugoslavia, and that at least 100,000 people used
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   They include the Serbian Orthodox Church, which has sent e-mail
to contacts around the world. An impassioned recent message from
the Rev. Sava Janjic of the Decani Monastery, for example, appealed
for an end to NATO bombing, which, it said, ``will only make things
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more Serbs have access to satellite receivers that enable
them to watch Western television, including German and Italian
channels.
</P>
<P>
   But Micovic, too, finds his access to information no easy guide
to reality. ``Either way I go, I stand to lose,'' he said.
``Supporting the bombing is stupid, because it makes everything
worse. Most people in the West don't understand the mentality that
exists here. The bombing has weakened any chance to turn Serbia
into a democratic country.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time here we have been trying to build connections
between students and other groups, and we were making some
progress, but after the bombing it's largely destroyed. Milosevic
now has the power to do what he pleases, and some of my friends
have already been drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a professional television journalist here, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, says no one can believe in the state media,
which cycle rumors and propaganda in a crude way. ``We joke that if
so many NATO planes have been shot down,'' he said, ``their pilots
must already speak Serbian and are hiding in a village tending the
cows, because no one can find them.''
</P>
<P>
   He watches a lot of Western television and surfs the Internet
for six or seven hours a day, he said. ``But there is a lot of
nonsense there, too. On CNN they said that 8,000 to 12,000 Albanian
refugees were crossing the border every hour,'' he said, laughing.
``First, it's impossible to know. But in 10 hours that's 100,000
people, and in four days that's a million people. And in seven
days, all of Kosovo is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he believe that Serbian forces are committing
atrocities in Kosovo? He sighed. ``I think they do it,'' he said.
``I think they'll do whatever is necessary to stay in power, and
they try to destroy the KLA and expel as many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he said, the point is not the percentage of
Serbs who live in Kosovo. ``What's important is that for centuries
Kosovo was part of the Serbian state. And if we say that now Serbia
will give it up and be smaller, fine, but we must agree to do it.
NATO has put the whole region on the edge of a real eruption.''

CHINESE WANT MORE U.S. FILMS, MOVIE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Hollywood has received its first sign in years that
China may be willing to allow more American films into its
theaters, a movie industry leader said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as a sweetener in its campaign to open up the potentially
giant market here, the U.S. movie industry plans to stage a Chinese
film festival in New York and Los Angeles in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of
America, made the offer of a film festival in talks with senior
Chinese cultural officials here over the last two days. In the
talks he urged China to open its doors not only to more American
movies _ currently no more than 10 are allowed in each year _ but
also to American investment in studios, co-productions and
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said in an interview Tuesday night that he had been
heartened by his reception, which he described as the most positive
in four visits over the last three years. He met with Ding Guangen,
who is the Communist Party's chief of propaganda, and Sun Jiazheng,
the culture minister.
</P>
<P>
   While they made no specific commitments, both officials
indicated they wanted to see more American films in China, Valenti
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in all my visits that they've given me
a hopeful sign,'' he said. Still, without an agreement there is no
way to know how soon China's policies might change.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials made no public comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies are ready to invest millions of dollars here if
they are allowed to,'' Valenti said. ``We'd like to come in and
build multiplexes,'' which could attract more consumers to both
Chinese and American films.
</P>
<P>
   The officials did not bite on the multiplex idea, but they did
express interest in having American companies help renovate some
theaters, and they liked the idea of a film festival to promote
Chinese-made films abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti is in a trade mission led by secretary of commerce
William M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   By an unwritten rule, only about 10 foreign films per year,
virtually all of them American, are allowed to play inside China on
a basis of shared box-office revenues. China's concerns are partly
ideological: the Communist Party worries about ``spiritual
pollution'' from the West. But the country also wants to protect
its own weak film industry.
</P>
<P>
   China has not offered clear criteria for its choices but
generally avoids films with nudity or that delve into politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year only seven American films were released here,
including ``Titanic,'' which was a sensation and grossed more than
$35 million in China, and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which had modest
results.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999 eight films have been approved so far, including ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``A Bug's Life'' and ``The Truman
Show.'' Only the Disney animated film ``Mulan'' has been released,
though, and it is suffering because of widespread pirating.
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance of ``Mulan'' was delayed last year because of
Chinese anger over the Disney Corp.'s involvement with a film
glorifying the Dalai Lama. But Disney has patched things up with
the government, and three more of its films also have been approved
for release.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other foreign films, most from Hong Kong and Taiwan,
play in China for a flat fee, an arrangement that is not
interesting to Hollywood studios, said William Brent, president of
China Entertainment Network, a consulting concern based in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   China's own film industry produced about 80 films last year,
Brent said. But these are made under conditions of censorship with
outdated technology, and they seldom strike a chord with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   China does have some directors of international stature like
Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, whose films are respected if not always
commercially successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what the Chinese are afraid of,'' Brent said. ``
`Titanic' and `Saving Private Ryan' alone probably accounted for 30
percent of the total box office in China last year, and if 30
American films come in, their own industry could be totally wiped
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Valenti proposed that from June 1999 to June 2000 China allow 17
American movies in, then about 25 in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the plan for a film festival, which will showcase 10 to
12 Chinese films with commercial potential on cable television if
not in theaters, American companies are willing to help develop the
Chinese film industry if China wants that.
</P>
<P>
   The American companies could provide training for Chinese
studios in high-technology production methods, marketing and
distribution and hold classes in directing and writing, Valenti
said. Interns could work in American companies, and Chinese
students could be helped to enter American film schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their studios are in the Mesozoic Era, and they know it,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged officials here to allow competition in film
distribution, now controlled by an inefficient monopoly, and to
reduce the heavy taxes on film revenue.
</P>
<P>
   En route to China the trade mission stopped in South Korea,
where Valenti urged President Kim Dae Jung to drop a quota that
requires every screen in every theater to show Korean films at
least 146 days of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a stern and unforgiving rebuttal,'' Valenti said.

STRONG ECONOMY, REFORMS DELAY MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY CRISES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A robust economy and previously enacted reforms
have pushed back the looming financial crisis for Social Security
by two years and Medicare by seven years, according to an annual
assessment released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings that the two benefit programs for the elderly are
more sound than previously envisioned could lessen the pressure on
Congress this year to make major changes urged by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But anticipating the political impact of the new findings,
Clinton warned that reforms should still be enacted promptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say this good news means we can simply delay
reforms. Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Clinton said in
a Rose Garden appearance. ``Now is the time to make those changes.
Now, when we have time on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has asked Congress to use most of the federal budget
surplus to ensure that Social Security and Medicare funds will be
available when the vast Baby Boom generation retires early in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans have clashed with the White House
over the approaches for overhauling the programs. Those differences
led to the failure this month of a bipartisan commission on
Medicare to agree on a plan to change the health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Republicans are pushing for large tax cuts, which
Democrats have warned could use surplus money that is needed to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The financial assessment of the two entitlements was included in
the annual report of the Board of Trustees for Social Security and
Medicare, which is composed of four Clinton administration
officials and two presidential appointees.
</P>
<P>
   The report projected that Social Security would be able to pay
full benefits until 2034, two years later than had been estimated
in last year's trustee's report.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that Medicare, which had been projected to run out
of money in 2008, would remain financially sound until 2015.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year in a row that the report has extended
the life of Medicare. Last year, the trustees moved back the
bankruptcy date for the health insurance program by seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attributed the improvement to the booming economy and
changes in the way the benefits are administered. The economy has
boosted the revenue generated from payroll taxes that fund both
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security benefits also will last longer, in part because
of adjustments in the consumer price index, which determines
benefit levels.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare has benefited from legislative changes that reduced
payments to medical providers and governmental efforts to crack
down on fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We vigorously managed Medicare,'' said Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala, a Medicare and Social Securities
board member. ``I'm talking about management that is hands on,
holds people accountable, introduces new systems and responds to
changing systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Medicare has been more successful in recent
years in halting a common practice by medical providers of slipping
patients into more expensive reimbursement categories that did not
correspond to the treatment they received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providers of Medicare have been able to game the system to
their advantage. But over time, that has become harder to do,''
said Marilyn Moon, an economist and a Medicare trustee.
</P>
<P>
   While about 6 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries
are now enrolled in managed-care plans, officials said that trend
has not generated the cost savings that some have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Moon said the government has been overpaying managed-care plans,
which charge a fixed sum regardless of whether the beneficiaries
use the services. She said that healthy beneficiaries often enroll
in managed-care plans and then switch to the traditional
fee-for-service plans when they become chronically sick.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Medicare officials predict that greater numbers of
beneficiaries will enroll in managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the breathing room for action, the initial response from
Republican chairmen of committees with jurisdiction over the
programs was that lawmakers should proceed to make difficult
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot let this good news make us complacent in our efforts
to improve the ability of Medicare to meet the needs of seniors,''
said Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Houston, who was
traveling in Australia, also issued a statement on the report:
</P>
<P>
   ``That Social Security and Medicare each have a few more years
of projected solvency should not come as a surprise, given the
continued strength of the economy. Nor does it mean we should stop
considering solutions to the inevitable crises _ due to changing
demographics _ that these programs face in their long-term
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to reach a political consensus this year may be
tough, particularly with the collapse of the bipartisan commission
on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, led by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., had developed a
plan that would raise the eligibility age for Medicare, from 65 to
67, and would have the government pay a fixed sum for each Medicare
beneficiary, rather than pay separately for each medical service.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rejected the plan, however, because it did not provide
for pharmaceutical benefits and did not set aside 15 percent of the
surplus for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would propose his own plan to fix Medicare, and
his advisers said that the revised estimates had not changed his
intentions to submit that blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux also said he intended to put the commission's
recommendations into legislation despite the president's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said lawmakers must ``go beyond the same old legislative
fix that will extend Medicare's solvency only by further cutting
reimbursement payments to hospitals and providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding fixes for Social Security also has not proved easy, as
lawmakers debate whether to privatize a portion of the retirement
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has advocated letting the federal government invest a
portion of the retirement funds in the stock markets to boost
revenue. Republicans want to give individuals the ability to invest
some of the funds in the market.

MARKET PLACE: IPO COULD USE A DOT-COM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another environment, the initial public offering
of Pepsi Bottling Group might be one of the hottest stock deals of
the year, driven by an international brand name and a consumer
franchise with great opportunity to expand abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But in the year of the Internet, investors have been rather
uninterested in offerings by companies lacking ``dot-com'' in their
names.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the announcement late Monday by Coca-Cola Co. that
its sales, measured in cases, took an unexpected drop in the first
quarter, and the result could be a tepid reception for the Pepsi
Bottling offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is the largest manufacturer, distributor and
seller of Pepsi-Cola beverages, provided the details of its
long-awaited separation from Pepsico late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is selling 100 million shares of common stock for $23 a
share, raising $2.3 billion before expenses _ the fifth-largest
initial public offering by an American corporation, according to
Securities Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And if Pepsi Bottling exercises its option to issue an
additional 15 million shares under its overallotment clause, it
could rise as high as No. 3, behind last year's offering by Conoco
and the 1996 issue of Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The price, though, is at the bottom of the $23-to-$26-a-share
range that the company had previously said it was considering, most
likely reflecting caution after Coca-Cola's surprise announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold shares of several beverage companies Tuesday
following the Coca-Cola news, with Coke shares falling $1.5625, to
$63.50. Shares of Pepsico, which after the offering will own 35
percent of the bottling company's common shares and 43 percent of
the voting power in all classes of stock, fell 81.25 cents, to
$39.875.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's largest bottler and the
company whose structure most closely reflects that of Pepsi
Bottling, fell $1.8125, to $31.50.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts played down any connection between Coca-Cola's
weakness and Pepsico's largest bottler. Roy Burry, an analyst at
Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that Coca-Cola's loss of market
share presumably meant a gain for Pepsi, which would be good news
for the bottler.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the only area in which Coca-Cola eked out a sales
gain in the first quarter was North America, meaning that the
domestic soft-drink market might not be as weak as in the rest of
the world. About 92 percent of Pepsi Bottling's case volume is sold
in North America, and the company handles about 55 percent of
Pepsi's U.S. volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to look at Coke's volume numbers and deduce how
they will affect Pepsi,'' said Richard Joy, an analyst at Standard
&AMP; Poor's equity group. Pepsi Bottling could still see some weakness
in the small part of its business that is overseas: 8 percent of
its sales volume, measured in cases, comes from Spain, Greece and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been an extremely weak market for multinational
corporations like Coke and Pepsi ever since last year's devaluation
of the ruble. Spain offers a potential base for expansion into
neighboring European Union countries, but that market is not
growing very rapidly itself. Greece, meanwhile, offers relatively
little opportunity for regional expansion, given its proximity to
the war-torn Balkan nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All that said, Pepsi Bottling has certain attractions. For one,
it is likely to trade at a lower valuation than Coca-Cola
Enterprises. Standard &AMP; Poor's, in its Emerging and Special
Situations newsletter, calculated that at the midpoint of the
projected price range, Pepsi Bottling would trade at about nine
times earnings before noncash charges like depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises trades at about 10 times that earnings
measure. And since Pepsi Bottling is pricing at the low end of the
range, the discount grows that much larger.
</P>
<P>
   With its offering, Pepsi is following the trail blazed by Coke
and Coca-Cola Enterprises _ a surprising fact given that a number
of analysts and customers of the bottler have questioned just how
independent those two companies are.
</P>
<P>
   But the offering will give Pepsi Bottling the financial strength
to expand its vending operations and to continue an overhaul of its
manufacturing and distribution network. Those combined efforts
could help the company's profit margins in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should not expect the shares, which begin trading
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PBG, to
replicate the sharp rise recorded by recent offerings like that of
Priceline.com, which rose $53 Tuesday, to $69, from its initial
offering price of $16.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it preordained, though, that Pepsi Bottling will draw
as little interest as the February offering of Del Monte Foods,
which went public at $15 a share and closed Tuesday at $11.75.
Investors with long-term horizons, and a thirst for Pepsi over
Coke, might find the offering has some appeal.

   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He was at the top of his profession _ 10
feet high, technically, but a career's worth of success in cosmic
measurement. In a moment like this, an egomaniac might blurt
something about being king of the world, or dance around like the
proverbial decapitated chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Calhoun thought about somebody else. After Connecticut
outplayed Duke, 77-74, for the national college basketball
championship Monday night, there were a few strands of net hanging
from the rim, a civilized version of two ears and a tail in
bullfighting.
</P>
<P>
   He could have claimed all the spoils for having devised a
defense that helped his team finish three points ahead of Mike
Krzyzewski's team. Even though this burly basketball lifer had
never coached in the Final Four, he must have had something to do
with the victory, no?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the victory did exorcise Christian Laettner's
shot that killed Connecticut in the 1990 East Regional, after
Krzyzewski changed the play after a second timeout. This time, with
Laettner in attendance, Calhoun sent his co-captain, Ricky Moore,
out to stop Trajan Langdon one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ladder and the scissors, Calhoun clipped a fragment of
net but left something hanging from the rim, left it for the man
with ``the best seat in the house,'' Calhoun would say in a husky
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The last piece was for the family of Joe McGinn, who was once
his manager but came down with kidney disease so severe that he
died on March 9, at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
   This moment of generosity was not something he had scripted a
day or two earlier _ no crafted victory speech in his jacket
pocket. As he climbed the ladder, he suddenly thought of Joe
McGinn, whom he had counseled through his terrible last years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like,'' he said later in the steamy locker
room. ``I was called in from the outfield when I was 15, and found
out my father died of a heart attack. My coach then helped me get
through it. That's how I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not going to change, he insisted. He is still going to be
this self-styled ``stubborn Irish guy'' from Boston. He did not
need to win the Final Four to feel good about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now he joins the roster of coaches who won this jamboree:
Valvano. Haskins. Rupp. Richardson. Thompson. Massimino. Tarkanian.
Pitino. A couple of unrelated Smiths. A couple of unrelated
McGuires. Coach K. All the others. And somebody named Wooden, who
won it 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it now includes my name, but it doesn't validate me,''
Calhoun said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood that stuff,'' he added. ``It's like all
that baloney about the Super Bowl, where you lose four of them and
you're a loser. Does this mean you're better off going 10-8 and
getting knocked out in the first round?''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said he was the same person after 554 victories and 257
losses in 27 years. He specifically mentioned Eddie Sutton, who has
taken four teams to the tournament but never won it. The lifers
don't get to be lifers without knowing some stuff, do they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches cheat sometimes,'' Calhoun disclosed to an amazed
audience from the media. ``We do. We tell you things, and you use
them. You know that. I kept talking about how great Duke was _ and
they were. But I told my team, `This is the first time all year
that I'm telling you, they are as good as you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also told his players they could beat Duke. He schmoozed with
30 or 40 coaches, and thought he could throw in a lot of players,
make Duke run. His ace card was the sense of being an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun is from the distinctly nonscale American International,
and learned to coach at Northeastern, a bootstrapper's school in
urban Boston. When his Connecticut team overwhelmed a game Eastern
Michigan team a few years ago, Calhoun raved about the heart of the
two little opposing guards. They were his kind of guys.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he counted 17 of his former players in the stands _
men who took time off from their jobs in business or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Gwynn, Lyman DePriest, Spider Usry, Scotty Burrell, Ray
Allen, all of them,'' Calhoun said. ``Howie Dickenman, who used to
be my assistant, who laid the groundwork by recruiting a lot of
these guys, was here.''
</P>
<P>
   They filed into the borrowed office to hug the man who had
yelled at them so many times. Calhoun said he felt ``humbled'' by
the night, and the presence of his old boys, and in his celebration
he remembered to save a souvenir in honor of his late team manager,
the one with ``the best seat in the house.''

HIGH-SPEED AMTRAK BEGINS TO ROLL, SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(SUBS 7th graf to change million to billion)  (For release Sunday, April 4)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, when Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ended state financing for
the proposed 320-mile high-speed rail project that would have
linked Miami, Orlando and Tampa, the future of high-speed train
service in the United States suffered an apparent major setback.
</P>
<P>
   But an unlikely savior _ make that an unlikely  &UR; possible &LR;  savior
_ rode toward the rescue in March: Amtrak, that much maligned
national passenger rail system created by Congress in 1971, which
has lost money every year since. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (While the cause of the recent Amtrak crash south of Chicago
that killed 11 people and injured more than 100 after colliding
with a truck at an intersection has not yet been determined, it did
not involve high speed rails or high speed trains. And the train
was not exceeding the 79 mph limit.)
</P>
<P>
   In February, Amtrak unveiled the first of 20 high-speed trains
that will go into service later this year along the Northeast
Corridor, the 470-mile strip linking Washington, New York and
Boston. The new trains, renamed Acela, to suggest a combination of
excellence and acceleration, will race along at 150 mph, Amtrak
officials said; their top speed today is 90 mph between Boston and
New York and 125 mph between New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The higher speed, a result of track improvements and technology
that allows the new trains to tilt into curves with little danger
of derailment or of disrupting passengers when the trains bank,
would cut 30 minutes from the present four-hour New York to Boston
trip and up to 30 minutes between New York and Washington. As an
added lure, Amtrak officials said that fares will be 30 percent
lower than walk-up fares on US Airways' and Delta's shuttle
flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That saving presumably would make Acela more attractive to
passengers, especially business travelers. In addition, the new
cars will offer electrical outlets for laptop computers and audio
entertainment, televised news updates, tables to spread out papers
or hold meetings, enlarged lounges and bathrooms, and better food,
drinks and luggage storage.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Amtrak's ambitious plans for the Northeast Corridor succeed _
enabling the line to become self-sufficient by 2002, when its
federal subsidy is scheduled to end _ the railroad next plans a $25
billion network of high-speed trains linking nine Midwestern states
from Ohio to Nebraska, with Chicago as the hub. Then it hopes to
add other regions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those trains are still some years down the road. Meanwhile,
about a dozen other high-speed routes are already on the drawing
boards or under construction. They range in length from 85 miles,
between Chicago and Milwaukee, to 676 miles, the so-called
California corridor that would link San Diego, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Sacramento. Projected costs for the projects range
from $29 billion for the California corridor to $315 million to
link the Buffalo-Albany portion of the 430-mile Empire corridor
between Buffalo and New York City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trains are expected to exceed 100 mph, with the fastest in
California. One of the two types of train under consideration there
would be capable of 220 mph; the other could run at speeds up to
310 mph. Unlike other projects, which would use existing tracks,
California's proposes a new rail line solely for high-speed
trains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed projections assume that signals are improved,
curves straightened and stations rebuilt. So far improvements have
progressed only in the Northeast Corridor, which carried more than
9 million passengers in fiscal 1997 (7 million on the New
York-Washington portion). Electrification of the final link,
between New Haven and Boston, is scheduled for completion late this
year, with high-speed service to follow soon afterward.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other potential high-speed corridors include Eugene, Ore., to
Vancouver, Canada, and Washington to Charlotte, N.C. There is a
proposal to link Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and one for
Birmingham, Ala., and New Orleans, eventually hooking up with
Houston. The wide-ranging Midwestern project envisioned by Amtrak
would encompass three smaller corridors in which Chicago would be
the linchpin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent General Accounting Office report to Congress said that
most of the proposals for high-speed corridors are unclear about
where the money is coming from and some are still developing
feasibility studies. The agency cautioned that ``high-speed rail
systems are costly, and thus ridership levels may not be high
enough in the United States for systems to cover their costs.''
Equally discouraging, Amtrak has only 0.3 percent of the nation's
total passenger traffic, according to the Amtrak Reform Council,
established by Congress in 1997 to monitor the railroad's progress.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the pessimistic GAO report was issued more than a month
before Amtrak officials pulled the high-speed rabbit out of their
hats. And since that report, Amtrak officials have pointed to the
news from their recently completed fiscal year _ e.g., their
largest ridership increase in a decade, their best on-time
performance in 13 years and their first $1 billion-plus passenger
revenues ever _ as strong evidence that they have turned the
corner.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, especially those in Congress, will probably say they
have heard that before from Amtrak. About the best that supporters
of high-speed rail can do is hope that this time Amtrak is right.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While some Republican presidential candidates are
trying to avoid the thorny subject of American involvement in
Kosovo, Vice President Al Gore does not have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president is inextricably entwined with the
Clinton administration policy for the bombing campaign. Indeed, he
describes himself as an ``active participant'' in the
decision-making and he has been a strong advocate of the bombing
while he campaigns and raises money across the country _ a
political pursuit that Republicans have called ``a disgrace'' while
Americans are in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Gore was the one who informed former
Presidents George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter of the
impending airstrikes. He called Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov to tell him that NATO was beginning the bombings, leading
Primakov to cancel a meeting in Washington and turn his flight
around over the middle of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been meeting privately with President Clinton and
participates in military briefings at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While he campaigned in New Hampshire on Saturday, he received
seven updates from one of his military advisers, Cmdr. Kevin Scott,
a Navy helicopter pilot. And in his hour-long flight back to
Washington, he received three updates on the effort to rescue the
Air Force pilot whose plane went down near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A second military adviser, Maj. Steve Kwast, an Air Force
fighter pilot, provided updates as Gore campaigned Monday in
Chicago and Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing his support for the airstrikes, Gore said in
Alabama, ``Despite the risks, in my opinion, we are doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that Gore has always carried weight
on foreign affairs in the White House, partly because of his
military service _ he worked as an Army journalist for seven months
in Vietnam _ and because he specialized in subjects like arms
control during his eight years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president always comes to the table prepared and with
strong views,'' said Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman. ``I know
the president relies on him. He's the one who has no institutional
representation; he doesn't represent the Pentagon, he doesn't
represent the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   During this particular crisis, Gore has felt the absence of his
longtime national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, who had a mild
heart attack last Wednesday. Fuerth, who is recuperating at home,
has a secure telephone line and participates in classified
briefings. His place at the table with the president's national
security team is being filled by his deputy, Col. Richard M.
Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has largely been using Gore, though, as a public
spokesman on the American-led NATO bombings. ``One of the best
roles he can play is articulating the policy,'' one administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombing began last week, Gore's team considered
scrapping a long-planned political trip to New Hampshire. But they
concluded that the amount of press attention that Gore would
attract _ this was his first trip where he mingled with small
groups of voters _ would be useful in helping to advance the
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as he was tucked away in remote North Conway, N.H., in
the White Mountains, on Friday night, his interviews about Kosovo
with local television stations were broadcast by the national
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In between every stop, my national security staff conversed
over the secure line with my military aide,'' Gore told reporters
Saturday night as he flew back to Washington, ``and I relayed my
advice on pending questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that while the initial decision to begin airstrikes
was a difficult one, ``it was not an especially controversial
decision internally'' because the administration was convinced that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was committing
atrocities. ``Everybody understands this guy is a butcher,'' Gore
said, adding that he expected the bombing to continue for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-dozen speeches throughout his two-day swing across New
Hampshire, Gore talked about the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of about 70 people in a living room in Concord,
he described Milosevic this way: ``He's one of these junior-league
Hitler types who tries to hold on to power by stirring up hatred
among his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of American participation in the bombing, ``If we stood
by and did nothing while this kind of activity occurred, we would
not be true to our values.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Gore said: ``I do not support the
introduction of ground troops in combat settings in the Balkans. I
believe we can achieve our objectives through the use of air
power.'' That comment was a clearer formulation than other
administration officials, including Clinton, have offered in their
briefings and speeches, when they have taken care to say they have
``no plans'' for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is virtually the only presidential candidate who, whether
by design or duty, has tied himself so definitively to the NATO
mission, and if it turns sour and loses support, he would have the
most difficult time extricating himself politically. ``Even if he
wanted to separate himself, he couldn't,'' one administration
official said. ``But he has always been hawkish on the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley,
the former senator from New Jersey, has raised red flags about the
effort, saying that the administration has no clear exit strategy
and that the nation runs the risk of a Vietnam-like quagmire. Of
the several Republican presidential candidates, about half support
involvement in Yugoslavia and the other half do not.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have freely questioned the propriety of Gore's
discussing policies that endanger American troops during his
campaigning. Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican
Party, called Gore's campaigning ``a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Forbes, a Republican candidate for president who was
also touring New Hampshire last weekend, criticized the ``dithering
and drift'' of the administration on Balkan policy.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism followed Gore on Monday on his fund-raising trips.
Winton Blount 3rd, the Republican chairman in Alabama, said,
``Gore, who is running in a practically uncontested primary, has
put dollar signs ahead of our men and women in the armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president canceled plans this week for a six-day ski
vacation, during which he and his wife, Tipper, were to celebrate
his 51st birthday. But he is still planning a three-day
fund-raising trip to California next week.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After pounding Serb targets for seven days, NATO
officials admitted Tuesday that they were shocked and surprised by
the continuing atrocities ravaging Kosovo, warning grimly that
there was no quick military solution to the humanitarian
catastrophe unfolding there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have anticipated that it would be
quite as bad as it seems now to be becoming,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters in Brussels, as hordes of horrified and weary
refugees streamed toward the borders of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can talk about a modern-day Great Terror going on
in Kosovo at the moment,'' Shea said, in a reference to purges by
Joseph Stalin that left some 2 million Russians dead six decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing their campaign of violence, pillage and destruction to
the heart of Kosovo, Serb troops and special police forced
thousands of ethnic Albanians to abandon their homes in the
provincial capital of Pristina, even as around-the-clock NATO air
strikes punched at the forces underpinning the repression.
</P>
<P>
   As the air assault entered its second week, however, U.S. and
NATO officials conceded that poor weather, difficult terrain and
the threat of Serb air defenses continued to hamper the mission,
forcing bombing runs to be scuttled in mid-air and blunting the
effectiveness of high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never supposed or reported that we had a silver bullet that
would bring this to a halt,'' asserted U.S. Naval Vice Adm. Scott
Fry, director of operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be hard,'' Fry told reporters at the
Pentagon. ``We are grinding it out.''
</P>
<P>
   With a NATO victory not yet in sight, President Clinton told the
nation to brace for ``a sustained period'' of continuing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the 19-member NATO alliance to stick with the
mission, saying the wholesale persecution of Albanians since the
allied attacks began has only underscored the necessity of striking
the forces commanded by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions,'' Clinton
said. ``We must remain steady and determined with the will to see
this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, military officials said future strikes would
bear down increasingly on the individual troops and tanks carrying
out the hostilities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In strikes Monday and Tuesday, NATO warplanes bombed Serb army
garrisons in Pristina, army barracks just north of Kosovo and an
array of fuel and ammo depots scattered across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and London showed reporters images of
the Pristina headquarters for the Serb special police and also for
the army, both of which have conducted brutal campaigns against
ethnic Albanians. Both headquarters operations appeared to be
destroyed by coordinated strikes from multiple NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of treatment which Milosevic can now
increasingly expect,'' said Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of
staff for the British Defense Agency. ``The focus of the air
strikes has now shifted firmly towards military forces in Kosovo
and the facilities directly supporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officers said, however, that heavy cloud cover
and the continuing threat of Serb air defenses had seriously
compromised the pace of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying U.S. A-10 tank busters, for instance, flew missions
Monday night but returned without firing on their targets, said
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots have at times been unable to fire laser-guided
bombs, which perform poorly in cloudy conditions, out of fear of
unleashing a bomb that could land wide of its target and perhaps
injure civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying Harrier attack jets were able to strike their targets
on only two nights out of the first six of the campaign, British
officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart technology is affected by poor weather, and we have
had a run of very poor weather,'' Guthrie told reporters in London.
``What we do not want to do is to create any more collateral damage
than we have, we do not want to kill innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed as ``unacceptable'' a Russian-brokered offer
by Milosevic to talk peace in exchange for a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, whose government
adamantly opposes the NATO strikes, reported the offer to NATO
officials after meeting in Belgrade with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted, however, that the only way to end the strikes
is for Milosevic to withdraw his troops, end the violence and
accept the outline of an international peace plan that calls for
putting 28,000 NATO peacekeepers, 4,000 of them Americans, in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic began this brutal campaign,'' Clinton said
in a prepared statement. ``It is his responsibility to bring it to
an immediate end and embrace a just peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the diplomatic ante for Belgrade, Clinton said Milosevic
risks losing Kosovo altogether by persevering with a military sweep
that has put an estimated 600,000 ethnic Albanians to flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sustained period, he will see that his military will be
seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the
prospect of international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo
increasingly jeopardized,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to independence for
Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million, 90 percent of whom are ethnic
Albanians, in southern Serbia, and State Department spokesman James
Rubin stressed that this position hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, however, were clearly meant to send the
message to Milosevic that the longer he stands up to NATO, the
greater the chance that his defiance and oppression will ultimately
cost him the province at the center of his dispute with the
powerful U.S. and European alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for NATO tenacity -- made during a State
Department ceremony to unveil a portrait of former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher -- echoed earlier statements from the
British government, in what appeared to be a coordinated effort to
demonstrate NATO unity and resolve in the face of a difficult and
widening air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has got the determination and the stomach to see this
through,'' British Defense Secretary George Robertson assured
reporters in London. ``The killing fields of Kosovo are not going
to remain as some memorial for Milosevic to sneer over, and we are
determined to make sure that the violence is stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robertson and Clinton spoke, however, much of Kosovo was in
flames. Serb troops under Milosevic's command were pressing forward
with a concerted program of terror that invited flashbacks to the 3
1/2-year war between Serbs and non-Serbs in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials displayed intelligence photographs of
buildings burning near the town of Brestovac, where special Serb
police units were active, and Dobrido, where Serb army troops were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Other images were shown documenting the forced evacuation of
towns and villages across a wide swath of north-central Kosovo,
where fleeing civilians left their homes to be destroyed by the
torches of Serb forces, and of similar activities near towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   NATO received unconfirmed reports of artillery and tank attacks
on large groups of refugees fleeing toward the Albanian border from
population centers in southwest Kosovo. By late Tuesday, U.S.
officials said they could not confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told by tens of thousands of fleeing refugees,
however, are being largely confirmed through intelligence sources
-- U.S. spy satellites and three high-altitude U-2 spy planes are
actively monitoring the region, as are, presumably, U.S. and NATO
contacts on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the evidence points to a catastrophe of epic
proportions unfolding across the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know President Milosevic's record, but I think that
even we have been shocked by the sheer proportions of what we see
happening in Kosovo today,'' Shea, told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whole towns and villages, tanks are first surrounding the
site, then paramilitaries are going in, rounding up civilians at
gunpoint, separating young men from women and children,'' Shea
said, describing in hauntingly familiar detail a reprise of the
pattern Serb troops and paramilitary thugs used to force an
estimated 3 million Muslims and Croats from their homes during the
civil war in Bosnia. ``The women and children are then expelled
from their homes and then sent towards the border. And after they
have left, the villages, the towns, the homes, are looted and then
systematically torched.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said the movements of ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo and
along its borders had become so widespread and frenetic that
accurate numbers on displaced people were no longer attainable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated, however, that roughly 94,000 ethnic
Albanians had fled the country just since the NATO air strikes
began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimated -- guessed, really -- that nearly 600,000
Kosovar Albanians have been displaced in 15 months of conflict.
Roughly half are believed to be hiding inside Kosovo or desperately
trying to get out, and the rest have made their way to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we haven't seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the mid
1970s,'' Shea said.

</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody could have anticipated that it would be
quite as bad as it seems now to be becoming,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea told reporters in Brussels, as hordes of horrified and weary
refugees streamed toward the borders of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can talk about a modern-day Great Terror going on
in Kosovo at the moment,'' Shea said, in a reference to purges by
Joseph Stalin that left some 2 million Russians dead six decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing their campaign of violence, pillage and destruction to
the heart of Kosovo, Serb troops and special police forced
thousands of ethnic Albanians to abandon their homes in the
provincial capital of Pristina, even as around-the-clock NATO air
strikes punched at the forces underpinning the repression.
</P>
<P>
   As the air assault entered its second week, however, U.S. and
NATO officials conceded that poor weather, difficult terrain and
the threat of Serb air defenses continued to hamper the mission,
forcing bombing runs to be scuttled in mid-air and blunting the
effectiveness of high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never supposed or reported that we had a silver bullet that
would bring this to a halt,'' asserted U.S. Naval Vice Adm. Scott
Fry, director of operations for the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be hard,'' Fry told reporters at the
Pentagon. ``We are grinding it out.''
</P>
<P>
   With a NATO victory not yet in sight, President Clinton told the
nation to brace for ``a sustained period'' of continuing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the 19-member NATO alliance to stick with the
mission, saying the wholesale persecution of Albanians since the
allied attacks began has only underscored the necessity of striking
the forces commanded by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president
of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt about what is at stake in Kosovo,
Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his actions,'' Clinton
said. ``We must remain steady and determined with the will to see
this through.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, military officials said future strikes would
bear down increasingly on the individual troops and tanks carrying
out the hostilities on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In strikes Monday and Tuesday, NATO warplanes bombed Serb army
garrisons in Pristina, army barracks just north of Kosovo and an
array of fuel and ammo depots scattered across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington and London showed reporters images of
the Pristina headquarters for the Serb special police and also for
the army, both of which have conducted brutal campaigns against
ethnic Albanians. Both headquarters operations appeared to be
destroyed by coordinated strikes from multiple NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the sort of treatment which Milosevic can now
increasingly expect,'' said Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of
staff for the British Defense Agency. ``The focus of the air
strikes has now shifted firmly towards military forces in Kosovo
and the facilities directly supporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officers said, however, that heavy cloud cover
and the continuing threat of Serb air defenses had seriously
compromised the pace of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying U.S. A-10 tank busters, for instance, flew missions
Monday night but returned without firing on their targets, said
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. pilots have at times been unable to fire laser-guided
bombs, which perform poorly in cloudy conditions, out of fear of
unleashing a bomb that could land wide of its target and perhaps
injure civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying Harrier attack jets were able to strike their targets
on only two nights out of the first six of the campaign, British
officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart technology is affected by poor weather, and we have
had a run of very poor weather,'' Guthrie told reporters in London.
``What we do not want to do is to create any more collateral damage
than we have, we do not want to kill innocent civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed as ``unacceptable'' a Russian-brokered offer
by Milosevic to talk peace in exchange for a halt in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, whose government
adamantly opposes the NATO strikes, reported the offer to NATO
officials after meeting in Belgrade with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted, however, that the only way to end the strikes
is for Milosevic to withdraw his troops, end the violence and
accept the outline of an international peace plan that calls for
putting 28,000 NATO peacekeepers, 4,000 of them Americans, in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic began this brutal campaign,'' Clinton said
in a prepared statement. ``It is his responsibility to bring it to
an immediate end and embrace a just peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the diplomatic ante for Belgrade, Clinton said Milosevic
risks losing Kosovo altogether by persevering with a military sweep
that has put an estimated 600,000 ethnic Albanians to flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sustained period, he will see that his military will be
seriously diminished, key military infrastructure destroyed, the
prospect of international support for Serbia's claim to Kosovo
increasingly jeopardized,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to independence for
Kosovo, a province of 2.2 million, 90 percent of whom are ethnic
Albanians, in southern Serbia, and State Department spokesman James
Rubin stressed that this position hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments, however, were clearly meant to send the
message to Milosevic that the longer he stands up to NATO, the
greater the chance that his defiance and oppression will ultimately
cost him the province at the center of his dispute with the
powerful U.S. and European alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plea for NATO tenacity -- made during a State
Department ceremony to unveil a portrait of former Secretary of
State Warren Christopher -- echoed earlier statements from the
British government, in what appeared to be a coordinated effort to
demonstrate NATO unity and resolve in the face of a difficult and
widening air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has got the determination and the stomach to see this
through,'' British Defense Secretary George Robertson assured
reporters in London. ``The killing fields of Kosovo are not going
to remain as some memorial for Milosevic to sneer over, and we are
determined to make sure that the violence is stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robertson and Clinton spoke, however, much of Kosovo was in
flames. Serb troops under Milosevic's command were pressing forward
with a concerted program of terror that invited flashbacks to the 3
1/2-year war between Serbs and non-Serbs in neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials displayed intelligence photographs of
buildings burning near the town of Brestovac, where special Serb
police units were active, and Dobrido, where Serb army troops were
operating.
</P>
<P>
   Other images were shown documenting the forced evacuation of
towns and villages across a wide swath of north-central Kosovo,
where fleeing civilians left their homes to be destroyed by the
torches of Serb forces, and of similar activities near towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   NATO received unconfirmed reports of artillery and tank attacks
on large groups of refugees fleeing toward the Albanian border from
population centers in southwest Kosovo. By late Tuesday, U.S.
officials said they could not confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The stories told by tens of thousands of fleeing refugees,
however, are being largely confirmed through intelligence sources
-- U.S. spy satellites and three high-altitude U-2 spy planes are
actively monitoring the region, as are, presumably, U.S. and NATO
contacts on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the evidence points to a catastrophe of epic
proportions unfolding across the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know President Milosevic's record, but I think that
even we have been shocked by the sheer proportions of what we see
happening in Kosovo today,'' Shea, told reporters at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whole towns and villages, tanks are first surrounding the
site, then paramilitaries are going in, rounding up civilians at
gunpoint, separating young men from women and children,'' Shea
said, describing in hauntingly familiar detail a reprise of the
pattern Serb troops and paramilitary thugs used to force an
estimated 3 million Muslims and Croats from their homes during the
civil war in Bosnia. ``The women and children are then expelled
from their homes and then sent towards the border. And after they
have left, the villages, the towns, the homes, are looted and then
systematically torched.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said the movements of ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo and
along its borders had become so widespread and frenetic that
accurate numbers on displaced people were no longer attainable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimated, however, that roughly 94,000 ethnic
Albanians had fled the country just since the NATO air strikes
began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimated -- guessed, really -- that nearly 600,000
Kosovar Albanians have been displaced in 15 months of conflict.
Roughly half are believed to be hiding inside Kosovo or desperately
trying to get out, and the rest have made their way to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we haven't seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the mid
1970s,'' Shea said.

SUPREME COURT ENDS CONFUSION ON PROSECUTING GUNMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal offense of using a gun during ``any
crime of violence'' may be prosecuted anywhere the underlying crime
took place and not only where the gun itself was used, the Supreme
Court ruled on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision resolved confusion in the lower federal courts
over how prosecutors should handle what is in effect a two-part
offense: one that requires both the use of a gun and a connection
between that use and other behavior that, standing alone, would
still be criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The gun offense carries a mandatory five-year sentence in
addition to the sentence for the underlying crime.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in this case, Jacinto Rodriguez-Moreno, had
committed the federal crime of kidnapping, in a venture that began
in Texas and continued into New Jersey, New York and Maryland.
Having been hired by a cocaine distributor to find a drug dealer
who had stolen 30 kilograms of cocaine, Rodriguez-Moreno took
captive the middleman in the deal to help him in his search.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Moreno used a .357 magnum revolver only once, to
threaten his captive's life at the end of the journey in Maryland,
after which the captive escaped. The defendant was tried and
convicted in New Jersey on the kidnapping and accompanying gun
charge.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia
overturned the conviction on the gun charge, on the ground that the
gun offense had occurred only in Maryland and could not be
prosecuted anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion on Tuesday that reinstated the conviction, Justice
Clarence Thomas said the gun crime was not a ``point-in-time
offense'' but had to be viewed in the context of the crime to which
it was connected. ``A kidnapping, once begun, does not end until
the victim is free,'' Thomas said, adding that it made no sense
``to speak of it in discrete geographic fragments.'' As long as the
kidnapping could properly be charged and tried in New Jersey, so
could the gun offense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by
Justice John Paul Stevens, said that the court's interpretation
violated the defendant's constitutional right to be tried where his
crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Scalia said, the defendant was prosecuted ``for
using a gun during a kidnapping in a state and district where all
agree he did not use a gun during a kidnapping.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If to state this case is not to decide it, the law
has departed further from the meaning of language than is
appropriate for a government that is supposed to rule (and to be
restrained) through the written word.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was U.S. vs. Rodriguez-Moreno, No. 97-1139.

NO QUICK CHINESE ENTRY SEEN INTO TRADE GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Dampening hopes for a quick agreement on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, American officials said Tuesday
that ``difficult and complex issues remain across all areas of
trade'' after a visit by the White House trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese and American officials have negotiated intensively for
the last week here over the scale of market-opening concessions
that China must make to qualify for membership in the global trade
forum, which sets rules and arbitrates disputes.
</P>
<P>
   China has long sought entry, and after years of impasse,
officials from both countries now seem eager for the Chinese to
join. They are trying to put the outlines of a deal together by the
time Prime Minister Zhu Rongji arrives in Washington for an
official visit next week.
</P>
<P>
   More than just a trade deal is at stake. The American and
Chinese governments both see a potential accord as a rare political
breakthrough in a relationship increasingly strained by disputes
over such issues as human rights, nuclear espionage and the NATO
bombing in Yugoslavia, which China condemns.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that agreement might be near on entry into the trade group
were raised over the weekend when President Clinton's trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, left Washington for a quick
trip to Beijing, in hopes of pushing Zhu to make last-minute
concessions on market access for foreign companies in agriculture,
financial services and other areas that the Chinese have long been
protected.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Barshefsky said she did not plan to go home with a
deal, she hoped for breakthroughs. It is unclear whether she got
any, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she spent five and a half hours talking with a senior
trade official, Wu Yi, and with Zhu. But Tuesday night, as Ms.
Barshefsky headed home, she issued a written statement saying that
although there had been ``important progress today in narrowing the
issues,'' there remained ``substantial gaps in critical areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will set no artificial deadlines in these
negotiations,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Commerce William Daley, who is also here on a trade
mission, said he believed that a deal would be reached some time
before the fall. But by then, many in Washington believe, it will
be too close to next year's election campaigning for the
administration to submit China's offerings to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   According to American officials, China has offered some major
concessions. Daley said Zhu told him that his government would
permit the sale of cellular telephones that operate on technology
used by Motorola and other American phone makers. Until now, the
Chinese system favored European producers. China has also indicated
that American companies could buy minority stakes in
telecommunications businesses, but so far it has refused to allow
them to take majority stakes.
</P>
<P>
   China has also not agreed on a resolution of disputes that have
blocked the importing of most types of American wheat. ``Based on
what we have right now,'' an American official said, ``we couldn't
send this thing to the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief China negotiator on Ms. Barshefsky's staff, Robert
Cassidy, will stay on for ``a couple of days,'' an official said,
and then talks are expected to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans seem uncertain whether China plans last-minute
offers _ something not uncommon in trade negotiations _ or whether
its leaders doubt that President Clinton has the will or the
political strength now to get a deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Along with membership in the trade organization, the Chinese
want the protection for their own exports that it would bring. But
with rising unemployment and farmers' protests at home, and
inefficient domestic industries already reeling, they have been
reluctant to cut tariffs and other protective measures as quickly
as Western nations demand.
</P>
<P>
   While China's accession to the trade organization requires the
consent of many countries, satisfying the United States is the most
crucial step. Washington is concerned about a growing deficit with
the Chinese, estimated at $57 billion last year, and officials
believe that lower tariffs here would increase American exports. At
the same time, many American companies have been frustrated by
rules that severely limit their ability to invest or operate.
</P>
<P>
   As anti-China sentiment rises in Congress, officials say, no
agreement can survive without enthusiastic corporate support and
lobbying. And while congressional approval of a China accord is not
required, under the trade body's rules, Congress would have to
rescind a law that requires annual renewal of China's
most-favored-nation trading status.

PANEL DISALLOWS `PHEN' PART OF FEN-PHEN AS EVIDENCE IN DIET DRUG
LAWSUITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A three-judge panel in Harris County, Texas, on Monday
became the first court in the nation to disallow evidence that the
``phen'' part of the ``fen-phen'' diet drug combination has helped
cause heart defects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision was heralded Tuesday by manufacturers of
the ``phen'' drug as precedent-setting, plaintiffs lawyers said
they did not oppose the motion to disallow the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pirtle of the Houston law firm O'Quinn and Laminack said
Tuesday that the ruling was actually a victory for fen-phen
plaintiffs because it has always been clear that the ``fen'' part
of the combination caused the alleged health problems. The ruling
by the judges means that the manufacturers of fenfluramine,
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia, a division of American
Home Products, will not be able to claim that the health problems
were caused by phen.
</P>
<P>
   The panel consists of state District Judges Harvey Brown, Tad
Halbach and Katie Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Pirtle said plaintiffs' lawyers in fen-phen cases throughout the
country have been routinely dismissing the manufacturers of phen
from their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the Food and Drug Administration withdrew
from the market fenfluramine, sold as Pondimin, and a purer version
of the compound, known as dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of
the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, but
primarily by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass. No
studies linked this drug with the heart valve disease.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pirtle said phentermine manufacturers were also
initially sued in Harris County because they marketed phentermine
to prolong the usage of either ``fen`` compound from the usual
period of 12 weeks to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Esnouf, spokesman for Fisons Corp. in Collegeville, Pa.,
which had bought a manufacturer of phentermine in 1995, denied that
phen manufacturers promoted the use of their drug with fen. He said
phentermine is a weight-reduction drug that should be taken on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Harris County) decision should exonerate the phentermine
manufacturers and the physicians who prescribed phentermine,'' said
a press release jointly prepared by Fisons and Medeva
Pharmaceuticals, another manufacturer of phentermine.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has denied that their drugs have caused
heart problems.

NATO ALLIES, UN RUSH AID TO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States rushed hundreds of tents,
thousands of pounds of high-protein biscuits, and numerous pairs of
thermal underwear to northern Albania, while Macedonia awaited
39,000 blankets and 20,000 personal hygiene kits from the United
States as waves of terrified refugees flooded across the Kosovo
border.
</P>
<P>
   International efforts to stem the humanitarian disaster
unfolding in the Balkans kicked into high gear Tuesday as the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees estimated the number of people
spilling across Kosovo's border at nearly 96,000 since NATO's
bombing campaign began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 185,000 more people beyond the reach of relief
efforts may have been displaced within the Yugoslav provinces of
Montenegro, Serbia, and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This is in addition to the 459,500 people _ amounting to about a
quarter of the population of Kosovo _ already made homeless since
the conflict between the Kosovar Albanians and Yugoslavian
government forces erupted a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a very serious refugee crisis, which is
worsening by the hour,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN
commissioner. ``People are arriving exhausted, traumatized, and
terrorized.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has publicly pledged $8.5 million to
the UN refugee commission, at least an additional $20 million will
be funneled into relief efforts from the State Department and the
US Agency for International Development. More money and assistance
will be announced by the White House as early as Wednesday, and UN
relief officials are meeting Thursday to draw up a new relief plan
for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But US government officials coordinating the relief effort say
money is the least of their concerns as Europe, still in the grip
of cold winter winds and snow, tries to cope with the gravest
humanitarian disaster it has faced in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always cover whatever the costs are for the United
Nations agencies and the NGO,'' or nongovernmental organizations,
said Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state. ``Right now, we have
two big problems. The first is getting the agencies and their
people on ground so they can tell us what they need, and two, to
get the assistance there.''
</P>
<P>
   Airports from Tuzla to Skopje are shut down, forcing the United
States, Britain, and UN to ferry supplies in by boat, and shuttle
them through to northern Albania and into Macedonia by truck.
Bosnia and Montenegro are also suffering from refugee overflows.
Airlifts are a distinct possibility, Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions are pouring in from US emergency stockpiles in Pisa,
Italy, but they are a small part of the massive relief operation,
headed by the UN refugees commission. The UN refugees commission
relies on organizations such as the international Red Cross, CARE
International, Catholic Relief Services, and Doctors Without
Borders.
</P>
<P>
   These groups have already swung into action, helping distribute
staples provided by the World Food Program to families hosting
refugees in Macedonia. In Albania, they handed exhausted refugees
packs of high-protein drinks and food as they crossed the border at
Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are facing are bread and butter issues like how to
feed and house people,'' said Jonathan Frerichs, communications
director of Lutheran World Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, the European Union released $10.7 million. The
British government supplied a transport plane to the Albanian
capital of Tirana and donated $800,000 to the international Red
Cross. The Danish government released more than $1 million for
Danish charities in the area. Norway granted $2.7 million in aid,
and Sweden's International Development Agency contributed $300,000
in cooperation with the Swedish Red Cross.

   WASHINGTON _ Dismissing the first Serbian cease-fire proposal in
weeks as unacceptable, President Clinton joined NATO allies Tuesday
in repeated condemnations of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
then raised the stakes with an unprecedented suggestion: Further
atrocities could lead to US support for Kosovo independence.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic offered only to withdraw some troops from Kosovo after
NATO ended its air campaign against the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long backed Milosevic's claim to the southern
province, considered the cradle of Serbian civilization. Kosovo's
leaders have been urged during peace talks to seek only autonomy,
and not full sovereignty. Albanian Kosovars signed a treaty last
month that agreed to a period of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But following Tuesday's unsuccessful peace mission to Belgrade
by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Clinton suggested he
might use the issue of independence as a powerful negotiating tool.
If the violence continues, Clinton said, Milosevic could expect to
see ``the prospect for international support of Serbia's claim to
Kosovo increasingly jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remain steady and determined with the will to see this
through,'' Clinton said of NATO's goal to destabilize Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The thinly veiled threat came as new waves of ethnic Albanians
fled torched villages to safety in neighboring regions, bearing
fresh stories of massacres by Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials described the violence against the Kosovars in
increasingly outraged terms, comparing it to the bloodiest
campaigns of the 20th century. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea,
describing the ``modern-day terror going on in Kosovo,'' said the
busloads of ethnic Albanians being rounded up served as proof
Milosevic had mapped out a strategy to expel the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we haven't seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the
mid-1970s,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Primakov appeared to yield no progress. After
meeting with Milosevic in Belgrade for six hours, Primakov, along
with a group of top Russian aides, flew to Germany, where he
explained to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder the peace agreement
Milosevic had laid out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav proposal, in which Milosevic agreed to begin
withdrawing some Serb forces if NATO airstrikes stopped at once,
was instantly rejected by Schroeder. He then called Clinton, who
concurred, saying, ``President Milosevic's proposal is
unacceptable.'' Both Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to consider the proposal
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, who made the trip to Belgrade at the urging of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, held out hope the conflict might yet be
resolved. Indicating that he might personally play a role in
brokering a future deal, Primakov told reporters in the airport in
Bonn that Milosevic ``even now thinks that all the peaceful
refugees that have left their territory . . . could get back to
their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in general, we think this is a good start,'' Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have opposed the air campaign against
Yugoslavia, and Yeltsin repeated the condemnation Tuesday in his
annual state-of-the-union address. Saying the airstrikes were
``continuing to bypass the United Nations Security Council, in
violation of the UN Charter, reason and common sense.'' Yeltsin
promised ``to put an end to military actions in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian president stopped short of pledging aid to
Yugoslavia. Allaying earlier fears that Russia might offer
extensive political help to the Serb leader, Yeltsin said, ``The
tragic mistake of the United States on the Kosovo issue should not
turn into a prolonged crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has made its choice,'' he said. ``It will not allow
itself to be drawn into the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, protests continued around the world against the
airstrikes. Nearly 6,000 demonstrators converged outside the US
Embassy in Athens on Tuesday, carrying candles and burning British
and American flags at an all-night anti-NATO protest.
</P>
<P>
   A similar demonstration also took place in Spain, and in
Bosnia's Serb-controlled republic, three bombs have exploded
outside Western organizations since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As political leaders carried on their discussions, NATO
continued its own round-the-clock attacks, sending low-flying
planes into the region to target ground troops and tanks, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials did so at the risk of attack from Yugoslav
surface-to-air missiles, which have hardly been seen during combat,
and which Milosevic is believed to be hoarding for use on
low-flying planes in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO forces faced a severely weakened Yugoslav Air Force,
Pentagon officials said. In addition to decimating half of the air
force's best planes in the first days of the air strikes _ gunning
down five Russian-made MiG-29s in less than 72 hours _ NATO
warplanes so far have destroyed several MiG-21 and helicopters,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have drawn some limited criticism from analysts in
the United States, as well as several elected officials, who
believe the military may not be acting quickly enough to stop the
ethnic cleansing on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, one of the chief critics of the US decision
to rule out sending in ground troops, said the air war may not be
damaging the ground war as efficiently as the military would have
liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we anticipated that Milosevic would dramatically
increase the ethnic cleansing if we increased the airstrikes,''
said McCain, Republican of Arizona. ``I think we thought the
airstrikes would have a more debilitating effect than they have...
We got a little spoiled by Desert Storm, when things went exactly
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increased military activity was matched by heightened
fears of instability in the region around Kosovo. Of particular
concern was the neighboring republic of Montenegro, where it was
reported that Milosevic intended to encourage a coup against the
local government. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright phoned
Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, to express her concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt by Belgrade to overthrow the democratically
elected Montenegran government would only ...escalate the conflict
with NATO,'' said State Department spokesman James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was Kosovo itself that continued to attract almost
all the international attention, as world leaders and military
officials struggled to explain the NATO strategy for stopping a
wave of atrocities that has only increased since the airstrikes
began one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this context that Clinton raised the specter of
supporting the Kosovo drive toward independence. Although he did
not explicitly threaten to back the Kosovo Liberation Army, and he
seemed to make the suggestion almost in passing, Clinton did
indicate what may be the next phase of political negotiations with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt what is at stake in Kosovo,''
Clinton said, ``Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But with that strategy could come a separate set of problems,
both at home and abroad. Even if it served as a useful bargaining
tool with Milosevic, such rhetoric might in the long-term spark
revolution in any number of enclaves, said Senator Jack Reed, a
Rhode Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the ultimate trump card with Milosevic,
because it's what he cares about most,'' Reed said. ``He doesn't
care that he's reviled. He's got this image of greater Serbia. But
the problem is, to what extent do you set off a frenzy in the
region of all ethnic minorities? And while you might win on the one
hand, you might lose on the other. The whole reason for this drill
is to prevent instability in the Balkans.''

BOTH SIDES QUIET ABOUT SETTLEMENT TALKS IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Settlement talks began on Tuesday afternoon between
the Microsoft Corp. and the federal and state authorities who filed
antitrust charges against the company almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides emphasized before the discussions started that they
would talk in complete secrecy, and they stuck with that vow on
Tuesday. But it was clear from the opening positions of both
parties that a vast gulf divides them, making a settlement
difficult at best. The case has been in trial since October but is
now in recess until the middle of April.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials have said they believe no settlement
will be effective that does not result in a restructuring of the
company in some way that will change Microsoft's business
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft executives have said they are not willing to
consider the general proposals that have been discussed so far _
forced licensing of the Windows operating system, or breaking up
the company.
</P>
<P>
   As its opening position, Microsoft offered more modest proposals
last week, including the elimination of certain restrictive
contract provisions for computer manufacturers and Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both sides also have strong incentives to try for a
settlement. In Microsoft's case, even friends of the company have
been saying the trial has not gone well, and a settlement would
forestall a more severe remedy that could be imposed should
Microsoft lose the case.
</P>
<P>
   Settling now would also cut off one possible result of the trial
_ a judicial declaration that Microsoft holds a legal monopoly in
personal computer operating systems, a declaration that could
significantly complicate Microsoft's business decisions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   For the plaintiffs _ the Justice Department and 19 states _ a
settlement would obviate appeals, should they win, that would take
years to litigate. A final ruling would probably come long after
many of these elected or appointed officials have left office.
</P>
<P>
   As one senior government official involved in the case said:
``When you look at an antitrust case, finality becomes a very
important factor in itself. These things can be appealed forever.
But with a settlement, the rule of law is imposed immediately.''

promised ``to put an end to military actions in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian president stopped short of pledging aid to
Yugoslavia. Allaying earlier fears that Russia might offer
extensive political help to the Serb leader, Yeltsin said, ``The
tragic mistake of the United States on the Kosovo issue should not
turn into a prolonged crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has made its choice,'' he said. ``It will not allow
itself to be drawn into the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, protests continued around the world against the
airstrikes. Nearly 6,000 demonstrators converged outside the US
Embassy in Athens on Tuesday, carrying candles and burning British
and American flags at an all-night anti-NATO protest.
</P>
<P>
   A similar demonstration also took place in Spain, and in
Bosnia's Serb-controlled republic, three bombs have exploded
outside Western organizations since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As political leaders carried on their discussions, NATO
continued its own round-the-clock attacks, sending low-flying
planes into the region to target ground troops and tanks, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials did so at the risk of attack from Yugoslav
surface-to-air missiles, which have hardly been seen during combat,
and which Milosevic is believed to be hoarding for use on
low-flying planes in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO forces faced a severely weakened Yugoslav Air Force,
Pentagon officials said. In addition to decimating half of the air
force's best planes in the first days of the air strikes _ gunning
down five Russian-made MiG-29s in less than 72 hours _ NATO
warplanes so far have destroyed several MiG-21 and helicopters,
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have drawn some limited criticism from analysts in
the United States, as well as several elected officials, who
believe the military may not be acting quickly enough to stop the
ethnic cleansing on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, one of the chief critics of the US decision
to rule out sending in ground troops, said the air war may not be
damaging the ground war as efficiently as the military would have
liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we anticipated that Milosevic would dramatically
increase the ethnic cleansing if we increased the airstrikes,''
said McCain, Republican of Arizona. ``I think we thought the
airstrikes would have a more debilitating effect than they have...
We got a little spoiled by Desert Storm, when things went exactly
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's increased military activity was matched by heightened
fears of instability in the region around Kosovo. Of particular
concern was the neighboring republic of Montenegro, where it was
reported that Milosevic intended to encourage a coup against the
local government. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright phoned
Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, to express her concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt by Belgrade to overthrow the democratically
elected Montenegran government would only ...escalate the conflict
with NATO,'' said State Department spokesman James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was Kosovo itself that continued to attract almost
all the international attention, as world leaders and military
officials struggled to explain the NATO strategy for stopping a
wave of atrocities that has only increased since the airstrikes
began one week ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this context that Clinton raised the specter of
supporting the Kosovo drive toward independence. Although he did
not explicitly threaten to back the Kosovo Liberation Army, and he
seemed to make the suggestion almost in passing, Clinton did
indicate what may be the next phase of political negotiations with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever any doubt what is at stake in Kosovo,''
Clinton said, ``Mr. Milosevic is certainly erasing it by his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But with that strategy could come a separate set of problems,
both at home and abroad. Even if it served as a useful bargaining
tool with Milosevic, such rhetoric might in the long-term spark
revolution in any number of enclaves, said Senator Jack Reed, a
Rhode Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the ultimate trump card with Milosevic,
because it's what he cares about most,'' Reed said. ``He doesn't
care that he's reviled. He's got this image of greater Serbia. But
the problem is, to what extent do you set off a frenzy in the
region of all ethnic minorities? And while you might win on the one
hand, you might lose on the other. The whole reason for this drill
is to prevent instability in the Balkans.''

   WASHINGTON _ Hampered by overcast skies Tuesday, NATO warplanes
bombarded Serb army forces, airfields and supply depots around the
clock but failed again to knock out air defenses or blunt Serbia's
offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and poor visibility have forced scores of allied
fighter-bombers to abort their missions in the weeklong air
campaign and return to base, their laser-guided bombs still in
their bays, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On only one day in seven have pilots had optimal conditions for
bombing _ a cloud ceiling of at least 25,000 feet and visibility of
more than five miles. Tank-killing A-10 Warthogs have flown air
patrol, but have yet to dare to dip down into the range of
surface-to-air missiles to attack tanks directly.
</P>
<P>
   Under strict rules to attack only when targets are visible, to
avoid civilian damage, pilots have had to dart in and out of clear
patches of sky to drop their payloads. They have been flying mostly
at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather has not been in our favor,'' said Vice Adm. Scott
A. Fry, director of operations for the military's Joint Staff, who
refused to say how many missions had been canceled because of the
weather. ``It has gotten more difficult with each succeeding
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Balkans are notorious for fog and rain, the week
has been unusually difficult, officials said, putting the air
campaign behind schedule, even as Yugoslav troops have stepped up
their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The climate has compelled NATO to rely more heavily on missiles
launched from sea and air, as well as bombs dropped from B-2's, all
of which satellites can guide to fixed targets.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has cropped up. The Air Force is running out of
its most highly prized cruise missiles, launched from B-52's with
2,000-pound warheads. The shortage occurs as NATO gears up for a
possible assault on downtown Belgrade. Those missiles are the
weapon of choice for such missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of the air campaign, United States B-52's
dropped roughly 50 cruise missiles, reducing by one-third the Air
Force worldwide stock of 150. ``That's something that we do worry
about,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon, said Tuesday. ``We have
a supply now. But it won't last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Made by Boeing, the air-launched missiles cost $1 million each
and are prized for their accuracy and powerful punch.
</P>
<P>
   Although equally accurate, the sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missile has a smaller warhead, 500 pounds, and is in ample supply.
They are made by Raytheon and cost $600,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the air war began, the Pentagon ordered a
review of its guided-missiles stocks and decided to proceed without
increasing the supplies. ``We are fully satisfied that we have
sufficient ammunition,'' a senior Pentagon official said Tuesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The secretary of defense and
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs were involved in that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather isn't NATO's only problem. Yugoslav troops and
artillery have dispersed into the region's forests and hilly
terrain. Serbian tanks are parked next to residential buildings,
daring NATO pilots to strike.
</P>
<P>
   To work around this obstacle, NATO wants to use unmanned
reconnaissance drones to reconnoiter the battlefield and transmit
the coordinates of allied warplanes. But the weather has grounded
the drones.
</P>
<P>
   There are also political constraints. Over the past eight days,
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO military commander, has requested
Apache helicopters, only to be turned down by political leaders, a
NATO official said. The helicopters, for use against tanks, suggest
a ground war more than an air war.
</P>
<P>
   Even as commanders poured out their frustration here and at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, the Pentagon tried to put the best face
on the situation, delivering an upbeat assessment in classified
briefings to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and then a sanitized
version to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has flown about 425 combat flights against 100 targets, a
Pentagon official told reporters, ranging from air defense radars
that require only one bomb to weapons factories that require
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with detailed charts, military briefers said Tuesday that
NATO had damaged or severely damaged the systems that integrate
Yugoslavia's vaunted air defenses, its intelligence-gathering
capability, army and police garrisons, and aircraft repair depots.
</P>
<P>
   But Fry and Rear Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, the director of
intelligence for the Joint Staff, repeatedly refused to define
exactly what those terms mean, or just how degraded they believe
Belgrade's capability really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to assign percentages to it,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the first time since the air campaign started
that senior officials from the Joint Staff, which has influence
over the targets bombed 5,000 miles away, had met with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon has given regular briefings but has pointedly disclosed
few operational details.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have clamped down on details
of military operations since last summer's cruise missile strike
against suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. Cohen
and Shelton have justified this approach to avoid leaks of
classified information and to let Clark take the lead in releasing
most information.
</P>
<P>
   The American reticence contrasts with that of Britain, whose
Defense Ministry offers detailed news conferences. And during the
1991 Persian Gulf war, the predecessors of the two admirals who
briefed Tuesday gave daily briefings.

ABDUCTED CHILDREN HEADING HOME TO CALIFORNIA AFTER BEING FOUND WITH
MOTHER IN TEXAS

<P>
   KENEFICK, Texas _ Three children, abducted by their mother two
years ago during a custody dispute in California, were headed back
to their father Tuesday, after being found hiding in a home in this
southeast Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   Eugia Morse, 36, was huddled with the children in a closet when
investigators found them late Sunday, authorities said. The woman,
who had been using the alias Gabriella Escada, remained in the
county jail Tuesday in lieu of a $1 million bond, after being
charged with three counts of child abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morse, a drywall construction company owner from La Mesa,
Calif., was making plans to be reunited today with the children he
has not seen in more than two years _ Aja, 12; Syna, 10; and
Alixander, 7.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Tracy Morse, said he will give them the Christmas
presents that have remained unopened since their abduction on Dec.
13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, described as an actress from La Mesa, and her
children had been staying recently with a woman identified as Sandy
Hayes, of Kenefick, about 45 miles east of Houston, authorities
said. Hayes declined to comment, but investigators said she had
given them lodging for a few days after befriending them at a
church revival meeting and did not know about the abduction case.
</P>
<P>
   Eugia Morse _ who had lost all custody and visitation rights
several weeks earlier _ snatched the children as they were getting
off their bus at their elementary school in California, said Gayle
Falkenthal of the San Diego County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Morse had lost her parental rights after the courts found that
she had made false claims that her ex-husband had beaten her and
molested the children, Falkenthal added. She said Morse also was
diagnosed with serious psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morse and his current wife said they normally drove the
children to school because their mother had threatened to steal
them. That morning, however, their car wouldn't start and they let
them ride the bus, Tracy Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   As the children were leaving the bus, their mother had a singing
telegram delivered to the school's principal, creating a
distraction while she shuttled the children into her car and drove
away, Falkenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person delivering the telegram had a costumed dog and a
bunch of helium balloons,'' she said. ``It was also `Pajama Day'
and a lot of the kids were in their night clothes. It was quite a
diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody saw what happened except the two stepchildren of the
father, who were also on the bus, but then it was too late,''
Falkenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morse never gave up searching for his children, his wife
said, and he recently contacted legislators for help. A photo of
one of the children was distributed nationwide on a direct-mail
flier.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he sued the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District
for failure to adequately protect his children and won a $50,000
judgment in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The children finally were located through photos posted by the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, at www/missing
kids.com on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were seen by a relative of a Houston-area man who
recently married Eugia Morse and then separated from her after a
few months, said Texas Department of Public Safety investigator
Mike Buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This relative was suspicious of the story (Morse) told about
being in the witness-protection program. The photos confirmed it,''
Buck said. ``From what we know, she never told people that she was
divorced and had abducted her children. She usually gave two
stories _ the witness-protection one, or that her husband had
sexually abused her children and she had to remain in hiding
because he was very well off and connected to police.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck said Morse apparently has been in the Houston area since
February 1998, but has not held a steady job. He said she accepted
donations from ``religious people who'd take up collections.''
</P>
<P>
   After separating from her new husband, she rented an apartment
in January north of Houston, authorities said. She left the
apartment, however, after learning that authorities knew she had
been visiting her dying mother at a Houston-area hospital,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The children had not been enrolled in school, but Buck said he
found literature for home-schooling at her apartment. He said he
also found a journal she kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``In it, she would be writing and ask a question of God, and
then there'd be an answer from God in her own writing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Morse said her husband had not sought full custody of the
children after the divorce in 1994 until he learned that the
children had missed half a year of school and were suffering from
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   When the courts began ruling in favor of the father and
stepmother, allegations of abuse began, she said. A court-appointed
evaluator was able to get the children to admit that they had lied
for their mother, she said.

   WASHINGTON _ The growing exodus of refugees from Kosovo _ now
nearly one-third of the ethnic Albanian population of the province
_ has left Clinton administration and NATO officials wondering
whether they will be able to achieve their goal of of Serbs and
ethnic Albanians living together peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a third of the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
have been forced from their homes by Serbian troops, and many of
those refugees have left Kosovo for neighboring Macedonia, Albania
or Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, State Department spokesman, said Tuesday that the
strategy of forcing ethnic Albanians from their homes, under the
direction of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has
crystallized the animosity between the two groups. This
``radicalization'' of the province, he said, was making it ``all
the more difficult to imagine a circumstance where the peoples can
begin to live together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted on Tuesday that the administration stood by the
framework of the Rambouillet accord, which called for Kosovo to
stay within Serbia as an autonomous entity.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials have already started talking about other
outcomes, including talk Tuesday that Kosovo could wind up as a
separate entity under international protection _ if the allies
actually succeed in subduing the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   Sketching the outlines of a protectorate, a NATO planner said
that NATO troops would oversee the return of ethnic Albanian
refugees to Kosovo and guarantee their safety under an arrangement
in which the Serbs would have virtually no power.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British officials said the refugees should be allowed
to return home. The defense minister, George Robertson, said that
Milosevic should not be rewarded for ejecting ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refugees must be allowed to go home, their homes must be
rebuilt,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others were not specific about who would rebuild the
villages or pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The outflow of refugees, many of them traumatized by the
executions they said they had witnessed, could easily destabilize
the fragile countries of Macedonia and Albania, as well as the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Given the speed at which the Serbian forces have pushed the
ethnic Albanians out of their homes, a Balkans specialist in the
administration predicted Tuesday that by the end of the week, half
the Albanian population could be outside the province and the
remainder left crouching in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   In his televised speech last Wednesday, outlining the reasons
for NATO's intervention in Kosovo, Clinton said the conflict
between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians had ``no natural
national boundaries.'' It was necessary, he said, to intervene to
contain its spread.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying a map with bold arrows showing the movement of
refugees, Clinton said on the evening of the bombing: ``Already
this movement is threatening the young democracy in Macedonia,
which has its own Albanian minority and a Turkish minority. Already
Serbian forces have made forays into Albania, from which Kosovars
have drawn support. Albania has a Greek minority. Let a fire burn
here in this area, and the flames will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the bombing started, Milosevic had purposely pushed
refugees to Macedonia and Albania in an effort to throw into
turmoil the very countries that the bombing was supposed to help
protect, a Clinton administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the two million inhabitants of Macedonia are
Albanian and a large inflow of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could
tip the balance into a majority Albanian population, the official
said. Macedonia has about 40 percent unemployment and a new
democracy. Government officials there were appealing Tuesday to the
European Union to take some of the ethnic Albanian refugees, and
foreign ministers from Germany, Austria and Finland said they would
meet Thursday near Bonn to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Albania is the poorest country in Europe, barely able to look
after its own people, and certainly not able to care for the tens
of thousands of new refugees, the Clinton administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, the official said, that NATO troops would have
to be sent to Albania as well as Macedonia _ where a 10,000 strong
NATO force has been poised as peacekeepers for Kosovo _ to help the
two countries control increasing tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to end up with troops in Albania and
Macedonia,'' the Clinton administration official said. ``For
Macedonia these refugees make big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing began last week, NATO officials said they
believed almost 150,000 ethnic Albanian refugees had left the
province. and gone to Albania. Another 22,500 had fled to Macedonia
and 42,500 were now in Montenegro, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the more than 400,000 that had fled their homes
beginning in January of last year when the conflict began, the
number of refugees forced either into neighboring lands or left to
seek shelter in the countryside had reached 570,000 refugees, Jamie
Shea, the NATO spokesman said Tuesday. Kosovo has about 2 million
people, of which 90 percent are ethnic Albanian, and the remainder
Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the border at Macedonia on Tuesday, said that a
line of cars and people on foot stretched for six miles inside
Kosovo, as people tried to leave.
</P>
<P>
   From inside Kosovo, there were reports of a large gathering of
refugees huddled for safety in a valley being shelled by Serbian
artillery and of a forced mass exodus along the eastern road out of
Pristina, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Pec, a town of 100,000 was virtually empty and the
houses, mosques and stores destroyed, NATO said. With Pristina now
a target of ethnic cleansing, there was only one town of any size
-- Gnjilane, south east of the capital -- that had not been
attacked by the Serbs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of the continuing purge of the population were eked
out by satellite phone and in some cases landline phone. But most
were impossible to verify especially after the departure Monday of
the last Western aid groups, the International Committee of the Red
Cross and Medecins Sans Frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no doubt that the people
were being forced from their homes at gun point, and that there
were what Rubin called ``mass murders.''

</P>
<P>
   An ethnic Albanian living in Washington, who spoke on condition
of anonymity because of fear of reprisals against his family, said
he spoke to his parents, and two brothers in Pristina Tuesday by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there's lots of panic because people have fled to
Macedonia and those who are left don't know what to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The villages of Sosali and Matican to the east of the city had
been shelled, leaving a line several miles long of people in cars
and on foot heading for the border of Macedonia, he said. ``My
mother is very concerned about my brothers and their kids. How are
they going to leave and how are they going to leave together?''
</P>
<P>
   There were wild rumors in the city, the Albanian said. There
were stories that more members of the intellectual elite of
Pristina, which before the conflict started had masterminded a
parallel government in an effort to outwit the Serbian repression,
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, Air Commodore David Wilby, said that ``large numbers of
refugees'' were being attacked by artillery in the Pegarusa Valley,
about 20 miles north of the town of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Rubin said a report had been received
for the second day in a row from the Kosovo Liberation Army leader,
Hashim Thaci. Thaci, who initially refused to sign the peace
settlement at Rambouillet and then after two weeks changed his
mind. Rubin said that Thaci, calling from Kosovo on Tuesday, said
``the situation is worse today than it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also said that Thaci reported ``that the killing is more
widespread, that there's shelling of a whole series of towns, that
the Kosovo Liberation Army is doing the best it can under the
circumstances, but that it's becoming increasingly difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to help the refugees with blankets, food and other
essentials, the State Department said tonight that the Pentagon
would air lift supplies to Tirana, the capital of Albania.

   WASHINGTON _ Since the bombing of Yugoslavia began, American
officials have threatened to prosecute perpetrators of violence in
Kosovo, but for that threat to be credible, changes must be made in
the war crimes tribunal that would try them, American officials and
human rights advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, since some of the first atrocities, the
international tribunal has balked at urgings from the Clinton
administration and human rights organizations to aggressively
pursue prosecutions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of relatively inexperienced investigators have
been assigned full time to Kosovo, and it was not until recently
that an investigator was hired who spoke Albanian. American
officials and human rights advocates argue that by failing to act
decisively, the tribunal lost an opportunity to act as a deterrent
force, which it was set up to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tribunal had been aggressive in carrying out its
responsibilities in Kosovo, it might have deterred the genocide
that is now unfolding there,'' said James Hooper, a former American
diplomat and director of the Balkan Action Council.
</P>
<P>
   Actually making criminal cases against Serbian officials
suspected of war crimes would require considerably more action than
the administration and other Western governments have taken so far.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Western governments have been disinclined to share
their intelligence information, tribunal investigators and American
officials have said. And because the tribunal lacks any enforcement
power, its indictments require Western governments to arrest war
criminals, which they have been reluctant to do so far.
</P>
<P>
   A tribunal spokesman, Christian Chartier, has declined this week
to answer any questions about any Kosovo investigation, including
what resources the tribunal would need to fulfill the recent
demands from the Clinton administration and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of what the United States has given the tribunal has
become a contentious one, with American officials bristling at the
suggestion that the Clinton administration has not fully cooperated
with the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, the tribunal's first chief
prosecutor, Richard Goldstone, said the United States had provided
more information to the tribunal than other countries, although
that information had often been slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Britain had recently vowed to give the tribunal all
its evidence that might link the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, to possible war crimes, Goldstone added: ``One must
question whether the information now being offered wasn't available
two, three, or four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt that the United States had provided everything
it could, he said, ``It's impossible to know without knowing
everything they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crux of the problem. Tribunal investigators are
not experienced intelligence gatherers, and intelligence officers
are not policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and lawyers at the tribunal ``don't know how to
ask the right questions because they don't understand the
intelligence community,'' said William Stuebner, who served as an
intelligence officer in the Army and was an investigator at the
tribunal from 1994-1997. On the other hand, he said, ``the
intelligence community, even if they did want to cooperate, is not
geared towards gathering information for a prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, the Clinton administration, along with several
European governments and numerous human rights organizations, began
urging the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, to begin an
investigation last March, after a number of massacres and the
razing of several villages by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   She was urged to focus not only on the massacres but on the
systematic destruction of villages, so that it would not be only
low-ranking soldiers who were prosecuted, but the leaders of the
campaign, all the way up to Slobodan Milosevic, a senior Clinton
administration official said. They wanted her to act quickly and to
issue public, not secret, indictments, so that they would have a
deterrent impact.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arbour, a Canadian lawyer whom friends and colleagues
describe as a cautious and conservative prosecutor, initially
argued that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction over events in
Kosovo, because it was not an armed conflict as defined by the
Geneva Conventions, according to several individuals, inside and
outside the tribunal, who heard her arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It took several months, but eventually, she concluded the
tribunal did have jurisdiction. Still, the tribunal moved slowly.
At a meeting with human rights groups in Washington last August,
Ms. Arbour reacted to demands for a more aggressive investigation
in Kosovo by saying that she did not want to do anything that
looked political, according to several people who were present.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She has also been reluctant to send investigators into Kosovo
without the permission of the Milosevic government. A readily
available alternative was to go in through the Yugoslav province of
Montenegro, which would issue visas at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe she is acting in good faith, and is intent on doing
a good job. She just has very conservative instincts,'' said Aryeh
Neier, president of the Open Society Institute, a private
organization in New York that works for the development of
democratic institutions in former communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights advocates consider the criticism of the
tribunal unfair. They point out that during negotiations with
Milosevic last October, the administration's point man, Richard
Holbrooke, tried but failed to get Milosevic to allow the tribunal
investigators into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal is being called on by the West now because it fits
in with the campaign against Milosevic, and especially with the
desire to avoid sending in ground troops to stop the atrocities,
several human rights advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a sustained commitment to the tribunal,
with resources and with the political will,'' said Michael Posner,
director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, in New York.
``It's like a spigot. They want to turn it on and off as it suits
their purposes. But justice doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that until recently the United States and
other governments had not pushed on the tribunal to investigate
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these governments talk a great game, but when it comes
down to making their information available, they're very
skittish,'' Posner said. ``It remains to be seen whether action
will match their public statements this time.''

COMMENTARY: NO FREE WAR

   WASHINGTON _ It could be even more scary.
</P>
<P>
   We could have Elizabeth Dole in the Oval Office running the war.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine the woman who likes to coordinate the color
of her shoes with the color of the rug on the stage where she gives
a speech dealing with any crisis that involves a lot of
 &UR; variables &LR; , a lot of unpredictable turns that she could not
 &UR; control &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   I cringe at the thought of Dan Quayle as commander-in-chief,
too. You picture him wearing one of those propeller beanies and
annoying generals by playing with the colored pins on the military
maps.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who's getting coached on foreign affairs by his
dad's old wise men, did not exude confidence when he took two days
to come out with a position on Kosovo so vague that The Wall Street
Journal dubbed it ``Clintonian.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is buzzing with testosterone, happy to be engaged in
a matter with more gravitas than Monica Lewinsky. Military talking
heads have replaced legal talking heads. Arguments about armor have
replaced arguments about sex.
</P>
<P>
   There are jitters, as usual, about the Clinton team's spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is scared to death,'' says Sen. John McCain,
the presidential candidate with the most military experience.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the national security adviser is named Sandy, and
seems too easily pushed around on Sunday mornings by George Will.
It's not that President Clinton and many of his advisers came out
of a flower-power, anti-war culture.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply that in hard moments that require clarity, the
Clintonites seem in soft-focus. Nero fiddled; Clinton golfed. The
president and his secretary of state are great at wagging fingers
at strongmen, but you are left with the uneasy feeling that they
may not be ready to do what it takes, or may not even know what it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility is our most precious asset,'' McCain says. ``We
have purchased our credibility with American blood.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't reassuring when the president noted, the day the
bombing began, that he had been ``reading up on the history of that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration was caught off guard by the scale and
brutality of Slobodan Milosevic's purge of Albanian Kosovars
following the NATO bombings. ``There was a gross miscalculation
about how he would react,'' says McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It was disturbingly reminiscent of Robert McNamara's stunning
admission in 1996 that the Vietnam debacle occurred because top
Washington officials were not sophisticated about other nations'
thinking. He said a major lesson of Vietnam was ``know your
opponent.'' Isn't that why we have the State Department, CIA and
NSA?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had to be coached on how to salute more crisply,
always seems tentative in military situations. He never lays the
proper groundwork. He springs wars on us.
</P>
<P>
   His speech to a trade union here the day the bombing began was
not a masterpiece of illumination. One argument he used to justify
the air strikes was that we needed a prosperous Europe that was ``a
good partner with us for trading.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not forceful enough in explaining that America cannot
have wars without casualties.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stealth bomber was shot down Saturday, there was a
frantic reaction, before news that the pilot had been rescued.
Americans expect war to work like a video game now, with missiles
so accurate they can hit the fork but not the spoon. The president
can use the military, as long as it's blood-free. We will fight for
a moral goal as long as nothing morally ambiguous happens. We want
to hide all our anxieties and despair about Vietnam behind the
precision of our fabulous new technology. But force has
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It detracts from our ability to carry out the mission if our
first and major priority is to keep casualties down,'' McCain says.
``Wars, many times, do not go according to plan. This one has not
gone according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the president and his team unfocused and ``feckless''
on foreign policy. ``They have had feckless behavior in Iraq, China
and North Korea, so there is a lack of confidence in this guy,'' he
says. ``It is not so much his personal problems, but he has not
handled foreign policy in a manner that a leader should and it has
eroded people's confidence.''

`10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU': IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, SONNETS AND
STUFF  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among the crop of recent teen-age movies whose plots
parody stories from classic literature, ``10 Things I Hate About
You,'' a high-school ``Taming of the Shrew,'' tries the hardest of
any to season its screenplay with authentic Shakespearean touches.
Students in a writing class at Padua High School (somewhere around
Seattle) are asked to create sonnets. There is an Elizabethan-theme
prom that inspires some fancy hairdos and fetching costumes. And
every now and then the banter among the characters incorporates
actual Shakespearean quotations.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all very clever for a teen-age film, it also feels
terribly forced. One of the many delightful things about
``Clueless,'' the movie that started it all, was a glove-smooth fit
of Jane Austen's ``Emma'' on a teen-age comedy of manners. You
barely sensed Austen's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``10 Things I Hate About You'' has its charms, most
notably Julia Stiles' brash, cheeky portrayal of Katarina Stratford
(known as Kat), the proud, nonconforming ``shrew'' who is ``tamed''
by Heath Ledger's Patrick Verona. A spirited feminist who doesn't
date and sneers at the conformism and idiocy of teen-age social
life, she is a breath of fresh air in the stifling materialistic
atmosphere of today's Hollywood teen-age movies. Ms. Stiles, whose
slightly rushed, impatient delivery sometimes recalls the young
Jane Fonda, lets enough sweetness seep into her portrayal to lend
even the nastiest retort a hint of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, a rough-edged outsider, is a soft-focus teen-age rebel
with an Australian accent. How rebellious is he? He hangs out at a
seedy pool hall and is rumored to have eaten a live duck. But when
all is said and done, he seems awfully mild-mannered. His idea of
impressing Kat is to commandeer the high-school's outdoor sound
system and sing ``Can't Take My Eyes Off You'' to her as the
school's marching band clumsily oompahs along behind him. This is
not an act to challenge the transgressive style of Marilyn Manson.
And Kat is utterly delighted with it. Her taming is so easily
accomplished that it's almost a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Kat and her drippy younger sister Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) live
under the thumb of their divorced father, Walter (Larry Miller), an
insanely overprotective obstetrician. When he tells Bianca that she
is not allowed to date boys unless her man-hating sister does, he
thinks he has secured Bianca's chastity for the foreseeable future.
Kat's taming, which involves cash bribes to Patrick, is part of an
elaborate scheme to liberate Bianca.
</P>
<P>
   The plot and its repercussions almost duplicate the setup of
another recent teen-age film, ``She's All That.'' Both films
involve bribery and the heroine's deception. Both feature a
ludicrously vain preening teen-age ladies' man who is shown up as a
fatuous narcissist. Here he is Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan), a model
who can't resist striking a different pose every few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Gil Junger from a screenplay by Karen
McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, gets in trouble by stirring in too
many subsidiary characters and sketchy subplots. It doesn't help
that Ms. Oleynik's Bianca and Joseph-Gordon Levitt as Cameron, an
ardently devoted classmate who tutors her in French, are
irritatingly blank, colorless screen presences. For off-center
comic embellishment, the movie throws in a writing teacher who's a
rapper, played by Daryl (Chill) Mitchell, and a sex-crazed guidance
counselor (Allison Janney) who writes steamy novels and asks
students to come up with synonyms for words like engorged.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the other recent teen-age comedies, ``10 Things I
Hate About You'' takes place in a super-affluent, all-American
never-never land where high schoolers drive fancy new cars and have
lavish wardrobes. This hothouse world suggests a vintage sitcom
larded with sex and cushioned with money. It isn't anymore real
than ``The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten Things I Hate About You'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It abounds with off-color humor.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun knew his
Huskies believed they were the best team in the nation. On the eve
of Monday night's championship game, Calhoun gathered his players
and brandished a stack of blue index cards that he had compiled on
Duke this season. The blunt-talking coach told them emphatically
and without bluster how the title game was going to play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first team you'll face all year that's as good as
you; but here's what they can't do,'' he said, holding up the
cards, ``and that's how we're going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those meticulous notes yielded three tactics that Calhoun
promised would beguile Duke, snap the Blue Devils' 32-game winning
streak and bring a national championship to Storrs, Conn., on the
Huskies' first trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   All the Huskies had to do was execute.
</P>
<P>
   They did for 40 thrilling minutes, carving out a pulsating 77-74
victory over a Duke team that had the title of One of the Best Ever
bestowed upon it by most observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say it,'' said Ricky Moore, UConn's defensive
stopper. ``We have great players on this team and we showed it
today.''
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, the Huskies (34-2) wanted Trajan Langdon to
bring the ball up court. So that meant pressuring the sophomore
point guard William Avery, who is a better ball handler and
penetrator than Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   The risk was putting the ball into the hands of an all-American
and the best shooter in college basketball. Langdon scored a
team-high 25 points _ 15 on spectacular 3-point bombs from beyond
21 feet _ but not without feeling the wrinkles and sweat of Moore's
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With Avery watching from the perimeter, the Blue Devils (37-2)
were forced to shoot 24 times from beyond 15 feet _ including 19
3-pointers. In having to hurry long-range shots, Duke looked human
_ shooting a season-worst 41.1 percent over all from the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 25 seconds, it was apparent how Moore's full-court
pressure had worn down Langdon. The Duke senior guard tried to win
the game by taking Moore to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed solid and stayed down; I was right there,'' Moore
said of how he forced Langdon to travel with 5.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After Khalid El-Amin sank two free throws to make the score
77-74, Langdon tried to dribble down the court for a game-tying
score. But Moore and company were there to strip the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job funneling me toward the sideline,'' a
dejected Langdon said of the play that ended the game. ``There were
three people there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Langdon would never have been placed in such a desperate
situation if the Huskies had failed to execute the second part of
their strategy: double-team all-American and player of the year,
Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Calhoun gave his 6-foot-11-inch center Jake Voskuhl
one instruction _ don't foul. He told the 245-pound Voskuhl to bang
Brand and wait for help.
</P>
<P>
   So whenever Duke tried to get the ball inside, 6-7 Kevin Freeman
fronted Brand while Richard Hamilton and El-Amin rotated to the
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great team defense,'' said Voskuhl, whose two points
and three rebounds could not illustrate how strong a wall he put up
inside. ``We got help from everyone and everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brand, 6-8 and 265 pounds, would not have been held to just
eight shots and 15 points if Connecticut didn't keep throwing fresh
players at Duke. Calhoun intended to run as many of his players at
the Blue Devils as possible to keep everybody fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were deeper offensively,'' he said. ``But I thought we
were deeper defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Souleymane Wane, Albert Mouring, Edmund Saunders and Rashamel
Jones played a combined 43 minutes for the Huskies. The Blue
Devils' bench of Nate James, Corey Maggette and Chris Burgess
played 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' bench outscored the Blue Devils', 17-8,
outrebounded it, 8-1, and Wane and Saunders spent a combined seven
fouls battering Brand on the double teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it really tough to get open looks,'' Brand said.
``They were fighting every time I touched it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Calhoun counted on his all-American, Hamilton, and point guard,
El- Amin, to carry the offensive load. And they did. Hamilton spun,
slashed, rained 3-pointers and created his own shots on the way to
27 points. El-Amin added 10 points in the second half. Together,
the duo scored 26 of Connecticut's 40 second-half points, including
the final 11.
</P>
<P>
   But that alone isn't what brought the Huskies a championship at
Tropicana Field. It was Connecticut's confidence and Calhoun's
index cards that did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this club says about loving and caring for each other,
they mean,'' said an emotional Calhoun. ``When you have that kind
of group you don't even know that you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their stopper, Moore, says, you have a college basketball
team that deserves to mentioned among history's very best.

   KUKES, Albania _ In the darkness, the little villages in the
rolling hills and river valleys around the northwestern Kosovo city
of Djakovica emptied out Tuesday morning, with the residents
rushing _ literally for their lives _ to beat the 5 a.m. deadline
set by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Serbian forces methodically went from village to
village in what is called the Has district, the refugees said. The
troops told the villagers that they had to leave or they would be
killed in the morning, and so the villagers fled toward Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They joined the 60,000 ethnic Albanians who came the day before
and who had apparently been forced to flee from another area of
Kosovo, to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Halilaj, 27, came to the border today. ``They came
yesterday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon,'' he said. ``They said if
we were still there at 5 o'clock in the morning, `We will kill
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so in Damjan, and the other villages, ethnic Albanians
packed what they could _ wooden baby cradles elaborately painted in
folk patterns were common _ and climbed into carts pulled by farm
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., about 10,800 had crossed the border and officials
estimated they were coming at the rate of 2,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the long columns of tractors, a very few cars and people on
foot came across the border, the only difference in their accounts
was the time the Serbs arrived. They were told to leave, they were
robbed, their identity documents were taken away and they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came at 10 o'clock in the morning,'' said Gezim Sela of
the village of Gershin. ``They said if somebody was found in the
village after 5 o'clock in the morning, they would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the accounts were virtually identical, pointing to
the methodical, well-organized nature of what appears to be a
government campaign to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, who
make up 90 percent of the population. The refugees fear the troops'
past record of atrocities. There was no question in the villagers'
minds that they had to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had 10 tanks and 5 military minibuses,'' said Ymer
Pnishi, 65, from Damjan, driving one of the tractors in a long
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soldiers told us to leave the village by 5 o'clock,'' he
said. ``We have nothing with us, no bread, no water. Nobody was
killed, but they burned the village. They looted the homes and took
everything of worth, and after, they burned the village.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo thus far have
been attributed to special Interior Ministry policemen or
paramilitaries or to the private armies of ultra-nationalists like
Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan. But some refugees today
said they thought that some of the warnings were delivered by
soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army. This could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   While the warnings alone were enough to set off the exodus of
villagers, refugees also gave accounts of killings and other
atrocities in the last few days, giving weight to their fears.
While these also could not be independently confirmed, there
appeared to be a pattern of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed my 10 brothers, and I am alone,'' wailed Naxhije
Zymi, 55, as a group of refugees rested by the side of the road
leading from the border.
</P>
<P>
   Her account of a mass killing in the village of Krushe Evogel on
Friday conformed with other accounts given by refugees and with
accounts that the observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe here have also heard from refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday the police came early in the morning _ they executed
almost 100 people,'' Ms. Zymi said, mimicking the spraying of an
automatic rifle. ``They killed them all _ men, women and children.
They set a fire and threw the bodies in the fire and put car tires
on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Halilaj, a university graduate in economics, said three of his
cousins, all with the family name of Osmani, had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he said, as the NATO bombing was beginning,
a group of six Serbian men wearing ski masks over their faces
entered one neighborhood in the city of Dakovica and burned down
about 50 Albanian-owned shops and 35 houses.
</P>
<P>
   They separated the men from the women and children and killed 11
men, he continued, leaving their bodies in the street in the
morning for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city was very scared,'' he said, and added that more than
10,000 people in the city of roughly 60,000 had fled southward, but
he said that most of them are trapped on the road near the village
of Raqa, about a mile away from Dakovica, surrounded by Serbian
forces and unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   Under gray, chilly skies at the border post, 64-year-old Dull
Gunxi lay on a tractor cart, wrapped in a blanket, his face a mask
of cuts and crusted blood from a tank shell that hit his home in
Damjan on Sunday. His wife and children had similar wounds.
</P>
<P>
   They fled to the home of friends in the nearby village of
Tepnish seeking safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Tepnish, Monday's order to leave came at 4 in the afternoon.

JAZZ SINGER JOE WILLIAMS DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB BLUMENTHAL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Williams, the master of blues and ballad singing whose
vocals were crucial to the success of the ``New Testament'' Count
Basie band, and whose subsequent work on his own made him a
reigning jazz star for four decades, died in Las Vegas on Monday
night. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Admitted to a hospital last week for a respiratory ailment, Mr.
Williams ( scheduled to play the Regattabar in August) had
apparently left without informing hospital staff, and was
attempting to walk to his nearby home when he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and Tony Bennett are the last of what I call the graceful
genre, the folks who wear tuxes and take the time to say hello and
sign autographs,'' young vocalist Kevin Mahogany noted recently.
``They set a standard, especially for singers, and they have
managed to remain graceful after 40 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fortunate enough to have encountered Mr. Williams knew
that this grace was not feigned. He was one of the music's true
aristocrats, and he had worked in obscurity for years before Basie
gave him his crucial break.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams was born Joseph Goreed on Dec. 12, 1918, in
Cordele, Ga., and moved to Chicago at an early age. He broke into
nightclubs with clarinetist Jimmie Noone, and through the 1940s
enjoyed brief affiliations with Coleman Hawkins, Andy Kirk, and Hot
Lips Page, among others. It was his 1955 recordings of ``Every Day
I Have the Blues'' and ``All Right, OK, You Win'' with Count Basie
that finally brought him national attention, and in turn ensured
the success of Basie's recently reorganized orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 interview, Mr. Williams credited the Basie musicians
with helping him perfect his urbane style. ``I've been surprised
and pleased at how closely they listen to singers,'' he said.
``Benny Powell, one of Basie's trombonists, pointed out to me that,
no matter how softly I wanted to sing, I had to push in on the
diaphragm. It's basically an awareness of what you want from your
voice and what point you're trying to make.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was an all-around singer who also excelled with popular
ballads, Mr. Williams was most influential with his sophisticated
approach to blues material. ``Joe definitely dressed the blues
up,'' Mahogany explained. ``He made it okay to listen to the blues
for those who misperceived what they were all about. He pointed the
blues in another direction from just sitting out in a field and
moaning about your life. His diction was very proper, without a lot
of slang and idioms, and that made a big difference. And as he
aged, he learned finesse, how to be powerful when necessary without
being strong all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basie identification stuck with Mr. Williams, although the
singer had launched a solo career by 1961. Touring with a rhythm
section that has featured pianist Norman Simmons as musical
director for the past two decades, Mr. Williams was a regular at
clubs, festivals, and jazz cruises, where his conviviality brought
many fans back year after year. His Las Vegas home base and
friendship with Johnny Carson also landed Mr. Williams numerous
guest shots on ``The Tonight Show'' that together with a recurring
role as Bill Cosby's father-in-law on ``The Cosby Show,'' made him
perhaps the most widely exposed artist in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The consistent quality of Mr. Williams's performances in the
past decade, which are documented on several Verve and Telarc CDs,
set him apart from many of his aging contemporaries. ``They did a
lot of things that I didn't do and probably had a better time,'' he
joked when asked about his superior staying power in 1994, but it
was the intelligent application of his rare talents that made Mr.
Williams seem to get better with age. ``Here's to Life'' was his
last anthem, and it testifies to the spirit that illuminated his
art to the end.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of his available recordings are ``Every Day: The
Best of the Verve Years'' and ``Ballad and Blues Master,'' both on
Verve. His appearance on Marian McPartland's ``Piano Jazz'' has
also been released on a Jazz Alliance CD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mr. Williams leaves his son, Joe; and
his daughter, Anne.

JURY AWARDS $81 MILLION TO OREGON SMOKER'S FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: INSERTS 2 grafs with comment from family's lawyer bgng
`William A. Gaylord ...'; Pickup 10th graf   pvs, Gary Black ...) 
 (th) 
 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state jury in Portland, Ore., Tuesday ordered the largest
award in a smoking-related lawsuit, ruling that Philip Morris Cos.
must pay $81 million to the family of a man who smoked Marlboro
cigarettes for four decades before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, coming just a month after a San Francisco jury
awarded $51 million in another case brought by an individual smoker
against Philip Morris, could indicate that the tobacco industry's
legal fortunes may have shifted, analysts said. In recent years,
the public has witnessed a constant drumbeat of documents damaging
to cigarette makers, which industry analysts say may be a factor in
the jury decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in both cases involving Philip Morris, the juries
called for large punitive damages, which are meant to punish a
company for its behavior. In Tuesday's decision, the jury awarded
$79.5 million in punitive damages and $1.6 million in compensatory
damages to the family of Jesse Williams, a janitor who died in
1997, five months after lung cancer was diagnosed. In the San
Francisco case, the jury awarded $50 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Mayola, said Tuesday that he had had a dying
wish. ``He wanted to make cigarette companies stop lying about the
health problems of smokers,'' she told The Associated Press. ``This
jury agreed with his goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which is appealing the California verdict, said
Tuesday that it would also appeal the Oregon verdict. Higher courts
have thrown out the few previous victories by smokers in
cigarette-related lawsuits, often on procedural grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No verdict has ever withstood an appeal, and we don't believe
this will be a first one,'' said Gregory Little, the associate
general counsel for Philip Morris, which is the country's largest
cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco industry analysts said Tuesday's decision was a
particular setback for cigarette makers because state product
liability laws in Oregon are far tougher than those in California
or Florida, the other states in which producers have suffered legal
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, a smoker is barred from receiving an award if a jury
determines that he or she bore more than 50 percent liability for
the problem over which a suit was brought.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette company lawyers argued that Williams was aware of the
health risk when he decided to continue smoking. The jury
determined that Williams and Philip Morris equally shared
liability.
</P>
<P>
   William A. Gaylord, a lawyer for the Williams family, said the
family had always acknowledged that Williams was partly responsible
for his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has been that Philip Morris and other cigarette
companies have never accepted an ounce of responsibility,'' Gaylord
said. ``They deny everything. They essentially say to their very
best customers that you get what's coming to you for believing
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York, said that added to the California decision,
Tuesday's verdict suggested that the industry's $206 billion
settlement last year with 46 states had failed to put its legal
troubles to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, which resolved lawsuits brought by the
states to recover health care expenses related to smoking,
individual smokers and groups of them can still sue. Four states
had earlier settled their claims in deals with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has got to get its head out of the sand
and stop believing that the settlement got them closure,'' Black
said. ``With all the documents and whistleblowers out there, juries
are increasingly going to award damages.''
</P>
<P>
   In trading following the verdict, Philip Morris stock fell
$3.4375 a share to close at $37.75.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the California case last month, the jury ordered Philip
Morris to pay $51.5 million to Patricia Henley, a California woman,
who said that her lung cancer had been caused by more than 35 years
of smoking. That verdict was the largest award of its kind until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette industry officials have portrayed that case as an
aberration, pointing to a number of recent legal victories. Earlier
this month, a federal jury in Akron, Ohio, ruled that tobacco
companies did not have to repay to dozens of union health and
benefit plans in that state the costs of treating smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that the back-to-back losses by Philip Morris
in individual cases suggested that cigarette makers were likely to
see more defeats and escalating awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to appear in the last two cases that the juries
wanted to punish Philip Morris and the industry,'' said Bonnie
Zoller, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon lawsuit was brought by the wife and children of
Williams, a former janitor in the Portland school system who was 67
when he died. It charged that Philip Morris knew cigarettes caused
cancer and misrepresented that information. It sought $101 million
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In making its finding, the Oregon jury also had to conclude that
the misrepresentations Philip Morris was accused of took place over
the past decade because state law limits the time for which
plaintiffs can seek damages.
</P>
<P>
   Little, the Philip Morris lawyer, said he believed that despite
the two recent decisions, tobacco producers would continue to
prevail in the courtroom. ``The industry has been very successful
defending individual cases,'' he said. ``And we continue to believe
that we will continue to be successful defending them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 500 smoking-related lawsuits pending against
Philip Morris. President Clinton also announced earlier this year
that he had directed the Justice Department to begin preparing a
lawsuit against cigarette makers to recover Medicare and other
federal money spent treating illnesses related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Black said a federal lawsuit could be in the industry's interest
because it might provide a way to resolve individual cases as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has got to make a decision,'' Black said. ``They
have to recognize that the tide has turned and decide they have to
get some type of settlement. Either that or they have to build in
the anticipated price of litigation in the cost of cigarettes.''

RENAULT NAME NOT TO BE REVIVED IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TAURUS-DESIGN)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having agreed last week to buy a little more than a
third of Nissan Motor Co., Renault SA may start selling Renault
cars under the Nissan name in the United States someday, but it has
no plans to revive the Renault name in the American market,
Renault's chairman and chief executive, Louis Schweitzer, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Renault may start selling vehicles using its own name in
Mexico and possibly build these cars at a Nissan factory in that
country, Renault has no intention of using its own name in the
American market because its reputation is so weak, Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Renault brand image in the U.S. is poor, that's a fact,''
he said. ``It reminds people of cars that rusted, which was true
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer's plans, including his blunt assessment of Renault's
reputation in the United States, were another sign of the enormous
importance of brand names in the consolidation of the auto
industry. The purchased companies have been those with strong
brands, not just big factories or strong engineering staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said that Renault might try to sell Nissan sport
utility vehicles in Europe under the Renault name. But in the
United States, Renault will try to use Nissan's reputation for
quality cars at reasonable prices, while trying to enliven Nissan's
designs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try, Nissan and Renault, to bring products that have
not already been done by a competitor. I do not believe in a me-too
attitude,'' Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. bought the car operations of Volvo this year
mainly because Volvos have a strong worldwide image for safety and
are popular with women and baby boomers. Part of Chrysler Corp.'s
attraction for Daimler-Benz before the companies formed
DaimlerChrysler last November was the strength of Chrysler's Jeep
and Dodge brands.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, said the Japanese
automaker planned to step up efforts to cut costs after the
business consolidation with Renault and was not looking at the
partnership as a way of avoiding difficult moves. ``This
restructuring plan will be front-loaded and brought forward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa and Schweitzer spoke at a briefing for automotive writers
at the New York International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   At other events for the news media on Monday night and Tuesday
morning, executives of General Motors Corp. acknowledged that it
may take longer than originally predicted for the company to
replace some small car factories with new assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's president and chief operating
officer, said that because GM was mainly interested in increasing
light-truck production, he was not especially concerned about the
growing likelihood that the company would have to delay the
construction of new small-car factories.
</P>
<P>
   GM had been close two months ago to an agreement with local
units of the United Automobile Workers union on work rules for the
new factories, which would rely heavily on snapping together large
pieces of vehicles that would be manufactured by outside suppliers.
Many of these suppliers are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's national leadership stopped the talks last month
after becoming concerned that local union units were competing with
each other to be more generous to the company. Stephen Yokich, the
union's president, said on Sunday that the union had deep concerns
about so-called modular assembly techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner said that GM would have to discuss these concerns with
the union. GM's national contract with the union expires in
September.
</P>
<P>
   GM needs to replace assembly plants to lower its production
costs in the small-car market, a swiftly shrinking and unprofitable
market segment that GM dominates.

UCONN FINDS OFF-COURT GAINS IN BASKETBALL PROWESS

<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Just six years ago, after enduring yet another
round of frustrating negotiations to get more money from the state
legislature, Harry J. Hartley, then the president of the University
of Connecticut, declared facetiously that he wanted to turn UConn
into a prison because ``that's the only way I see to get assured of
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately Hartley and his successor found another way to
achieve that goal: basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the success of both the men's and women's teams,
which culminated Monday night with the Huskies' victory in the
national men's final, university officials have managed to secure
$1 billion from the legislature, lure prize professors and attract
a surge of applications from prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does athletics help?'' Hartley, now an education
professor, asked Tuesday as the campus throbbed with Husky fever.
``Let me count the billion ways.''
</P>
<P>
   And while a string of powerhouse basketball teams over the past
several years, including a national champion women's team in 1995,
has given UConn a taste of the riches and recognition that come
with sports success, the upset of top-ranked Duke University, seen
in about 17 million homes, has the university's officials dreaming
even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn has been a serious academic institution for many
decades, but athletics has enabled us to grow exponentially,'' said
its president, Philip E. Austin. ``It helps us recruit students,
enhances our ability to sell our program to the state legislature,
and energizes alumni and others who might be called on for
philanthropic support.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials say they can already measure the benefits
of having strong teams. Their bragging points include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Donations have increased from $6 million five years ago to $20
million last year and an expected $25 million this year. Over those
five years, thanks to donations and a strong stock market, the
assets of the school's foundation grew from $50 million to $175
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Campus tours for prospective students increased from 9,000 at
this time last year to 12,000 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of applications has risen 14 percent in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since 1995, 97 construction and renovation projects _ have
been completed, and 51 are under way.
</P>
<P>
   The glow of mounting respect added to a frenzy Tuesday on
campus, after many of the 15,000 undergraduate students stayed up
all night, some singing ``Kumbaya'' over burning pizza boxes, then
greeted the returning team at a huge pep rally with the winning
score from the championship game, 77 to 74, displayed in lights on
each wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke Who?'' said a sheet hanging from the third floor of one
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff benefit of winning teams is such a well-known
phenomenon among university administrators that they even have a
name for it _ ``the Flutie factor,'' for the 33 percent increase in
applications that Doug Flutie helped bring Boston College when he
was a football star there in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nation's best-known institutions can profit from a
burst of television exposure for its teams. In 1996, after
Northwestern University enjoyed a Cinderella football season and
made it to the Rose Bowl, the admissions office had to print more
applications and add phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems funny to say that sports validates an institution for
a student who wants to major in science or music, but students want
to go to a school that people are talking about,'' said Rebecca R.
Dixon, Northwestern's associate provost for university enrollment.
``It may be subliminal, but it is real.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what has happened in the past decade to
UConn, once an unglamorous, middle-of-the-pack school marooned in
the hills of eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hartley, who was president from 1990 to 1996, UConn
basketball players became lobbyists, traveling to Hartford to tell
lawmakers about how difficult it was to recruit athletes when the
library was swathed in plastic sheeting to keep the bricks from
falling.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors criticized Hartley for his aggressive promotion
of sports, but it worked. In 1995, the year the women's team
captured the national championship, the legislature voted to give
the school $100 million a year for 10 years for construction and
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate president pro tempore, Kevin B. Sullivan, said the
basketball dominance was a crucial factor in winning his
colleagues' support for the huge financing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to say every legislature and citizen in Connecticut
was transfixed when they recruited a top physics professor from
Iowa, but that just isn't the real word,'' Sullivan said. ``It was
the athletics that go people to think again about UConn in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   C. Peter Magrath, the president of the National Association of
State Universities and Land Grant Colleges in Washington, said that
as a result, UConn is winning a national reputation for rapid
improvement after decades of quiet. ``They have a lot on the plate
and it seems to be cooking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the discomfort many in academia feel about the role
of athletics in a university's image, Magrath then joked, ``This is
a great moment for the state of Connecticut to move forward and
have an academic and educational program that its basketball team
can be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The school is not content to stop with domination in basketball.
For several years, UConn officials have been pushing to build a
bigger stadium to meet the NCAA's requirements for Division I-A,
putting the university _ now Division I-AA _ in the elite of the
nation's college football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UConn is on the verge: a main selling point of the state's
plan to build a stadium for the New England Patriots in Hartford is
the provision that the university use the field for home football
games.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the stadium, which has run into several hurdles
since the legislature blessed the plan in December, seized on the
euphoria about the Huskies as proof that a winning team would be
worth the project's high price. Digital highway signs, which
usually blink out bleak news about spills and bottlenecks, Tuesday
said, ``UConn Men's Basketball/1999 NCAA Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds greeted the Huskies' charter jet at Bradley Airport,
with players wandering into the crowd to accept hugs and dispense
high-fives. Families waved from overpasses on the 30-mile route to
Storrs.
</P>

ALABAMA SENATE ENDS FEUD ON LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S POWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After more than a month of fierce factional deadlock
and ridicule, the Alabama state Senate on Tuesday found its way out
of the procedural chaos that had prevented any legislation from
being passed and threatened to paralyze state government.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a deadline that was jeopardizing Gov. Donald
Siegelman's first-year legislative agenda, the governor's
Democratic allies agreed to return some of the power that they had
stripped from Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican. In exchange,
Windom agreed to share control over the Senate with Democratic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the compromise, senators agreed to end the
lawsuits, the talk of impeachment, and the personal recriminations
that many legislators said represented a new low in Alabama
politics, which has never been known as a model of high-minded
public policy. When the Senate reconvenes next Tuesday, it will
have 18 days to pass a state budget and consider the governor's
plan for a state lottery. (State law limits the Legislature's
session to 30 working days, 12 of which were used up in the
dispute.)
</P>
<P>
   The paralysis began in January, when Democrats backed by
Siegelman _ who have a slight edge in the Senate _ voted to strip
the lieutenant governor of the power to make committee assignments
and direct the flow of legislation (the lieutenant governor had
five Democrats supporting him). That power has traditionally been
vested in the lieutenant governor, but when Windom was elected in
November as the first Republican in that office this century, he
threatened to hold up some of Siegelman's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his power, Windom took some unusual actions to
regain it. On March 3, after an ally in the Senate moved to restore
his power, Windom declared that the Senate had unanimously approved
the measure on a voice vote, despite a platoon of screaming
Democrats voting no. The noise, which frightened one little girl in
the gallery to tears, also scared the governor, who realized that
his agenda could be threatened if Democrats, who began to boycott
the Senate sessions, could not reach agreement with Windom's
faction.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman called an unusual special session of the Legislature
to solve the dispute, but tension ran so high that Windom refused
to leave the chamber even for a bathroom break during the
round-the-clock session lest Democrats find a way to replace him.
To illustrate his plight, Windom announced on Sunday that he felt
obliged to urinate in a jug behind the podium during the
negotiations, and the remark was picked up by headline writers,
radio talk shows and national television programs, making the
situation appear ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   But after Tuesday's compromise, Windom declared that all the bad
publicity was worth it, and even took what he called a ``people's
gavel victory lap'' by plane around the state to announce his
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people won a great victory,'' he said in an interview on
Tuesday. ``The governor tried to take tremendous power, but the
lieutenant governor has been restored to an office that does wield
the people's gavel and protects the state.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief antagonist in the Senate, President Pro Tem Lowell Ray
Barron, said that Windom was wrong to call the compromise a
personal victory, agreeing only that the people would benefit from
an end to the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to fly around the state declaring a victory is about
as embarrassing as what he did behind the podium in the jug,''
Barron said. ``This is only a victory in that the people's business
can now be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, Windom will not be able to bottle up
legislation or approve any more voice votes, but his faction will
retain some power over budget bills and some authority over
committee assignments. He said he would not block the governor's
principal legislative goal _ a state lottery with proceeds
designated for education _ even though he opposes it. The lottery
will go before the voters if it is approved, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Stewart, chairman of the political science
department at the University of Alabama, said the episode showed
that Democrats must take more seriously the growing power of
Republicans in Alabama. But Stewart said it also demonstrated that
the Legislature had a great deal of work to do if it is to rise
above a dysfunctional level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature still has such a limited agenda, and such a
limited conception of what the basic policy-forming institution of
the state should be about,'' Stewart said. ``They're still not
identifying the state's real problems, or coming up with solutions.
They're still responding to interest-group pressures. But at least
now, they'll be able to function, for a while.''

BOTTLED WATER NOT NECESSARILY BETTER THAN TAP WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.) (mk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People who buy bottled water cannot be sure that it
is purer or safer than tap water, an environmental advocacy group
said in a report issued Tuesday after sampling 1,000 bottles of
water sold under 103 brand names.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said samples of bottled water contained bacteria or chemicals in
levels that were considered unsafe because they might cause cancer
or other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bottled water tested was of good quality, but some
brands' quality was spotty,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contamination posing immediate risks to healthy people is
rare,'' it said. ``However, blanket reassurances from the bottled
water industry that bottled water is totally safe and pure are
false. No one should assume that just because water comes from a
bottle it is necessarily any purer or safer than most tap water.''
</P>
<P>
   The council is seeking stricter federal controls on bottled
water, either by tightening the regulations imposed by the Food and
Drug Administration or by transferring jurisdiction to the
Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates tap water.
</P>
<P>
   In 23 of the 103 brands tested, at least one bottle violated
California's strict limits for some contaminant, usually arsenic or
one of several cancer-causing man-made organic chemicals. In 18 of
the brands, at least one bottle was found to contain more bacteria
than would be allowed under guidelines for microbial purity that
are recommended by some states.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the EPA has reported that in 1996 about one in 10
community tap water systems, serving about one-seventh of the U.S.
population, violated tap water treatment or contaminant standards.
</P>
<P>
   The International Bottled Water Association, an industry group,
said the environmental group's testing ``confirms the quality
results of the industry's own testing program.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade association said that under the FDA, which has the
authority to recall and seize tainted products, there were no
confirmed reports in the United States of illness or disease linked
to bottled water in 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, the Environmental Law Foundation, a
nonprofit group based in Oakland, Calif., filed a lawsuit against
eight bottled-water companies alleging that their brands had
violated California laws by advertising the purity of their
products and by failing to provide notification to consumers of
possible contamination. The complaint was based on the Natural
Resources Defense Council's report.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of bottled water have tripled in the last 10 years, to
about $4 billion annually.

SPORTS ARENA BECOMES LAGOS-LAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Sports Arena, rarely (if ever) confused for an
amusement park, became Lagos-land on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, is the birthplace of the starting
centers for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Hakeem Olajuwon grew up in Lagos, attended the
University of Houston, and was the first player selected in the
1984 NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, the Clippers used the league's first pick
to choose Michael Olowokandi, the University of Pacific star whose
father is a Nigerian diplomat. Olowokandi grew up in England.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian centers aren't exactly unacquainted, although
Tuesday's game was their first official on-court meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers did play in Houston earlier this month, but an
ankle injury limited Olowokandi to participation in the morning
shoot around. But he did cross paths and exchange pleasantries with
Olajuwon, who looked at the rookie's shoes and announced that they
were quite ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Numb and numbers: An examination of league-wide statistics
reveals that Clipper Maurice Taylor is looking up at the rest of
his power-forward peers when the subject is rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pulling down 20 in a double-overtime loss to Vancouver,
the 6-8, 250-pound Taylor is averaging a disappointing (not to
mention puzzling) five rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Clippers rank 21st in the league in
rebounding, meaning eight other teams are worse at rebounding than
they are.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers take a back seat to no team when it comes to
allowing the other team to make a high percentage of its field-goal
attempts. Clipper foes are connecting on 47.7 percent of their
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Point of no return?: The Clippers' next game date is Thursday in
Dallas, where point guard Sherman Douglas is eligible to bring his
sore thigh off the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas is expected to remain on the IL until the wheel is
fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday also happens to coincide with the end of Troy Hudson's
10-day contract. Hudson, who arrived from the CBA when injury and
circumstance found Douglas and Pooh Richardson on the IL at the
same time, could be signed to another 10-day deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the completion of the second 10-day contract, the team would
have to sign Hudson for the remainder of the season or give him the
boot.
</P>
<P>
   But the latter option seems risky, because Hudson has provided
an end-to-end spark rarely seen this season at the point. Not to
worry, faithful Clips fans; the team is expected to give Hudson and
second 10-day run, then sign him for the remainder of the season.

`THE UNDERGROUND ORCHESTRA:' DOCUMENTARY ON MUSICAL EXILES IN
PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of ``The Underground Orchestra,'' Heddy Honigmann's
moving documentary about exiled musicians living in Paris,
Argentine classical pianist Miguel Angel Estrella recalls the
shattering events that drove him to leave his country when it was
governed by a repressive military regime. Arrested and tortured,
Estrella was accused of giving aid and comfort to anti-government
forces (the lower class, which his captors dismissed as ``scum'')
simply because he played for the poor. The fact of his being a
musician was deemed sufficient to stimulate a dangerous class
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   While Estrella was blindfolded and shackled, his hands were
severely injured, and he was told they would be severed. But just
before an execution that he believed was imminent, the torture
stopped. Years of medical treatment in France eventually enabled
him to regain the use of his hands and to play the piano again.
</P>
<P>
   This pianist's story, related in a tone more sad than
embittered, is one of many loosely woven tales in a documentary
that begins as a study of Parisian subway musicians, then broadens
into a poignant meditation on social and political exile.
</P>
<P>
   Like this Dutch filmmaker's earlier documentaries, ``Metal and
Melancholy'' and ``O Amor Natural,'' explorations of South American
attitudes toward cars and sex that carry a much broader resonance
than these subjects might suggest, ``The Underground Orchestra'' is
an open-ended celebration of human tenacity and life force that
builds up a compelling personal vision in a offhanded, roundabout
way. One reason it's so inspiring is that you never sense a mawkish
triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed. That spirit
reveals itself bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Underground Orchestra'' begins with a descent into the
Paris Metro, where musicians from countries all over the world
jubilantly perform for handouts. Those who don't have work
passports are constantly on guard against being arrested by the
police, who seem to have a fairly laissez-faire attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Among the musicians we meet are a Venezuelan harpist whose
ethereally gorgeous strumming transforms a subway tunnel into a
Orphean cave, a father-and-son violin duo from Romania and a
classical violinist from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanians tell of how their initial euphoria after the fall
of communism quickly evaporated as a political and economic climate
coalesced that was almost as bad as the previous one. Because the
Yugoslav violinist who had played for the National Opera was
granted political asylum in France, he says, he can't go back to
his homeland even though the political situation there has changed
enough to make his return possible.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the filmmakers are chased out of the Metro by the
police, who tell them it's illegal to film there. Above ground,
they continue meeting musicians from places as diverse as Central
Africa and Vietnam. A Vietnamese woman playing a kotolike
instrument gives a vividly poetic description of what various
passages and sounds are intended to evoke.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most charismatic musicians interviewed is a disk
jockey and singer from Zaire who tells of being enslaved by the
Mobutu regime and sent to a forced labor camp from which few
prisoners have ever returned. He escaped, he says, on a six-week
barefoot trek through the jungle. The movie ends with an
extraordinarily beautiful song about exile and longing for the
fatherland performed by an exiled Algerian singer, Fateh Benlala.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, ``The Underground Orchestra'' is an informal
world-music primer featuring some astonishingly beautiful sounds.
We feel the paradoxical power of music to transcend national
boundaries while serving as a profound spiritual connection to the
homeland left behind but never forgotten.

RENAULT NAME NOT TO BE REVIVED IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TAURUS-DESIGN) 
(mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having agreed last week to buy a little more than a
third of Nissan Motor Co., Renault SA may start selling Renault
cars under the Nissan name in the United States someday, but it has
no plans to revive the Renault name in the American market,
Renault's chairman and chief executive, Louis Schweitzer, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Renault may start selling vehicles using its own name in
Mexico and possibly build these cars at a Nissan factory in that
country, Renault has no intention of using its own name in the
American market because its reputation is so weak, Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Renault brand image in the U.S. is poor, that's a fact,''
he said. ``It reminds people of cars that rusted, which was true
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer's plans, including his blunt assessment of Renault's
reputation in the United States, were another sign of the enormous
importance of brand names in the consolidation of the auto
industry. The purchased companies have been those with strong
brands, not just big factories or strong engineering staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer said that Renault might try to sell Nissan sport
utility vehicles in Europe under the Renault name. But in the
United States, Renault will try to use Nissan's reputation for
quality cars at reasonable prices, while trying to enliven Nissan's
designs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try, Nissan and Renault, to bring products that have
not already been done by a competitor. I do not believe in a me-too
attitude,'' Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. bought the car operations of Volvo this year
mainly because Volvos have a strong worldwide image for safety and
are popular with women and baby boomers. Part of Chrysler Corp.'s
attraction for Daimler-Benz before the companies formed
DaimlerChrysler last November was the strength of Chrysler's Jeep
and Dodge brands.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, said the Japanese
automaker planned to step up efforts to cut costs after the
business consolidation with Renault and was not looking at the
partnership as a way of avoiding difficult moves. ``This
restructuring plan will be front-loaded and brought forward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanawa and Schweitzer spoke at a briefing for automotive writers
at the New York International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   At other events for the news media on Monday night and Tuesday
morning, executives of General Motors Corp. acknowledged that it
may take longer than originally predicted for the company to
replace some small car factories with new assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Wagoner Jr., GM's president and chief operating
officer, said that because GM was mainly interested in increasing
light-truck production, he was not especially concerned about the
growing likelihood that the company would have to delay the
construction of new small-car factories.
</P>
<P>
   GM had been close two months ago to an agreement with local
units of the United Automobile Workers union on work rules for the
new factories, which would rely heavily on snapping together large
pieces of vehicles that would be manufactured by outside suppliers.
Many of these suppliers are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's national leadership stopped the talks last month
after becoming concerned that local union units were competing with
each other to be more generous to the company. Stephen Yokich, the
union's president, said on Sunday that the union had deep concerns
about so-called modular assembly techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner said that GM would have to discuss these concerns with
the union. GM's national contract with the union expires in
September.
</P>
<P>
   GM needs to replace assembly plants to lower its production
costs in the small-car market, a swiftly shrinking and unprofitable
market segment that GM dominates.

OLSTEN TO PAY $61 MILLION IN MEDICARE BILLING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Md., Ga., Fla.)   (af)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Olsten Corp., a big provider of home health care
and temporary office workers, said on Tuesday that it would pay $61
million, including $10 million in fines and penalties, to settle
federal investigations into Medicare billing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the details of which are still being
negotiated, Olsten said that its Kimberly Home Health Care unit
would plead guilty to criminal charges. Both the fine and the
guilty plea were related to Olsten's former arrangements with the
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., the embattled hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to the guilty plea, Olsten, based in Melville, N.Y.,
may be preparing to divest itself of Kimberly to keep the Medicare
business of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew V. Roswell, a securities analyst in Baltimore with Legg
Mason Wood Walker, said he expected that Olsten would sell, spin
off or close its entire home health business, which he said had had
operating losses since early last year.
</P>
<P>
   David Fluhrer, a spokesman, said there were no plans for Olsten
to divest itself of the home health business.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimberly unit, which managed home health services for
Columbia and other hospitals, generated less than 1 percent of
Olsten's 1998 revenue of $4.6 billion. Total home health operations
generated about 30 percent, and office and other staffing about 60
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Retaining the right to serve patients under Medicare and
Medicaid, the government health programs, is essential for hospital
and home health care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Olsten and Columbia/HCA have said that they are cooperating
with federal investigators, who are also pursuing a broader inquiry
into Medicare billing by the hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   In another health care investigation, the Centennial Healthcare
Corp. said Tuesday that the inspector general's office of the
federal Health and Human Services Department had subpoenaed
portions of its records. Centennial, based in Atlanta, operates 107
nursing homes. Centennial shares fell $7.0625 Tuesday, more than 44
percent, to $8.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Centennial, which was acquired last year for $16 a
share by Welsh, Carson, Anderson &AMP; Stowe LP, a New York buyout
firm, had dropped more than 30 percent in the 12 months preceding
the subpoena. Nursing home stocks have tumbled after changes in
Medicare payments and government investigations of the industry,
including Beverly Enterprises Inc., the largest nursing home chain.
</P>
<P>
   Olsten's shares have lost about 70 percent of their value since
July 1997, when the Medicare billing investigation was disclosed.
Tuesday, the shares fell 62.50 cents to $6 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Olsten also said on Tuesday that it would take a $70 million
charge, or 86 cents a share, against earnings in the current first
quarter. Fluhrer, the company spokesman, said the charge included
the $61 million payment, as well as restructuring charges. He
declined to specify the after-tax amount of the Medicare
settlement.

<P>
   The company said that it expected first-quarter earnings,
excluding the charge, would be 10 cents a share, disappointing
analysts who had projected earnings of 14 cents to 15 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Olsten bought back some of the home health agencies
it had sold to Columbia under the arrangement that federal
officials later challenged
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Justice Department joined a lawsuit in federal
district court in Tampa, Fla. The suit contends that Columbia paid
Olsten artificially low prices for home health agencies and
inflated the fees that Columbia paid Olsten for managing them. The
management fees were charged to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   John Hindelong, a Wall Street analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said that health-care companies were having difficulty
adjusting to the change in Medicare payments for home health and
nursing home services. Medicare established a fee for each type of
service or patient instead of paying on the basis of customary
costs. He said it took half a dozen years for hospitals to adjust
to a similar change in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office is conducting more than 1,200
investigations of providers of Medicare and Medicaid. Judy Holtz, a
spokeswoman for the inspector general, confirmed that negotiations
with Olsten were under way. federal officials declined to discuss
the status of the Columbia/HCA investigation.

SPORTS COLUMN: TOMMY JOHN: DON'T SET TARGET DATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since a tendon from Tommy John's right forearm was
transplanted to replace a ruptured ligament in his left elbow in
1974, the operation has been known as ``Tommy John surgery.''
Dozens of ballplayers, mostly pitchers, have needed it. Now the
Cubs' phenom, Kerry Wood, needs it. So does Paul Wilson, the Mets'
right-hander who is scheduled to be wheeled into surgery on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it's one thing to undergo Tommy John surgery. It's quite
another to pitch again as well as he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful surgery, in the sense of coming back to
throw the way you did before, was the first one,'' Tommy John was
saying, meaning himself. ``Doctors say they know more about it now,
but then I say, `If you know more about it, why aren't guys coming
back and pitching as well?' I say that because I never lost a day,
not one day, because my arm hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   When his 26-season career ended with 288 career victories, John,
at 46, had won more games, 164, in 14 seasons after the surgery
than he did before it, 124. And now, as a 55-year-old broadcaster
and director of community relations for the Charlotte Knights of
the International League, he's still throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On April 7,'' he said, ``I'm throwing batting practice for our
sponsors, patrons, sportswriters and sportscasters. I'll throw
about 1,500 pitches that day. I also throw batting practice every
day to our high school team, 350 to 500 pitches. At least 25
pitches to each kid, 15 kids on the team. Add it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And his arm doesn't hurt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If only Wood and Wilson and Matt Morris, the Cardinals'
right-hander who also needs the operation, were sure of being able
to say that eventually. Also in that group are Jason Isringhausen,
the Mets' farmhand right-hander who missed last season, and Bill
Pulsipher, once a Mets left-hander who missed the 1996 season and
is now with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked why more pitchers haven't returned from Tommy
John surgery as successfully as John himself did, he had a theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a mistake putting a target date on when they want to
be back,'' John said. ``If you're ready to come back, come back. If
not, take however long it takes. I just think longer is better. I
can't prove it, but I know the way I did it. Wait until your arm is
absolutely back to full strength in the biceps and the triceps and
the forearm, then you start throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   John was 13-3 with the Dodgers in 1974 when he suddenly needed
surgery in September. Although on the disabled list throughout the
1975 season, he made all the Dodgers' road trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to the ball park early and jog six or seven miles,'' he
recalled. ``Then I'd soak my arm in a hot whirlpool for three
minutes, then put it in ice for 30 seconds. I'd take eight of those
hot-then-cold treatments, then take ultrasound treatments. And when
I wasn't doing anything else, I'd squeeze Silly Putty to strengthen
my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1975 season John was pitching batting
practice, then he pitched in the Arizona instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the rest of the winter off,'' he said. ``But from the
day spring training started that year and for the rest of my
career, I threw every day. I didn't pitch, but I threw to make my
arm strong. I'd throw off a mound to a catcher to the outside
corner because I wanted to be able to throw the ball to the outside
corner every time.''
</P>
<P>
   John was 10-10 in his return with the Dodgers in 1976, then 20-7
with a 2.78 earned run average, and 17-10. Joining the Yankees as a
free agent in 1979, he was 21-9, then 22-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have Kerry Wood pitch in 2001 and have him pitch
until he's 35,'' he said, ``than come back in 2000, pitch spotty
and be out of the game at 26. Because he can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think that a pitcher about to undergo or recuperate
from Tommy John surgery would phone Tommy John to ask what he did
to be so productive after the operation. But he remembered only one
pitcher calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Palmer, a young right-hander with the Expos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who had been 24-13 with the Expos before surgery, missed
the 1983 season. Over the next six years, he struggled to a 40-46
record with the Expos, Braves, Phillies and Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kerry Wood and Paul Wilson should call him now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell 'em, `Don't be in a hurry,''' Tommy John said.

U.N. PANEL IS TOLD OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AT U.S. WOMEN'S PRISONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ga., Minn., N.J.)  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ An independent fact-finder for the United Nations has
said sexual misconduct by prison guards is common in women's
prisons in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The fact-finder, or special investigator for violence against
women, issued her report on Tuesday to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission, which is meeting here for six weeks to examine rights
violations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the session began on March 22, the United States has found
its human rights record being scrutinized, and sometimes
criticized, particularly on accusations of police brutality, ill
treatment of detained women seeking asylum and the use of capital
punishment, especially for those who committed their crimes before
the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Radhika Coomaraswamy of Sri Lanka, added
sexual misconduct and the ``cruel'' use of shackles in women's
prisons to the list, based on her visits last June to state and
federal prisons in six states and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coomaraswamy, a lawyer who operates independently of the
U.N. Human Rights Office, which appointed her, said she made the
visits after receiving ``serious allegations of sexual misconduct
by male corrections officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In some prisons, she said she was told that ``at least
two-thirds of the female inmates have been sexually or physically
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Rape, Ms. Coomaraswamy said in her report, was a ``fairly rare
phenomenon.'' More frequent, she added, was ``sex in return for
favors, or consensual sex.'' In addition, she said she found
``sanctioned sexual harassment'' to be prevalent, and described
such incidents as ``women being pat-frisked by men and monitored in
their rooms and in the showers by male corrections officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coomaraswamy took testimony from 44 women in custody and 10
corrections officers while visiting prisons in California,
Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, New Jersey and New York.
</P>
<P>
   She noted in her report that, according to Justice Department
statistics, the United States has the largest number of prisoners
of any nation in the world, with more than 43,000 women in custody.
These women, she said, were most often poor and black and were
often unwittingly involved in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coomaraswamy called for an end to the use of leg irons and
chains. Their use ``violates international standards and may be
said to constitute cruel and unusual practices,'' she asserted,
adding that there were ``large-scale violations'' in prisons in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Women who are refugees or seeking asylum have been ``in many
cases shackled at the airport even when there is no criminal
sanction against them,'' Ms. Coomaraswamy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in labor are shackled during transport to a hospital and
soon after the baby is born,'' she said in discussing the case of a
26-year-old Virginia woman who was a first-time offender. In
another case, she said, shackles ``were kept on even during
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in women's prisons varied substantially, and Ms.
Coomaraswamy urged that minimum standards be adopted to conform
with U.S. obligations under international treaties guaranteeing
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, states should criminalize sexual
misconduct between staff members and inmates. The presence of male
prison guards ``creates a situation in which sexual misconduct is
more pervasive than if women were guarded by female officers,'' the
report said.

U.S. DATA MAY UNDERSTATE PRODUCTIVITY GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of maintaining that its statistics on
the labor productivity growth rate were generally reliable, the
government agency that produces the numbers now says they may be
somewhat underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published on Wednesday, the Labor Department's
Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the current economic
prosperity, and rising profits ``do not seem fully consistent with
slow productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The new studies focused on four industries _ banking, insurance,
construction and health services _ that seem robust but have
registered no improvement in official productivity statistics in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin R. Dean, chief of the bureau's productivity division,
wrote in one of three articles that will appear in the Labor
Department's Monthly Labor Review that the published data do not
appear to understand productivity gains ``by a large order of
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said there appeared to have been at least some
underestimate, mostly because of measurement problems in the vast
service sector.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected expression of doubt from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics gives a fresh twist to perhaps the most important
economic debate in the United States today: whether corporate
America has become sufficiently efficient to keep the current
economic boom going without having to raise prices or sacrifice
profits.
</P>
<P>
   National well-being depends on productivity, which measures the
output of goods and services by the amount of time per worker. That
is because corporate revenue rises when workers produce more in a
given hour than they did before.
</P>
<P>
   A factory worker makes more bottle caps, for example, or a
telephone operator handles more calls, or an air traffic controller
more flights. The additional revenue can then be divided up as
extra profit or higher wages or both. That feeds into spending and
investment, and more jobs, and the economy flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   The productivity growth rate rose smartly until 1973 and then
the statistics registered a sharp decline that has persisted since,
except for temporary upticks during boom periods, including the
current boom, which started in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While some economists contend that the official productivity
numbers are accurate, others insist that they have failed to
capture the improvements made possible by computers and other
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has repeatedly
argued that the national economy once again enjoys a productivity
growth rate reminiscent of the quarter-century after World War II.
And now the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the first time, has
publicly expressed doubt about its own figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had careful discussions with prominent economists in
recent years,'' Dean said in a telephone interview, ``and we have
felt under an obligation to conduct probing studies of this issue
and these studies have now been completed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's studies fail to address an issue considered crucial
by some economists _ whether the findings in three or four
industries can be generalized to the economy as a whole.
Underestimating productivity in some industries may be offset by
overestimating productivity in others, said Barry Bosworth, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if we are dealing with an allocation problem,''
he said, ``or a change in total national productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's new studies examined not only labor productivity
but also a broader measure, known as multifactor productivity,
which measures the output or dollar value of the production that
results not only from a worker's efforts but also from other
inputs, such as the computers and machinery that workers use.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the bureau found that the biggest problem lay in
accurately measuring output. Often it has to be roughly estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's studies also cited difficulties in adjusting output
for inflation, and in defining in the service sector what
constitutes input and output in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the production of services,'' Dean wrote in an article that
summarized the other findings, ``the consumer often supplies an
essential input. For example, it may not be possible to define
medical output adequately without considering whether the patient
follows the doctor's advice, or ignores it. Similar issues arise in
the fields of education and entertainment. For example, the output
of a jazz band may not be well defined without considering whether
the audience was 1,000 people, 10 people, or no one at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bureau's studies covered the last 20 years, too
short a time to determine whether the productivity growth rate was
similarly underestimated in its heyday before 1973. If so, then the
sharp decline in productivity growth after that year would be
roughly unchanged.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While some Republican presidential candidates are
trying to avoid the thorny subject of American involvement in
Kosovo, Vice President Al Gore does not have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president is inextricably entwined with the
Clinton administration policy for the bombing campaign. Indeed, he
describes himself as an ``active participant'' in the
decision-making and he has been a strong advocate of the bombing
while he campaigns and raises money across the country _ a
political pursuit that Republicans have called ``a disgrace'' for
an administration official while Americans are risking their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Gore has been influential in helping set
priorities since the situation inside Kosovo deteriorated. For
example, he pressed administration officials to move more quickly
with plans for NATO air strikes rather than delay until after a
visit by Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, officials
said. And he called Primakov to tell him that NATO was beginning
the bombings, prompting Primakov to cancel a meeting in Washington
and turn his flight around over the middle of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also notified former Presidents George Bush, Gerald R. Ford
and Jimmy Carter of the impending air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been meeting privately with President Clinton and
participates in military briefings at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While he campaigned in New Hampshire on Saturday, he received
seven updates from one of his military advisers, Cmdr. Kevin Scott,
a Navy helicopter pilot. And in his hour-long flight back to
Washington, he received three updates on the effort to rescue the
Air Force pilot whose plane went down near Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   A second military adviser, Maj. Steve Kwast, an Air Force
fighter pilot, provided updates as Gore campaigned Monday in
Chicago and Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing his support for the airstrikes, Gore said in
Alabama, ``Despite the risks, in my opinion, we are doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that Gore has always carried weight
on foreign affairs in the White House, partly because of his
military service _ he worked as an Army journalist for seven months
in Vietnam _ and because he specialized in subjects like arms
control during his eight years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president always comes to the table prepared and with
strong views,'' said Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman. ``I know
the president relies on him. He's the one who has no institutional
representation; he doesn't represent the Pentagon, he doesn't
represent the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   During this particular crisis, Gore has felt the absence of his
longtime national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, who had a mild
heart attack last Wednesday. Fuerth, who is recuperating at home,
has a secure telephone line and participates in classified
briefings. His place at the table with the president's national
security team is being filled by his deputy, Col. Richard M.
Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has largely been using Gore, though, as a public
spokesman on the American-led NATO bombings. ``One of the best
roles he can play is articulating the policy,'' one administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombing began last week, Gore's team considered
scrapping a long-planned political trip to New Hampshire. But they
concluded that the amount of press attention that Gore would
attract _ this was his first trip where he mingled with small
groups of voters _ would be useful in helping to advance the
administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as he was tucked away in remote North Conway, N.H., in
the White Mountains, on Friday night, his interviews about Kosovo
with local television stations were broadcast by the national
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In between every stop, my national security staff conversed
over the secure line with my military aide,'' Gore told reporters
Saturday night as he flew back to Washington, ``and I relayed my
advice on pending questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that while the initial decision to begin airstrikes
was a difficult one, ``it was not an especially controversial
decision internally'' because the administration was convinced that
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was committing
atrocities. ``Everybody understands this guy is a butcher,'' Gore
said, adding that he expected the bombing to continue for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-dozen speeches throughout his two-day swing across New
Hampshire, Gore talked about the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of about 70 people in a living room in Concord,
he described Milosevic this way: ``He's one of these junior-league
Hitler types who tries to hold on to power by stirring up hatred
among his own people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of American participation in the bombing, ``If we stood
by and did nothing while this kind of activity occurred, we would
not be true to our values.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Gore said: ``I do not support the
introduction of ground troops in combat settings in the Balkans. I
believe we can achieve our objectives through the use of air
power.'' That comment was a clearer formulation than other
administration officials, including Clinton, have offered in their
briefings and speeches, when they have taken care to say they have
``no plans'' for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is virtually the only presidential candidate who, whether
by design or duty, has tied himself so definitively to the NATO
mission, and if it turns sour and loses support, he would have the
most difficult time extricating himself politically. ``Even if he
wanted to separate himself, he couldn't,'' one administration
official said. ``But he has always been hawkish on the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley,
the former senator from New Jersey, has raised red flags about the
effort, saying that the administration has no clear exit strategy
and that the nation runs the risk of a Vietnam-like quagmire. Of
the several Republican presidential candidates, about half support
involvement in Yugoslavia and the other half do not.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have freely questioned the propriety of Gore's
discussing policies that endanger American troops during his
campaigning. Steve Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican
Party, called Gore's campaigning ``a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Forbes, a Republican candidate for president who was
also touring New Hampshire last weekend, criticized the ``dithering
and drift'' of the administration on Balkan policy.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism followed Gore on Monday on his fund-raising trips.
Winton Blount 3rd, the Republican chairman in Alabama, said,
``Gore, who is running in a practically uncontested primary, has
put dollar signs ahead of our men and women in the armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president canceled plans this week for a six-day ski
vacation, during which he and his wife, Tipper, were to celebrate
his 51st birthday. But he is still planning a three-day
fund-raising trip to California next week.

SAMARANCH DECLINES INVITATION TO TESTIFY BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:: Ariz.) (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the International Olympic Committee has refused
to testify before a U.S. Senate Committee hearing investigating the
Salt Lake City bribery scandal that led to the expulsion of six IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   Without an explanation, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC
president, declined the invitation to testify before the Senate
Commerce Committee on April 14, but suggested that it invite Anita
DeFrantz, an IOC vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, Samaranch doesn't understand the gravity of the
situation for the future of the Olympic movement,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a committee chairman, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the committee invited DeFrantz and James Easton, the
two U.S. members of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee, which scheduled its hearing before the IOC
expelled six members and created ethics and reform commissions two
weeks ago, wants to be certain that the IOC is doing enough to
guarantee accountability in the way it conducts business.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the committee was particularly interested in how
Samaranch, who had resisted change until the Salt Lake City scandal
exploded beyond his control, had placed himself in charge of the
ethics and reform panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC has taken serious action to deal with the past and
intends to continue to work with a number of people, including
yourself, to set the IOC on the right course for the future,''
Samaranch wrote in his March 29 letter to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate committee is considering legislation that could strip
the IOC of its tax-exempt status in the United States and possibly
shift control, from the IOC to the U.S. Olympic Committee, of the
cash raised domestically from nine of the 11 worldwide sponsors and
NBC, which holds the American Olympic television rights through
2008.
</P>
<P>
   Those expected to testify are William Hybl, the USOC president;
George Mitchell, the former senator who was chairman of an
independent USOC investigation into the Salt Lake City scandal; and
other members of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's refusal to testify was made public on the same day
that the IOC's chief marketers met with representatives of its 11
sponsors to assure them of the viability of the committee's plans
to reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them: `This is the blueprint of what we're working on.
Now we have to implement it,''' Richard W. Pound, an IOC executive
board member, whose investigation led to the six expulsions, said.
``I think they were satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour meeting, at a Manhattan hotel, lacked the urgency
of a similar one in mid-February, when restless sponsors urged the
IOC to take greater responsibility for the scandal, which
implicated as many as 30 members in the Salt Lake City organizing
committee's improper cash and gift-giving spree to get the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   One person in the meeting, who asked not to identified, said
some of the sponsorship officials said their top management and, in
some cases, their franchisees, are resistant to participating in
Olympic marketing programs because they feel the IOC, which is
based in Lausanne, Switzerland, has not proposed serious enough
reforms. Also, the person said, sponsors were told not to expect
the Senate hearing to lead to the most serious changes contemplated
in the possible legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy expressed by the Olympic officials was to bide time
with the Senate by promising that the IOC reform commission would
eventually make changes that would parallel those recommended by
the Mitchell commission.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Pound said he believed the steps taken by the
IOC addressed the most serious concerns of the Senate. The
legislative proposals, he said, ``are more likely ideas that had a
certain currency at a certain time and that time may have come and
gone.'' He said he had not been invited to testify.
</P>
<P>
   John Krimsky Jr., deputy secretary general of the USOC, who
attended the meeting, added, ``We'll know a lot more after the
testimony is heard.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for one sponsor, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance,
which has been sharply critical of the IOC, said the company let a
deadline lapse last Friday to be the exclusive insurance advertiser
on NBC's Olympic broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the scandal broke, Hancock halted its talks with
NBC about buying $20 million in Olympic advertising.

LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPECTS TO START REPAYING RESCUERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund
that Wall Street firms saved from collapse during the turmoil in
stock and bond markets last September, has recovered robustly and
plans to start paying back its rescuers as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of 14 banks and brokerages firms that control
Long-Term Capital said on Tuesday that the fund was much less risky
now than it was six months ago, having reduced market risk by 50
percent, although they did not define how they measured risk.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the consortium said, Long-Term Capital's investments
have gained more than 20 percent after paying management fees, a
recovery the consortium said was faster than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a downturn in the bond markets in which Long-Term
Capital has large investment positions, the hedge fund will return
at least part of the capital invested by the consortium in the
second half of this year, the consortium said in a statement.
People close to the fund said that it was possible that consortium
members, which invested between $100 million and $300 million
apiece, could receive all of their money within a year or so,
sooner than the three years initially anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement confirms earlier reports of a turnaround in the
hedge fund's fortunes. Bond markets generally have rebounded from
their lows last fall after Russia's debt default sent global bond
markets, and Long-Term Capital's portfolio, tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street firms and other investors who specialize in
bond investments have posted big profits in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But Long-Term's recovery is noteworthy because it made sizable
gains even while reducing risk, two goals that are not always
complementary. Reducing risk generally means borrowing less money
and buying securities judged less likely to swing sharply in price.
That helps protect the fund in down markets but reduces potential
gains when things go well.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Long-Term said its total assets and liabilities,
known as the balance sheet, had been reduced, but they declined to
provide specific figures. When the hedge fund foundered last fall,
it held securities valued at $120 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The news about Long-Term Capital seems likely to bolster the
efforts of its founding partners, led by the former Salomon
Brothers bond trader John W. Meriwether, to prepare the hedge fund
for a future without Wall Street patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether has plans to raise fresh capital from private
investors as soon as possible, people close to the fund said. He is
eager to wind down his affiliation with the Wall Street consortium
that has stationed a six-man team at the hedge fund's office in
Greenwich, Conn., to oversee its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium consists of large banks and brokerages houses,
including the Chase Manhattan Corp., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. People close to the consortium said that by
June the members will decide how much money to withdraw from
Long-Term Capital and whether to give Meriwether permission to
raise money from other sources.

ADVERTISING: BASEBALL'S BIG CAMPAIGN  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif., Mass., N.Y., Md., Ga., Texas)  (mk) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to capitalize on last year's phenomenal success on the
playing field and at the ticket office, Major League Baseball is
kicking off a record $25 million television advertising campaign
this Sunday on ESPN during its season opener, a game between the
Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres to be played in
Monterrey, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is divided into three distinct groups of
commercials, two of which will be given a local twist by 22 of the
league's 30 teams _ the first time MLB, which represents the
business interests of the 30 clubs in the American and National
leagues, has created such local advertising. The budget is double
its 1998 advertising expenditures; MLB will be responsible for $15
million and the individual teams for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to 1998's home-run exploits by Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa, and the record-breaking attendance of 70.3 million _ a 10.4
percent increase from 1997 _Kathleen Francis, MLB's vice president
for marketing, said: ``We had a great season last year, the game
played on the field, the great story with Sammy and Mark. With the
advertising, we're trying to maintain the momentum gained from last
year. And by working with the clubs locally, it reinforces the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's centerpiece is a clever series of ads involving a
role reversal: baseball players as fans of baseball fans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Vigilante, a New York-based unit of Leo Burnett Co.,
these ads show fans receiving fan mail from various players,
thanking them for their support.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, to be broadcast nationally, a heavyset young man
receives a package from Tony Gwynn, the right fielder for the San
Diego Padres, containing the lyrics of the national anthem and a
note from Gwynn _ who reads it in the voiceover _ saying that he
and his teammates had noticed the fan had problems remembering the
song. The fan then practices singing the anthem, off-key of course,
and ends the commercial by rasping, ``Play ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A second spot, also for national broadcast, shows another fan
listening to messages on his answering machine. One is from Nomar
Garciaparra, the shortstop for the Boston Red Sox, who thanks the
fan for putting on his rally cap in the eighth inning of that day's
game. At the end of his message, Garciaparra asks the stunned fan
if he can attend any road games.
</P>
<P>
   In one commercial intended for local broadcast, a fan nursing an
injured elbow receives a fax from a player congratulating him on
his ``sweet catch at the game today'' and telling him to take care
of his elbow. Local teams will use their own players in this
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Another local ad depicts a small boy, seated at a computer, who
gets an e-mail from a player _ again differing by team _ thanking
him for sticking up for the player against an older bully at a
game.
</P>
<P>
   All commercials end with rousing music from Bizet's opera,
``Carmen.'' Nationally broadcast ads close with the MLB logo, while
local ads conclude with promotional information from each team.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Strachan, a principal of Vigilante, said the ads were
intended to ``capture the unique ballpark experience.'' He added,
``We tried to put baseball inherently where it could only be, a
game that is Americana, that can be touched, where you can win a
souvenir.''
</P>
<P>
   The humorous, somewhat edgy tone of the advertising should also
help reach baseball's hard-core supporters as well as its less
ardent fans, Jacqueline Parkes, MLB's director of advertising,
said. ``Humor transcends age and sex barriers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second set of commercials, public service ads by Waylon
Advertising of St. Louis, shows well-known players with children at
the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which MLB has designated as
its official charity.
</P>
<P>
   A national version of the ad shows Cal Ripken Jr., the Baltimore
Orioles' third baseman; Mo Vaughn, the Anaheim Angels' first
baseman, and Roger Clemens, the New York Yankees pitcher. MLB
officials said that all three were personally involved with the
children's organization. Ripken and Vaughn will also appear in
local ads, along with a player, chosen by each team, who is active
in the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Another commercial focuses on a special ceremony in Atlanta on
April 8, when Hank Aaron, the major leagues' career home-run
leader, will be honored on the 25th anniversary of his breaking
Babe Ruth's record of 714. The ad, also by Vigilante, shows a young
man, wearing a batting helmet but dressed in business attire,
fruitlessly trying to belt a home run in a ballpark. With each
swing, he shouts the name of a celebrated slugger, like McGwire and
Ken Griffey, Jr. The end of the spot invites viewers to celebrate
the ``home run hitter of home run hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The fan mail and Boys and Girls Clubs ads will be broadcast
throughout the season on ESPN, Fox, FX, Fox Sport Net, TBS and NBC,
and on stations in teams' local markets. The Aaron ad will be shown
through April 8 on TBS, which will broadcast the ceremony that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cancro, vice president of sales and marketing for the
Boston Red Sox and a member of MLB's advertising committee,
applauded the campaign's messages and execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports advertising typically shows a lot of action, but we
wanted more than footage,'' he said. ``We wanted a campaign that
was consistent with the feel of the game, that shows that players
are cognizant of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, the first baseman for the Houston Astros who
appeared in the fax machine fan-mail commercial for the local
market, said baseball players actually did notice ``the kind of
stuff shown in the ad all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a foul play, we watch where it goes,'' he added.
``We see some incredible things.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Bagwell said, it was necessary for Major
League Baseball to improve its public image, which until last
season seemed in particular trouble in the years following the 1994
baseball strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so bad at promoting itself for so long,'' he said.
``I think the ads are a neat thing. They're going in the right
direction.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Acknowledging that airstrikes have failed to
halt the assault in Kosovo or sufficiently damage the Serb
military, the United States and NATO agreed Tuesday to an escalated
campaign targeting government buildings in downtown Belgrade, two
senior administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks, which would probably include government centers
like the interior and defense ministry buildings in the Serbian
capital as well military targets elsewhere in the country, would
represent a major change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has largely limited its bombing to air defense
systems, factories and defense installations on the outskirts of
Belgrade and forces directly involved in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deepening and broadening of the target set,'' said
one of the senior American officials. The officials said about 20
percent more places were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the expanded bombing campaign would be
considerably less violent than the airstrikes aimed at the
political leadership of Iraq during the Gulf War when American
bombers targeted Saddam Hussein's palaces and the headquarters of
his political party. Officials said, however, that any attacks on
the densely populated center of Belgrade would require pinpoint
accuracy to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   American officials appeared hopeful that the request for
authority to bomb a much broader range of targets throughout
Yugoslavia, made at a closed door meeting of NATO ambassadors,
would be granted, diplomats reported. But NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said in an interview that he was not convinced the
time had come to dramatically broaden the strikes, reflecting
continued strains within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to escalate the combat came on a downbeat day here,
as NATO's commanders received bad news from every direction.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces continued to advance virtually unopposed on the
battlefield and the refugee crisis threatened to spiral out of
control, with NATO officials estimating that one-third of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had been forced from their
homes. The alliance was forced to beat back an attempt by Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to open negotiations on terms
dictated by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said Tuesday night that the alliance
raids had been stymied by a Yugoslavian air defense that has proved
more resilient than anticipated, new tactics that involved
dispersing Milosevic's forces in the field and extremely bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the alliance was eagerly waiting to deploy
A-10 ground attack planes that they hoped would strike directly at
Serbian troops in Kosovo and knock out tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The A-10s took off Tuesday but returned without attacking their
targets because of thick clouds and rain, a NATO official said. The
A-10s could not fly below the clouds because of the risk of
exposure to anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had an impact on the infrastructure, but the impact on
their operations is a different matter,'' the NATO official said.
``Whether we can stop it or not we'll find out. A lot of people
have real doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   With the alliance excluding the use of ground forces, airpower
appeared to be the only tool NATO has to influence the Yugoslav
leadership. But the air attacks have been constrained by political
considerations, despite the West's increasingly vociferous charges
that Milosevic is engaged in a brutal campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing plan was developed months ago
when alliance officials anticipated that a modest air raid or two
would be enough to nudge a recalcitrant Milosevic back to the
negotiating table. But the scale and intensity of the Serb attacks
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have caught the alliance by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even we have been shocked by the sheer enormity of what is
going on in Kosovo at the moment,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with hundreds of thousands of refugees and reports of
murders, NATO's planners have begun to talk belatedly about the
need to ``adapt'' their bombing plan.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, officials say, has a three-part bombing plan. The
first stage is to attack Yugoslav's anti-aircraft systems, an
effort that is still under way.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, which has recently been launched, involves
strikes on the Serb forces south of Yugoslavia's 44th parallel,
units which have been pressing the attack against the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a third, more aggressive phase of the NATO
bombing plan, which officials here have been reluctant to discuss
in detail and which had not previously been approved.
</P>
<P>
   It would give NATO commanders the authority to launch a broader
range of attacks against Yugoslavia's military leaders, command and
control centers, weapons depots, heavy weapons and fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The American proposal to expand air attacks came as Serb forces
continue to press their attacks against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, NATO officials estimated that 118,000 ethnic Albanians
had been forced out of Kosovo since March 24. Serb tanks have been
surrounding villages and towns. Women and children have been
separated from the men and then forcibly bused to the frontier.
Afterwards, their homes are burned to the ground so that they
cannot return.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Pec, which used to have a population of some
100,000, has now been almost totally destroyed. Along with the
daily handouts touting its airstrikes, the NATO press office now
distributes a daily report on ``City Torching'' by Serb forces.

`ENCOUNTER IN THE THIRD DIMENSION': PROFESSOR'S DREAMS AND 3-D
CLEAVAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The latest Imax tourist attraction is a giddy foray
into three-dimensional imagery, one that traces the history of this
technique and makes a case for its promising future. Of course that
possible renaissance is closely linked to the prospects for 3-D
Imax, the huge-screen format that puts viewers in special headgear
and sends them grasping at the illusory visions that seem just out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   While Imax still remains more of an amusement park treat than a
viable storytelling form, ``Encounter in the Third Dimension''
offers a nifty demonstration of what 3-D technology can do now.
</P>
<P>
   The pretext for the film involves a hammy professor (played
eagerly by Stuart Pankin), his pet flying saucer (with Pankin's
voice), and the professor's plan to create his own 3-D marvels. His
laboratory alone offers a screen-filling array of 3-D props and
gimmicks, not least of them the vampy Elvira, who plays herself.
The film's shifting between plain old Elvira and Elvira with 3-D
cleavage is only one of the ways it has fun with its medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encounter in the Third Dimension'' reviews the history of 3-D,
from the Lumiere brothers' oncoming train to a bit by Dean Martin
and Jerry Lewis, with a set of clips that have been enterprisingly
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The real standout here is the elaborate roller coaster fantasy
that hurls the audience into gravity-defying races through
seemingly huge settings. What begins in an Indiana Jones-type
underground cavern takes the viewer under the sea and up toward the
stars, in sequences that are as imaginatively staged as they are
vertiginous. The excitement is offset by the deliberate cheesiness
of the professor's merry shtick.
</P>
<P>
   Young children overheard at one preview of ``Encounter in the
Third Dimension'' said it was fun, and it is.

EQUANT PLANS TO EXPAND ITS GLOBAL DATA SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helping to expand the digital world to some of the
globe's least-wired corners, Equant NV of the Netherlands plans to
announce on Wednesday that it will offer advanced data services in
25 additional territories and countries including Albania, Georgia,
and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement will bring to more than 100 the number
of countries and territories in which Equant offers the data
service known as frame relay, giving Equant perhaps the world's
most geographically extensive communications network.
</P>
<P>
   Equant, which first offered shares to the public just last
summer, emerged from a global communications consortium that was
formed in 1949 by many of the world's airlines to help coordinate
schedules and reservations. Equant is expanding on the network
built by the airlines in a bid to serve the communications needs of
multinational corporations outside the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Frame relay is a technology that is well suited to connecting
corporate networks in far-flung sites and to transmitting
information like credit-card data or requests from automated teller
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Corp. offers frame-relay service in about 40 countries,
a figure that an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman said would not change
significantly after AT&AMP;T completes its joint venture with British
Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc. offered the service in only about 20 countries
at the end of last year, while the Global One partnership of
Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which appears to be in
danger of collapse, offers frame-relay service in 51 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Equant's competitors are not standing still, however. On
Tuesday, MCI Worldcom said it had extended its frame-relay network
to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela and that it planned to
offer the service in a total of 44 countries by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   And all of the international communications giants reach
additional countries through technologies other than frame relay.
Tuesday, for instance, AT&AMP;T announced that it would use IBM's
network to expand the number of countries in which it provides
standard telephone Internet access to 59 from 40.
</P>
<P>
   The other countries and territories to which Equant has expanded
its frame-relay service are Algeria, Armenia, Aruba, Azerbaijan,

DIALLO FAMILY TO HEAR PREVIEW OF CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the
Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the
criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the
four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from
the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see
the officers not only charged, but brought to trial. ``We are
waiting for this, for justice,'' he said, ``and we feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Kadiadou Diallo, and two of her children, are
expected to arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on
Thursday morning. She had been expected Tuesday, but had to cancel
her flight because the U.S. Embassy in the Guinean capital of
Conakry was unexpectedly closed Monday and she was not able to pick
up her visas.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early
February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in
Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political
protest that has yet to abate.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant who worked as a street peddler
in Manhattan and attended computer classes, was shot in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4. He was unarmed.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson plans to meet with the
Diallos shortly before 2 p.m., when the grand jury indictments are
scheduled to be unsealed in open court. Johnson has refused to
confirm reports, based on people familiar with the case, that the
officers will be charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the daily protests over the
Diallo shooting and is an adviser to the family, also is expected
to attend the meeting, said Steven Reed, Johnson's spokesman.
Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem has helped finance the
Diallo family's trips to and from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting,
Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the
indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury
voted on the charges last Thursday. Asked if the timing of the
arraignment was scheduled to accommodate the Diallo family's travel
plans, Reed said he would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a prosecutor to brief a victim's family on
criminal charges, he added, even in cases far less publicized than
the Diallo case. ``It is the district attorney's practice to have
families of the deceased hear about grand jury results in
advance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During their stay in New York City, Diallo's parents will have a
packed schedule of meetings and rallies, organized by Sharpton,
that will keep them in the spotlight. When they came in February,
shortly after their son's killing, they attained near-celebrity
status _ trailed by television cameras, greeted by crowds and
transported from place to place by motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, both parents are expected to meet with many of the
people who were arrested for civil disobedience during protests at
Police Headquarters over the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barron, an organizer of the protests, said the Diallos
would speak at rallies organized around other high-profile cases in
which the police are accused of brutality against young black men.
</P>
<P>
   He said they would be taken to U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
for example, where a jury is being selected to hear the case
against police officers charged with brutalizing a Haitian
immigrant, Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, according to Sharpton, will stay in New York City
for about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also plans to be in the Bronx on
Wednesday. The mayor is scheduled to rename the block in front of
the 50th Precinct station house, on Kingsbridge Avenue at West
236th Street. The block will named for Officer Vincent Guidice, who
died in May 1996 after he fell on the shards of a broken mirror
while responding to a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday, about 400 off-duty
police officers chanting ``No Justice, No Police'' and ``Its a
Tragedy, Not a Crime'' rallied to show support for the four police
officers before their expected arraignment.

OFFICERS ARE SAID TO TELL OF SUSPICIONS ON DIALLO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN and MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed
Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was
initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop
of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into
the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with
knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Those officers told associates that they grew more suspicious
when two of them got out of their car to question him and he
retreated into the vestibule of the building, the people
knowledgeable about the case said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, who are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal
charges in state Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday, did not
testify about the shooting before the grand jury that heard their
case. Diallo, an unarmed man with no criminal history, was killed
on Feb. 4 when the four officers fired 41 shots at him, 19 of which
hit him.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting led to 15 days of protests outside Police
Headquarters and reignited the gnawing debate about police in New
York City. During the outcry the officers, their lawyers and
law-enforcement officials have remained silent about what set off
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But several officers are said to have told associates that the
chain of events that led to the fatal shooting of Diallo began when
the officers first spotted him and thought that they saw him
looking into the window.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy, all in plain clothes _ were driving along
Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:40 a.m.
when they first spotted Diallo pacing on the stoop of No. 1157. The
officers did not know it, but it was the building where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon and Carroll got out of their maroon Ford Taurus and
approached Diallo on the stoop. McMellon stood to the left and
Carroll to the right as they mounted the steps.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next is sure to be the subject of much debate at
the future criminal trial of the four officers. The four police
officers have yet to officially explain their actions. But several
officers told associates that after the officers identified
themselves and asked to talk to Diallo, he retreated into the
building's vestibule and appeared to be trying to reach the inner
door, the people with knowledge of the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo remained silent during the whole encounter, they said.
</P>
<P>
   According to this account, several officers told associates that
while Diallo was in the vestibule, he made a move that led them to
believe he was armed: he turned to his right, reached into his
pocket and pulled something out. It turned out later to be his
black wallet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Carroll yelled, ``Gun!'' the people knowledgeable
about the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details were first reported Tuesday in The New York
Post.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear from Tuesday's accounts who fired the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   As the first gunshots rang out, McMellon fell backwards down the
steps and injured his tailbone, causing at least some of his
colleagues to believe that he had been hit by return fire, people
knowledgeable about the case said. Carroll moved to his right and
continued firing, and Murphy and Boss, who were closer to the car,
began firing as well, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the officers are said to have told associates that
they continued firing because Diallo did not fall even after they
had unleashed the fusillade. When the officers saw afterward that
Diallo was unarmed, the people knowledgeable about the case said,
at least one of the officers wept.

 HEALTH OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE EMBRYO MIX-UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a case reverberating through the rapidly growing
world of reproductive technology, the New York state Health
Department has started an investigation into an embryo mix-up that
caused a Staten Island woman who underwent in vitro fertilization
to recently give birth to two boys, one black and one white.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Linden, director of the state Health Department
division that regulates fertility clinics, said officials would try
to determine how the woman, Donna Fasano, received implants not
only of her eggs fertilized by her husband, Richard, but also of
other fertilized eggs, apparently from a Teaneck, N.J., couple,
Robert Rogers and Deborah Perry-Rogers. Both Mrs. Fasano, who is
white, and Mrs. Rogers, who is black, were patients of a Manhattan
physician, Dr. Lillian Nash, and both women apparently had
fertilized eggs implanted on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be sending somebody to the site to see exactly what
the records say and to interview Dr. Nash to see what happened,''
Dr. Linden said Tuesday. She said investigators also would speak to
employees at a Manhattan fertility clinic owned by Dr. Dov
Goldstein, where the Rogerses had paid $1,500 to store their
embryos in a freezer.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated case took a dramatic turn on Monday when lawyers
for the Fasanos announced that the couple would raise their
biological child, and that the Rogerses would raise theirs, if DNA
tests confirm they are his biological parents. The Rogerses were
expected to take a DNA test within the week, and lawyers for both
couples will negotiate a visitation agreement. Two weeks ago, the
Rogerses filed a lawsuit seeking custody of one baby and claiming
negligence, malpractice and breach of contract against Dr. Nash,
Goldstein and an embryologist, Dr. Michael Obasaju.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tarlton, a state Health Department spokeswoman, said the
state investigation would probably be concluded this week. She said
Dr. Nash is licensed to practice reproductive technology and that
her West 57th Street clinic was recently inspected by state health
officials. Ms. Tarlton said she did not know the results of that
inspection. A secretary reached by telephone at the clinic said Dr.
Nash would not comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   If the state investigation concludes that any regulations or
standards of care were violated, Ms. Tarlton said the department
``would take appropriate action,'' possibly a statement of
deficiency. If evidence of gross negligence or incompetence by
doctors is discovered, the Office of Professional Medical Conduct
could investigate later. But Ms. Tarlton emphasized that the
investigation began only Monday and that few facts had been firmly
established.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are such things as errors made in medicine,'' Ms.
Tarlton said. ``The standard for professional medical conduct is
gross negligence or incompetence. We have no information at this
time that this is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has quickly attracted national and international
interest even as lawyers for both couples have pleaded for privacy.
David Cohen, a lawyer for the Fasanos, said the two families will
meet within days with the 3-month-old babies. Cohen described the
Fasanos as ``prisoners in their house with the blinds closed
because there are camera crews sitting outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Silas, the lawyer for the Rogerses, said his clients
also were struggling to live normal lives. Silas said both couples
were angry with Dr. Nash but not with one another. ``The Fasanos
are a little saddened that they are parting with a child, and the
Rogerses are delighted that they are receiving a child,'' he said.
Unlike Mrs. Fasano, Mrs. Rogers did not become pregnant after the
in vitro procedures. Both women have tried for years to conceive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A study conducted by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine found
that in 1996, 64,000 attempts at assisted reproduction were made
nationally, mostly through in vitro fertilization, resulting in
20,659 births. A study by the state Health Department documented
that 5,741 attempts at in vitro fertilization had been made in New
York state in 1995, though the success rate could not be
determined. The figures do not include cases of artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Katz Rothman, a City University sociologist whose most
recent book, ``Genetic Maps and Human Imagination,'' addresses
issues involving reproductive technology, said a similar case
occurred recently in Holland. In that case, a white woman receiving
in vitro treatment received implants of her eggs, fertilized by a
white man, but the clinic mixed in eggs from another woman,
fertilized by a black man. The woman gave birth to two boys, one
black, one white, and is now raising both children, Ms. Rothman
said. Such cases, she said, raise murky philosophical questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're raising all kinds of questions about what is the meaning
of the ties between a parent and a child and between any people and
how we are related to each other,'' she said. ``What concerns me is
with all the push toward genetic determination is that we're coming
to think of `real ties' as genetic relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fasano and Rogers case almost certainly will provide
ammunition to groups calling for greater federal and state
regulation of fertility treatments. But Dr. Linden said mistakes
were very rare. New York, she said, requires that labs file records
of procedures with the state. Officials also conduct routine
inspections at the 24 licensed in vitro programs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linden said officials did not yet know whether the mix-up in
the Fasano case happened at Dr. Nash's office, where the
implantation occurred, or at Goldstein's clinic. She said Dr. Nash,
who is 71, did not have a freezer at her clinic _ unusual for a
fertility practice _ and that someone at her office had arranged
for 10 additional fertilized eggs from the Rogerses to be stored at
Goldstein's clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Pittoni, a lawyer for Goldstein, said an embryologist from
Goldstein's office agreed to store the Rogerses' unused fertilized
eggs after someone from Dr. Nash's office called and appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Pittoni said that Obasaju, the embryologist named in the
Rogerses' lawsuit, is not the same embryologist who works for
Goldstein. Pittoni also said that the Rogerses' unused eggs did not
arrive at Goldstein's clinic until April 24, the same day that Dr.
Nash did the implants. Obasaju could not be reached by telephone
for comment Tuesday, but Silas said he worked with Dr. Nash during
the implantation.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department lists no disciplinary actions
against Dr. Nash or Obasaju, but Goldstein was censured,
reprimanded and fined $35,000 last June 22 after a hearing
committee found that he allowed unlicensed employees to perform
artificial insemination. Pittoni said his client's history was
irrelevant to the Fasano case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a doctor who was standing on the sidewalk
and witnessed an accident and he's not involved in it all, but it
brings up things that would not be related to this case,'' Pittoni
said. ``It's unfair. In no way would that be reported, except for
the fact that he was improperly served and involved in this case.''

LUDWIG LIKES HIS HOCKEY AND HARLEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The conversation turns to goalie masks. And, as always,
Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig has a unique perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As he studies ``The Eagle'' mask of Ed Belfour and the ``Iron
Maiden'' monster mask of Roman Turek that give insight into the
character of each player, Ludwig is asked what he would paint on a
mask if he was a goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see,'' Ludwig says as his brain churns forward trying to
crystallize his personality in one poignant scene. ``How about a
can of Bud Light riding on a Harley?''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig is all about motorcycles and fast cars and slow-pitch
softball and beer. He is equal parts Evel Knievel and Homer
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   And, the funny thing is, somewhere beneath all of that rests a
pretty good hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an interesting guy,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``He has this big \Rwild man\S image, and that's there because of
the type of person he is. But I don't think he gets near enough
credit for being a true natural athlete. This is a guy who's had
success in more than a couple of sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig plays softball at the elite level during the summer back
home in Wisconsin and is about to wrap up his 17th NHL season. He
turned 38 on March 15 but shows no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been his best season since I've been here,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's moving the puck well, he's making smart
decisions, he's got a lot of confidence out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes have come in handy the past two weeks as Ludwig
has helped fill the void created by injuries to defensemen Richard
Matvichuk and Shawn Chambers. Ludwig has pushed his average minutes
played from about 13 to 18 a game and has shown no signs of wear.
He had 11 hits _ a Stars season high _ in one game. He had four
blocked shots in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy works just as hard off the ice as he does on, but he
doesn't ever let the fun get in the way of the work,'' said
Matvichuk, who has fashioned his career after Ludwig's. ``He's
amazing. He shows up to play every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig's dedication is, in many ways, confusing. He often gripes
about the length of the regular season, has said he would rather
play softball for a living and has said countless times that he
should have retired by now. But fill an arena with people, put a
team out there in opposite colors, and Ludwig is flinging his body
in front of flying pucks and dipping low with his trademark hip
check to smash an unsuspecting forward into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the old system \Rwith the Montreal Canadiens\S
where you were expected to work hard on the ice and play hard
off,'' he said. ``But no matter what you did on your off day, the
thing that was certain was you were going to give 100 percent every
game. I'm still that way. I come to the rink every game believing
that if I don't play my best, I shouldn't be on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig recently received the nomination of the Dallas chapter of
the Professional Hockey Writers Association for this year's
Masterton Trophy. He is one of 27 nominees across the NHL that have
displayed ``perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least the perseverance part might be right,'' Ludwig
joked.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is Ludwig qualifies on all three counts. As for
sportsmanship, he plays the rules old style: He only gives out what
he expects to get back. And as for dedication to hockey, there's
nobody on the Stars who wants a Stanley Cup more than Ludwig. It's
just that he doesn't think he has to always wear a serious face in
pursuit of the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I like to have fun; that doesn't mean I'm not serious,''
said the man who generally organizes all the NCAA Tournament and
golf pools and holiday parties for the team. ``I mean, we're
playing hockey for a living. I still realize it's a game. If we
can't laugh at ourselves every once in a while, we're in trouble.''

FLORIDA DETAILS WIDE ABUSE AT AGENCY FOR THE RETARDED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PAMELA MERCER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A state report has documented widespread neglect of
patients and misuse of funds at an agency for the mentally retarded
that was put under state supervision earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The report, obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times and other
news organizations, was conducted by the Florida Department of
Children and Families after a former employee of the agency made
accusations that clients were abused and neglected and that senior
staff members routinely took the center's money for their own use.
</P>
<P>
   The center's executive director, Maureen Robinson, was fired
earlier this month after state investigators determined that she
had used money from several grants to pay herself a yearly salary
of $180,000, and that she was driving a 1997 Jaguar that may have
been insured with the agency's money.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices contributed to a cash shortage that, according to
the state's investigation, has pushed the agency, Metatherapy
Institute Inc. of Homestead, Fla., close to insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The acting district administrator for the department, Sara
Herald, said the state was still investigating many of these
allegations. No charges have been filed against any individual, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The state-appointed receiver, Kenneth Marlin, is expected to
give a report to the state next week on the agency's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Metatherapy, one of the largest agencies of its kind in this
area, runs rehabilitation and therapy programs for 63 mentally
retarded adults. It also provides temporary housing, job training
and counseling for about 100 homeless men and has a substance abuse
program.
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing the agency exemplify what critics call the
lack of accountability and oversight that have plagued such
institutions here. Metatherapy is the fourth nonprofit agency
serving the developmentally disabled to be put under receivership
in Miami-Dade and Monroe counties in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Bock, who until February served as the district
administrator for the department, is temporarily supervising
Metatherapy. She said that the problems there reflect much of what
she has encountered at other agencies over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was initially very shocking for me,'' said Ms. Bock, who
had been district administrator since 1992. ``But I became used to
encountering these problems in the nonprofit arena. There's very
little accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 1 to 10, this situation is a five ,'' Ms. Bock
added. ``I have seen 1's in my tenure with the department.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 43-page report filed on Feb. 2, officials from the
Florida Department of Children and Families concluded that
Metatherapy had suffered from ineffective management by a board of
directors plagued with conflicts of interest, and that the state
attorney's office should investigate the claims of client abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended an overhaul of staff supervision,
scheduling and incident reporting, and urged Metatherapy to hire a
chief financial officer to develop a system of ``checks and
balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation stemmed from statements by Tracy Collier, a
former care giver at the agency who cited several instances in
which, he said, clients were put at risk and not medicated
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Collier told investigators that records were falsified to show
that clients had taken part in fire drills or that medications had
been dispensed. He also accused one staff member of giving patients
their daily medications in a single dosage so that they would go to
bed early and she could leave work early.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Collier said that the agency's accounting procedures were
inadequate and that staff members used money belonging to the
clients and to the agency for items such as Christmas gifts and, in
one case, a trip to Washington to attend a festival.
</P>
<P>
   Like other centers of its kind, Metatherapy is financed by the
federal government and state and local governments and is run by a
board of directors, made up of community leaders, who are rarely
held accountable for their oversight of an agency, Ms. Bock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is already trying to address the issues that have
come up with this probe in a general manner, and we hope that the
legislature will fully address the problem we have,'' said Lanedra
Carroll, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   She added that earlier this month the governor's office had
asked the Legislature for $2 million in additional funds for the
oversight of such agencies and to approve the hiring of 27 people
to improve the state's capacity to regulate such agencies.

BAFFERT PUSHES THE WRONG BUTTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ It began as a professional disagreement
between Bob Baffert, the nation's leading horse trainer, and Scotty
McClellan, Santa Anita's most influential jockeys' agent. It got a
little loud. It got a little physical.
</P>
<P>
   It was all over in five minutes, shortly after 8 o'clock Tuesday
morning in the normally tranquil gathering spot known as Clockers'
Corner. But by then, rumors of the altercation had spread like a
barn fire and the Santa Anita stewards were being dragged into the
latest dispute over a broken racetrack promise.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Saturday's Santa Anita Derby acquired its juiciest
subplot. Call it the shove heard round the world.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began 24 hours earlier, when Baffert broke some
bad news to jockey Chris McCarron as a small group of horsemen
eavesdropped at trackside. McCarron, who expected to ride General
Challenge in the $750,000 race, was being replaced by fellow Hall
of Famer Gary Stevens, who had just become available.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron was angry but didn't make a scene. That's what his
agent is for _ to play the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as Baffert stood on the grandstand steps preparing to
clock a workout, McClellan approached him to complain. McClellan
opened with a joke, but Baffert didn't see the humor. Voices were
raised.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron might be stuck without a mount in the West's leading
prep for the May 1 Kentucky Derby, McClellan pointed out. He'd
already turned down a couple of offers to ride in major races out
of town on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert argued that unique circumstances justified the switch:
Stevens, the barn's No.1 jockey and General Challenge's regular
rider, had been scheduled to accompany 1998 Kentucky Derby winner
Real Quiet to the Oaklawn Handicap in Arkansas on Saturday. But
Baffert had withdrawn Real Quiet in disappointment over weight
assignments. Now Stevens was free.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Baffert pleaded, hadn't he always been lenient when
jockeys or their agents asked to back out of riding commitments for
better opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   When McClellan turned to walk away, Baffert followed him, still
shouting. And as they walked in front of Clockers' Corner, Baffert
reached out and gave McClellan a right-handed shove, before
assistant trainer Eoin Harty stepped between them, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert later denied shoving McClellan: ``Oh, hell no, we were
just talking. I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover... It's gotten a
little blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan, not wanting to fan the flames, said, ``I don't know
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   But the horsemen and track employees who were there were sure
what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw was two men under pressure, with a month to go
before the Kentucky Derby and places in the Churchill Downs
starting gate up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw was the inevitable result of the casual racetrack
approach to contracts, in which a million dollars or more can turn
on a handshake or less.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's commitment to McCarron was delivered verbally at the
trainer's barn on March 17, the day Exploit, then both men's top
Kentucky Derby prospect, was retired with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' McClellan remembered saying to Baffert. ``In the
next breath, he said, `But I'll put you on General Challenge.' I
said, `That's great!'''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's not so great. The agent said one annoyance is the way
the trainer made the change _ telling McCarron instead of asking
him.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron is left in a no-win situation: If he petitions the
three-man board of stewards to enforce the verbal contract, he
risks alienating the powerful Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is a smart guy,'' Baffert said. ``I don't think he wants
to burn any bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Get out the fire hose. Later Tuesday morning, steward George
Slender's phone rang. It was McCarron, on a golf outing in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Slender told reporters it sounded as if the jockey planned to
press the issue, the kind of thing that lands on stewards' desks
about once a month in Southern California. McCarron and Baffert
could be called into the stewards' office today to offer their
versions of events.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards prefer to mediate such a dispute, often by getting
the trainer to promise the rider an attractive mount in the future.
But that might not help this time, because Baffert said he has
already offered McCarron ``a future draft pick'' for his trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't (resolve the matter), we'll make a decision one of
them won't like,'' Slender said.
</P>
<P>
   Push has come to shove.

MAJOR LEAGUES MIGHT SELL ADS ON THE UNIFORMS OF THE PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major League Baseball is considering selling small
patches of advertising on the uniform sleeves of its players as a
new way to increase team revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's tentative plan, one company official said, would
probably have teams sell the advertising patches to local
corporations. When revenue reached a certain level, it might be
shared with other clubs. Only companies in the tobacco, alcohol and
broadcast businesses would be barred from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, baseball has allowed uniforms to bear only the
manufacturer's logo. Currently, an `R' is visible on the sleeves,
for Russell Athletic. In the NFL, uniforms carry the logo of one of
four apparel makers _ Nike, Puma, Adidas or Starter _ on both
jersey sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum are athletes in sports like
auto racing; the jumpsuits of NASCAR drivers are plastered with the
logos of their sponsors. Golfers and tennis players also wear caps
and shirts with logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue being considered here goes beyond the scope of a
uniform manufacturer's logo,'' said a team official who asked not
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Smith, the vice president of licensing for Major League
Baseball Properties, would not discuss the details of a possible
uniform advertising plan. But he said: ``We're talking from A to Z
about our on-field programs, and bringing in additional sponsors in
other formats than we have now. We've talked about everything. But
we're not close to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball uniforms are considered the most traditional
in sports, they have undergone marketing-induced changes over the
years. Teams have changed uniform and cap designs, or added new
jerseys for special occasions, to enhance the sale of licensed
replica jerseys in retail outlets. (Baseball is also considering
whether its licensed apparel makers should make replica uniforms
bearing the logos of the advertisers who buy the patches.)
</P>
<P>
   To increase revenue more dramatically, teams have also covered
stadium fences and dugout walls with commercial signs and added
rotating advertising behind home plate.

`THE MATRIX': THE REALITY IS ALL VIRTUAL, AND DENSELY COMPLICATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Action heroes speak volumes about the couch-potato
audiences that they thrill. So it's understandable that ``The
Matrix,'' a furious special-effects tornado directed by the
imaginative brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (``Bound''), couldn't
care less about the spies, cowboys and Rambos of times gone by.
Aiming their film squarely at a generation bred on comics and
computers, the Wachowskis stylishly envision the ultimate in
cyberescapism, creating a movie that captures the duality of life a
la laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wildest exploits befall this film's sleek hero, most
of its reality is so virtual that characters spend long spells of
time lying stock still with their eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that's as likely to transfix fans of computer
gamesmanship as to baffle anyone with quaintly humanistic notions
of life on earth, the Wachowskis have synthesized a savvy visual
vocabulary (thanks especially to Bill Pope's inspired
techno-cinematography), a wild hodgepodge of classical references
(from the biblical to Lewis Carroll) and a situation that calls for
a lot of explaining.
</P>
<P>
   The most salient things any prospective viewer need know is that
Keanu Reeves makes a strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero,
that the martial arts dynamics are phenomenal (thanks to Peter
Pan-type wires for flying and inventive slow-motion tricks), and
that anyone bored with the notably pretentious plotting can keep
busy toting up this film's debts to other futuristic science
fiction. Neat tricks here echo ``Terminator'' and ``Alien'' films,
``The X-Files,'' ``Men in Black'' and ``Strange Days,'' with a
strong whiff of ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' in the battle royale
being waged between man and computer. Nonetheless whatever
recycling the brothers do here is canny enough to give ``The
Matrix'' a strong identity of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves plays a late-20th-century computer hacker whose terminal
begins telling him one fateful day that he may have some sort of
messianic function in deciding the fate of the world. And what that
function may be is so complicated that it takes the film the better
part of an hour to explain. Dubbed Neo (in a film whose similarly
portentous character names include Morpheus and Trinity, with a
time-traveling vehicle called Nebuchadnezzar), the hacker is
gradually made to understand that everything he imagines to be real
is actually the handiwork of 21st-century computers. These
computers have subverted human beings into batterylike energy
sources confined to pods, and they can be stopped only by a savior
modestly known as the One.
</P>
<P>
   We know even before Neo does that his role in saving the human
race will be a biggie. (But on the evidence of Reeves' beautiful,
equally androgynous co-star, Carrie-Anne Moss in Helmut Newton
cat-woman mode, propagating in the future looks to be all
business.) The film happily leads him through varying states of
awareness, much of it explained by Laurence Fishburne in the film's
philosophical-mentor role. Fishburne's Morpheus does what he can to
explain how the villain of a film can be ``a neural interactive
simulation'' and that the Matrix is everywhere, enforced by
sinister morphing figures in suits and sunglasses. ``The Matrix''
is the kind of film in which sunglasses are an integral part of
sleekly staged fight scenes.
</P>
<P>
   With enough visual bravado to sustain a steady element of
surprise (even when the film's most important Oracle turns out to
be a grandmotherly type who bakes cookies and has magnets on her
refrigerator), ``The Matrix'' makes particular virtues out of
eerily inhuman lighting effects, lightning-fast virtual scene
changes (as when Neo wishes for guns and thousands of them suddenly
appear) and the martial arts stunts that are its single strongest
selling point.
</P>
<P>
   As supervised by Yuen Wo Ping, these airborne sequences bring
Hong Kong action style home to audiences in a mainstream American
adventure with big prospects as a cult classic and with the future
very much in mind.
</P>
<P>

HILLARYNO.COM IS NOT MUD.COM, GIULIANI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the undeclared Republican
candidate for U.S. Senate, said on Tuesday that a Web site set up
by his supporters was not intended as an attack on Hillary Rodham
Clinton but rather as an effort to capitalize on the fund-raising
opportunity presented by her potential Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   At a morning news conference, Giuliani said he would be
politically remiss not to take advantage of the attention raised by
Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality,'' he said, ``is that we want to take advantage of
those people who think that she shouldn't run for the Senate, of
which there are many and who feel very fervently about it. I would
be foolish if I didn't take advantage of that. It's an opportunity
that she's presented us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has said she is considering running for the New
York seat being vacated next year by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. The Web site set up by Giuliani's fund-raising committee
asserts that Mrs. Clinton has no experience in elective office and
no ties to New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats said the Web site, called Hillaryno.com, was
a sign of early mudslinging by the mayor and an indication of the
type of campaign he would wage. Mrs. Clinton, who was traveling in
Morocco, has not commented on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the new site merely reflected the sentiments
expressed by New York voters that he has met in his recent travels
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fair?'' the mayor asked, repeating a reporter's question
Tuesday. ``Come on, it's politics. She presents us with an
opportunity and we take advantage of it and then that's not fair? I
mean is it fair that she comes to New York and raises lots of
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Mrs. Clinton's expression of interest in running
had energized both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her consideration of candidacy has gotten her a great deal of
attention,'' he said. ``We're taking advantage of her consideration
to raise money and to develop volunteers should I decide to run for
the Senate. It's smart politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was paid for by one of the mayor's campaign
committees and invites visitors to make online contributions and to
volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who was in Troy, N.Y., on Tuesday night to deliver a
speech, said the Web site received 200,000 hits Tuesday from about
25,000 dedicated users. He said that more than 1,100 people had
volunteered to help his campaign should he run, and that 2,000 had
signed a petition voicing opposition to Mrs. Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani expressed amazement at the response. ``Man, if I can
continue to do that good, who knows,'' he said. ``The sky's the
limit.''

LOAIZA OUT OF RANGERS' ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, anointed as
the fifth starter by manager Johnny Oates in February, pitched
himself out of the Rangers' rotation this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a fifth starter,'' Oates said yesterday after the
Rangers' 7-1 exhibition loss to the Boston Red Sox at Charlotte
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not need a fifth starter until April 13, and
Oates remains noncommittal as to whom it will be.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but another issue surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Can Loaiza pitch himself off the Rangers' Opening Day roster and
onto the one at Triple-A Oklahoma?
</P>
<P>
   ``That decision has not been made,'' general manager Doug Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who could be optioned to the minor leagues without being
exposed to waivers, views that as unacceptable and would request a
trade should that occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes to that, all I have to do is pick up the phone and
call my agent on his 1-800 number,'' Loaiza said. ``I've been down
there before. That would be like going from sixth grade to fifth
grade. There are other teams out there who would want me.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza drew considerable interest during Major League Baseball's
winter meetings in December, and as many as seven organizations _
including the Toronto Blue Jays and San Diego Padres _ expressed
interest then, major-league officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would likely find it difficult to receive sufficient
value for Loaiza in a trade this month.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, who described this as ``the worst spring training I've
ever had,'' could not stop the bleeding yesterday. The right-hander
surrendered five runs on six hits and three walks during his
five-inning appearance against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   That included a 36-pitch second inning in which Oates sent
right-hander Jonathan Johnson to warm up in the bullpen. This
latest performance gave Loaiza an 8.04 earned-run average through
15 2/3 innings, and opponents are hitting .339 (20-for-59) against
the inconsistent 27-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza's salary will not dictate whether he remains in the major
leagues. Loaiza will earn $1.4 million this season whether he
pitches for the Rangers or the Triple-A RedHawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make any difference,'' Rangers president Tom
Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, appear willing to attempt to develop what
Loaiza can offer. Loaiza allowed only a single and one walk during
his final three innings yesterday, and he has the best arm on the
staff, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to do everything we can to make them better
players,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin offered this point: ``What are the alternatives?''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza offers another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about them sending me to the minor leagues,''
he said. ``I'm capable of pitching here. I know I'm capable of
performing. I'm still confident.''

STARS TO GET BETTER SURFACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Reunion Arena staff has taken the first steps
toward improving the ice surface for Stars games, and hopes to have
the ice in good shape at least two weeks before the playoffs start
April 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on a whole list of items that
collectively should make a big difference,'' arena group president
Brad Mayne said yesterday. ``We realize how important this is, and
we're going to put a lot of time and money into fixing it before we
even get to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Stars players complained that the ice
surface was ``soft'' and rutted, and that those problems led to
poor puck handling and the chance for injuries. Because of that,
Reunion Arena management has worked to keep the building cooler for
Stars games and last week shaved the surface of the ice (which is
about three-quarters of an inch thick). By shaving the ice, the top
layer, which had accumulated some microscopic dirt, was taken off
and replaced with a new layer of ice.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer impurities, the ice will freeze harder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Reunion Arena staff will bring in dehumidifiers
within the next two weeks. That will help make the air in the arena
more conducive to good ice making, especially as the temperatures
warm. The Stars used the dehumidifiers in the playoffs last season,
and Stars players said that improved the surface of the ice
dramatically.

UCONN SAYS ITS WILL TOO STRONG FOR DUKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Champions are created in many ways, but
one constant is mental toughness. The players for Connecticut, the
1999 men's NCAA Tournament champion, showed that their minds are
sharp and highly developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' 77-74 victory over Duke probably should be regarded
as a surprise, but not a shocking upset. The Blue Devils were
``expected'' to win the title because of their seasonlong
dominance, but Connecticut was the only other team ranked No. 1
this season and both were No. 1 seeds.
</P>
<P>
   With five starters returning from a team that came within a
victory of reaching last year's Final Four, Connecticut had its own
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Huskies added their emotional leader in point
guard Khalid El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Khalid came to our program, he motivated all of us,''
said junior Richard Hamilton, who combined with El-Amin to score 26
of UConn's 40 second-half points. ``He let everybody know we had an
opportunity to win the national championship. Everybody said we
weren't going to fall short this year.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Huskies' 1997-98 season ended with a loss to North
Carolina in the East Regional final, Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun
started focusing on this season. The journey began in mid-August
with a trip to Israel. Hamilton was out with a broken foot, so the
Huskies had to play their eight exhibition games without him. They
went 3-3 against Israeli professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a relaxed trip, but without Richard
everybody had to step up their play and improve,'' Connecticut
junior forward Kevin Freeman said. ``Last year made us realize we
were close. Israel helped bring us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut started this season 19-0. ``People kept asking me if
they were affected by it, and I'd say no,'' Calhoun said. ``Nobody
would believe me. But the kids never concerned themselves with
records or rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NCAA Tournament, the Huskies defeated Iowa, a team
playing for its lame-duck coach, in the regional semifinals. They
survived against a nothing-to-lose Gonzaga team in the West Region
final.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the Final Four for the first time in school
history, Connecticut maintained its focus. The Huskies were the
first team since Texas Western (now UT-El Paso) to win the national
title on their first trip to the Final Four. Texas Western won in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough not to just settle for getting here,'' said
Freeman, whose defensive help contributed to limiting Duke's Elton
Brand to 15 points. ``We got back to campus, and it was like we had
won a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke entered the tournament ranked No. 1 and the prohibitive
championship favorite, but the Huskies say they knew they were
capable of winning the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the semifinals, all the questions people asked us were
about Duke this and Duke that,'' said center Jake Voskuhl, a junior
from Katy. ``We used that, and it hurt Duke because it put so much
pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it pressure, fate or the breaks of the game. Duke was
8-of-15 on layups or dunks. Junior Chris Carrawell missed a layup
after a steal. Connecticut twice converted first-half baskets after
the Blue Devils failed to secure a near turnover and a defensive
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outhustled us and beat us on loose balls,'' Carrawell
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final minutes, Connecticut made the key plays:
El-Amin's scoring the Huskies' last field goal and points (two free
throws at 5.2 seconds) and Ricky Moore's denial defense on Duke's
Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just out-willed Duke in those last few minutes,''
El-Amin, a sophomore, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the will to win,'' Calhoun said. ``We showed people the
heart and character this team has. That's what it always takes to
win a national championship.''

TIGHT END ROGERS GETS INITIATED EARLY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jacob Rogers should be dealing with nothing more
serious than senioritis, but decided he'd rather get hit by USC's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, Rogers was attending classes at Oxnard
High. But he graduated early and enrolled at USC for the winter
semester.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tight end is only 17, Rogers has started his
college football education early by participating in USC's spring
practice. USC coach Paul Hackett already noticed Rogers getting
popped by a defensive player because he was standing too high
during a drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, would he rather be in his senior year, kicking
back, enjoying life?'' Hackett said. ``He's a mature guy. I think
for a certain type, this is a great way to get a jump. For a
lineman or tight end, this is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rogers isn't complaining about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a jump but I feel I've acclimated to the
program,'' Rogers said. ``I've had no regrets. I've had a lot of
fun the last few days. This is why I came here early.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helps Rogers is having one of his best friends,
former Oxnard fullback Chad Pierson, on the team. Rogers may be in
college, but he said he still intends to go to the prom, and will
participate in Oxnard's graduation ceremony in June.
</P>
<P>
   Back to football: Freshman Sultan McCullough has run the fastest
100 meters in the nation this year (10.17 seconds), but he has no
plans to abandon football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the best in both sports,'' McCullough said. ``I
came out there to prove my point (in track).''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough thinks he could be the Trojans' No.2 tailback by next
season, backing up Chad Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Chad's a senior and a captain, it will be hard, but if
I can I'd like to beat him out,'' McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he's been impressed by McCullough's movement and
planting in practices, but he still needs to work on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little bit of the problem Frank (Strong) has. He
doesn't hold on to the ball enough,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson to fullback: Tailback Jabari Jackson has been working
out at fullback, a position where the Trojans are particularly
thin, because Brennan Ochs is out with a pulled hamstring, leaving
Pierson as the only true fullback at the position. Malaefou
MacKenzie could also play fullback, but is still in rehabilitation
from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas rests: Quarterback Jason Thomas re-aggravated his
hamstring and sat out Tuesday's practice. Thomas has been bothered
since the winter with a hamstring injury. He is considered
day-to-day.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The United States and NATO agreed Tuesday
night to an escalated bombing campaign targeting government
buildings in downtown Belgrade, in an acknowledgement that air
strikes have failed to halt the assault in Kosovo or sufficiently
damage the Serbian military, two senior American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks, which would probably include government centers
like the Interior and Defense Ministry buildings in the Serbian
capital as well military targets elsewhere in the country,
represent a major change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, NATO has largely limited its bombing to air defense
systems, factories and military installations on the outskirts of
Belgrade and forces directly involved in the Kosovo campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deepening and broadening of the target set,'' said
one of the senior American officials. The list of targets was
increased by about 20 percent, one official said. The change in
bombing plans was first reported in the early Wednesday issue of
The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   American officials made the request for authority to bomb a much
broader range of targets throughout Yugoslavia at a closed-door
meeting of delegates to NATO, but said they did not get as broad an
authority as they proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's Secretary General, Javier Solana, expressed
misgivings earlier in the day, saying he was not convinced that the
time had come to broaden the strikes dramatically, reflecting
strains within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded bombing campaign would be considerably less
extensive than the air strikes aimed at the political leadership of
Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991, when American bombers targeted
President Saddam Hussein's palaces and the headquarters of his
political party, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said, however, that any attacks on the densely
populated center of Belgrade would require pinpoint accuracy to
avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to escalate the attacks came on a downbeat day for
NATO, as its commanders received bad news from every direction.
 &UR;  &LR;  Serb forces continued to advance virtually unopposed on the
battlefield and the refugee crisis threatened to spiral out of
control, with NATO officials estimating that one-third of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had been forced from their
homes. The alliance was forced to beat back an attempt by Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to open negotiations on terms
dictated by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said Tuesday night that the alliance
raids had been stymied by a Yugoslavian air defense that has proved
more resilient than anticipated, new tactics that involved
dispersing Milosevic's forces in the field and extremely bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the alliance was eagerly waiting to deploy
A-10 ground attack planes that they hoped would strike directly at
Serbian troops in Kosovo and knock out tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The A-10s took off Tuesday but returned without attacking their
targets because of thick clouds and rain, a NATO official said. The
A-10s could not fly below the clouds because of the risk of
exposure to anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had an impact on the infrastructure, but the impact on
their operations is a different matter,'' the NATO official said.
``Whether we can stop it or not we'll find out. A lot of people
have real doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   With the alliance excluding the use of ground forces, airpower
appeared to be the only tool NATO has to influence the Yugoslav
leadership. But the air attacks have been constrained by political
considerations, despite the West's increasingly vociferous charges
that Milosevic is engaged in a brutal campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the bombing plan was developed months ago
when alliance officials anticipated that a modest air raid or two
would be enough to nudge a recalcitrant Milosevic back to the
negotiating table. But the scale and intensity of the Serb attacks
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have caught the alliance by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even we have been shocked by the sheer enormity of what is
going on in Kosovo at the moment,'' said Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with hundreds of thousands of refugees and reports of
murders, NATO's planners began to talk about the need to ``adapt''
their bombing plan.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, officials say, has a three-part bombing plan. The
first stage was to attack Yugoslav's anti-aircraft systems, an
effort that is still under way.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase, which had recently been launched, involves
strikes on the Serb forces south of Yugoslavia's 44th parallel;
those forces have been pressing the attack against the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The third phase of the NATO bombing plan had not been approved
until Tuesday night, and officials here had been reluctant to
discuss it in detail.
</P>
<P>
   It would give NATO commanders the authority to launch a broader
range of attacks against Yugoslavia's military leaders, command and
control centers, weapons depots, heavy weapons and fuel supplies.
And allied planners would get more leeway to bomb targets in
Belgrade and to put buildings like the Defense and Interior
Ministries on the target list.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States led the effort to get NATO to approve this
third phase of strikes. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the alliance's top
military commander, had independently asked for the authority to
hit a broader array of targets, according to NATO officials. Clark
declined to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The American proposal to broaden air attacks came as Serbian
forces continue to press their attacks against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, NATO officials estimated that 118,000 ethnic Albanians
had been forced out of Kosovo since March 24. Serbian tanks have
been surrounding villages and towns. Women and children have been
separated from the men and then forcibly bused to the frontier.
Afterward, their homes are burned to the ground so that they cannot
return.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Pec, which used to have a population of some
100,000, has now been almost totally destroyed. Along with the
daily handouts touting its air strikes, the NATO press office now
distributes a daily report on ``City Torching'' by Serbian forces
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we have not seen since the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in the
mid-1970s,'' said Shea, the NATO spokesman, referring to the forced
migration.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance spokesmen said the alliance had received sketchy
reports that fleeing refugees were even being shelled by Serbian
artillery and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   To put pressure on Serbian commanders to curtail their attacks,
NATO spokesman have repeatedly warned that their assaults against
ethnic Albanians might be prosecuted as war crimes. But the NATO
official said there was no indication that those threats were
influencing the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   To try to keep up the pressure, allied warplanes have also begun
flying during daytime, instead of confining their attacks to the
night. New American B-1B bombers and British Tornadoes are being
added to NATO's attack force.
</P>
<P>
   But to deter the Serbs, the alliance needs to expand the scope
of its attacks, military planners say. Whether Milosevic is worried
by the threat of escalation is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much force this is going to take is something we simply
can't predict,'' Shea said. ``We always hope for the minimum
because an alliance of democracies is never very enthusiastic about
having to use force unless pushed into a corner.''

HUNDLEY'S ELBOW FINE, BUT WILL LEGS HOLD UP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Todd Hundley understands it's management's
decision whether to carry three catchers or two when the season
begins Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After catching five innings against St. Louis on Tuesday,
Hundley said he's prepared to handle the bulk of the Los Angeles
Dodgers' catching duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good enough to go,'' Hundley said of his
reconstructed right elbow. ``I can go four or five times a week. Or
as much as I can. (Monday) we threw a lot, and we threw hard. That
was a test, to test it out and see how it responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley said it responded well. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said he still has some reservations. He'll talk with Hundley about
it, but added, ``I trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Today is another big test for Hundley. He's slated to catch
against the Houston Astros, marking the first time this spring
he'll catch on back-to-back days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't gone back-to-back,'' Johnson said. ``His legs could
cramp up.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last week the legs, and not the elbow, have been the
question with Hundley. The rigors of catching can take a toll and
Hundley said he's still not 100 percent. Hundley also said he isn't
concerned because he's done of lot of conditioning drills to
strengthen his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of running, the legs are getting better,''
Hundley said. ``There's no reason for (the elbow) not to feel 100
percent now. (Monday) it felt fine. You actually do more throwing
in practice than games.''
</P>
<P>
   Gettin' in a groove: After a slow start, Dodgers right-hander
Darren Dreifort is rounding into form. He had his best outing of
the spring against the Cardinals, striking out six in a scoreless
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real impressed with Darren,'' Johnson said. ``The last
time out he went five innings, this time he went six and could have
gone seven pretty easy. It looked like he was more confident
hitting his spots. (He was) crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, though, wasn't pleased with his control. He allowed
three hits and walked three. In 23 innings this spring, Dreifort
has walked 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good accept for the walk on four straight pitches to
(Eli) Marrero,'' Dreifort said. ``We had some good plays to get me
out of some tough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try: Kevin Brown's private planes are being treated as
plain old cash as far as the commissioner's office is concerned,
and the team will have to pay an extra $204,000 in luxury tax this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office has proposed adding $600,000 to
Brown's listed salary in each season of his $105 million,
seven-year contract. That's because Brown's contract contains a
unique clause allowing the use of a team-paid private jet _
estimated to be worth $50,000 per round trip _ 12 times a year so
his family can travel from L.A. or Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Recently disabled right-hander Antonio
Osuna pitched a perfect inning for the Dodgers' Single-A San
Bernardino team against the Cardinals' Single-A squad. He threw
nine pitches and experienced no pain.... Right-handers Chan Ho Park
and Dave Mlicki will both throw in minor-league games today....
Raul Mondesi earned a rare assist Tuesday. St. Louis pitcher Darren
Oliver lined the ball to right, Mondesi one-hopped it and threw
Oliver out at first. And it wasn't close.... Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield went 1 for 3, raising his average to .115 this
spring.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hampered by overcast skies Tuesday, NATO warplanes
bombarded Serb army forces, airfields and supply depots around the
clock but failed again to knock out air defenses or blunt Serbia's
offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and poor visibility have forced scores of allied
fighter-bombers to abort their missions in the weeklong air
campaign and return to base, their laser-guided bombs still in
their racks, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On only one day in seven have pilots had optimal conditions for
bombing _ a cloud ceiling of at least 25,000 feet and visibility of
more than five miles. Tank-killing A-10 Warthogs have flown air
patrol, but have yet to dare to dip down into the range of
surface-to-air missiles to attack tanks directly.
</P>
<P>
   Under strict rules to attack only when targets are visible, to
avoid civilian damage, pilots have had to dart in and out of clear
patches of sky to drop their payloads. They have been flying mostly
at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather has not been in our favor,'' said Vice Adm. Scott
A. Fry, director of operations for the military's Joint Staff, who
refused to say how many missions had been canceled because of the
weather. ``It has gotten more difficult with each succeeding
night.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Balkans are notorious for fog and rain, the week has
been unusually difficult, officials said, putting the air campaign
behind schedule, even as Yugoslav troops have stepped up their
campaign against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Military officials conceded the air war has failed to curb
the killings. ``I think right now, it is difficult to say that we
have prevented one act of brutality at this stage,'' said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The climate has compelled NATO to rely more heavily on missiles
launched from sea and air, as well as bombs dropped from B-2's, all
of which satellites can guide to fixed targets.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has cropped up. The Air Force is running out of
its most highly prized cruise missiles, launched from B-52's with
2,000-pound warheads. The shortage occurs as NATO gears up for a
possible assault on downtown Belgrade. Those missiles are the
weapon of choice for such missions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of the air campaign, United States B-52's
dropped roughly 50 cruise missiles, reducing by one-third the Air
Force worldwide stock of 150. ``That's something that we do worry
about,'' Bacon said Tuesday. ``We have a supply now. But it won't
last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Made by Boeing, the air-launched missiles cost $1 million each
and are prized for their accuracy and powerful punch.
</P>
<P>
   Although equally accurate, the sea-launched Tomahawk cruise
missile has a smaller warhead, 500 pounds, and is in ample supply.
They are made by Raytheon and cost $600,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the air war began, the Pentagon ordered a
review of its guided-missiles stocks and decided to proceed without
increasing the supplies. ``We are fully satisfied that we have
sufficient ammunition,'' a senior Pentagon official said Tuesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The secretary of defense and
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs were involved in that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather isn't NATO's only problem. Yugoslav troops and
artillery have dispersed into the region's forests and hilly
terrain. Serbian tanks are parked next to residential buildings,
daring NATO pilots to strike.
</P>
<P>
   To work around this obstacle, NATO wants to use unmanned
reconnaissance drones to reconnoiter the battlefield and transmit
the coordinates of allied warplanes. But the weather has grounded
the drones.
</P>
<P>
   There are also political constraints. Over the past eight days,
Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO military commander, has requested
Apache helicopters, only to be turned down by political leaders, a
NATO official said. The helicopters, for use against tanks, suggest
a ground war more than an air war.
</P>
<P>
   Even as commanders poured out their frustration here and at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, the Pentagon tried to put the best face
on the situation, delivering an upbeat assessment in classified
briefings to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and then a sanitized
version to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has flown about 425 combat flights against 100 targets, a
Pentagon official told reporters, ranging from air defense radars
that require only one bomb to weapons factories that require
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with detailed charts, military briefers said Tuesday that
NATO had damaged or severely damaged the systems that integrate
Yugoslavia's vaunted air defenses, its intelligence-gathering
capability, army and police garrisons, and aircraft repair depots.
</P>
<P>
   But Fry and Rear Adm. Thomas R. Wilson, the director of
intelligence for the Joint Staff, repeatedly refused to define
exactly what those terms mean, or just how degraded they believe
Belgrade's capability really is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to assign percentages to it,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the first time since the air campaign started
that senior officials from the Joint Staff, which has influence
over the targets bombed 5,000 miles away, had met with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon has given regular briefings but has pointedly disclosed
few operational details.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have clamped down on details
of military operations since last summer's cruise missile strike
against suspected terrorist sites in Afghanistan and Sudan. Cohen
and Shelton have justified this approach to avoid leaks of
classified information and to let Clark take the lead in releasing
most information.
</P>
<P>
   The American reticence contrasts with that of Britain, whose
Defense Ministry offers detailed news conferences. And during the
1991 Persian Gulf war, the predecessors of the two admirals who
briefed Tuesday gave daily briefings.

PROOF SEEN IN SHELVES BRIMMING WITH SINGLE-MALT WHISKY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You won't find 99 beers on the wall at the Wine &AMP;
Liquor Depot in suburban Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   But you can peruse about 550 brands of single-malt Scotch whisky
_ ranging in price from about $16 to $7,000 and in age from
relatively young to venerable _ lining the store's shelves and in
the case of the latter locked in a vault.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough variety in a decidedly esoteric niche market to give
store owner Howard Meister bragging rights to the largest supply of
single malt in America, or maybe even the world. A camera crew from
the BBC, as in British Broadcasting Corp., even dropped by recently
to pay homage to the unpretentious shop that draws customers from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So can Meister fit a couple more brands on his crowded shelves?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, absolutely, sure,'' he said with a chuckle, adding that
with new shelving his selection can be expanded to 600 brands.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for Lloyd Grant Gordon, the urbane brand
manager for Glenfiddich and The Balvenie single malt scotches from
William Grant &AMP; Sons Inc., because the company is bringing two new
products to market this month.
</P>
<P>
   And they are made in a rather nontraditional scotch-making way.
</P>
<P>
   The new lines, or ``expressions'' as some aficionados refer to
different products from the same distillery, are a 15-year-old
Glenfiddich Solera Reserve and an 18-year-old Glenfiddich Ancient
Reserve, expected to retail for about $48 and $64 a bottle,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   At these kinds of prices, Solera and Ancient Reserve won't be
for everybody, but then scotch is not a taste at home on every
palate, acknowledges Gordon, a member of the fifth generation of
the Grant family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to market it to scotch drinkers and people who like
the finer things in life,'' he said during a recent visit to Los
Angeles and an impromptu tasting at a restaurant in suburban
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Single malt scotch is so named because it comes from the same
distillery. Blended scotch is made by mixing several single malts
with spirits made from other grains.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenfiddich Soleras are based on the traditional method of
sherry production first created in Jerez, Spain. The key to the
system is the solera vat, which can hold about 5,000 gallons of
scotch but is always kept about half full. The malt master selects
three 15-year-old Glenfiddich single malts from traditional oak
casks, new oak casks and sherry casks and marries them with the
scotch in the solera vat.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a single malt scotch that can be sipped like a
fine brandy, with the 18-year-old showing hints of vanilla and
honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not innovation for innovation's sake,'' Gordon said of
the solera process. ``This is something that Glenfiddich drinkers
would expect from a family that does things a little differently.
And it's all about brand building too, reaching out to the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a lot of competition. About 95 percent of the
scotch produced is marketed as blended scotch consumers might be
familiar with. But bottlers can buy a barrel of scotch from
distilleries still operating or those that have been shuttered,
package the contents and ship it to retailers as a single malt.
That's why there can be so many single malts when there's only
about 90 scotch distillers in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansell, editor and publisher of The Malt Advocate
Magazine, a trade publication based in Emmaus, Pa., thinks the
industry might be getting to the point where the consumer might
just have too much to reach for in stores like Meister's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's getting crowded,'' he said of the market. ``It's
getting to the point where I think there is going to have to be an
end sometime soon to the expansion. You could be getting to the
point where the consumer might be getting overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might be, but not Meister.
</P>
<P>
   He's been in the business about 40 years, and most recently
owned the Gourment Pantry in suburban Encino. Five years ago, he
decided to stop being a full-line store and concentrate on
discounting, which prompted the move to Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   He'd already developed a taste for single malt and was selling
about 100 varieties then.
</P>
<P>
   As new ones come on the market they usually end up on his
shelves. Meister advertises his selection in the Malt Advocate and
does a brisk mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottles run from the sublime to the ridiculous,'' he said
of the prices. ``But the value increases on a lot of these
scotches. They become collectors items and are sold and resold.
Some we have sold for $350 a bottle and are now bringing in $1,200
and $1,500 from collectors. It's like wine.''

MAKER OF NET SYSTEMS FOR TV PLANS IPO

<P>
   NEWBURY PARK, Calif. _ Pacific Softworks Inc., an Internet
software company, has filed to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The company develops software systems that allow machines other
than computers, such as telephones, faxes and television, to be
used for Internet and Web-based communications.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Softworks, based in Newbury Park northwest of Los
Angeles, plans to offer 800,000 investment units at prices ranging
from $5 to $5.50. There are one common share and one warrant in
each unit. As soon as the company goes public, the shares and
warrants will be traded separately under PASW and PASWW on the
Nasdaq SmallCap Market. No date has been set for the initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Edwards is the lead underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The company is going public at a time when Internet stocks are
hot. Jeff Stacey, chief operating officer of IPO Monitor, a listing
agency, calls 1999 the Year of Internet IPOs. ``There's absolutely
a lot more Internet IPOs this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While a hot market for Internet offerings might help Pacific
Softworks, it has several hurdles to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Stacey says it's not a true Internet company like
Yahoo! or America Online. Pacific Softworks provides systems, not
content or direct access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company's declining sales and net losses for the past two
years also are troubling, he added. Analysts point to increases in
sales as a bullish factor for Internet companies, such as
Amazon.com, whose stock has flourished in spite of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Both sales and earnings have dropped at Pacific Softworks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the company had sales of $3.6 million and a profit of
$393,034 or 12 cents a share. By 1998, sales dropped to $2.7
million and the company lost $473,760 or 14 cents a share. The main
culprit for the loss was declining revenues, company officials
said.

HELPED BY WOMAN SHE SHOT, AMY FISHER MAY BE PAROLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Amy Fisher, who has served nearly seven years in
prison for the 1992 shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco, may soon be out
on parole, thanks to the help of her victim, who now says she
forgives Ms. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years is long enough,'' said Nassau County District
Attorney Denis Dillon, who announced Tuesday that he had filed
court papers seeking a five-year reduction in Ms. Fisher's
sentence. If a judge approves the request, and if the Parole Board
follows suit, Ms. Fisher could be free by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Ms. Fisher and Mrs. Buttafuoco have exchanged letters and
have begun a healing relationship that has benefited everyone,''
Dillon said. ``Mary Jo felt that because Amy had been abused in her
past life and done seven years in prison, that she had been
punished enough and that the healing should begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buttafuoco, whose husband, Joey, had carried on a yearlong
affair with Ms. Fisher, told Dillon in a letter that she had spent
much time thinking about Ms. Fisher and what she had done to her
and her family. ``From my perspective, there is no reason to keep
her in jail any longer,'' Mrs. Buttafuoco said in the letter. ``In
fact, I believe that she should be released as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Through an exchange of letters with Ms. Fisher and Rose Fisher,
Amy's mother, Mrs. Buttafuoco said that she now believed that Ms.
Fisher recognized the harm she had caused and that she wanted to
change her life. ``She wants to get the psychiatric care necessary
to be certain she will adjust well upon her release.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher was 16 when she began her affair with Buttafuoco. She
was 17 when she shot Mrs. Buttafuoco, saying later that he had
urged her to kill his wife. Part of Mrs. Buttafuoco's face remains
paralyzed from the gunshot, and a bullet remains lodged in her
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Although Buttafuoco, an auto body repairman, denied engaging in
a sexual relationship with Ms. Fisher when she was 16, he pleaded
guilty to statutory rape in October 1993 and served six months in
jail. The Buttafuocos now live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday, Dillon announced that his office
would support Ms. Fisher's request to withdraw her original plea of
guilty to assault in the first degree, for which she was sentenced
on Sept. 23, 1992, to up to 15 years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon said that when Ms. Fisher pleaded guilty, she apparently
believed, based on information from her lawyer, Eric Naiburg, that
she would be set free and placed in a work release program after
serving at least three years in jail. Dillon said that his office
had never made such a promise and that an investigation of Ms.
Fisher's claim indicated that she had been misled and denied her
constitutional right of effective counsel by Naiburg.
</P>
<P>
   In her request to withdraw her plea, Ms. Fisher accused Naiburg
of lying to her about the consequences of her guilty plea, and said
she had had a sexual relationship with him when he represented her.
Naiburg has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding that she had been misled by Naiburg, Dillon
said he had recommended to the court that Ms. Fisher be permitted
to enter a new guilty plea to the same charge of assault, and then
be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. The lighter sentence
would make her eligible for parole next month.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon declined to comment further on Naiburg's role in
representing Ms. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Naiburg, reached by telephone at his office in Hauppauge,
declined to comment, saying he would discuss the issue after the
court rules on Ms. Fisher's request. The judge is expected to rule
on April 22.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Ms. Fisher's mother, Rose, said she was
thankful for Mrs. Buttafuoco's ``pure act of forgiveness.'' She
said that she met with Mrs. Buttafuoco several months ago and found
that she was ``very compassionate and understanding about Amy and
her problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fisher, who met Tuesday afternoon with her daughter's new
lawyers, said she was hopeful that the judge would act in favor of
her daughter's release. But even with the court's consent, she said
she was concerned that the state Parole Board might vote against
her daughter's release.
