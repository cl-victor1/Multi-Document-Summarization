<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The price of the Venezuelan
oil basket rose this week 0.87 dollars to 19.13 dollars per barrel
(bpd), the Mines and Energy Ministry (MEM) announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This increase means a slight drop compared to yesterday's 19.50
bpd, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Crude international quotations advanced with the restriction of
the supply due to the cut of 2.1 million barrels a day agreed on
by independent producers.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) joined
these cuts for one year, starting last April 1.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil basket price averaged 13.55 bpd at the close
of this week, 4.55 dollars more than the 9 bpd estimated for the
average price of sale of the oil exports in the 1999 Budget of the
Nation.
</P>
<P>
Oil sector sources warned of pressures on the OPEC from the
speculative markets to prevent prices from continuing rising.
</P>
<P>
Mines and Energy Minister Alvaro Silva Calderon said that the
OPEC meeting to be held September 22 in Vienna will ratify the
cuts until March 31, 2000, because it is a factor which the
producers rely on to stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, oil prices in the international market also
rose sharply to over 23 dollars a barrel after a report showed
that U.S. inventories are at their lowest level in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even believed that the price will be 25 dollars
if there is a cold Winter.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Direct Talks on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Government Spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Friday said Cyprus government would like to
hold face to face talks with the Turkish Cypriot side to seek a
settlement for the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Papapetrou said the
government is pleased to hear that the United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan is working within the framework of
U.N. decisions about a solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
"If Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash sets unacceptable
terms for the talks and he refuses to go to the negotiating
table, then he would be violating U.N. resolutions and Kofi Annan
should lay the responsibility on him," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has insisted that his breakaway regime be recognized
by the Security Council before the Turkish Cypriots enter into
talks with the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, who was in Washington last week, has called on Annan
not to send invitations to the two sides for talks, saying he
would not respond favorably if he received such a letter.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in New York, he repeated his preconditions for talks
with Nicosia over the settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said, however, that the U.N. chief should send such
invitations "within a reasonable time" and that Cyprus' government
does not favor any other procedure which would in effect give the
chance to Denktash to avoid serious discussion on the issue.

Convent" , felt lamented referring to the rampant conflicts in
many countries all around the world including Angola.
</P>

that the " meaningful" visit is a good opportunity for him to know
the real life of the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>

literature, got the prize in 1998 for the profundities expressed
by his novels and the distinct way of using the ancient
Portuguese.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks San Jose Pact Continuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque asked Friday to preserve the Pact of San Jose, by
which Mexico and Venezuela supply oil in favorable conditions to
Central America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The Pact of San Jose is considered necessary for the
strengthening of the economic and social development of Central
America and the Caribbean, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is excluded from the Pact of San Jose, according to which
Mexico and Venezuelas supply 50 percent each of 160,000 barrels of
oil a day to 11 countries of Central America and the Caribbean in
preferential conditions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Perez Roque thanked Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez for proposing a mechanism for the energy support to Cuba
similar to the Pact of San Jose during the recent summit of
Caribbean presidents held in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela will unilaterally supply Cuba with oil after Mexico
blocked the island nation from inclusion in the pact.
</P>
<P>
President Chavez has met with Fidel Castro several times since
taking office in February and has pledged a continuous supply of
oil to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Pact of San Jose, renewed every August 3, benefits
Barbados, Belice, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and Panama.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of the amount of the cost is granted in credits
for infrastructure works in the benefited countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Latin America said Venezuela, one of the largest
foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, could face pressure
by breaking a U.S. embargo against trade with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Nothing out for Peacekeeping in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
provide military support operation rather than send troops to East
Timor for restoration of order there, a top U.S. official said on
Friday. But he would not rule anything out in U.S. support for
peacekeeping for that violent-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
"I think that what the Australians are most interested in are
those things that we have a special capability in: logistics and
communications, intelligence and air lift," said Sand Berger,
President Bill Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
"We have not made any decisions beyond that," he told reporters
aboard Clinton's Air Force One on route to Auckland, New Zealand,
for a Asia-Pacific summit. "But I don't think anything is ruled
out here." His comments were relayed to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether such a peacekeeping force might enter East
Timor without Indonesia's permission, Berger said: "I think it
is the view of most members of the international community ...
that our focus at this stage should be on putting the maximum
amount of pressure on the government of Indonesia to agree."

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Athens Earthquake Rises to 97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Tuesday
afternoon's powerful earthquake in the northwestern Athens suburbs
climbed to 97 Friday as efforts to recover the rest trapped in the
rubble of the collapsed buildings continued.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 Greek rescue workers, along with 185 of their
counterparts from Turkey, France, Russia, Germany, Switzerland,
Cyprus and Israel, have rescued 85 people, while they pulled 73
dead out of the rubble.
</P>
<P>
So far, the earthquake has injured more than 2,000 people and
left about 20,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded since Tuesday's
earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale, which occurred
around 3 p.m. local time in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20
kilometers northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
An aftershock registering 4.3 on the Richter scale also rocked
Athens at about 6 p.m. local time Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government decided at a cabinet meeting Friday to
extend an extra 3 million drachmas (about 10,000 U.S. dollars) to
those families who lost a worker.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to create a mechanism that would
strictly monitor the safety and quality of private construction.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has already provided 12,000 tents for
homeless people and they will provide 8,000 more tents by Monday.
</P>
<P>
Three campsites have been established in Menidi and in Nea
Liosia both of which were worst-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Of 12,000 buildings inspected by state engineers, 1,700 were
deemed fit only for demolition and 4,500 fit for habitation after
repairs.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who led a high-ranking
government delegation on a visit to the devastating northern
Athens suburb of Ano Liosia, promised more effective help and
support for those affected by Tuesday's earthquake, which is
expected to cost the country hundreds of billions of drachmas.
</P>
<P>
The premier announced Wednesday a series of measures to deal
with the earthquake, which include rental subsidies, interest-free
loans to repair or rebuild homes and start-up loans for small- and
medium-sized enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Britain Dismayed by East Timor Hawk Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday expressed
alarm and dismay at reports that the Hawk trainer jets it made and
sold to Indonesia had flown over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We are alarmed and dismayed by the reports. Our ambassador in
Jakarta has made immediate representations to the Indonesian
government," a Reuters report quoted a Foreign Office spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made after a Financial Times report said that
the Hawks were flying regularly over East Timor to detect any
encroaching foreign aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times also reported that Indonesian television
had shown three Hawks on the tarmac of the airport in Kupang near
the capital of West Timor, where thousands of East Timorese
refugees have fled to escape militia violence which the Indonesian
army has failed to quell in the wake of a vote for independence
from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The reports triggered fresh calls for Britain to cancel the
delivery to Indonesia of nine more Hawks.
</P>
<P>
Experts said delivery of the jets would be immoral while
Indonesia conducted a "scorched earth policy in East Timor".
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office spokesman said Britain's ambassador in
Jakarta had spoken to Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas
about the reported flights.
</P>
<P>
After the violence in East Timor was made known, Britain's
policy towards Indonesia, especially its military sale to Jakarta,
was widely criticized.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday demanded rapid and
effective action from Indonesia President B.J. Habibie to restore
order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Blair warned Indonesia it would face economic and
political isolation otherwise.

During the briefing, Kouchner spoke on the efforts by UNMIK "to
restore law and order, public utilities, measures to accommodate
the flow of returning refugees and to revitalize the economy" in
Kosovo, the statement said.

<P>
Richard Holbrooke, who made his first presence at the Council
meeting since he presented his credentials to U.N.

feeling in the (Council) Chamber that Dr. Kouchner is the right
man in the right place at the right time."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Indonesia to Accept International Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged Indonesia to accept an international
peace-keeping force to go to East Timor as he saw the situation
deteriorating in the territory.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in New York, Annan accused Indonesia of
failing to fulfill the agreed responsibility of keeping law and
order in East Timor, even with the introduction of martial law in
East Timor in the last 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military forces "have been either unable or
unwilling to take effective steps to restore security," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"The time has clearly come for Indonesia to seek the help of
the international community in fulfilling its responsibility to
bring order and security to the people of East Timor, and to allow
those who have been displaced to return home in safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, a number of regional governments including
Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Malaysia have
expressed their willingness to participate in the international
action, with Australia willing to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "East Timor is at a moment of great crisis, danger
and uncertainty" and that "a small mission" cannot be expected to
cope with security problems there, Annan urged the Indonesian
Government to accept the help "without further delay."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General described East Timor as descending into
anarchy with anti-independence militias "engaged in an orgy of
looting, burning and killing".
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese have abandoned their
homes and several of the local staff of the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET has been forced to evacuate 12 of its 13 regional
centers, with UNAMET local staff and non-essential international
staff successfully evacuated from Dili (capital of East Timor) to
Darwin (Australia) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. is keeping the situation under constant
review while awaiting the outcome of the visit of a five-member
Security Council mission to Indonesia, which is expected to be
known Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Council resumes its consultations on East Timor at 4:00 pm
EST Friday.

<HEADLINE> New Twist in S. African Arms Procurement Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- New controversy over
South Africa' s arms procurement plan surfaced Thursday as senior
ruling African National Congress (ANC) officials were accused of
accepting kickbacks, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) member of parliament
Patricia de Lille Thursday called in a motion for the
establishment of an inquiry commission, state television reported.
</P>
<P>
De Lille said she was in possession of a report from
disgruntled ANC members of parliament, claiming that certain ANC
officials and public representatives accepted bribes from foreign
bidders of the multi-billion- dollar arms deal, while some others
had business interests in the deal.
</P>
<P>
However, she stopped short of naming the ANC officials.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association (SAPA), the
implicated officials include Deputy President Jacob Zuma and South
Africa's chief negotiator for the arms deal, Jayendra Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
A former cabinet minister, a businessman and his brother and an
ex- politician are also among those implicated, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet last November approved the massive
arms procurement plan and the government is still negotiating with
preferred suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The arms contract, which is worth about 24 billion rands (4
billion U.S. dollars) is for the supply of helicopters, fighter
jets, submarines and patrol boats. The preferred bidding companies
are from Germany, Italy, Britain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has denied the allegations as groundless.
</P>
<P>
"The presidency rejects any insinuation that Deputy President
Zuma is implicated in shady arms deals. The deputy president
subscribes to the principles of transparency and openness in
business dealings," SAPA quoted Zuma's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Zuma remains committed to combating crime and
corruption in both the private and public sectors, without fear or
favour.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo dismissed the allegations against him as "junk", adding
that "I can say for the record that I have no commercial interest
in any company doing any work anywhere in the defence or
non-defence aspects of this package".

<HEADLINE> No Change in Turkey's Anti-Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's resolve to fight
terrorism remains unchanged, the country's military said in a
written statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the office of the chief of the
General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, said the recent remarks
made by Chief of General Staff Huseyin Kivrikoglu on the death
sentence ruling for the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan and on Kurdish press had been incorrectly
evaluated and used in a manner that contradicted the realities.
</P>
<P>
Kivrikoglu had remarked that "as the PKK leader admitted, the
terrorists have realized they will get nowhere with the use of
arms. Now they are contemplating a solution through political
means. They do not want a federation either. What they want are
cultural rights, " according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said domestic and foreign media obviously mistook
Kivrikoglu's statement for a "state policy" and a sign of change
in policy.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered an end to the
armed struggle against the Turkish government and people after
he was sentenced to death for treason on June 29.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has refused to negotiate with the PKK
which have been fighting a 15-year-old war for an independent state
in southeastern Turkey, which has claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Franco-Belgian Police Destroy Drug Trafficking Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- French and Belgian police have
recently destroyed a drug trafficking network operating at the
Franco-Belgian border, which has smuggled at least 2.5 tons of
cannabis to France in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted police sources as saying that the
network's head, a 35-year-old Frenchman, was arrested on Tuesday
at an oriental restaurant in Mouscron in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Three of his accomplices have also been arrested at the order
of a judge in Lille, northern France.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 people have been put under investigation in the
Franco-Belgian joint operation against the drug traffickers, who
often sold cannabis to drug-addicts.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Join International Force in E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Friday that France is ready to join an international
peacekeeping force in East Timor if the United Nations Security
Council approves such a force.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
Chirac made the promise in a telephone conversation with
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Gutteres.
</P>
<P>
Both Chirac and Gutteres said that the international community,
especially the Security Council, should make a firm reaction to
the acts of violence inflicted upon the people of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"President Chirac informed Mr. Gutteres that, if the Security
Council decides to create an international force, France will take
part in it," said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The French president also pressured Indonesia to accept an
international force when he accepted the credentials on Friday
from Indonesia's new ambassador to France, Dadang Sukandar.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told the ambassador that if Indonesia cannot stop the
violence in East Timor, it should accept an international force,
according to the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia cannot achieve the maintenance of order, it
should accept an international force, short of which the country
would banish itself from the nations and would be held responsible
for the consequences from it," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia should also provide a safe passage to
international humanitarian aid materials destined for East
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has rejected the deployment of an international force
in East Timor, which has been plunged into a blood bath by the
military-backed anti-independence militias after a majority of the
local inhabitants voted for independence from Indonesia last week.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches National Rebirth Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo launched the campaign of "National Rebirth" here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally at the Eagle Square in the capital, the
president called on Nigerians to "think positively, talk
positively and act positively so that Nigeria can be great again".
</P>
<P>
"Human rights without human responsibilities will be incomplete
and so will human responsibilities without human rights,"
Obasanjo said in "the Nigerian Declaration of Human
Responsibilities", the first of its kind by any government in the
most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the National Rebirth campaign was aimed at national re-
orientation of the psyche of the people in both public and private
sectors, particularly at educating the ordinary citizens about
their duties and responsibilities to the state, their
communities, their families and even to themselves.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates International Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday reiterated his demand that Indonesia allow
international peacekeeping force to restore order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
He made the demand on the background that he had received
reports saying the Indonesian military was aiding and abetting
the militia violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"Let me address the deteriorating situation in East Timor. I
am alarmed by reports I have just received of attack on the U.N.
compound in Dili. It is now clear that the Indonesian military
is aiding and abetting the militia violence. This is simply
unacceptable," Clinton said in a written statement released
aboard Air Force One en route to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government and military must reverse this
course, do everything possible to stop the violence and allow an
international force to make possible the restoration of
security," Clinton said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters aboard Air
Force One that Clinton was briefed on the situation at Hickham
Air Force Base in Hawaii by Adm. Dennis Blair, head of U.S.
Pacific forces, and spoke by telephone call with Australian
Prime Minister John Howard, who has volunteered to lead the
formation of an international force.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said on Friday that U.S. arms sales to Indonesia
are "under review." It did not elaborate. It also announced that
as a result of the suspension of U.S. relations with the
Indonesian military, announced on Thursday, plans for earmarking
money to finance joint exercises and training during the coming
2000 budget year have been canceled, and three Indonesian
military officers who were scheduled to attend a course next
week in Hawaii at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies
have been disinvited.
</P>
<P>
International financial institutions, including the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, have frozen
assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's military commander said on Friday he would accept
foreign peacekeepers, but not until after the military could
"calm down the situation."

<HEADLINE> Toll Reaches 90, Cleanup Ends in Moscow Blast Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The final number of people
killed in the Wednesday explosion that ripped apart a nine-story
building in Moscow was put at 90, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers are clearing the debris and leveling the
ground at the site where the blast, equal to some 400 kilograms of
TNT, collapsed all nine stories in the center section of the
block-long building, but left apartments intact on either side.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said 15 buildings were damaged,
mainly shattered windows, and a nearby school and kindergarten
lost windows, doors and doorframes. About 800 apartments would
have to be repaired, while the people registered in 286 apartments
would have to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are still investigating the tragedy, pursuing such
causes as a natural gas leak, dangerous chemicals stocked in the
building, or a bomb planted by terrorists linked to Islamic
militants in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller with a Caucasus accent told Interfax
Thursday that the apartment explosion and a Saturday night bomb
blast in Buinaksk, Daghestan, were in response to Russia's
military campaign against Islamic rebels in the southern territory
of the republic bordering the breakaway Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Buinaksk, Daghestan, believed to be staged by
Islamic militants, killed more than 60 people when a five-story
residential building was demolished by a car bomb.

<HEADLINE> Martial Law in E. Timor to Be Revoked as Situation Improves: Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The state of military
emergency in East Timor will be lifted as soon as the security
situation in the region improves, a spokesman of the Indonesian
National Defense Forces (TNI) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Martial law in East Timor will be revoked as soon as the
situation there has returned to normal," chief of the TNI's
Information Service Maj. Gen. Sudrajat told the press after
attending a meeting between Defense Minister/TNI Commander General
Wiranto and a visiting U.N. Security Council delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said security conditions in the riot-torn territory had
improved since the military emergency status was declared on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Armed Forces declared a state of emergency in
East Timor Tuesday morning following a series of violence in the
territory after the announcement of the August 30 direct ballot
result on September 4.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that about 100 people have been killed in clashes
between pro-integration and pro-independence groups in the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
The clashes also caused more than 100,000 people to flee to
some provinces in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wiranto said after his meeting with the five-member
U.N. delegation that the focus of their talks was the security
situation in East Timor and humanitarian assistance for refugees
from the ravaged territory.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully understood the preparedness of a number of
foreign countries to help Indonesia maintain law and order in East
Timor by sending in peacekeeping forces under the U.N. banner.
</P>
<P>
"But according to my assessment of the situation, now is not
the right time for an international peacekeeping force to land in
East Timor. There are groups of East Timorese people who are still
so angry with the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
that we fear they will direct that anger at the U.N. peacekeepers
if the latter come in now," Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the TNI will first calm down the situation
and after this has been accomplished, there will be hope that U.N.
peacekeeping forces will be welcomed by all East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the U.N. peacekeeping forces could come to East Timor
after the general meeting of Indonesia's People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) scheduled for November has adopted a resolution to
put East Timor back into its former status as a non-self governing
territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation arrived here on Wednesday to discuss the
security situation in East Timor with Indonesian leaders. On
Thursday, the delegation met with President B.j. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to visit Dili, capital of Eat Timor,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1976, has been seen by the United Nations as a non-self-governing
territory.

<HEADLINE> Irvine's Championship Hopes Diminished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Eddie Irvine received an early
blow on his hopes of winning the World Championship on the first
day of the Italian Grand Prix in Monza on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Irvine of Ferrari, who trails McLaren's Mika Hakkinen by one
point with four races left, finished only in 16th place at the end
of the first practice.
</P>
<P>
Although first day times might be misleading, it seems that
Irvine has quite a lot of work to do to make up the deficit by
Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
Irvine is in great needs of a victory for Ferrari in their home
race on Sunday to lift both his confidence and title hopes.
Another defeat this weekend would virtually end his hopes of
taking the title.
</P>
<P>
World Champion Hakkinen of Finland finished in sixth place
while Germany's Ralf Schumacher took top spot with his teammate
Alex Zanardi finished the third quickest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Rise 0.5 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department
reported Friday that prices at the wholesale level rose 0.5
percent in August, mainly because of a big jump in energy prices
and a smaller gain in food costs.
</P>
<P>
The August's increase in the Producer Price Index followed a
modest 0.2 percent rise in July. It was worse than expected. Many
analysts had been anticipating that prices would rise 0.3 percent
in August.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and good categories, however,
the so-called core rate of inflation at the wholesale level
actually fell 0.1 percent in August, after being unchanged in
July.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the big advance in wholesale prices, if matched
at the consumer level, could stoke concerns somewhat at the
Federal Reserve about a potential breakout of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale prices so far this year have been rising at an
annual rate of 2.3 percent, compared to no change for all of 1998.
The pickup in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big
increases in energy costs, which had been falling for much of
1998.
</P>
<P>
For August, energy costs rose a sharp 3.7 percent, the biggest
one-month gain since a 5.5 percent rise in April. That April spike
in energy prices had put the Fed on inflation alert and on June 30
the central bank raised interest rates for the first time in two
years.
</P>
<P>
The rise in energy prices in August was led by a big 9.1

<HEADLINE> India Denies Pakistan Claim About Return of Armymen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- India Friday denied
Pakistan's claim that it had refused to take back two of its
armymen, now in custody in Islamabad, in an attempt to cover up
New Delhi's alleged attack on Pakistani posts about 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We (India) are the ones who raised the issue with Pakistan on
August 31," a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
told the media here Friday.
</P>
<P>
India declared that all the soldiers of a six-men patrol team
had been missing inside the India-controlled Shyok-Turtuk sector
near Siachen of the disputed Kashmir since the night of August 29
while Pakistan said it had captured only two of the team which
intruded into its territory and initiated attacks on its border
posts.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday last week, Islamabad informed New Delhi that it had
two Indian soldiers in its custody and was prepared to hand them
over through the International Committee of the Red cross.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman reportedly said Thursday
in Islamabad that Red Cross officials had told Islamabad that
"Indians are not yet ready to receive the two soldiers."
</P>
<P>
India has reservations about Pakistan's bid to involve the Red
Cross in the handing over of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Indian spokesman said the fastest way to return the
soldiers would be for the military authorities to agree on a
pre-determined point for their handing over.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that
Pakistani troops fired along the line of control in the Kupwara
sector of north Kashmir Friday, forcing retaliation from the
Indian Army. But there is no further report of any casualties.
</P>
<P>
PTI said the Indian Army had foiled a major attempt by Pakistan
to push armed militants into Kashmir on the eve of the second
phase of India's elections scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a local official spokesman as saying a group of
heavily armed militants, in a pre-dawn attack Friday, stormed a
police post in a village.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that two Indian soldiers were killed and 10 others
injured when they were ambushed by a group of Pakistani intruders
at another sector Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Churns Through North Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Tropical storm Floyd
strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this
year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take
it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it
has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with
the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami. "We think it
could continue to strengthen and become a major hurricane in three
days."
</P>
<P>
At 14:00 GMT, the center of the hurricane was about 330
kilometers east-northeast of Barbuda at latitude 19.1 north,
longitude 58.9 west, the NHC said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, China's Tibet Sign Trade Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and China's Tibetan
Autonomous Region signed two-way trade contracts worth 31.58
million U.S. dollars, according to the head of a visiting Tibetan
trade delegation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of '99 Nepal-China's Tibet
Trade Fair Friday, Xu Minyang, vice-chairman of the Tibetan
Autonomous Region of China, said the trade fair, which began on
September 5, produced import and export trade contracts worth
31.58 million dollars, 8 million dollars of investment in Nepal
and six letters of intent for joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Six trade fairs have so far been held alternatively in Lhasa,
capital of China's Tibet, and Kathmandu, capital of Nepal. The
trade fairs helped promote bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
The trade between Nepal and Tibet, which are linked by common
mountains and rivers, have been soaring in recent years. The
two-way trade between Tibet and Nepal in 1998 was 23 million
dollars and reached 21.01 million dollars in the first half of
1999, a 160.47-percent increase over the same period of 1998.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Hardens His Line On East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Friday demanded rapid and effective action from Indonesian
government to restore order in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the demand in a letter, in which he warned Indonesia
it faced economic and political isolation otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Blair's intervention followed a 15-minute telephone call to
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie Thursday in which the President
turned down his demand to allow an international force into East
Timor saying it was not needed because the situation was being
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister was therefore dismayed that the situation
on the ground in East Timor has not improved," a spokeswoman for
Blair said, citing reports of Indonesian troops either standing
aside or helping militias carry out a campaign of destruction and
terror.

"The process by which the arms package was handled and by which

humanly possible," he told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>

He criticised the inclusion of Mbeki's name in a document

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- India said Friday that it
would like to resume the Lahore peace process and asked Pakistan
to facilitate the renewal of the composite dialogue between the
two neighbors by ending its sponsorship of cross-border terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the annual report by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),
declared that New Delhi was committed to the establishment of
peaceful and friendly ties with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the work of the United Nations, Annan urged
both India and Pakistan to revive the Lahore peace process and
said the Kargil conflict had demonstrated the fragility of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The MEA spokesman blamed Islamabad for the delay of dialogue
between the two countries, saying, "The continuation of
cross-border terrorism by Pakistan is a breach of the Lahore
process."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a violation of the line of control, whose sanctity
and inviolability is fundamental for the maintenance of peace and
security," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declared in an official statement that India "is
a responsible member of the international community and "there can
and never will be any threat to international peace and security
on account of India's policies or actions."
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that "Pakistan's armed intrusion and
aggression across the line of control in Kargil sector (of
Kashmir) was acknowledged by the international community," which
also "recognized and appreciated India's restraint in responding
to this aggression."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday met in a closed-door session to hear the briefing
by Bernard Kouchner, U.N. special representative for Kosovo, on
the latest development in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The closed meeting came in what U.N. officials termed as "a
more thorough consultation" on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held after the U.N. reports food decline and
bomb attack in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner, who also heads the U.N. Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), arrived in New York on Wednesday
afternoon, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has lost 65 percent of this year's agricultural and
livestock due to the recent NATO air strikes and could face a big
shortfall in food aid imports by mid-2000, U.N. food agencies
said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production in 1999, forecast at 113,000 tonnes, will meet
only 30 percent of the province's requirements and the number of
cattle has been reduced to 50 percent of 1997 levels, the
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.
</P>
<P>
A bomb attack has killed a Serb man and injured three ethnic
Albanians, including two children. On Saturday, Kouchner condemned
the attack, saying that the attack was "barbarian and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
About 130,000 Serbs have left Kosovo, fearing revenge attacks
by ethnic Albanians, since Serb forces were pulled out before the
NATO-led peacekeeping forces arrived in Kosovo under a military
accord between Belgrade and NATO.

<HEADLINE> Hunters Sent to Kill Cattle-Eating Lions in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Wildlife Authority
(ZAWA) has dispatched game scouts to Gwembe district in Southern
Province to hunt for two lions that reportedly killed cattle in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the ZAWA Lewis Saiwana confirmed Friday that
two games scouts were sent to the district immediately after the
report was received about the presence of lions in the district.
</P>
<P>
Saiwana said the two scouts were given instructions to find the
lions and kill them.
</P>
<P>
He said since the men were dispatched to the area nothing had
been heard of them and no animal had been reportedly killed in the
area.
</P>
<P>
"We were informed of the presence of lions in Gwembe by the
area member of parliament Clement Chimbwe and two game scouts were
dispatched to go and kill the lions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saiwana said game scouts had also been sent to Monze and Choma
districts in the province to verify reports of seeing lions by
local people in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Last week Chimbwe urged ZAWA to send game scouts to track down
the lions which had attacked his cattle.
</P>
<P>
He feared that the lions if not killed, might attack villagers
who are not aware of the presence of lions in the area.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Consumer International Criticises WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Africa regional office of
Consumer International (CI) criticised the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Friday for having failed to benefit the
continent since its inception four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Four years after the World Trade Organization was established
to encourage and regulate trade in the global market pace,
consumer organizations worldwide say it has failed to deliver what
it has promised," said CI trade officer Nessie Golakai.
</P>
<P>
She said the developing world, particularly Africa, had not
benefitted from these stated objectives and poor implementation of
the trade liberalization commitments by industrialized countries
had resulted in an unequal distribution of benefits from the
WTO-based regime.
</P>
<P>
She said CI demanded that member states must include consumer
policy in trade policy at both the national and international
level as well as ensure that views of consumers and the consumer
movements were represented in trade policy making.
</P>
<P>
"Consumer International has submitted specific recommendations
for WTO members to adopt within the Seattle WTO Ministerial
Declaration in November, " she said.
</P>
<P>
Among the key recommendations were that the WTO must promote
the participation of representatives from both non-governmental
organizations and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Of great concern to CI is that under the current WTO regime,
the distribution of wealth worldwide has become increasingly
unbalanced, particularly in Africa where consumption per capita
has actually decreased by 20 percent in the last 20 years," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said while CI was not arguing that the WTO had caused this
unfair distribution of wealth, it noted that the increasing
imbalance amply demonstrated that the WTO had failed in its
mandate to promote sustainable consumption and raise living
standards throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Consumer International represents 247 consumer organizations in
111 countries.

HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The allied forces which
support the Congolese President Laurent Kabila said Friday that
their positions in Mukamba-kasai Oriental Province of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were attacked by Rwanda and
Uganda-backed rebels on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) allied forces
 headquarters said over the past week they had observed a lot of
movements by the rebels and their allies which aimed at throttling
communication lines of the SADC allied forces.
</P>
<P>
This follows an earlier report by the rebels who accused the
allied forces of attacking their own positions in two towns they
hold.
</P>
<P>
The latest skirmishes threaten the cease-fire agreement both
sides signed recently.
</P>
<P>
"We will be happy if the rebels move back to their original
positions or we will be forced to use the means available at our
disposal to reach our troops," Allied Forces Commander Major
General Amoth Chimombe said.
</P>
<P>
He said they would not be stopped from reaching their troops by
these recent deployments by the rebels and their allies.
</P>
<P>
Chimombe said the cease-fire should be observed in its totality
and that these movements should not be used to endanger the
positions and security of the SADC allied forces.

KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh held talks with Nepali Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai and Foreign Minister Ram Sharan Mahat Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai told reporters after the meeting that he had
discussed with Singh matters relating to a review of the
Nepal-India treaty of 1950 in a new context.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said he had clearly presented Nepal's concept on the
100,000 Bhutanese refugees, who are now living in eastern Nepal
after fleeing from Bhutan around 1990. Nepal has been seeking
India's cooperation on the matter, but India, which handles
Bhutan's foreign affairs, takes "an evasive stand" in this regard,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Indian Embassy in Nepal, the
Indian foreign minister said this matter will be discussed after
the Indian election.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese Ambassador to India Bhesh Bahadur Thapa said both
sides had positive views on matters relating to border management,
water resources, security and economic cooperation.
</P>

Foreign Minister Mahat told reporters after his meeting with
the Indian foreign minister that the whole gamut of Nepal-India
relations including border problems and security matters was
discussed during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Murari Raj Sharma said the Indian
side expressed the view that an amicable solution to the Kalapani
territorial dispute can be found through systematic discussions
and on the basis of a study of the relevant historical documents.
</P>
<P>
he said both sides agreed to contribute to the resolution of
the problems which arose due to the open border. Nepal and India
share a common border of 1,700 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Japan Pledges to Contribute to Lebanon's Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan Friday reiterated its
pledge to provide Lebanon with a total of 100 million U.S. dollars
for the country's reconstruction which was launched after its
15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by visiting Kishishero Amai, the head of
the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Middle East and Africa section.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Amai
said the fund will be used in the economic field, especially for
the water and environment projects.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest development in the region, Amai told
reporters that things are going toward a good direction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the release of Palestinian detainees
by Israel posed a good start for the implementation of the recent
accord signed by the Palestinians and Israel at Sharm el Sheikh of
Egypt last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official, who came here on Thursday, also held
talks with Lebanese ex-premier Rafik Hariri on the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Japan is increasingly interested in
the Middle East peace talks and wants to be given a role to play
through its economic aid to the Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> EU To Consult With U.S. Over Row of "Havana Club" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
due to begin consultations with the United States Monday over an
American law adopted last year banning the use of the Havana Club
trademark by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, has said it
is to fight on Pernod Ricard's behalf against the U.S. rules "that
seem to guarantee hegemony for Bermuda-based rum-maker Bacardi."
</P>
<P>
The commission said the U.S. rule, known as Section 211,
violates the United States' obligations in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) under the Trade-Related Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPs) agreement. Pernod Ricard also claims that over 400
U.S. corporate trademarks are at risk of cancellation in Cuba
because of Section 211's unilateral abrogation of the
Inter-American Convention on Trademarks.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled EU-U.S. consultation, the first stage of the WTO
dispute settlement process, will deal with "the new U.S. trademark
rules contained in the so-called Section 211 law," the commission
said in an official document.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law says trademarks used in connection with assets
confiscated by the Cuban government cannot be registered without
the permission of the original owner. In this case, Jose
Arechabala's Havana Club rum plant at Cardenas, Cuba, was
expropriated by the socialist Cuban government in 1960.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Pernod Ricard signed a joint venture with a Cuban
state-run firm to market Havana Club rum produced in Cuba.
However, the U.S.-related Bacardi said it acquired the rights to
the trademark from the Arechabala family in April 1997. Bacardi
claims that it can use the Havana Club everywhere with the rights.
</P>
<P>
The French-Cuban joint venture filed a suit in a U.S. federal
court in 1996 over Bacardi's use of the trademark in the U.S. But
part of the court's ruling earlier this year cited Section 211 as
a reason for blocking the suit.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 80 million 9-liter cases of rum were sold
around the world -- 12 million cases in the U.S. alone -- of which
Bacardi accounts for 20 million cases, according to the EU
executive.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake Hits Mexico </HEADLINE>

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake of 4.7 degree
on the Richter scale Friday jolted Mexicali, a border city with
the United States, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The tremor occurred at 8:40 local time (13:40 GMT). The
epicenter was 9 kilometers east of the volcano of Cerro Prieto,
near Mexicali, capital city of the Baja California state, some
2,100 kilometers northwest form Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
Some residents left their houses fearing for a collapse, but no
victims were reported.
</P>
<P>
An expert of the National Seismologic Service attributed the
quake to an earth arrangement in faults of the north of Cerro
Prieto and south of Imperial in the region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drought Expected to Reduce Crop Production, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- This summer's drought,
which hit Pennsylvania and several other eastern states, damaged
enough crops to cause modest increases in the prices farmers will
get for their corn and soybeans, the U.S. Agriculture Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Based on its latest survey of crop conditions, the department
predicted that corn production would reach 9.4 billion bushels
this year, 2 percent less than it expected a month ago, and 4
percent under last year's production.
</P>
<P>
The projected soybean harvest is down 3 percent from last
month's prediction but would still be a record crop, 1 percent
larger than last year's.
</P>
<P>
The price of soybeans was estimated at 4.80 U.S. dollars a
bushel, up from 30 cents last month. The Agriculture Department
raised its estimate of the farm-gate corn price a nickel to 1.95
dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices have been depressed for the past two years because
of a worldwide glut of grain and falling exports.
</P>
<P>
The department said it expected the price of wheat to drop 10
cents to 2.60 dollars a bushel, down from 3.38 dollars two years
ago, even though U.S. farmers cut production and turned to more
profitable crops this year. Big wheat crops in Canada and
Argentina will offset the drop in U.S. production, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The drought did the most damage in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania
and other eastern states.
</P>
<P>
In Pennsylvania, farmers are expected to harvest just 72
bushels of corn to the acre this year, down from the 111 bushels
they got in 1998 and well below the average yield nationally this
year of 134 bushels per acre. Yields in Ohio are expected to drop
from 141 to 125 bushels this year.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department estimates the drought will cost
farmers 1.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Senate last month approved 7.4 billion dollars in
additional aid for farmers to compensate them for the low prices
and the price tag could go even higher before Congress finishes
work on the package.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is preparing a proposal of its own
that is expected to include assistance for weather-related losses.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Businessmen Backs EU WTO-Talks Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of the
American Chamber of Commerce in the European Union (EU) said it
supports the EU plans for a wide-ranging Millennium Round of the
World Trade Organization (WTO)'s multilateral talks over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
In a newly published 50-page position paper, the committee said
that despite well-publicized trade rifts between the EU and the
United States, their respective business interests in a successful
Millennium Round were the same.
</P>
<P>
Representing U.S. companies in Europe, authors of the report
called on policy-makers on both sides of the Atlantic "to overcome
short-term policies and histrionics to tackle the myriad of trade
issues" on their agenda.
</P>
<P>
The committee listed a series of areas where it hoped progress
will be made when the new WTO round is due to be launched in
November. These includes industrial tariffs, agriculture,
services, government procurement, intellectual property,
electronic commerce, the environment and investment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businessmen also reiterated their gripe about barriers
to American food exports -- from hormone-treated beef to
gene-altered foods -- by appealing to policy makers to set clear
scientific guidelines to trade policy, rather than letting
politics interfere.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of electronic commerce, the committee said the
entire services sector in Europe needed to to liberated first,
which includes government procurement, express delivery services,
financial services, information technology, business services and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
"For electronic commerce to thrive, services must be allowed to
be provided electronically across boders," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The probelm is that many of the underlying services are not
permitted to be provided across borders. This means then, that
they cannot be provided electronically, thus stifling the growth
of electronic commerce," it added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Food Decline in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Rome-based United
Nations food agency Friday said people living in rural Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province, have lost 65 percent of this year's
agricultural and livestock production due to the recent conflict
and warned of serious nutritional and economic consequences in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
With incomes from agricultural activities sharply down "the
rural population will be very heavily reliant on remittances from
abroad," according to a joint report released by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the U.N. World Food Program
(WFP).
</P>
<P>
An estimated 60 percent of rural cash income came from the sale
of crops, livestock and livestock products before the March 24
beginning of the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia, which lasted 79
days.
</P>
<P>
The balance of income was made up largely by remittance from
abroad, U.N. officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production in 1999, forecast at 113,000 tons, will meet
only 30 percent of the province's requirements. The number of
cattle has been reduced by roughly 50 percent of 1997 levels.
Small livestock and chickens now amount to almost 25 percent of
1997 levels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Import requirements for wheat, which is the staple food in
Kosovo for the marketing year (from July 1999 to June 2000) is
228,000 tons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Against this requirement, the report said 143,000 tons of
food aid deliveries, or pledges of food aid, are scheduled up to
the end of 1999, leaving an uncovered import gap of about 85,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The report said the level of food aid in Kosovo will depend on
the pace of economic recovery in the region, which suffered
massive destruction from the recent conflict and many years of
economic stagnation preceding it.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production in the province has also been affected
by a decline in fertilizer use and the stagnation of seed
improvement over the past decade. This resulted in cereal yields
in Kosovo at around mid-1980s levels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"At 3 tons per hectare, this is substantively lower than
yields achieved elsewhere in Europe," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report also warned that persistent civil unrest
and the recent exodus of a large part of the rural Serb population
has undoubtedly meant that many of the maize crops may now be
unattended and harvesting may prove difficult because of a lack of
hired labor.
</P>
<P>
On a brighter note, the report said, "Although the food supply
situation for the population in Kosovo was reported to be getting
critical towards June 1999, the high level of preparedness of the
international community assured that flows of food aid into the
province quickly started" after the end of the NATO air attacks on
June 10.

<HEADLINE> Most U.S. Consumers Satisfied with Online Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- In a survey released this
week 88 percent of U.S. consumers rated online buying
satisfactory, despite delivery and customer service problems.
</P>
<P>
The ease of placing orders or reservations is the key to
overall consumer satisfaction with online purchasing, according
Dataquest, the U.S. market research firm that conducted the
survey.
</P>
<P>
In about a third of the 37 million U.S. households having
access to the Internet or online services, there was at lease one
person who placed an order or made a reservation online during the
period from February to April 1999, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Of these households, 2.4 million, or about 20 percent,
experienced problems. The research showed that of households
experiencing problems, 49 percent reported that they placed orders
that did not arrive. Nevertheless, in more than half of these
households, the customer was billed for the order. For a quarter
of the households that experienced problems, the main problem was
the inability to contact the merchant's customer service
department via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
In the rush to participate in e-commerce, Dataquest said, many
merchants have not implemented effective links to back-office
system, nor have they given sufficient consideration to online
customer support.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital to win the customer loyalty at this early stage in
the development of e-commerce," Dataquest said. "Internet
merchants have the opportunity to gain competitive advantage if
they can provide outstanding and imaginative online customer
service."
</P>
<P>
Dataquest added that consumer satisfaction is crucial to the
future of e-commerce, for when an online experience is
consistently more satisfactory than in the physical world, and at
the same or lower price, consumers' habits are likely to change
permanently. But "there is no second chance to win customer
loyalty," the research firm said.

LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) - London's FTSE 100 index ended
1.1 percent lower on Friday as worries over the direction of UK

The bulk of the downward pressure came from the highly rated
telecom and interest rate sensitive bank sectors, with BT,
Vodafone AirTouch, Barclays and Lloyds TSB wiping some 26 points

By the close, the FTSE 100 had fallen 69.6 points to 6191,
having been up some 40 points soon after weaker-than-expected core
US producer price data.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were looking ahead to next week in

German shares closed higher, lifted by US producer price data
which cooled fears of rising inflation and a further interest rate

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Commerce and
Industry Secretary Herminio Blanco said Friday that his country
will seek a free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that negotiations for a FTA with Japan might
start next year, before the change of government in Mexico, said
Blanco, in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Blanco is taking part in Auckland in a ministerial meeting that
precedes the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum,
foreseen for next September 12-13.
</P>
<P>
Blanco said that Mexico and Japan officials will start this
month in Tokyo talks for an Agreement of Promotion and Protection
of Investments that would lay the foundation for an eventual FTA
between both countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement on investments is fundamental for
the intensification of commerce between the two countries. Blanco
said that Japan is negotiating a similar pact with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Mexico substituted during the first semester of the year Japan
as the United States' second biggest trade partner after Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican commerce secretary announced that talks for a FTA
between his country and the European Union will be resumed in
Mexico City next September 27.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has signed several FTAs in the American continent. The
most important is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
in force since 1994 with the United States and Canada, which has
promoted trade exchanges among the three countries.

<HEADLINE> Irish Unionist's Deputy Leader Pulls Out of Peace Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's fragile
peace drive ran into new problems on Friday as a powerful
Protestant politician said the Good Friday peace agreement would
fail and fresh controversy erupted over police reform.
</P>
<P>
John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP),
said he would play no part on a developed government of Northern
Ireland involving Sinn Fein, the political wing of the radical
Irish Republic Army(IRA).
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that it (the accord) is not going to work
because I don't believe that they (IRA guerrillas) are going to
stop re-arming and stop recruiting," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The IRA refused to disarm, imported arms, killed people,
expelled them and recruited new members, as well as targeting
potential victims, a BBC report quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's stance highlighted divisions in the UUP about the
accord and dimmed hopes of early progress in talks to be chaired
by U.S.mediator George Mitchell in Belfast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The accord is championed by UUP leader David Trimble but
scorned by some influential UUP figures who see it as a sell-out
to the Irish Republican Army and Sinn Fein.

<P>
AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The future is
bright for China's economic development and modernization drive,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark at a gala dinner given in his honor by
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Summit of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the dinner, Jiang briefed the participants on China'
s economic development. He noted the 1997 Asian financial crisis
has had a grave negative impact on regional economy, which had
maintained a sustained development for some years.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy has also come under serious attacks. The
Chinese Government has promptly adopted measures to stimulate
domestic demand and economic growth. China has made its own
contribution to alleviating the negative impact of the crisis,
helping the countries concerned out of the crisis and maintaining
economic stability in Asia," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the Chinese Government is actively implementing
the policies to stimulate domestic demand, in combination with
such macro economic levers as fiscal, taxation and monetary
policies, in order to promote economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that in the first half of 1999,
China maintained a 7.6 percent GDP growth rate. "We will further
increase effective demand, speed up infrastructure development,
promote technical advancement and industrial upgrading in
enterprises, ensure a steady growth of agriculture, carry out
extensive environmental and ecological projects, deepen reform of
state-owned enterprises, adjust economic structure, and improve
the quality of economic growth and the performance of our economy,
" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, firmly pursue the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world. The future is bright for China's
economic development and modernization drive," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: No Major Issues Solved Between India, Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh concluded his four-day visit to Nepal Saturday, with
all the outstanding issues between the two countries remaining
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by the foreign ministers of the two
countries Saturday downplayed or even did not mention the Kalapani
territorial disputes, the revision of the 1950 Friendship Treaty
and the repatriation of Bhutanese refugees, all the major issues
which Nepal deems to be of great importance.
</P>
<P>
These issues were discussed during the talks when the Indian
minister met with the Nepali prime minister and foreign minister,
but no substantial progress was made on any of them.
</P>
<P>
On the Kalapani controversy, the two sides did not reach any
substantial agreement. Instead, the two foreign ministers decided
to take up the issue at the technical level.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India Joint High-level Technical Committee has been
discussing the demarcation of the border in Kalapani for the past
three years, but without much progress.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Nepal lay claim to the Kalapani area, which has
been under the occupation of Indian troops since 1966.
</P>
<P>
The revision of the 1950 Friendship Treaty between Nepal and
India was raised by the Nepali side during the talks. The Indian
foreign minister did nothing more than showing a positive attitude
to this matter.
</P>
<P>
Nepal raised the need for reviewing the treaty in accordance
with the new reality in 1995 and prepared a draft, which has been
given to India for a review, but India has not given any response.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement by the two foreign ministers said they
directed the foreign secretaries of the two countries to resume as
soon as possible consideration of all issues of bilateral
interest, including those pertaining to the 1950 treaty.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Nepali side reiterated its request for
Indian cooperation on the repatriation of 100,000 Bhutanese
refugees now living in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign minister said after his meeting with the
Nepali prime minister that the issue of Bhutanese refugees will be
discussed only after the Indian election and refused to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue is that when the refugees wanted to go back to
Bhutan they were not given the same kind of free passage as they
were given when they were coming to Nepal," said Nepali Foreign
Secretary Murari Raj Sharma.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese came to Nepal through India when they fled Bhutan
around 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, there was more progress in the economic and security
areas.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said the talks between the two foreign
ministers covered issues of mutual interest, such as the
utilization of water resources, the management of the open border,
security issues, trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side reiterated the commitment of the Indian
government to continuing engagement in the development of Nepal
and the two sides agreed to expand cooperation in the development
of infrastructure, including transportation and communications, in
the adjoining border districts of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers agreed to expedite the joint development of
water projects, such as the Pancheswor multi-purpose project and
the Mahakali River project and agreed to encourage the private
sector's participation in the development of hydropower in Nepal,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali foreign secretary said the Indian side had stressed
the joint development of water resources. "It has showed the
willingness to assist Nepal in harnessing our water resources.
India is very much willing to see Nepal as an energy exporting
country."
</P>
<P>
As for trade and economic cooperation, the two sides agreed to
cooperate in setting up export processing zones in Nepal and to
jointly work to facilitate expansion of the industrial production
base in Nepal, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the Inter-Governmental Committee,
consisting of senior representatives of the two countries, should
meet within two months to discuss measures to promote trade,
facilitate transit and control unauthorized trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed to further cooperate in border management
and prevention of border crimes, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Both Nepal and India have been experiencing problems and the
understanding has been reached to control and check problems
arising from the cross-border movement of people carrying out
illegal and undesirable activities," said the Nepali foreign
secretary.

<HEADLINE> Inter-clan Clashes Destroy Village in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A village in southern
Somalia has been reduced to rubble as a result of a renewed
fighting between the Ogaden and Sheikhal clans living together in
the Lower Jubba region.
</P>
<P>
Local elders told Xinhua via VHF radio Saturday that the only
building remaining intact in the village of Hosingo, about 90 km
from southern port of Kismaio, is the mosque, which is seen as
neutral but accommodates no one.
</P>
<P>
The village has for several times changed hands with each side
inflicting the other with heavy casualties. Each side has burned
the houses of their opponents to ashes during their limited period
of control in the village.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people are known to have died and over 70 others,
mainly civilians, were wounded during the two-month hostilities
for the control of Hosingo village. According to the elders, the
latest round of fighting took place only two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Each side of the Ogaden and Sheikhal clans has accused the
other for massacring civilians and destroying Hosingo village
whose population are now scattered throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Osman Nur, who spoke for the Sheikhal Clansmen, has
called on the neutral clans living in the region to intervene into
the matter and appealed for a cease-fire. But there's no word as
yet from the other side.
</P>
<P>
The Jubba Valley Alliance, led by General Ahmed Warsameh who
chased General Mohamed Saed Morgan out of Kismaio in June this
year, control the major part of the region.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Economic, Technological Cooperation: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said on Saturday that China "has all along
attached importance to and actively conducted economic and
technical cooperation with fellow members of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC)."
</P>
<P>
The president, addressing here at a gala dinner given in his
honor by the APEC Chief Executive Officers (CEO) Summit, said that
since he proposed the establishment of an APEC High-Tech Science
and Technology Industry Parks Network at the APEC leaders'
informal meeting forum held in the Subic Bay in 1996, five state-
level high-tech industry parks of China have joined the network.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, the China-APEC Science and Technology
Industry Cooperation Fund and the APEC China Enterprises Assembly
were set up in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that all these measures will provide favorable
conditions for China and other APEC members to partake in Ecotech
(economic and technological cooperation) activities and forcefully
promote the exchanges and cooperation between APEC members and
their enterprises in such areas as advanced technology, managerial
expertise and human resources development," said the president.
</P>
<P>
While placing emphasis on Ecotech, Jiang said, the Chinese
government has taken an active part in APEC's trade and investment
liberalization process and has taken a series of major steps.
</P>
<P>
"The simple average tariff rate of China has dropped steadily
year by year from the level of 42.5 percent in 1992 to 16.7
percent at present. The average tariff rate for industrial goods
of China will be below 10 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"China has transformed the old model of management under the
planned economy and is vigorously developing a socialist market
economy. We have eliminated a large number of non-tariff measures.
In the area of trade in services, China has adopted a host of
major opening-up measures in an incremental manner in light of its
own national conditions," noted the president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that "We will continue to press ahead with the
reform and opening-up and actively engage in exchanges and
cooperation with other member economies of APEC and other
countries of the world, so as to make fresh contribution to
economic development in the Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole.
"
</P>
<P>
He noted that enterprises are not only the players in economic
activities and technological innovation, but also the principal
driving force in international economic and technical cooperation.
They should play an important role in the economic development of
the Asian-Pacific region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Inflow and outflow of investment and technology represent the
two interrelated and interactive aspects of China's opening-up
policy," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed businessmen of various countries to China for trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will provide you with necessary support
and assistance to facilitate your activities in economic and
technical cooperation and trade in China.
</P>
<P>
"China boasts a vast market, and its potential market is even
bigger. With a good growth momentum, the Chinese economy will
offer you ample ground for development," the Chinese president
said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Reduces Taxes on Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Finance
Ministry has reduced the excise and sales taxes levied on beer and
stout from 150 percent to 50 percent, the Monitor newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sales and excise rate was made effective as of August 7,
1999, but the factory-gate price of the various beers being
produced has not been adjusted yet, an unidentified source of beer
industry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it will cause a reduction in the price of beer,
he said it would definitely reduce the factory-gate price of
libation.
</P>
<P>
He said that his factory would welcome the news of tax
reduction.
</P>
<P>
"We used to produce a bottle of beer at 60 cents and pay the
government 90 cents in excise tax, but now when the tax is
reduced, we will produce at 60 cents and pay 30 cents to the
government.
</P>
<P>
"So we will save, and the retailers will have a reduced price,"
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The loss in revenue to the government is believed to be
compensated by a sales boost due to increased consumption, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China Producing More Mobile Telecommunications Equipment Domestically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to
manufacture more than half of the components and parts of mobile
telecommunications equipment now assembled domestically by the
year 2001, a Chinese industry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country has taken a series of steps to encourage domestic
production of telecommunications equipment, said Wang Jianzhang,
vice director of the overall planning department under China's
Ministry of the Information Industry, at the ongoing Third China
Fair for International Investment and Trade.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country will allocate 400 million yuan for this
effort, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Motorola representative attending the fair said that China's
decision to raise domestic production of this equipment conforms
with the international trend of industrial division of labor.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, a major producer of mobile telecommunications
equipment in China, raised its production in the country to 58.5
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 30 million mobile-phone users, ranking
third in the world, and experts expect this figure to increase to
90 million by 2001.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Phase Polling Ends With Sporadic Violence in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 50 percent
Indian voters cast their ballots Saturday in 123 constituencies
spread over eight states in the second phase of polling amid
sporadic incidents of violence and snatching of ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Revenue of the south state of Maharashtra
and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Udyan Raje Bhosle and
four others were arrested in connection with the murder of a
worker belonging to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), a
breakaway faction of the Congress party, early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that NCP activist
Sharad Lewe, who was traveling in a jeep, was attacked by a mob
with swords and other sharp weapons.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his injures,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Security had been tightened all over the related states in view
of violence in the first phase last Sunday which claimed six
lives.
</P>
<P>
Polling was held simultaneously Saturday for 353 assembly seats
in three states, 105 in the south Andhra Pradesh, 104 in southwest
Karnataka and 144 in south Maharashtra.
</P>
<P>
PTI said the polling rate was lower than the first phase, which
witnessed a turnout of less than 60 percent with New Delhi not
exceeding half of the number of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 million voters have decided the electoral fortunes of
869 candidates for Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian
Parliament, in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
According to the final figures released by the Election
Commission, only 58.17 percent of 166 million voters participated
in the first phase of voting, as against 62 percent recorded in
the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the low percentage turnout in the first phase of
voting has brought to the fore the "voter fatigue" with frequent
elections.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Police Crack Down on Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- In a major crackdown on
opposition parties, Pakistan police Saturday arrested dozens of
opposition leaders and workers who were planning to hold an
anti-government rally in the southern city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Several members of parliament and provincial assembly belonging
to Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)
were rounded up along with other opposition leaders as they
arrived to attend a meeting of a 19-member opposition alliance,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The police deported President of Awami National Party Asfandyar
Wali and Senator Ajmal Khattak from Karachi airport while
President of Pakistan Awami Ittchad Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan was
put under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Awami Tehrik Tahirul Qadri was also detained from his
Karachi residence and shifted to an unknown destination, a party
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The media center of PPP, the major opposition led by former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, confirmed the arrest of PPP
parliamentary leader Raza Rabbani and several of its workers.
</P>
<P>
MQM leaders Senator Aftab Sheikh, Senator Nasreen Jalil and
Farooq Sattar were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
Farhatullah Babar, spokesman for the opposition alliance,
accused the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) government of arresting
lawmakers without charges.
</P>
<P>
The government is bent upon depriving political opponents of
their democratic rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came just hours ahead of a planned opposition rally
in Karachi, provincial capital of Sindh and also the stronghold of
PPP and MQM.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, dozens of heavily armed police surrounded the MQM
headquarters in central Karachi and rounded up at least 50 of its
members.
</P>
<P>
Police intensified actions against the opposition after 19
opposition parties formed a grand anti-government alliance for the
removal of Nawaz Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused Sharif of massive corruption and
undermining and usurping the rights of three smaller provinces in
favor of his home province of Punjab.
</P>
<P>
Rallies and protest meetings have been banned in Sindh Province
for two months. A government announcement said the ban has been
imposed to save people from "inconvenience" caused by rallies and
to ensure undisturbed economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Macao Marks 100-Day Countdown to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- In the square in front of the
Municipal Council in Downtown Macao, a giant painting featuring a
flying phoenix was being composed Saturday afternoon to express
Macao people's expectations for their long-awaited homecoming.
</P>
<P>
The event was to mark the 100-day countdown to Macao's return
to the motherland, the 90-foot-long (30 meters) painting took some
100 pupils one hour to finish. Government officials and social
celebrities were invited to sign the painting upon its completion.
</P>
<P>
The Women's Association of Macao, organizer of the event, said
the painting was a gift to the occasion and the work symbolizes
Macao is heading for a new era.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of loving the motherland and Macao and greeting
Macao's return, an exhibition of children's paintings was also
held in the square on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ng, a stamp designer, brought his 20-meter-long painting to
the square and said he was very glad to make his contribution to
Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
He said the newly formed government of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) has a fresh outlook. All the principal
officials are Macao residents and are very familiar with Macao's
situation.
</P>
<P>
Judging by their preparatory work, they have laid a solid basis
for implementing the "one country, two systems" principle in Macao,
said Ng.
</P>
<P>
The celebration was part of a series of activities to mark the
region's upcoming return. In order to solicit more opinions on the
establishment of the Macao SAR, the Association for Promotion of
Basic Law of Macao held a seminar on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Participants, mainly noted local figures, offered many
constructive suggestions on the upcoming SAR administration and
expressed their confidence in a brighter future after Macao's
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
When night fell in Macao, two evening galas were held
simultaneously on two squares.
</P>
<P>
The evening galas featured dancing and singing performances, as
well as a quiz on the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 100-day countdown, various activities had also
been staged in Macao.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,999 homing pigeons were released Thursday morning
to fly back home in Guangzhou some 100 kilometers away. The flying
pigeons were meant to indicate that Macao is returning to the
embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
To increase understanding between Macao and the mainland, a
youth art troupe from Guangzhou was invited to give performances
over the past several days in Macao for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said all these activities helped promote patriotism
among Macao residents and pave the way for a smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> "Without Ecotech, APEC Would Be Deprived of Sustained Driving Force ":       Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- "Without
Ecotech (economic and technological cooperation), APEC would be
deprived of a sustained driving force for its development,"
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gala dinner given by the APEC (the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation)Chief Executive Officers (CEO) Summit, Jiang
stressed APEC's responsibility to promote cooperation between its
member countries and help them survive the deepening economic
globalization, which is an important feature in today's world
economy.
</P>
<P>
The growing trend of economic globalization is a product of the
rapid scientific and technological progress, industrial
restructuring and sharp market fluctuations in the world today, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The trend towards economic globalization has brought about not
only opportunities for development but also grim challenges and
risks for the countries in the world. It is like a double-edged
sword. While helping open markets, intensify competition and
improve efficiency, it presents to all countries, developing ones
in particular, a new issue of how to maintain their own economic
security.
</P>
<P>
"As a forum for regional economic cooperation with mutually-
beneficial cooperation as its principle and common prosperity as
its purpose, APEC ought to do something to help its members to
take an active part in international economic cooperation and to
effectively cope with the resulting risks and challenges."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed: "Strengthening Ecotech is an important means to
enhance its cohesiveness. Without Ecotech, APEC would be deprived
of a sustained driving force for its development."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ecotech is by no means confined to a simple
transfer of technologies. Rather, it covers, among others,
cooperation in the research and development of science and
technology, in the industrial application of mature technologies
as well as in finance, venture capital and the development of
human resources.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation should be designed to materialize the
potentiality of all members in cooperation in the fields of
science and technology and industry," President Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Puts 250 Soldiers Ready for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain has put 250 Nepalese
Gurkha troops ready to go into East Timor if needed, a defense
ministry spokesman said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "we have an infantry company of Gurkhas
currently stationed in Brunei. They can go to East Timor or
Australia within two or three days."
</P>
<P>
A British reconnaissance team could also be sent in to see what
they might need to take, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Britain's decision was made after Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said on Saturday in Auckland that Australia, New
Zealand, Malaysia, Britain, Canada, the Philippines and Portugal
had committed to participate in a U.N.-mandated peacekeeping force
in East Timor if Indonesia consented to such a force.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese Gurkhas are a regular fixture in British military
deployments abroad.
</P>
<P>
A group of the Nepalese Gurkhas were sent to the Serbian
province of Kosovo in June after NATO's 11-week air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Two of the soldiers were killed there while helping to dispose
of cluster bombs dropped by NATO's air forces.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, under considerable international pressure to halt
massacres carried out by anti-independence militia in Timor,
appeared on Saturday to be leaning towards allowing foreign
peacekeepers into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wide-spread killings were reported in Timor after the territory
's overwhelming vote on August 30 in favor of ending Indonesian
rule.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui, Seller of China's National Interest: People's Daily ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily tomorrow
is to carry a commentary titled "the Seller of the Interest of the
Chinese Nation," the third of a series of commentaries issued by
the paper to denounce Lee's "two-states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui proposed the "two-states" statement to split the
motherland at a time when he is about to fade from the limelight,
and thus has made himself a complete opponent of the entire
Chinese people, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The long history of the Chinese nation has been dominated by
the search for unity, the paper says, noting that the China has
immense vitality and cohesive force.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that China has never been separated for
long, despite numerous foreign invasions and internal struggles,
and stresses that the unity of the motherland is the supreme
interest and a common and sacred goal of the Chinese people on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The man-made separation of the two sides over the past five
decades stands against the interest of the Chinese nation, the
commentary says. Lee Teng-hui has moved against the trends of the
history, as all the Chinese people everywhere look forward to the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out that the leaders of Taiwan prior to Lee
Teng-hui, though having serious political disputes with the
mainland, consistently said that there is only one China. Lee
Teng-hui, however, has gradually abandoned the principle of "one
China" and has attempted to split Taiwan from the motherland step
by step, ever since he took power.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee has supported "Taiwan Independence" elements by legalizing
their status in the island, and has caused trouble for cross-
Straits relations consistently, the paper emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
This time, Lee has thoroughly exposed his separatist essence by
attempting to reposition relations between the mainland and Taiwan
by proposing the "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-
state relations" concept.
</P>
<P>
Lee, like other "Taiwan Independence" elements, fears a
powerful motherland, the paper says, adding that a powerful China
is the most effective curb against these elements. Lee has echoed
international anti-China sentiments by drumming up the specter of
a "China Threat" in an attempt to hamper the reinvigoration of
China.
</P>
<P>
For years, Lee has spared no efforts, with his power and
resources, in an attempt to pit the "Taiwan people" against the
the "Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
But no one can block or sever the kinship between the people of
the two sides, the paper says, quoting official figures that more
than 14 million Taiwan compatriots have visited the mainland and
their ancestral homes, invested and done business here, and
engaged in exchanges of many kinds.
</P>
<P>
Without the backing of the motherland, Taiwan will be captured
by hegemonists, and the island province, if it falls into the
hands of foreign enemies or separatists, would become a
springboard or stronghold for foreign invaders, the paper comments.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quotes President Jiang Zemin as saying, in his
phone-talk with U.S. President Bill Clinton, China will never sit
idle if some people engage in seeking 'Taiwan's independence' or
foreign forces interfere in China's cause of reunification.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's effort to improve its
foreign exchange (forex) administration since the start of the
Asian financial crisis is not a retrogression to forex control but
a major step to ensure the country's economic and financial
security, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The effort represents the central government's resolution to
crack down on forex-related crimes, protect the legal interests of
overseas investors, and achieve a long-term healthy growth in
overseas investment," said Liu Xin, in charge of investment at
China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since last year China has adopted a series of
effective measures to verify the authenticity of current trade
accounts and reinforce foreign-exchange management under capital
accounts.
</P>
<P>
These steps, Liu said, are intended to crack down firmly on
illegal activities in the foreign exchange sector and maintain the
stability of the yuan exchange rate and balanced international
payments.
</P>
<P>
"Gradually introducing a fully convertible currency remains the
final target for the reform of China's foreign exchange system,"
Liu added.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Proposed Visit by U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- India Saturday rejected a
proposed visit by a U.S. official to discuss religious freedom in
the country following the release of an internal report by the
U.S. State Department on religious freedoms on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi "has no plans or intention to invite such an official
to India or to engage in discussion with any foreign governments
or agency on these matters," the External Affairs Ministry said in
a press release issued here.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp reaction to reports of Washington's intention to
send ambassador at large for international religious freedom,
Robert Sieple, for talks with Indian officials, the ministry
termed the move as intrusive.
</P>
<P>
"The government and people of India reject any intrusive
exercise into how we conduct out affairs," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report criticized the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) as one of a number of offshoots of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak
Singh (RSS), an organization that "espouses a return to Hindu
values and cultural norms."
</P>
<P>
Members of the BJP RSS and other affiliated organizations had
been "implicated in incidents of violence and discrimination
against Christians and Muslims," it charged.
</P>
<P>
It pointedly mentioned that most BJP leaders, including
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Home Minister L.
K. Advani, are also RSS members, as are chief ministers of several
states.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said Sieple would convey U.S. concern
about religious freedom in the country during the proposed visit
in which he would have a "candid" discussion with Indian officials
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of the report in Washington, the U.S.
Embassy here was quick to clarify on Friday that the survey "has
no relation to events in any particular country" and that the
timing of its release was determined by U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government declared in the press release that
absolute religious freedom is guaranteed, in accordance with the
laws, by constitution, which provides a strong framework for a
secular and democratic polity.

<HEADLINE> Mainland to Further Encourage Taiwan Investors, Despite Lee Teng- hui's "Two-States" Remarks: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the "two-states"
remark made by Lee Teng-hui, the mainland will continue to
encourage investors from Taiwan, and a series of new and
preferential policies will be issued by the Chinese government to
attract more investment from the island.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made at a local news briefing by Wang Hui,
director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Department under the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that Lee Teng-hui has always created trouble
during time when cross-Straits relations are going well. His
provocative activities in recent years cannot block the pace of
the development of cross-Straits trade and economic exchanges, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, in the first seven months of this
year, cross-Straits trade reached 12.7 billion U.S. dollars, up 12.
5 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's direct exports to Taiwan were 2.11 billion U.S.
dollars, equal to that of last year, while Taiwan directly
exported 12.06 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this July, indirect cross-Straits trade had
topped 149.6 billion U.S. dollars. Taiwan enjoyed a surplus of 101.
3 billion U.S. dollars, as the mainland only exported 24.2 billion
U.S. dollars of goods, and the island province exported 125.5
billion U.S. dollars.

effort for peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the new parliament started functioning, Faleiro
said, a resolution on IYCP would be introduced with the aim of
strengthening the United Nations as a guardian of global peace and
to see that the Non-Aligned Movement gains further momentum.

ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling

Sunday and Monday, which will be chaired by Iraq under an
alphabetical rotation basis.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid and al-Sahhaf discussed proposals on clearing Arab
atmosphere, healing Arab rifts and creating adequate climate to
help the ministers come up with positive resolutions towards Iraq
and Arab solidarity, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers' meeting is expected to discuss the Iraq
issue. Iraq has been under United Nations economic sanctions since
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the event which is widely believed to
have jeopardized the Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also dealt with a possible meeting on the
sidelines of the foreign ministers' meeting by a committee aimed
at helping get the sanctions on Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up during an emergency meeting of Arab
foreign ministers held in Cairo on January 24. But Iraq has
refused to recognize the committee or cooperate with it unless it
becomes a member.

<HEADLINE> China in Eyes of Foreign Comic Dialogue Performers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- If you just listen, you may
not think they are foreigners performing Chinese comic dialogues.
</P>
<P>
"It is really exciting for us to amuse a Chinese audience,"
said Borza and Mamadu, from Bulgaria and Cameroon, after stepping
down from the stage.
</P>
<P>
The traditional Chinese comic dialogue (Xiangsheng) was created
many years ago, and it is still a favorite of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
It is pretty difficult to learn Xiangsheng routines, not only
for foreigners, but for Chinese as well. Borza and Mamadu are
both students at the Beijing Language and Culture University, and
they have become rising stars as entertainers after learning
Xiangsheng for only half a year.
</P>
<P>
They have now appeared at several large performances, including
the 22nd Universal Postal Congress evening party and the
International Labor Day show on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"Xiangsheng makes people laugh, and it also encourages people
to think," said Mamadu, who has been studying Chinese for three
years at the University, adding that he learns more about this
ancient oriental country through laughter.

<P>
More importantly, he said, the Chinese people are humorous,
intelligent and enthusiastic about life.
</P>
<P>
"I hear laughter, see smiling faces, and feel people's strong
desire for a better life," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese capital, a group of foreign comic dialogue
performers, who all take Ding Guangquan, one of masters of the art,
as their teacher, have been active in entertaining local audience
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"In order to learn a tongue-twister routine, we and master Ding
often practice it dozens of times. In the end, our tongues are
little numb," said Borza, the a 22-year-old Bulgarian woman.
</P>
<P>
Speaking, imitating, teasing, and singing are four basic
Xiangsheng skills, and speaking, of course, is the basis of this
linguistic art.
</P>
<P>
"I am moved that young foreigners love traditional Chinese art
so deeply," Ding said, adding that laughter is his best reward.
</P>
<P>
On weekends, Ding and his students have a good time practicing
Xiangsheng and making Chinese dumplings together.
</P>
<P>
"I'm reluctant to leave China and master Ding," Borza said
before leaving for home, adding that she will play the videotape
of her performance for her mother.
</P>
<P>
On his future plan, Mamadu said he will continue to try and
amuse his Chinese audiences.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Lifting of U.N. Economic Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq demanded on Saturday the
lifting of U.N. sanctions, saying it has complied with all
international resolutions punishing it for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf a day before a meeting of Arab foreign ministers, which
is expected to discuss Iraq's problems with the United Nations and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations and demands that the
sanctions be lifted," al-Sahhaf said after meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"This is an inalienable right for Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt also wants the Iraqi-U.N. confrontation to
end and see sanctions on Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
"Everything which affects Iraq, its people and its children is
something which we would not accept," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here Friday for the biannual meeting of the
Arab foreign ministers. The meeting, slated for Sunday, will be
chaired by Iraq under an alphabetical rotation basis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was originally scheduled for September 4 but was
moved to September 12 at the request of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been the strongest opponents of
allowing Iraq back into the Arab fold. In January, the two
countries blocked an Iraqi proposal for the league to condemn
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq and to support its campaign for
the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has suffered more than eight years of debilitating
sanctions because of its invasion and occupation of Kuwait in
1990-91.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that Iraq chairs the Arab League
meeting since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Today began the 100-day
countdown to Macao's return to the motherland, as thousands of
Chinese came to Tian'anmen Square to have their pictures taken in
front of the large countdown sign erected on the east side of the
square on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The sign features a golden five-pointed stars and green lotuses
design, the regional emblem of the Macao Special Administrative
Region, and characters which read "The Chinese Government Resumes
Sovereignty Over Macao."
</P>
<P>
A grand concert was held near the countdown board yesterday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the hardships of preparing for the concert and
cleaning up afterwards, I am very proud that I can do something
for Macao's return," a painter from the China Opera and Ballet
Theater told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to one traffic policeman, more people than usual
swarmed to the square today to take pictures for the special
occasions, many arriving by taxi.
</P>
<P>
Two girls who were having their photos taken said they really
want to visit Macao someday in the future, after it returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
"I came to take this picture just because I want to keep this
moment in my mind forever," Chen Jian, an elderly man said with
excitement.

Coming from central China's Henan Province, Liu Guorong, whose
father lives in Taiwan, said he was going to mail the historic

<HEADLINE> Probe Report on Ugandan-Rwandan Clashes in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma had received the probe report on the clashes
between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani, a northern town
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on August 14-17.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma revealed this in Kampala on Friday evening but he
declined to comment on the probe, Ugandan newspaper Monitor said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the report was handed over to the presidents of both
countries, intense negotiations have been going on between Kigali
and Kampala to ensure that the findings are not disclosed, sources
in Kigali were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report follows efforts by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame to resolve their
differences following their meeting in western Uganda in the wake
of the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The report allegedly said that Uganda sent more troops to
Kisangani through other parts of the eastern DRC to reinforce
their positions and subsequently attacked the Rwandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the clashes, a total of 38 Ugandan soldiers and more than
200 civilians were killed while the casualties on the Rwandan side
were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Both sides accused each other of inciting the battle between
the two traditional allies.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators Agree to Eliminate Eight Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators have agreed to
eliminate seven pesticides and an industrial compound as the third
round of negotiations on the global persistent organic pollutants
(POP) treaty ended here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The eight chemicals to be eliminated are hexachlorobenzene,
endrin, mirex, toxaphene, chlordane, heptachlor, aldrin and
dieldrin.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the progress on the elimination of the eight least
produced and used chemicals, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
called on governments to make further efforts to eliminate the
remaining most toxic chemicals, DDT and its by-products such as
dioxins, PCBs and furans.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on the least contentious chemicals provides a
good foundation for action on the other four," said Clifton Curtis,
Director of the WWF's Global Toxics Initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Financial assistance can be the deal maker or the deal breaker,
" Curtis said. "There's a chance to really make this treaty work,
but it won't without significant, new financial assistance from
the developed world."
</P>
<P>
POPs are highly toxic chemicals that break down extremely
slowly in the environment, travel long distances and are linked to
reproductive abnormalities, immune system dysfunction,
neurological defects and cancer.
</P>
<P>
The POP treaty is targeted for completion in South Africa in
late 2000 and a signing ceremony is planned for Sweden in early
2001.

KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ernest Wamba dia Wamba,
leader of the Kisangani faction of the major rebel group, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), has moved his headquarters
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Wamba has moved over 480 kilometers from the northern town of
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Bunia town in the
east, the New Vision newspaper reported in Kampala Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of RCD general assembly Mbusa Nyamwisi, now a Wamba
loyalist, was quoted as saying that this move of headquarters was
temporary and it was for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
When the situation in Kisangani, where Wamba and his backer
Ugandan troops are based, improves a little bit, Wamba's
headquarters would be moved back to the town, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
They allegedly had unearthed a plot to kill Wamba by Rwandan
security, said another source close to Wamba.
</P>
<P>
Following the probe by Ugandan and Rwandan army chiefs, all
forces in Kisangani reverted to the positions they held before
August 14, when Ugandan and Rwandan forces clashed in the DRC
town.
</P>
<P>
In the August 14-17 clashes, Wamba's headquarters in Hotel
Wagenia was bombed by the Rwandan military, but Wamba himself
survived the attack with the assistance of a Ugandan battalion.

<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton, in an official
meeting held here Saturday, exchanged views on China's accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Jiang said China has always been positive
toward accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO is not only in the interests of
the country's economic development and its reform and opening to
the outside world, but also the interests of the establishment of
a complete and open international trading system, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of acceding to the WTO, China has always insisted
on the balance of rights and obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a universally recognized developing country, China will not
accept any conditions which go beyond its economic capacity, and
will not harm its national interests because of this, the Chinese
president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Presently, it is of positive significance that China and the
United States have resumed negotiations on China's accession to
the WTO, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Recently, negotiators from the two countries fully exchanged
their views on the issue, which helped enhance mutual
understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the negotiations will proceed on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit, and that an agreement can be reached
at an early date," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Clinton said that the United
States supports the early accession of China to the WTO and hopes
that the WTO negotiations with China will conclude successfully as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will make further
efforts to this effect.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents agreed that their
present summit meeting will play a guiding role in the process of
the WTO negotiations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Clinton arrived here earlier Saturday to attend
the 7th Informal Meeting of Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum scheduled for September 12-13.

AUCKLAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton Saturday agreed that the two
countries will continue to commit themselves to the building of
the constructive strategic partnership geared towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Clinton, who arrived here earlier Saturday for the
7th informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (
APEC) forum scheduled for September 12-13, held an official
meeting at the government house in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
During their "positive and constructive" meeting, Jiang said
that as two great countries of important influence in the world,
China and the U.S. shoulder important and major responsibility in
maintaining global and regional peace and stability, and in
promoting the economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese and U.S. economies are highly complementary
to each other with a huge potential for further exchanges and
cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should actively seek the convergence of common
interests, expand cooperation, narrow differences in line with the
principles of mutual respect, equal treatment and seeking common
ground while reserving differences, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the stable and sound development of Sino-U.S.
relations are not only conducive to the two countries, but to the
whole world as well.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at the meeting that the U.S. government and
himself attach great importance to furthering the U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, he has made unremitting efforts to
stabilize and develop bilateral relations, Clinton said,
expressing strong hope to help the bilateral relations back to the
normal track in various sectors.

<HEADLINE> African Economic Groupings Urged to Integrate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Former executive secretary of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Simba Makoni,
has urged the small economic groupings in Africa to integrate.
</P>
<P>
Makoni made the call at the end of a three-day meeting of
southern African business leaders in Harare Friday. The meeting
also called for the formation of a strong economic block of
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Makoni told the joint meeting of the Institute of Directors
Zimbabwe and the Institute of Directors in Southern Africa that
the existence of many small economic groupings on the African
continent was a cause for concern as it increased the possibility
of duplication, competition and conflict.
</P>
<P>
He called for a transformation of the smaller economic
groupings to full integration of African economies, if the
continent was to make mark in the global market.
</P>
<P>
"Development and integration of infrastructure, investment and
production structures and systems will yield enhanced material
production, service and exchange sectors," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Makoni also urged businesses to refrain from forming many
organizations, most of which had the same objectives, and he added
that such a proliferation of organizations was not in the interest

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Consider Peace-keeping Force for East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
Gen. Wiranto Saturday said he will send a report to President B.J.
Habibie to consider an international peace-keeping force for East
Timor, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
An offer to send international peace-keeping force to East
Timor must be considered as an option to resolve the violence in
the former Portuguese territory, Wiranto told reporters in Dili,
capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
As the situation deteriorated in East Timor after the
announcement of the August 30 direct ballot results, United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, U.S. President Bill Clinton
and leaders of other countries urged the Indonesian government to
accept an international peace-keeping force to go to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, until Friday, Wiranto and other government officials
had insisted that it was not the right time for an international
peace-keeping force to land in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"There are groups of East Timorese people who are still so
angry with the U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) that we fear
they will direct that anger at the U.N. peace-keepers if the
latter come in now," Wiranto said Friday after meeting with a
five-member U.N. Security Council delegation in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also National Defense Forces Chief, arrived in
Dili Saturday morning with the U.N. Security Council delegation.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival, Wiranto met with pro-integration figures,
appealing to them to shun activities that could tarnish the
reputation of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Violence rocked the territory after the UNAMET announced last
Saturday that an overwhelming 78 percent of the voters opted for
separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred deaths have been reportedly followed the
announcement of the ballot results.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Dili is gradually returning to normal,
according to the Antara News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia early this year announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory reject Indonesia's
offer of wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Preparations for Future Macao SAR Government to Be Completed in October: Ho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The government structure of the
future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will basically
come into being in October so that leading officials can make
preparations for the transfer of power of Macao, Macao SAR Chief
Executive-Designate Ho Hau-wah said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists from both China's mainland and Macao,
Ho said during the remaining 100 days before the transfer of power,
his main task is to make preparations for establishing the Macao
SAR government.
</P>
<P>
So far, he has appointed seven leading officials and the
procurator-general, which has been approved by China's central
government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this month, Ho said, he will finish the
appointment of judges for various law courts.
</P>
<P>
In October, Ho and his future government will concentrate on
working out Macao's budget for 2000 and on preparing some laws.
</P>
<P>
Ho said he is confident of Macao's future public security,
because his government will certainly take effective measures to
deal with criminals and other forces that engage in anti-
government activities.
</P>
<P>
During the transitional period, Ho said, some things should be
done through the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, and some
things through the incumbent Macao governor. "China and Portugal
have good relations of cooperation, and I and the Macao governor
also have cooperated well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ho pledged that he will whole-heartedly serve the Macao
residents and whole-heartedly implement the principle of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
On cooperation with other parts of China, Ho said after the
return of Macao to the motherland, there will be breakthroughs in
various fields.

<HEADLINE> Seminar Marking 100-day Countdown to Macao's Return Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A seminar marking the 100-day
countdown to Macao's return to the motherland was held here
Saturday afternoon with the participation of scores of local
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future, the speakers at the seminar held
the belief that the principles of "one country, two systems" and "
Macao people governing Macao" will surely be achieved under the
guidance of the Macao Basic Law and with support of the central
government of China and the concerted efforts of local residents.
</P>
<P>
"The central government's determination to carry out the 'one
country, two systems' principle in Hong Kong has greatly aroused
the confidence and enthusiasm of Macao people about the region's
return to the motherland," said Lei Hong, president of the Macao
Association of Neighborhood Communities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the selection of the future chief executive of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the appointment
of the SAR's leading officials have been open, fair and democratic
with extensive participation of local residents.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that an efficient, united and clean SAR government
can be established and Macao people will truly become the master
of their own affairs," Lei Hong said.
</P>
<P>
Hoi Sai Iun, vice-president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce,
said at the seminar that Macao's return indicates the end of
colonial rule in China's territory by the end of the century. The
five-star national flag will fly in Macao ever since Macao's
return," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 100 days, the Macao Basic Law will be put into force and the
SAR government led by Edmund Ho Hau Wah will formally shoulder the
glorious task of managing Macao's internal affairs, and the Macao
people will start to construct a new way of life with
unprecedented enthusiasm, Hoi said.
</P>
<P>
Ieong Wan Chong, a professor at the Macao University, noted
that Macao's return to the motherland will be of significance in
various aspects.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the return will be another major step toward the
country's complete reunification; Theoretically, it will be a
convincing testimony to the feasibility of "one country, two
systems" in resolving historical questions; Economically, it helps
raise China's national strength; Culturally, it will greatly
arouse the patriotic feeling of all Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Rita Botelho dos Santos, president of the Macao Civil Servants'
Association, said that all members of the association show
confidence about the leadership of the future SAR government,
believing that leading SAR officials will perform their
responsibilities well and serve the residents wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
Some other participants to the seminar also shared the view
that December 20 this year will definitely go down in the annals
and Macao's fate will be linked up with the motherland closer.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they called on local people to work together
with the SAR government to improve social order, revitalize the
economy and build a better future.

<HEADLINE> Hotspots for Taiwan Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua)-- Four Taiwan investment parks in
east China's Fujian Province are still hotspots for investment by
businessmen from Taiwan, according to figures released today by
the ongoing Third Chinese Investment and Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
The four parks, Mawei, Haicang, Jimei and Xinglin, have signed
contracts with Taiwan for 51 projects since the fair opened on
Wednesday, introducing total investments of 270 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this new investment, Taiwan enterprises in the
four parks have also expanded their production scales, involving a
total investment of 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
To attract more Taiwan investors, the Chinese government
approved the building of the four in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian
Province, and Xiamen City in 1989 under a series of preferential
policies.
</P>
<P>
After more than ten years, the parks have developed into a
comprehensive and integrated investment base.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a total of 569 Taiwan-invested enterprises had
been set up in the parks by the end of June, with contractual
capital of 5 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister
Gen. Wiranto Saturday met with East Timor's pro-integration
figures in Dili, capital of East Timor, appealing to them to shun
activities that could tarnish the reputation of the territory.
</P>
<P>
"This request is not only (aimed at) pro-integrationists but at
anti-integrationists as well. I beseech all parties to exercise
self-restraint and not to be provoked to commit any violent act
that could ruin the people of East Timor," Wiranto was quoted by
the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also National Defense Forces Chief, arrived in
Dili on Saturday morning with a five-member delegation of the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the allegations that the Indonesian military is
behind the continued flight of East Timorese to refugee camps,
Wiranto said this is untrue.
</P>
<P>
"This is not politically motivated. (The East Timorese) are in
need of food and are afraid of the security situation (in the
territory), that is why they are leaving East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Violence rocked the territory after the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) announced last Saturday that an overwhelming 78
percent of the voters opted for separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, until Saturday afternoon, more refugees in
Dili were awaiting transportation that would take them out of the
territory.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Dili is gradually returning to normal, but the
flight of residents of various areas of Dili and other districts
continued, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into

opening of the Games as well as diving in early September.

<P>
The quadrennial Games which was inaugurated in 1988 will also
see visitors from Macao as China is to resume its exercise of
sovereignty over the land by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The 68 Hong Kong athletes, who have been granted automatic
berths in the finals, are to compete in the athletics, badminton,
fencing, gymnastics, judo, rowing, shooting, soccer, swimming and
table tennis.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Not Committed to Abandoning Use of Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Saturday reiterated the Chinese government's principled
stance on the Taiwan issue, saying that China will never commit
itself to abandoning the use of force in order to safeguard its
national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In an official meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Jiang
said that the "two states" theory raised two months ago by Lee
Teng-hui have been strongly opposed and condemned by all the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted that President Clinton had restated
the U.S. support for the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 100 countries have reiterated their
adherence to the one-China policy, Jiang said. But Lee obstinately
clings to his wrong course of separating China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the struggle against Lee is one of whether to
safeguard or split China's sovereignty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, China has no other way out and can in no way
come to a compromise, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "two states" assertion is aimed at nothing
but disrupting the peaceful situation across the Taiwan straits,
undermining the cross-straits ties, obstructing the improvement of
the Sino-U.S. relations and endangering peace and stability in the
Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that Lee is not only a trouble-maker but also
an obstacle to the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China sticks to the basic principle of
peaceful reunification and "One country, two systems" on the
Taiwan issue, and will make every effort for a peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the current escalation of Lee's
separatist activities have sparked strong condemnation from all
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan issue has always been the most
protruding one in the Sino-U.S. relations. Some forces in the
United States, he pointed out, are attempting to obstruct China's
reunification cause and some practices on the U.S. side cannot but
arouse the serious concern of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The early reunification of China not only conforms to the
fundamental interests of the Chinese people, but also is conducive
to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and to the
healthy and stable development of the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton said he quite understands the
Taiwan issue is an extremely important one and that he had
immediately reiterated the U.S. government would continue to favor
the one-China policy after Lee's "two states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
Describing the "two states" assertion as creating many
obstacles both for China and the United States, Clinton reaffirmed
his commitment to the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Clinton arrived here earlier Saturday to attend
the 7th informal meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, which is scheduled to open Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, S. Korean Presidents Meet on Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and his South Korean counterpart Kim Dae-jung met here
Saturday to discuss relations between their two countries and
major international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Kim said he was very glad to have a chance to
meet Jiang in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that he would like to avail himself of the opportunity
to congratulate China in advance on the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China which falls on October
1, and the return of Macao to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao to China will mark the end of colonialism
in Asia and will be a historic event, the South Korean president
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Jiang said that he was very glad
to meet Kim again in less than one year after they met in Beijing
during Kim's visit to China in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation of the importance President
Kim attached to the relations between the two countries and the
great contribution he made in promoting the development of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have witnessed all-round
development, and their mutually beneficial cooperation has been
quite fruitful since the two countries established diplomatic
relations seven years ago, as a result of their joint efforts,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the two countries have forged a cooperative
partnership for the 21st century since Kim's successful visit to
China last year, and as a consequence, the Sino-South Korean
relations were enhanced to a new stage of development, the Chinese
president said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim briefed Jiang on the present situation
in the Korean peninsula and expressed appreciation over efforts of
the Chinese government for maintaining peace in the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China sincerely hopes that long-term peace and
stability will be maintained in the Korean peninsula and that
China has been making efforts to achieve this goal.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that all the parties concerned will do whatever
conducive to peace and stability in the peninsula and will do
nothing harmful to peace and stability there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to play its constructive role in
appropriately solving questions relating to the Korean peninsula,"
he added. The two presidents also exchanged views on regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Kim arrived here earlier Saturday to attend the
7th Informal Meeting of Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum scheduled for September 12-13.

<HEADLINE> Power Rationing to Ease in Kenya by November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing could ease in
Kenya when the rehabilitation of two power plants are completed by
November, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company has said.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of the company, Samuel Gichuru, said Friday
that the Kipevu power plant, which is already generating 20
megawatts, is expected to generate 70 megawatts after the repairs.
</P>
<P>
Gichuru added that rehabilitation of Westmont Power Plant will
also help ease the power shortage problem, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Westmont plant, which suffered a mechanical breakdown in
April, is to be in operation again at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company claimed in August that due
to the prolonging draught spell, it had failed to provide enough
electricity to Kenyans. The power rationing has been adopted in
the east African country since September.
</P>
<P>
The power rationing would impede badly the realization of
Kenya's target to turn the country into an industrialized one in
the year 2002, media reports said.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball Rules Changes Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The "Rules of the Game"
Commission of the FIVB, the world's volleyball governing body, has
finalized the text of the volleyball rules after the changes
approved last November at the FIVB World Conference in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, including representatives of the continental
Confederations and some National Federations, took into
consideration the valuable feedback from National Federations on
these changes.
</P>
<P>
Following are the major decisions on the changes:
</P>
<P>
1. If, when serving, the ball touches the net and passes to the
opposite side, the play continues.
</P>
<P>
2. Touching the net is not a fault except when playing the ball
or interfering with the play.
</P>
<P>
3. In normal play, all time outs are for 30 seconds; each team
has two time-outs per set. In official FIVB and World Competitions:
</P>
<P>
- In sets 1 to 4, each team has the right to call only one time-
out, and there are two technical time-outs; when the leading team
reaches the 8th and 16th points. All time outs are for 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
- In the fifth set, each team has two 30 second time-outs, but
there is no technical time-out.
</P>
<P>
4. All intervals between sets are for three minutes. The
interval between second and third set may be extended up to 10
minutes by the competent body at the request of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
This new edition of the Official Volleyball Rules 1999-2000
applies immediately in all official world and international
competitions as well as in all national competitions beginning on
or before January 1, 2000. It becomes compulsory with effect from
January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Denies Predictions of Food Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- There will be no acute food
shortage in Kenya despite earlier pessimistic predictions by local
and international analysts, a senior Kenyan agriculture official
has said.
</P>
<P>
Although some areas will receive below normal amounts of
rainfall during September-December, maize-growing areas are
expected to record a good harvest, James Oduor, an official in
charge of early warning and food security in the Agriculture
Ministry, told a seminar Friday.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts showed that western parts of the country and
mid-southern province of Rift Valley will receive good amounts of
rains, said Oduor.
</P>
<P>
He said that 22 million bags (90 kilograms each) of maize were
expected to be harvested, while another 150,000 bags of maize
were coming in through cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans consume about 2.8 million bags of maize per month,
implying that the stock and what is soon to be harvested will last
Kenyans for eight months, and the next harvest for the long rain
season will be ready in May, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Oduor admitted that the problem facing Kenya was the
distribution of maize into food-deficit areas and urged traders to
take maize to those ares.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Trade Ministry said
Saturday that U.S. and British warplanes Thursday bombed a grain
warehouse in the southern province of Muthana.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry told the Iraqi News Agency that
the bombardment led to "the martyrdom of one of the civil servants
in the warehouse and the injuries of two others."
</P>
<P>
The raid also smashed windows of the employees' houses and the
storage, the unnamed spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman announced on Thursday evening that
11 civilians were injured in U.S. and British warplanes' attacks
on civil and service facilities in southern Iraqi provinces of
Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana, Najaf and Qadissiya.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites in the no-fly zones, causing severe
civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of highway
deaths dipped slightly last year in the United States, said a
report released Friday by the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43,920 people were killed by accidents that occurred

<HEADLINE> Boeing: Information Technology Saves Time, Money in Maintenance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing official said
Friday that information technology is the key to boosting
productivity in the air transport industry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference in Ireland, the vice president for the
commercial operation of the company, Richard Higgins, said that
information technology has fundamentally changed the way of
airplane's design and build, and now the manufacturer is applying
the technology to change the way of maintenance as well.
</P>
<P>
Higgins was quoted by the company as saying that "information
technology saves time and money in the maintenance of aircraft and
also enhances safety."
</P>
<P>
According to the company, a new family of information tools,
under the trade name of Boeing Digital, has helped airlines make
significant improvements in maintenance process.
</P>
<P>
These tools replace paper and microfilmed maintenance documents
with digitized versions that are on compact disks or accessible
online. Information can be retrieved much faster from these
digital sources, speeding up aircraft double shooting.
</P>
<P>
Another key advantage of digitally based information tools is
that they can be updated quickly, enabling maintenance staff to
work with the most current and accurate information.
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant information tools in the Boeing
Digital family is Boeing On-Line Delivery (BOLD). Through high-
speed network connections, airlines access BOLD to quickly
retrieve service bulletins, component maintenance manuals and
airplane technical drawings directly from a Boeing database.
</P>
<P>
To further improve access, Boeing said that a trial program
will begin later this month to make BOLD available via the
Internet. Boeing expects to make BOLD a completely Web-based
service by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, BOLD will evolve into a single point of contact
through which airlines will obtain all of the technical
information they need to maintain and operate their Boeing fleets,
Boeing said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief
executive-designate of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR), said Saturday that he will undertake due responsibilities
amid local residents' aspirations for Macao's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 100-day countdown to Macao's
reunification with the motherland, Edmund Ho said the 100 days
will be a key period to achieve a steady transition and smooth
transfer of power, and to make preparations for realizing the
principles of "one country, two systems," "Macao people governing
Macao" and a high degree of autonomy in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the date (of December 20), we feel that time is
pressing and we cannot slack off. Facing the date which will start
a new era in Macao, we also feel there is a long way to go and we
have to shoulder heavy responsibilities," Edmund Ho said in an
article printed in Saturday's local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"In 100 days, I will put into practice the promises I made in
my program whereby I ran for the post of chief executive," he said.
"And I will live up to the expectations of the State and Macao
residents."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his work in the past several months since he won the
chief executive election, Edmund Ho said the framework of the
future SAR government has taken shape and relevant preparations
for its sound operation in the future are being made.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central government of China has given full
support to the work of the chief executive, and state leaders have
made encouraging and inspiring remarks to him.
</P>
<P>
After its return, Macao will strengthen contacts with
neighboring Hong Kong and the interior areas of China, and the
contacts will be of great significance to Macao's future
development, Edmund Ho said.
</P>
<P>
As to public security, he said the SAR will strive to eradicate
crimes by way of better coordination between administrative and
judicial organs, between the government and the entire society,
and between Macao and other places.

The editorial called on the Macao people to grasp every minute

<P>
Reviewing the 12-year transitional period, the editorial said
Macao has experienced the ever deepest political transformation
from being under foreign rule to becoming the masters of their own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
Facts in the transitional period demonstrate that only the
Chinese government sincerely hopes for the maintenance of long-
term prosperity and stability of Macao, and is concerned about the
interest of Macao people, said the "Correio Sino-Macaense"
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In resolving the issue of foreign rule, peaceful negotiations
and the "one country, two systems" principle have been proven to
be the best, the paper said.

Greeting a new era of Macao, the "Tai Chung Pou" said the chief
executive and principal officials of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) are intensively devoted to
preparation for the transfer of power, noting that the SAR
government also faces grave challenges like those concerning
public order and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Banned During Bangladesh Opposition's Sit-in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Apprehending security risks
during the opposition's sit-in Sunday, the Bangladesh government
has slapped a ban on rallies and bearing arms or explosives in and
around the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
An edict signed by Dhaka metropolitan Police Commissioner
Shamsuddin Ahmed said the restrictions would be effective from
Saturday midnight till Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative to maintain peace, order and public safety and
protect government establishments and property as well as the
Bangladesh Secretariat as it is an important establishment and
also a restricted area," said the order.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Home Minister Mohammad Nasim said on Friday there
would not be any obstruction from the government if the opposition
stages a peaceful demonstration on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
leader of the opposition in Parliament, Begum Khaleda Zia, warned
the government that it would be responsible for the consequences
if it takes any step to obstruct Sunday's sit-in program in front
of the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday, the opposition leader said BNP
would stage the sit-in demonstration in a peaceful manner to
realize people's demand for cancellation of the government's
decision to give transit to India. But if the government takes any
step to obstruct the peaceful program, "it would have to bear the
consequences," she warned.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia called on people from all walks of life to join
Sunday's sit-in program spontaneously and force the government to
refrain from giving transit to India which the opposition says is
endangering the country's independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
She said the Awami League (the People' League) government took
the suicidal decision to give transit to India unilaterally. If
India is allowed to transship its goods from one part to another
through Bangladesh territory, the country's independence and
sovereignty would be jeopardized, she said.
</P>
<P>
Major opposition parties in the country, including Jatiya Party
(The National Party) and Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, also made
statements on Friday, calling upon party leaders and workers to
make the sit-in demonstration a success.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Solovakia's economic growth
slowed down in the first six months of this year, with the gross
domestic product (GDP) increasing at a rate 3.7 percentage points
less than that in the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP increased by only 2.4 percent to reach 378.3 billion
korun (about 8.8 billion US dollars) in the first six months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures by the Slovak National Statistics Bureau show
this to be the country's slowest period of economic growth in five
years. Its GDP increased by six and 4.4 percent in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicts that it is very difficult for Slovakia's
economy to achieve the 3-percent-increase growth planned for this
year, due mainly to high unemployment rate and huge foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Though having the lowest unemployment rate in Europe, the
country's jobless hit a record 510,000 last July.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Slovakia's foreign debts totaled 11.8 billion U.S.
dollars, up 20.4 percent from 1997, but, since 1999, its currency
korun has fallen by 13 percent as against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Amendment Passed Banning Cigarette Ads in Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Parliament passed an
amendment Friday to ban cigarette advertisements and the promotion
of tobacco products within two years after the amendment takes
effect.
</P>
<P>
According to the amendment, promotion of tobacco products on
billboards should be banned in one year and cigarette
advertisements in newspapers should be banned in two years.
</P>
<P>
The current law, which was promulgated in 1995, requires only
that cigarette advertisements are banned on radio, television, in
cinemas, schools, stadiums and children's magazines.
</P>
<P>
The new law also stipulates that tobacco companies should be
banned from sponsoring sporting, cultural-education, health-
building and social-political activities, or face fines of up to
50,000 zloty (12,500 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
About 0.5 percent of the cigarette consumption tax will be used
to create a permanent fund that will provide moneys to help people
who want to give up smoking, the new law says.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly, almost one fourth of all Polish people, around 9
million, smoke. They consume 90 billion cigarettes each year.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has announced that all EU members
should ban cigarette advertisements before July 30, 2001. The ban
has already been implemented in Scandinavian countries and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Colombia Reduced This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- By the end of
August, foreign investment in Colombia had been reduced to 600
million U.S. dollars, down 34.21 percent from January's 912
million dollars, the superintendency of securities said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The analysts attribute the withdrawal of foreign investment to
the uncertainty about the economic future of the country, the
difficult situation of public order, and the uneasiness in the
exchange market after the devaluation of the currency in May.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during the first eight months of this year,
variable income bond investment in Colombia dropped by 36.7
percent (from 775 million dollars to 490 million dollars), and
fixed income bond investment fell by 19.7 percent (from 137
million dollars to 10 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Firms Can Enter Indian Service Sector: Singh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese enterprises are
allowed to enter the service industries in India and there are no
restrictions barring them from doing so, The Kathmandu Post
reported Saturday, quoting Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Nepalese business community Friday, Singh said:
"Of course they can do it... Nobody prohibits them from doing it.
There is no restriction in setting up an enterprise (for
Nepalese)."
</P>
<P>
Singh was answering a question as to when and if Nepalese
businesses could enter into the service industry in India.
</P>
<P>
India has so far allowed some selective foreign investment in
the banking sector only, while other service industries like
insurance are still left untouched by Nepalese.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Indian companies and investors have entered
the service industry in Nepal by opening up banks and setting up
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Singh suggested that South Asian countries should unite to form
a unified economic zone. "We in SAARC need to go beyond SAPTA
(South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement) and work to form a
South Asian Economic Zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign minister is in Nepal for an official visit
from September 8-11.

<HEADLINE> Nomadic Mongolians Enjoy Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Descendants of a nomadic
ethnic group who are used to living on horseback, the Mongolian
people, now are settling down and benefiting from the development
of a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of a contracting system, tens of
thousands of modern family pastures have sprung up in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the herdsmen are better off than
ever.
</P>
<P>
Nada Muqin is one such herdsman who has contracted about 10,000
mu (about 666.7 hectares) of grassland and breeds more than 2,000
head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Bidding farewell to the nomadic life and settling down in the
1970s, Nada's family is enjoying an annual income of over 200,000
yuan now, and their five-room house is richly furnished with all
the modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolia Prairie
have now abandoned the traditional Mongolian yurt homes for their
own wood and brick houses. And about 80 percent of Mongolian
herdsmen are working as farmers, businessmen and industrial
workers nowadays.
</P>
<P>
While Inner Mongolia was incapable of producing even matches
and nails 50 years ago, it has developed its own metallurgy,
machinery,petroleum, electronics, textile, sugar, food and garment
industries during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Some Mongolians have also become shrewd business people who are
engaged in cross-border trade or have started their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Nayen Toya, who has been a herdswoman for more than a decade,
got together with a dozen other women and started a clothing
plant producing garments with Mongolian characteristics. Their
products are not only on sale in domestic markets nowadays, they
are also exported to countries including Mongolia, Russia, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
After a half century of regional autonomy and economic
development, Mongolian people, once a nationality with an
illiteracy rate of 90 percent, have their own team of
technological talents.
</P>
<P>
Application of advanced technologies has enabled the region to
develop its own fine breeds of livestock, and the average annual
income of the region's herdsmen to grow by wide margins in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the great progress they have achieved in the past
50 years, Mongolian people are not content. "The next thing we aim
to do is to learn from developed parts of the world and develop
animal husbandry in the direction of intensive, mechanized, and
modernized livestock farming." This is the newest ambition of the
modern herdsman on the Mongolian Prairie.

<HEADLINE> IDB: 3.5 Million Dollars to Agriculture, Livestock Research in L. America </HEADLINE>

MANAGUA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American

<HEADLINE> New Magazine Aimed at XML Development Language Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A California-based
technical publication house Friday announced the launch of a new
magazine aimed at the growing community of professional XML
developers.
</P>
<P>
XML magazine, to be published by Fawcette Technical
Publications, will be the only publication designed to provide
information about the architecture and structure of XML.
</P>
<P>
Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a U.S.techno-
think tank, XML, or "extensible markup language" has been
described as a giant step toward the goal of making a "semantic
Web," in which all the world's knowledge can become computer-
accessible.
</P>
<P>
XML can describe Web pages with far more power than Hypertext
Markup language (HTML), the Internet programming language
developed in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web and
founder and director of the W3C. Unlike the standard HTML format,
which describes the structure of a page, XML allows developers to
make up their own page, or metadata, to describe information
content on the page.
</P>
<P>
While HTML uses only predefined tags to describe elements
within the page, XML allows tags to be defined by the developer of
the page. Thus, tags for virtually any data items such as product,
sales rep and amount due, can be used for specific applications,
allowing Web pages to function like database records.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the magazine's role in helping developers
incorporate XML into their e-business solutions, Fawcette said
that XML is indeed for e-business what HTML was for the Web,
enabling businesses to create e-business applications in a way no
other development language can match.
</P>
<P>
XML allows businesses to share one network system, while only
allowing each supplier or partner access to authorized information
in their particular area of expertise. This translates into the
power to make on-line commerce and e-business accessible to every
company regardless of size or revenue, the publisher added.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Denies All-Williams Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis, the world No.
1 player and the top seed, denied on Friday the Williams sisters
their dream of an all-Williams U.S. Open tennis championships
women's singles final.
</P>
<P>
After seventh seed Serena Williams dethroned defending champion
and fellow American Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in today's
first semifinal, Hingis ousted third seed Venus Williams 6-1, 4-6,
6-3 in two hours.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who was down a break in the final set, won the final
four games of the match to earn a berth in her third straight U.S.
Open final. The 18-year-old from Switzerland, the 1999 Australian
Open champion and runner-up at this year's French Open, will be
trying for her sixth Grand Slam singles title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Had Venus Williams prevailed, Saturday's final would have been
the first Grand Slam final between sisters since Maud Watson
defeated Lilian Watson for the 1894 Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great, but I have one more round to win," said Serena
Williams, who will try to avenge her sister's defeat Saturday
afternoon. "The tournament isn't over yet. I don't want my
tournament to end here."
</P>
<P>
After nearly being run off the court in the opening set, Venus
Williams settled down and broke Hingis four times on her way to
winning the second set and evening the match. She went up a break
early in the final set, but struggled with her serve and cramping
in the latter stages of the match.
</P>
<P>
On serve at 3-4 in the final set, Venus Williams' hopes were
dashed by a pair of costly double faults. The first resulted from
a second serve foot fault. The second came on break point and gave
Hingis a 5-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Venus Williams called for a trainer and
received treatment for cramping. While her movement was hampered,
Hingis was in full gear. Hingis hustled from deep behind the
baseline to rip a backhand winner down the line off a short ball
to set up match point. She closed out the match on the next point
as Williams sent a service return long.
</P>
<P>
Hingis improved to 8-3 lifetime against Venus Williams and
improved her summer hardcourt record to 21-1.
</P>
<P>
Rain delayed the start of the men's doubles final and forced
the match to be moved from Arthur Ashe Stadium to Louis Armstrong
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The 11th-seeded team of American Alex O'Brien and Canada's
Sebastien Lareau beat the top-seeded Indian duo of Leander Paes
and Mahesh Bhupathi 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 for their first Grand Slam
doubles title.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by HKSAR's representative Stephen IP

Vietnam (CAAV) Nguyen Tien Sam.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
It deals with acceptance of certificates issued by both sides
relating to tax exemption and customs clearance fees, and charges
for the use of airport facilities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates air fares of passengers and freight;
plane weights and flight schedules, and covers the exchange of

and termination, and registration with the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO).
</P>

new step in the development of civil aviation cooperation with
HKSAR in particular and with China in general.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks EU to Defend Firms Against Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has asked the EU to
defend European enterprises that defied the blockade imposed on
the island four decades ago from the more recent U.S. Helms-Burton
law.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must react to defend companies that want to maintain
free trade," said Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque,
commenting on reports that the two companies -- Club Med of France,
and LTU of Germany -- could be sanctioned along with the Spanish
hotel chain Sol-Melia for their operations on the island country.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque said that this situation, "Besides being a threat
to the EU, is an attack on the international trade system because
of the extraterritorial application of the illegal U.S.
legislation."
</P>
<P>
He said the defense of the interests of those countries must be
considered also in the case of Sol-Melia, for which the Clinton
administration opened a dossier because it is operating 12 hotels
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Washington attitude against
the European firms in Cuba "means the sinking of the
understanding" reached in May of 1998 by the EU and the United
States about the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
The understanding provides for the withdrawal of a European
claim before the World Trade Organization (WTO) in exchange for a
U.S. commitment to suspend the application of Title Four of the
Helms-Burton act, which denies visas for executives of the implied
firms and their relatives to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque also denounced the U.S. attempt to choke Cuba by
hunger and disease through the implementation of the Helms-Burton
law in a systematic and damaging way.

<HEADLINE> Spain Criticizes Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar on Friday criticized the U.S. Helms-Burton law for
violating international law, saying he will defend the Spanish
enterprises with investments in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, the United States has been examining the
implementation of sanctions in accordance with the Helms-Burton
law against the Spanish hotel network Sol-Melia for its
investments in the Cuban tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
"We think that if the United States and the European Union (EU)
reach at an agreement to prevent the application of that law from
disturbing the relations between the parts, to try to apply
sanctions would not have any justification," said Aznar.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said Friday in Havana that the U.S.
investigation of the Spanish, French, and German enterprises which
have made investments in the island country means the sinking of
the agreement between the U.S. and the EU about the Helms-Burton
law.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Spanish government said that "all the necessary
procedures in the defense of the just interest of Spain and the
just interest of the Spanish firms in their presence in the island
of Cuba have been done."
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government "knows in detail this matter and follows
it with the greatest interest," Aznar added.

</P>
<P>
Other delegates agreed that new radio and television channels
will mushroom in the digital time and increased demand of programs
will provide a good chance for corresponding arts, software
industry, new service sectors and businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, Europe has not taken this chance well. A deficit of
seven billion U.S. dollars exists in the trade of film and
television products between Europe and America.

<HEADLINE> Nomadic Mongolians Enjoy Modern Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Descendants of a nomadic
ethnic group who are used to living on horseback, the Mongolian
people, now are settling down and benefiting from the development
of a modern economy.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of a contracting system, tens of
thousands of modern family pastures have sprung up in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the herdsmen are better off than
ever.
</P>
<P>
Nada Muqin is one such herdsman who has contracted about 10,000
mu (about 666.7 hectares) of grassland and breeds more than 2,000
head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Bidding farewell to the nomadic life and settling down in the
1970s, Nada's family is enjoying an annual income of over 200,000
yuan now, and their five-room house is richly furnished with all
the modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolia Prairie
have now abandoned the traditional Mongolian yurt homes for their
own wood and brick houses. And about 80 percent of Mongolian
herdsmen are working as farmers, businessmen and industrial
workers nowadays.
</P>
<P>
While Mongolia was incapable of producing even matches and
nails 50 years ago, it has developed its own metallurgy, machinery,
petroleum, electronics, textile, sugar, food and garment
industries during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Some Mongolians have also become shrewd business people who are
engaged in cross-border trade or have started their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
Nayen Toya, who has been a herdswoman for more than a decade,
got together with a dozen other women and started a clothing
plant producing garments with Mongolian characteristics. Their
products are not only on sale in domestic markets nowadays, they
are also exported to countries including Mongolia, Russia, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
After a half century of regional autonomy and economic
development, Mongolian people, once a nationality with an
illiteracy rate of 90 percent, have their own team of
technological talents.
</P>
<P>
Application of advanced technologies has enabled the region to
develop its own fine breeds of livestock, and the average annual
income of the region's herdsmen to grow by wide margins in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the great progress they have achieved in the past
50 years, Mongolian people are not content. "The next thing we aim
to do is to learn from developed parts of the world and develop
animal husbandry in the direction of intensive, mechanized, and
modernized livestock farming." This is the newest ambition of the
modern herdsman on the Mongolian Prairie.

<HEADLINE> Western China Still The Country's Leading Cotton Grower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is expected to produce 1.4 million tons of
cotton this year, keeping it in first place in China for the 6th
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
A local agriculture official says that the good harvests are
the result of geographical conditions, preferential central
government policies, and the hard work of the ethnic groups that
live in the region.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang became China's leading cotton grower earlier this
decade and the regional government worked out a policy to increase
crude oil and cotton production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have turned a large amount of waste land into cotton
fields, expanding the cotton growing area to 533,300 ha. in six
years. Per ha output of ginned cotton has risen to 1,275 kg.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang produced 825,000 tons of cotton in 1994 and led all
other provinces in cotton output, unit output, quality, sales, and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the region's cotton output accounted for a third of
China's total. Nearly half of Xinjiang's industrial output value
came from cotton products.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Thanks Venezuela for its Proposal on Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Peres Roque said Friday that Venezuela had "a noble and generous
gesture" by proposing the creation of a mechanism similar to the
Pact of San Jose to supply oil to the Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Perez Roque told the press that Cuba has expressed publicly its
gratefulness to the proposal of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
"We think that to open or to deny their inclusion to other
countries in the Pact of San Jose is a sovereign decision of
Mexico and Venezuela," he added.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has expressed several times its desire to include
Cuba in the Pact of San Jose or of establishing an agreement of
supply to the island with advantageous payment conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has insisted that Cuba has not requested officially its
inclusion in that commercial mechanism and that Venezuela has not
made a formal petition either.
</P>
<P>
The Pact of San Jose, signed in 1980 and renewed every year,
establishes the sending by Mexico and Venezuela of 160,000 barrels
of oil a day, fifty percent each, to 11 countries of Central
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Latin America said Venezuela, one of the largest
foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, could face pressure
by breaking a U.S. embargo against trade with Cuba.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Becoming More Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
which ranks second in the country in terms of GDP, is close to
reaching its goal of modernization by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's per capita GDP will be equal to 4,000 U.S. dollars,
compared with about 1,200 U.S. dollars in 1998, Chen Huanyou, the
Provincial Communist Party Committee's secretary, told Xinhua and
says that modernization is something they strived for generations,
and now it's no longer just a dream.
</P>
<P>
Chen says that his province, which is on the Yangtze River
Delta, one of China's three major river deltas, has made much
progress toward its goal in the past five decades. It has 72
million people and produces 7 percent of China's total grain on 1
percent of its land.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the province launched a massive campaign to help
develop industry in rural areas, resulting in the growth of
township enterprises and the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the province developed a policy of revitalizing
the economy through science and technology, which contributed to
37 percent of its industrial output and 52.7 percent of its
agricultural output in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has opened nearly all sectors of its economy to the
outside world and foreign trade accounts for a fourth of its GDP.
Foreign capital makes up a fourth of its total spending on fixed
assets. It has also maintained annual growth of 12.6 percent on
average over the past two decades, with the GDP reaching 720
billion yuan in 1998.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Vice-
President Jacob Zuma said on Friday that through sport, Africa was
poised to claim its place among the nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
"It is significant that the 7th All Africa Games are being
hosted in South Africa on the eve of the new millennium," he said
at a luncheon before the opening ceremony of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that this event has brought the nations of the
continent together on the eve of the African Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
"Sport is the one unifying factor across the racial divide and
this extends to the rest of the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Love of sport is shared by all people on the continent, he said,
adding that "it's the one thing we have in common to build as a
springboard to realize the African dream. Success in realising the
dream depends on us as a people -- it will bring strength to us."
</P>
<P>
Zuma said that sport had been responsible for Africa making its
mark in the international community "because sport knows no
boundaries."
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is a sporting country with wonderful sportswomen
and men," said Zuma, referring to nine-times swimming world record
holder Penny Heyns as "South Africa's Queen of Sport.

<HEADLINE> Africa Adopts Sports Code of Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- African sports officials
have adopted a code of ethics for the sports movement on the
continent to prevent bribery scandals.
</P>
<P>
The code was approved as the 7th All African Games were kicked
off here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"All forms of embezzlement and bribery are prohibited," says
the document, which was approved by sports ministers and leaders
of African sports confederations and African national Olympic
committees.
</P>
<P>
The code, enacted at a meeting Johannesburg, cited the "
misdoings witnessed in the practice and management of sport in
Africa and throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
Among the provisions:
</P>
<P>
- Discrimination, violence and doping are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
- African sports leaders should be elected by "free and fair
ballots."
</P>
<P>
- Resources allocated to African sports must be used "
exclusively for the development of sport by means of transparent
management and accounting rules."
</P>
<P>
- All forms of cheating are prohibited, and athletes must
provide "credible identity documents" to be eligible to compete.
</P>
<P>
The ethics code comes after a turbulent year in which several
IOC members from Africa were implicated in the vote-buying scandal
surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The scandal resulted in the ouster of Jean-Claude Ganga, the
powerful former head of the Association of National Olympic
Committees of Africa.

the fire was directed to the office where he works and that he
does not know the causes of the attack.
</P>
<P>
Some people who live near the place said they heard the reports,
but they did not think it would be an attack to that building.
</P>
<P>
Others said they heard the shots, but they thought that
somebody was testing some weapons or that it was a holdup or a
fight between gangs.
</P>
<P>
The police are investigating the case and nobody has so far
claimed responsibility for it.

<HEADLINE> Serena Advances to U.S. Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Seventh seed Serena Williams
dethroned defending champion and fellow American Lindsay Davenport
6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in today's U.S. Open semifinals.
</P>
<P>
But third seed Venus Williams, Serena's elder sister, was
beaten by Martina Hingis of Switzerland in today's second
semifinal 6-1,4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
A lucky break and a strong resolve propelled Serena Williams to
victory in her first Grand Slam semifinal. She recorded the only
break of serve in the third set when a mis-hit service return
barely cleared the net. Davenport, the second seed, raced in, but
her desperate backhand effort sailed long to give Williams a 4-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams left the door open in her next service game,
but survived three double faults and five break points to solidify
her lead at 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who faced two match points in her quarterfinal
victory over fifth seed Mary Pierce, dodged another in the
following game. Her volley winner prevented Serena Williams from
closing out the match and Davenport managed to hold, forcing the
17-year-old serve for the match.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain delayed play for more than five hours today and the
long delay seemed to have an effect on both players. Both
struggled with their first serve and groundstrokes and each made
far more unforced errors than winners.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams broke Davenport in the 10th game of the match
to take the opening set. Davenport, who fought off five break
points in her two previous service games, made 18 unforced errors
in the set.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Seeks Free Trade Agreement With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Commerce and
Industry Secretary Herminio Blanco said Friday that his country
will seek a free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that negotiations for an FTA with Japan might
start next year, before the change of government in Mexico, said
Blanco, in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Blanco is taking part in Auckland in a ministerial meeting that
precedes the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
foreseen for September 12-13.
</P>
<P>
Blanco said that Mexican and Japanese officials will start
talks this month in Tokyo for an Agreement of Promotion and
Protection of Investments that would lay the foundation for an
eventual FTA between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement on investments is fundamental for
the intensification of commerce between the two.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, Mexico substituted Japan as
the United States' second biggest trade partner after Canada.
</P>
<P>
The secretary announced that talks for an FTA between his
country and the European Union will be resumed in Mexico City on
September 27.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has signed several FTA's with the countries on the
American continent. The most important is the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in force since 1994 with the United States
and Canada, which has promoted trade exchanges among the three
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Former champion Rodney Eyles
suffered an early defeat in the first round of the squash world
championship by Egypt's Amr Shabana here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eyles, mainstay of the Australian squad for next week's world
team championship, was beaten 15-9, 13-15, 15-8 ,15-13 by the 20-
year-old Shabana, who was ranked 20 places below him in the world
at number 35.
</P>
<P>
Eyles, the Bermuda-based president of the Professional Squash
Association who turns 32 during this tournament, succumbed in 85
minutes at the Egyptian National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
England captain Chris Walker also failed at the first hurdle,
losing 12-15, 15-13, 15-10, 12-15, 15-10 in 83 minutes to South
Africa's Rodney Durbach.
</P>
<P>
It was a second blow for England. Peter Marshall collapsed in
the finals of the qualifying tournament with back ligament strains
which will almost certainly keep him out of the team event.

<HEADLINE> British Public Less Hostile to Euro - Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The British public's hostility
towards the euro has thawed over the summer, according to a poll
published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest MORI poll, surveyed for U.S. bank Salomon Smith
Barney, found the balance of voters opposed to euro narrowed to 26
percentage points -- 56 percent against, 30 percent for, 14
percent "don't know" -- in September, from 31 points in July and
33 points in June.
</P>
<P>
It shows the euro has recovered since the last poll in early
July and is no longer a one-way bet on the world's foreign
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, the sample of 1,957 people were asked: "If there
was a referendum now on whether Britain should be part of a single
European currency, how would you vote?".
</P>
<P>
For the second question of how people would vote if the
government strongly urged a vote in favour of the euro, there was
a lower balance of 20 points against the euro, the result shows.
</P>
<P>
During the last poll in July, the balance to the same question
was 23 points.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Indonesia to Accept International Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged Indonesia to accept an international
peace-keeping force to go to East Timor as he saw the situation
deteriorating in the territory.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in New York, Annan accused Indonesia of
failing to fulfill the agreed responsibility of keeping law and
order in East Timor, even with the introduction of martial law in
East Timor in the last 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military forces "have been either unable or
unwilling to take effective steps to restore security," Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"The time has clearly come for Indonesia to seek the help of
the international community in fulfilling its responsibility to
bring order and security to the people of East Timor, and to allow
those who have been displaced to return home in safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, a number of regional governments including
Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Malaysia have
expressed their willingness to participate in the international
action, with Australia willing to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "East Timor is at a moment of great crisis, danger
and uncertainty" and that "a small mission" cannot be expected to
cope with security problems there, Annan urged the Indonesian
Government to accept the help "without further delay."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General described East Timor as descending into
anarchy with anti-independence militias "engaged in an orgy of
looting, burning and killing".
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese have abandoned their
homes and several of the local staff ot the U.N. Mission in East
Timor (UNAMET) have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET has been forced to evacuate 12 of its 13 regional
centers, with UNAMET local staff and non-essential international
staff successfully evacuated from Dili (capital of East Timor) to
Darwin (Australia) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. is keeping the situation under constant
review while awaiting the outcome of the visit of a five-member
Security Council mission to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Council will open formal consultations at 11:00 am EST
Saturday on East Timor, said Council president, Ambassador Peter
Van Walsum of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will have a second stage when the mission is back
from Indonesia and reports to the Council, he said, expecting it
to be in New York Monday morning at the earliest.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Driven by organizations
seeking to improve their efficiency in order to save costs,
increase revenues and ensure a high level of competitiveness, the
worldwide market for knowledge management products and
technologies will expand in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
According to a new study released Friday by U.S. market
research firm the Radicati Group, many enterprises are already
implementing successful knowledge management strategies and

relationship management products, workflow tracking products,
search and document management products and platform products such
as Microsoft Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The study estimates that the market for customer relationship
management products will reach 10.7 billion U.S. dollars by 2003.
Products in this category are increasingly adding artificial
intelligence and advanced information modeling techniques to help
companies automate their sales management and customer service
process.
</P>
<P>
The market for workflow tracking products, which include
intelligent forms routing and automated agents, will reach 269
million dollars by the end of this year and 887 million dollars by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Products that provide search and document management
capabilities for searching and managing large amount of
information from Web sites, databases, e-mails and other diverse
sources are continuing to bring innovative techniques to the
marketplace. This market segment is expected to reach 2.3 billion
dollars by 2003.
