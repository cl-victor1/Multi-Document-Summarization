NEW POSTAL RULE REQUIRES `TRUTH' IN P.O. ADDRESSES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A little-noticed U.S. Postal Service rule meant to
cut fraud has mail box renters steamed and owners of mail box
outlets worried about their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is aimed at people and companies that use swank
addresses for what are actually pigeon holes at places like Mail
Boxes Etc. The new guideline requires renters of such boxes to
strike the potentially misleading ``suite,'' ``office,'' ``bureau''
or ``unit no.'' from their address in favor of ``PMB,''
postal-speak for a private mail box.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, the postal service will deliver mail to
private mail boxes, regardless of designation. But come November,
letters and packages addressed to a rented mailbox with anything
but the PMB designation will be returned to sender, even when the
post office knows the intended recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of having a rule if you don't enforce it?''
said Terri Bouffiou, Southern California spokeswoman for the U.S.
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which was made public March 25 in a Federal
Register announcement, is meant to cut down on mail fraud. Too
often, postal officials say, criminals use mail boxes with
impressive addresses as a front for money-bilking operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many of our criminal investigations lead to the use of a
(private mail box),'' said Pamela Prince, a postal inspector in
Pasadena. ``When we go to obtain a copy of the application, we find
a fictitious name may have been used, fictitious identification and
even a fictitious address. Or sometimes a real address is listed
and we find out it's yet another mail box.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Prince said, the Postal Service issupermarkets,
upscale grocers and other places will dramatically increase the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesecake als won a large order from a major restaurant chain
that Gordon declined to identify. Shipments will start this
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both deals have the potential of adding millions to annual
sales, company officials said.!dlim!

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; By flashing her headlights, Treva Tegtmeier stopped two
gang members from beating and kicking a man who had fought gang
graffiti in his North Hollywood neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the gangsters tried to pull open the door of her car,
she called 911 on her cellular phone. Police arrested the two, and
the Sherman Oaks actress's testimony helped send them to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would do it again,'' said Tegtmeier, one of eight people the
Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office honored Friday for
their bravery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew that it wouldn't stop until somebody stopped it,''
Tegtmeier, 35, said of the September incident. ``I was really
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Also honored at the 14th annual Courageous Citizens Awards was
Marsha Bender, a Woodland Hills resident who is credited with
stopping a man from beating his wife and then comforting the woman
and her children until police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to force her into the car and closing the door
on her leg and arms,'' Bender said about the incident in the
parking lot outside her Van Nuys office in September. ``Even the
kids had tried to pull the man off his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender said she simply walked out and told the man to leave his
wife alone, which he did by leaving the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just helping someone in dire need. There was no
alternative,'' said Bender, 47, director of a weight-loss center.
``I hope someone will help me if I ever get in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender testified at the man's trial, and he was sent to prison
for three years, district attorney officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Southern California residents were recognized at the
awards luncheon at the Wilshire Grand Hotel in downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're not heroes, but they are,'' said District
Attorney Gil Garcetti. ``These are people who saw a situation that
needed attention and did it without hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The other honorees were:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Roger Furnival, 54, of Santa Monica stopped two men
attacking a woman in West Los Angeles, holding one despite being
stabbed in the side by the accomplice. The men were caught and both
are awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Carrie M. James, 23, of Los Angeles used a baseball bat
to stop a man from beating a woman with a wooden object in
September. She held the man at bay until police arrived, possibly
saving the woman's life. The man is now serving a 25-year-to-life
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Trista Martin, 26, of Beverly Hills, weighing just 95
pounds, took on two burglars after they broke into a neighbor's
home. She hit one of the men in the face and tried to retrieve her
neighbor's goods from the taxi the men were using as a getaway car.
Her description of the vehicle led to the arrest of the men, both
of whom face long prison terms when sentenced next month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Albert Pitts, 36, of Los Angeles followed a motorist who
fled the scene of a crash in South Central Los Angeles in March. He
pulled a bleeding child from the wreckage, but the motorist grabbed
the child back and drove away. Pitts followed the woman and called
police on a cell phone. The woman was arrested and is awaiting
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Hector Dominguez, 27, of Santa Ana saw a man shoot and
kill two people outside a La Puente nightclub in March 1998.
Crouching behind a door and using a cell phone, Dominguez called
911 and wrote the license number of the getaway car on his palm.
Police tracked down the car and Dominguez testified against the
suspect, who is awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; James Sanchez, 28, of Long Beach saw a couple with two
children leave a Montebello motel without the children in September
1997. He heard water running and banging in the room, which he
entered with the manager's help. He found the boy wrapped in duct
tape and the girl rolled up in a wet bedspread in the bathtub. The
little girl also was bound with duct tape and appeared near death.
Both children survived. The couple who abused them were arrested,
tried, convicted and sent to prison. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

PEACE PROGRAM HELPS TEENS COPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When two Colorado teen-agers went on a bloody
rampage, LAUSD counselor Ron Klemp knew exactly what to do: He
convened students in his Northridge Middle School Peace Institute
in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber, emotional session, they discussed the tragedy and
brainstormed ways to prevent similar bloodshed in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like me are scared about being in school,'' said
13-year-old Norma Hernandez. ``One time a guy followed me and my
friend home with a knife and said he was going to kill us both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how people act sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemp asked the youngsters what they would do if their friends
were acting strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell someone real fast, and I'd ask them if they have
a problem,'' said Jessie Carpio, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my friend was acting like an outcast, I would talk to them
and try to make them not an outcast,'' 13-year-old Leidy Montes
chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   Similar discussions took place at other Los Angeles middle
schools and at a Mississippi school, all of which have created
Peace Institutes based on Klemp's model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to teach the kids to put themselves in someone
else's shoes, to explore solutions without violence and to learn
how to control their emotions and actions,'' Klemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Next month he is scheduled to present the Middle School Peace
Institute at a conference of the United States' attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate hope is that this program becomes a systemic part
of every middle school, like the DARE program,'' Klemp said,
referring to Drug Abuse Resistance Education now taught in many
schools. ``We are in serious need of teaching the human part of
curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Already it's taught at 10 Los Angeles middle schools, most in
the San Fernando Valley, said Klemp, a staff developer and teacher
trainer at Northridge Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1993, the Peace Institute is designed to teach
students to use their brains instead of brawn to resolve conflicts
and to take action against violence.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also serves as a coping tool for students in the
face of news events like the Columbine High School massacre, and
the stresses of teen-age life, he said. They've discussed the
Northridge Earthquake, the Civil Rights Movement, the Kosovo
bombings, the Holocaust and more, Klemp said.
</P>
<P>
   And Klemp believes it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their awareness level is different from other kids, and when
incidents like these happen it makes their fears more real,'' Klemp
said. ``They want to know how to deal with it and what they can do
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemp developed the program as his teacher training project,
after realizing that he was unprepared for counseling students who
face ``death and mayhem'' as part of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a popular feature at seminars of teachers and law
enforcement officers nationwide trying to reduce violence on
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The program is rooted in the notion that society has grown
tremendously in technology, but has deeply failed in social issues,
Klemp said. He has placed a new demand on the teachers he trains,
emphasizing that learning ``isn't all about test scores,'' Klemp
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study of world peace is woven into the curriculum in some
classes at participating schools, which adds context to issues like
war, racism and violence in history, Klemp said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District
have been trained to teach for the Peace Institute. And teachers
say the program helps students find their own answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really come up with their own ideas about how to solve
world problems, and the class discussions get a life of their
own,'' social studies teacher Andrea Naud said. ``It's great for
the kids and builds character.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has been a hit at Brinkley Middle School in Jackson,
Miss. _ the only school outside of Los Angeles to adopt the
curriculum _ where students often visit the home of slain civil
rights leader Medgar Evers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the program after a fight between two groups of
sixth-grade girls. They thought the only way to solve their problem
was to fight,'' said program Director Lynn Moss. ``It's a rich,
rich program and teaches kids to hold back when their temper is
up.''

GRAND CANYON DIGS IN FOR MASS TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More visitors, fewer cars.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the 21st century holds for Grand Canyon National
Park as it moves into the mass-transit era.
</P>
<P>
   A groundbreaking ceremony Friday launched work on the hub of the
canyon's planned light-rail and bus system.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon View Information Plaza will be more than a bus/train
terminal. It will also be a crossroads for the canyon's walking and
cycling trails, and will provide visitors with the information they
need to negotiate the 1.2 million-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza will be built 500 to 800 feet back from the South Rim,
near Mather Point. Mather is the first scenic overlook for most
visitors, and the information plaza is designed to play off its
dramatic views.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt was among the nearly 400 people
who attended Friday's groundbreaking. The former Arizona governor
said the project would give the Grand Canyon the best visitor
service of all the national parks.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the project will virtually banish cars from the
park, freeing congested roads and reducing the level of
concentrated auto exhaust, parks spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's about more than mass transit. Oltrogge said the new
information plaza is designed to handle crowds: as many as 4,200
people per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the information plaza and transit hub will cost
$6.8 million, Oltrogge said, with most funds coming from a 1996
decision that doubled the park entry fee to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to plan their trip inside the park and
then move on _ either by train, an alternatively fueled bus,
bicycle or foot. That will make the Grand Canyon the first national
park to offer four transportation options from the same point.
</P>
<P>
   The transit system is expected to be in place by spring 2002,
Oltrogge said. At that time, most visitors will park their cars
outside the Grand Canyon, in Tusayan, and take a 10-minute electric
train ride into the information plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The park won't be entirely carless, however. Campers and those
staying at the South Rim's various lodges will be able to drive in,
but they'll have to rely on mass transit to move about the park,
Oltrogge said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Friday's groundbreaking, parks officials announced
the start of a $55 million capital campaign to pay for various
improvements at the park. Phoenix Newspapers Inc., publisher of
``The Arizona'' ``Republic,'' donated $100,000 to educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   A Heritage Education Campus will be established in the heart of
the park in restored historic buildings. The Del E. Webb Foundation
kicked off those efforts in January with a $2.5 million
contribution that will pay for restoration of a 1935 Community
Building into an education center. &QL;

NEW COACH SCHMID TO OBSERVE GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ New Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid will be an observer
tonight as the team plays host to San Jose at the Rose Bowl at
7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, hired after the team fired Octavio Zambrano on
Wednesday, said assistant coach Ralph Perez will control the Galaxy
tonight. Schmid said he will assume full control of the team
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (2-3) is in fifth place in the Western Conference,
has lost three straight and has scored only three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to observe,'' Schmid said. ``I have to use my ears and
my eyes and I have to watch and listen and sense what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, hired after a sensational 20-year run at UCLA that
included three national titles, said he needs time to evaluate the
team's individual talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach always looks at things a little bit differently,''
Schmid said. ``There are lots of different ways to be successful.
There are teams who win World Cups one way and teams who win World
Cups a completely different way. From that standpoint, I have to
see what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain players that may catch my eye more than they
caught Octavio's eye and vice versa. That's not to say one's right
and one's wrong, it's just an assemblage of preference. It's like
one guy likes chocolate and the other vanilla. I don't know what's
going to happen down the line, but I can promise we will be about
winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid has been a regular at Galaxy games the past four seasons.
Six of his former players are on the Galaxy's roster, including
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who welcomed his former coach's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sigi does is develop a technical base with the players,''
Hartman said. ``If you notice, most UCLA players have good
technical ability but more than anything they recognize
opportunities to go forward as quickly as possible to put people
under pressure and develop counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been Sigi's style. He likes to develop the
attacks down the wings with speedy outside midfielders and likes to
have people who are going to finish opportunities in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Schmid's Bruin teams scrimmaged the Galaxy on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the only thing I can see at this point was their
directness of play at certain times,'' Schmid said of the Galaxy.
``And that's not saying you're only going to counter-attack or
you're only going to go over the top. The object of the game is to
get behind the defense and you have to do that in a timely
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Zambrano was fired after only five games, Schmid says
he is not expecting a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know this could take some time,'' he said.
``I hope people don't only judge me on my first 10 games. I know my
coaching style. I sometimes tend to be a nag. I get in people's
ears, but I also get players to do what I want them to do
eventually. It might be easier because some guys know me, but from
week to week you will see a better team.''

SHORTAGE OF GUIDANCE COUNSELORS WORRIES SCHOOL LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the country agonizes over what caused the
Colorado shootings, Los Angeles school officials expressed concern
about the LAUSD's lack of counselors to help troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to hire more, California schools have fewer per
student than any other state, with just one for every 1,182
students. The Los Angeles Unified School District has just one for
every 1,077 students, falling short of the nationwide average of
one counselor for every 512 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got 500 kids, let's hope it's not your kid who's
No. 499 and waiting,'' said Arlene Anderson, assistant principal of
counseling at Chatsworth High School in Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Across the LAUSD, there are only 54 counselors to serve 418
elementary schools, and every high school counselor typically sees
about 500 students a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drastically overburdening our counselors,'' said
Principal Robert Kladifko at Reseda High School, also in the
Valley, where three counselors are responsible for 2,400 students.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education members voted in January to beef up the
counseling staff, providing money to hire a new position at all 36
district high schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are other school personnel trained to handle some of the
crushing workload. The district has 450 school psychologists, who
mainly work with special education students, and 220 pupil services
and attendance counselors, who deal with some of the more troubled
students, said Hector Madrigal, the director of pupil services.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of students per counselor seems daunting, so too
are the many jobs counselors perform.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors do more than help kids apply to college and monitor
course work to make sure students have the classes and grades
needed to graduate. They offer advice on turbulent home lives. They
piece back together young lives shaken by unexpected pregnancy or
shattered by rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is no longer, Johnny is chewing bubble-gum in
class and it's a distraction,'' said Anderson, who has counseled in
the district since 1959. ``These problems are heavy-duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Some counselors argue that even with the high workload, students
with extreme behavior problems will still be found. But many other
kids, whose problems don't manifest themselves as openly, may not
get the attention they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are bringing so many problems to school, not ones that
will make them violent, but ones that make it hard to get through
the day,'' said Beverly Bushner, assistant principal of counseling
services at John Francis Polytechnic High School in the San
Fernando Valley community of Sun Valley. ``That's where a lower
ratio would help.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme scarcity of counselors in elementary schools is
particularly disturbing, officials say. Some counselors argue that
if further violent attacks are to be prevented, districts must try
to reach students at a younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait until senior high school to do the counseling, the
problems are already there,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of counselors statewide started inching upward after
dramatic cuts during the early 1990s recession, but it has not kept
pace with booming school enrollment, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of hikes in enrollment, the ratio of students to
counselors has remained roughly the same despite the gradual
increase of new counselors, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a budget cut, they think, What can I do
without? and they think they can cut counselors,'' said Nancy
Perry, executive director for the American School Counselor
Association. Her group recommends a 250-1 ratio, although no state
meets that standard.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of counselors low, teachers have taken up more
responsibility for watching for troubled students, said Obie
Slamon, president of the Parent-Teacher Association at El Camino
Real High School in the San Fernando Valley. To their credit, she
said, they seem to be doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers have taken the place of counselors in being the
first to spot people,'' she said. ``It used to be the counselors.
But now they realize they can't possibly work with 3,000 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that counselors may be stretched too thin to reach
every student who needs help asking how they can be expected to
recognize the sometimes subtle clues that students may turn violent
when they barely have time to learn their names and faces.
</P>
<P>
   Kladifko said there are other ways for schools to spot and work
with troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   Reseda High School in the Valley uses a peer counseling program,
encouraging students to help other students. Several teachers have
been trained to counsel kids on social problems, like alcoholism at
home or thoughts of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kladifko has also assembled a team of students he considers
natural leaders, those respected by other kids, to help him find
and defuse problems on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if I had an adequate number of counselors, we wouldn't
have to do half these things,'' he said.

PETITGOUT (WHO?) WANTS GIANTS' FANS TO WAIT AND SEE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Ind.)   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When it was time for the Giants to make
their first draft pick, it was a surprise to hear the name Luke
Petitgout.
</P>
<P>
   Even to Luke Petitgout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the Giants liked me and I thought I might go somewhere
in the first round,'' Petitgout, a tackle at Notre Dame who will
play guard for the Giants, said Friday before a 90-minute practice
for Giants draft selections, free agents and assorted veterans.
``But I was like everybody else, I guess. I thought maybe they
liked Aaron Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is the 388-pound tackle from Wisconsin who many expected
to be the Giants' first choice. He was taken by Detroit, eight
selections after the Giants picked at No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Georgetown, Del., last weekend, it did not take
Petitgout and his family long to see that the mention of his name
at the draft left most dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious,'' Petitgout said. ``There was Chris
Berman on ESPN saying, `Luke who?' and Mel Kiper, well, he didn't
know what to say. It was kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout was raised in rural Delaware, where his father still
farms 80 acres of corn and soybean as a hobby from his regular job
as an ombudsman for the state of Delaware. Although Petitgout is 6
feet 5 inches and 315 pounds, he kept a low profile during his
Notre Dame days, which he said was not difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a place like Notre Dame,'' he said, ``it's not going to be
the left tackle who gets the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday at Giants Stadium, Petitgout was the center of
attention as he posed for pictures with coaches and the rest of the
draft class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little overwhelming,'' he said. ``But I'll get
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the cries of ``Luke who?'' Petitgout is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much worried about it,'' he said. ``Publicity isn't
what makes a good football player. People don't know me, but all I
ask is that they wait and see about me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If picking Petitgout was not surprising enough, the Giants then
took Notre Dame's other starting offensive tackle from last year,
Mike Rosenthal, in the fifth round.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout was surprised by that pick, too. ``We had already
talked about how our time together was ending,'' Petitgout said.
``But it's going to be good to have a friend here. And he's a good
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal is a big football player. At 6-7 and 310 it was not
hard to find him on the practice field today.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel said of Petitgout and Rosenthal: ``You look at
those big bodies and it's no wonder why Notre Dame pounded some
people on the line.'' Notre Dame's offensive line allowed just nine
sacks last season and was ranked 16th nationally in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, if Rosenthal had been the Giants' first-round
choice and Petitgout the fifth-rounder, there would not have been
much surprise. Rosenthal was everybody's high school all-American.
He was one of the most heavily recruited linemen in the nation when
he graduated from Penn High School in Mishawaka, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Petitgout was a high school tight end and captain of his high
school golf team. He was switched to guard after he redshirted his
freshman season at Notre Dame. He became the starting left tackle
during his junior season. But even after last season ended, it was
Rosenthal who made the majority of the all-star teams, not
Petitgout.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, looking for a quick tackle who could also play left
guard, preferred Petitgout because of his agile feet and
athleticism. Rosenthal said that he was not offended when his
teammate was taken four rounds ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Rosenthal said. ``At Notre Dame, everyone is an
all-American. You learn to check your egos at the door. Luke and I
have always gotten along great.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said that Petitgout, who is quiet with a respectful,
country manner, will succeed in his new high-profile role.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Notre Dame, there's a lot of pressure; it's always there
from coaches, fans and media,'' he said. ``Luke will be just
fine.'' &QL;

MUNIR A. KHAN, WHO MANAGED NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN, DIES AT
72  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Va. )  By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Munir Ahmad Khan, an administrator of Pakistan's nuclear energy
programs when Pakistan was developing a nuclear weapon, died on
Thursday in Vienna of complications after heart surgery. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Khan was not a scientist but frequently spoke for Pakistan's
civilian and military nuclear policies at international
conferences, according to Dr. George Perkovich of the W. Alton
Jones Foundation in Charlottesville, Va., an expert on nuclear
programs in Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   After pursuing graduate work at the Illinois Institute of
Technology, Khan was employed for 14 years beginning in 1958 by the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna as an administrator of
the agency's nuclear power and fuel cycle programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, after the war between India and Pakistan that led to
the creation of Bangladesh as an independent nation, Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, then Pakistan's president and later its prime minister,
appointed Khan to head the nation's Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto was overthrown and hanged in a military coup in 1977, but
the nuclear program survived, culminating in a series of bomb tests
conducted in the Baluchistan desert last May.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan credited its success in producing nuclear weapons
largely to Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a bitter rival (and not a
relative) of Munir Khan.
</P>
<P>
   After Pakistan's nuclear tests last year Abdul Khan was hailed
by Pakistanis as a national hero. Although he was credited as the
``father'' of Pakistan's bomb, the Pakistan government also paid
tribute to the less spectacular role played by Munir Khan's Atomic
Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   With the ascendancy of Abdul Khan in Pakistan's nuclear
hierarchy, the role of Munir Khan was eclipsed, American experts
said in interviews. But he remained active in nuclear policy
discussions, and took part in meetings of the Shanghai Initiative,
a nonofficial forum of nuclear experts from several nations.
</P>
<P>
   Khan is survived by his wife, Thera, three children and four
grandchildren. &QL;

THOMAS H. DAVIS, FOUNDER OF PIEDMONT AIRLINES, DIES AT 81  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ariz., Ohio)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas H. Davis, the founder of Piedmont Aviation, which grew to
employ more than 20,000 people before it was acquired by USAir
Group, died on Thursday at a hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C. He was
81 and lived in Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was known for walking through his company's repair shops,
asking the mechanics if all was fine. Until last year, he had gone
to work at the same place he had for decades, in offices next to
Smith Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem _ only about three miles
from where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Davis was fascinated by flying. When Charles
Lindbergh visited Winston-Salem after his trans-Atlantic flight in
1927, Davis built a model of Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was in high school, Davis had convinced his
father to help pay for flying lessons. In 1934, at 16, he made his
first solo flight in a Taylor E-2 Cub. The tiny plane had a canvas
shell, two seats and a 37-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main things I remember about it was the total
surprise at how quickly the airplane would get off the ground and
how fast it would climb without the instructor in it,'' Davis told
a reporter from The Wilmington (N.C.) Star-News in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the airplane rolled very far, it was off the ground and
climbing like a scared duck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he moved to Arizona, to study medicine at the
University of Arizona and to help relieve the asthma from which he
suffered all his life. While a college student, he gave flying
lessons in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   He quit college after spending the summer of 1939 back in
Winston-Salem selling small planes for Camel City Flying Service, a
company owned by L.S. McGinnis, his former flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Davis, then in his early 20s, became the company's
principal stockholder, changed its name to Piedmont Aviation Inc.
and began expanding. Over the next year, the company sold 100
planes.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Piedmont's sales slowed, but the company
quickly found a new niche by setting up training schools for
military pilots in Greensboro and Winston-Salem. With that change,
the company of fewer than 10 employees quickly grew to employ more
than 100.
</P>
<P>
   But with the end of the war, Davis lost most of his customers,
and he worried about having to let his workers go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the war was over,'' he recalled last year, ``I
didn't want to turn them out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   So Davis decided that the company would change its focus again
and start making commercial flights. In 1947, Piedmont Airlines, a
division of Piedmont Aviation, was formed. On Feb. 20, 1948, the
company's first commercial flight _ Flight 41 _ taxied onto the
runway in Wilmington with Davis on board. After making five stops,
the Douglas DC-3 landed in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Because Piedmont was a regional airline, it had a disadvantage
to overcome. In the 1960s, its average route was still less than
100 miles, which increased costs because of the frequent takeoffs
and landings. To save money, the company made lightning-fast
turnaround times at the terminal its specialty.
</P>
<P>
   To save time in turning a flight around after a landing, the
pilot would kill one engine but keep the other running as
passengers exited and others came on board. Even the co-pilot
helped with luggage. When a plane did not need to be refueled, it
was able to spend less than five minutes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades that followed, Davis helped turn Piedmont into
one of the nation's most profitable airlines. By the time USAir
Group bought Piedmont Aviation in 1987, the company had 21,500
employees and annual revenue of $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was also known for his philanthropy. He was a lifetime
trustee at Wake Forest University and served on the board at Wake
Forest University Baptist Medical Center. He was active at the Wake
Forest Baptist Church and a supporter of the American Lung
Association of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal for his
achievement in aeronautics, an award that had gone to such aviation
pioneers as Lindbergh, Davis' childhood hero.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' wife of 41 years, Nancy Teague Davis, died in 1985. He is
survived by five children: Thomas Davis Jr., George Franklin Teague
Davis and Nancy Davis McGlothlin, all of Winston-Salem, and
Winifred Davis Pierce of Weldon, N.C., and Juliana Davis West of
Raleigh, N.C. He is also survived by a brother, Egbert L. Davis
Jr., and a sister, Pauline Perry, both of Winston-Salem, and 13
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, when he became ill, Davis continued to fly
planes, sometimes in the Taylor E-2, now restored, that he had
flown his first solo in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy flying around and looking at the countryside,''
he said in 1995. ``It's a lot of fun.''

SIR LAURENCE KIRWAN, HELPED PLAN ASCENT OF EVEREST, DIES AT 91  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Sudan, Antarctica, Nepal, Egypt)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Laurence Kirwan, an archeologist and the former director of
the British Royal Geographical Society, and a man for whom harsh
and forbidding deserts, mountaintops and polar ice caps were
irresistible attractions, died April 16 in a hospice in London. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan was noted for excavating royal tombs in the Sudanese
desert dating from the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., for
promoting the exploration of Antarctica, and for helping to plan
and finance the first successful ascent of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   For the three decades after World War II, he was the director
and secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, a privately
supported institution that many Britons look upon as a remnant of
lost empire. In that role, he was involved in the planning and
financing of three great expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely known was the Mount Everest expedition of 1953,
which ended in triumph when Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide
Tenzing Norgay became the first people to stand at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Also widely admired was the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic
Expedition of 1949-52, which was the first international expedition
to Antarctica and the first to explore the possibility that global
warming might be a cause of the reduction of the polar ice cover.
</P>
<P>
   The third project was the Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1955-57,
led by Vivian Fuchs. In previous years, aircraft had flown across
the polar ice cap, but this was the first land crossing, with the
explorers riding in huge tanklike ``snow cats.'' Several of these
cumbersome vehicles tumbled into ``a maze of deep, concealed
crevasses of unparalleled extent,'' Kirwan wrote in his 1959 book
``The White Road,'' after interviewing the explorers. But the
caravan eventually completed the crossing ``with almost military
precision within a day of the planned date.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Hanbury-Tenison, the British explorer, recalled, ``He
spurred you to greater things by making you want to please him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hanbury-Tenison recalled an exception. ``When I told him
Richard Mason and I wanted to drive across Latin America at its
widest point, from Recife, Brazil, to Lima, Peru, he said there
were good and sufficient reasons why it hadn't been done before and
that we'd never make it. After we did make it in 1958, he said,
`Well done, chaps,' recommended us for a minor award, and then
wrote the preface for the book I wrote about our journey in which
he apologized for the fact that he hadn't thought much of our
project when we started out.''
</P>
<P>
   Archibald Laurence Patrick Kirwan was born in 1907 in Cregg,
County Galway, Ireland, and was educated at the Wimbledon School
and Merton College, Oxford. From 1929 to 1934, he was the assistant
director of an archeological survey of Nubia. In 1935 he was the
co-author of ``Excavations and Survey Between Wadi-es-Sebua and
Adindan'', in which he discussed the excavations of some of the
earliest settlements in that region of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, he carried out further excavations as
the field director of Sudanese expeditions conducted by Oxford. It
was during this period that he directed excavations of the royal
tombs at Ballana and Qustal, publishing his discoveries in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served at the Ministry of Defense and
was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1943. Immediately after the
war, he was named the director and secretary of the Royal
Geographical Society. He was knighted in 1972, and continued as the
director and secretary until 1975. After his retirement, he
continued as the editor of The Geographical Journal for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The picture of an aristocratic archeologist, Kirwan stood 6 feet
6 inches tall. He was known as a gentle but painstaking professor
when he taught at Edinburgh, London and Cairo universities.
</P>
<P>
   He was married twice. His second wife, Stella, died in 1997. He
is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Preston of London.
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan's involvement in two Antarctic expeditions excited his
interest in what he called ``the cold deserts'' and led to his 1959
book, which was published in the United States a year later under
the title ``A History of Polar Exploration.''
</P>
<P>
   His contribution to polar exploration is acknowledged in such
place names as the Kirwan Escarpment, in Queen Maud Land in
Antarctica, and the Kirwan Inlet on Alexander Island off the
Antarctic Peninsula.

SPREWELL'S $25,000 FINE WILL COME FROM APPAREL COMPANY'S POCKETS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., N.C. Ga., Pa., Ind., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Checketts' attempt to bring order to the Knicks was diluted
Friday when the $25,000 fine slapped on Latrell Sprewell was picked
up by an apparel company the guard endorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Latrell's back,'' said Jay Coen Gilbert, the
founding partner of And 1, in a radio interview. ``And we want him
to concentrate on playing basketball and helping the Knicks get to
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, was critical
of how the team was using his client and questioned the leadership
of the Knicks' organization. On Wednesday, the day he dismissed
Ernie Grunfeld from his position as team president and general
manager, Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, said he
held Sprewell accountable for his agent's comments and fined him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks they can step up and take potshots at the
organization and the coach is in for that kind of treatment,''
Checketts said when he handed down his fine. ``I won't stand for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Checketts attended the Knicks' game against
Charlotte but was unavailable for comment. Barry Watkins, a Garden
spokesman, said the team would still take the fine out of
Sprewell's paycheck. He also said Checketts had no reaction to And
1's decision to pay the fine for Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had been considering whether to appeal the fine through
the players association. But with the company's pitching in, he may
decide to forget about the red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's saying a lot for them to say that they're taking care
of something like that,'' Sprewell said. ``If they do that, it
makes it easier for it to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had to get his focus on the game quickly Friday night.
After being late for practice Thursday, he was stuck in traffic and
arrived in the locker room at Madison Square Garden just after 7
p.m. for an 8 o'clock tip-off. Most of the players get to the game
90 minutes before the game.

<P>
   This was not the first time Sprewell had been the center of
controversy with the team. Throughout the season, Sprewell has
voiced his displeasure with being the team's sixth man. The
comments made by Gist concerned that very issue. Gist was upset
that a player like Sprewell, a three-time All-Star, has been used
that way by the Knicks. He also said the tension that existed
between Grunfeld and Coach Jeff Van Gundy had filtered down to the
team. While Sprewell said the comments of his agent were ill-timed,
he did not rebut the basis of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of his teammates were surprised at the fine. Patrick
Ewing, the president of the players association, said he was going
to look into the union's stance on the issue. Now, the matter may
die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue for me,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm not focusing
on it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   KNICKS HAVE SEVEN UP
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks played Charlotte on Friday night, they had
seven games remaining: Miami twice, Charlotte, Atlanta,
Philadelphia, Indiana and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As packed as the schedule is over the next two weeks, there is
no way of knowing just how few victories the Knicks can get by with
and make the playoffs. Almost all of the teams jockeying for the
last three spots in the playoff standing play each other this week.
But Coach Jeff Van Gundy was willing to guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a chance? I'd say we have to win five games,'' he said
before his team played the Hornets. ``I didn't say that would get
us in, but it gives us a chance. You never know. But that's a basic
number. Whether it's true or not I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHNSON INVESTIGATION DROPPED
</P>
<P>
   The league has dropped its investigation into a recent report
that described a scene in which Larry Johnson exposed himself to
the Knicks' public relations director, Lori Hamamoto, and used
inappropriate language when addressing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to both Lori and Larry, and both insist the
incident never took place,'' said Chris Brienza, the league's vice
president for sports media relations. ``The matter is closed.''

ALEXANDER ALEXAY, PIANIST AND COACH, DIES AT 97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria, Canada, Ariz. )   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alexander Alexay, a pianist who coached and
accompanied opera singers and recitalists, and who worked for many
years with the composer Sigmund Romberg, died on Tuesday in
Manhattan, where he lived. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Alexay was born in Ottawa in 1901. By the time he was 15, he was
earning his living as a pianist in vaudeville and burlesque shows
and in movie houses. After five years, he had saved enough money to
travel to Europe to pursue more formal studies, and in 1921 he was
accepted as a student of Emil von Sauer, a pupil of Liszt, in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   He began working with singers during his student years, both as
a pianist in vocal classes and as an accompanist in recitals. When
he returned to the United States he performed both as a recitalist
and in collaboration with singers, and in the 1930s, he was
employed by Romberg as a coach on his operetta productions. He
worked with Romberg for 15 years, until the composer's death in
1951. He also occasionally played with the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Among the singers he accompanied through the early 1970s were
Helen Traubel, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Richard Tucker, Jan
Peerce, Roberta Peters, Jerome Hines, Robert Merrill, Mario Lanza,
Anna Moffo, Marian Anderson and Renata Scotto.
</P>
<P>
   Alexay is survived by his wife, Hiromi, and a son, Mario, of
Green Valley, Ariz.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: READING, WRITING AND OPERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 24: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few book reviewers are paid more quickly or have a more
appreciative audience than Corey Sheen. He reviews novels and
nature books for the newspaper of the bookstore at Public School
161 in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood, which pays him in
books. Every Wednesday morning, students can buy books for one
dollar. They depend on reviews like Corey's to help them choose. At
the moment he is recommending ``Salmon,'' about the fish, which in
a recent review he called ``full of intriguing information'' and
``easily read and understood by young children.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey, who is in first grade, should know. Although math is his
favorite subject, Corey guesses he has ``99 books'' at home and has
read them all. His father, Carlos Torres, helps him with the really
hard words.
</P>
<P>
   From kindergarten through fifth grade, P.S. 161 is a
neighborhood school, admitting every student that space permits.
Two years ago it added a competitive middle school, the Crown
School for Law and Journalism, which admits the best applicants
from the same neighborhood. Virtually all the students are black,
mostly West Indians like Corey, who came to New York from Trinidad
four years ago. Nearly 97 percent qualify for free lunches _ not
usually a good sign for academic success _ yet P.S. 161's third
graders' reading scores tower above the city average. Every eighth
grader passed the Regents math exam last year, and all but one
passed the biology exam. On sixth-grade reading tests last year,
the school ranked second of all public schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Much of P.S. 161's success can be attributed to its
administrators and staff. Irwin Kurz, the kinetic principal,
arrives at 6 most mornings, and personally greets the children
every day when they enter and leave the building. His staff of
unusually experienced teachers, many of whom he has hand-picked,
call him a demanding leader who inspires them to get the most out
of their students.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much in Kurz's program that other schools could
duplicate. P.S. 161 has an aura of gravity. Students wear uniforms,
with neckties. The teachers dress up as well, many in suits. The
halls are spotless and hushed. Although many classes have 35
students _ one thing he would change if he had the money, Kurz says
_ a visit to numerous classrooms found all the students paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers use a phonics-based reading series, but the school has
spent thousands of dollars both from fund-raisers and its very
active Parent Association to supplement the texts with novels. When
students first learn to read, they go to Kurz's office and read a
book to him. Classes read novels together, a chapter a night as
homework, and discuss what they have read. Students write essays
every week.
</P>
<P>
   In Alice Cherry's fourth-grade class they write and illustrate
their own complete books, after studying writing techniques such as
using action to show character. There are high expectations of
teachers, students and parents in every field; 10 years ago for the
school play a music teacher, Ann Aviles, staged ``Carmen.'' Now she
takes a group each year to the Metropolitan Opera. This year,
before seeing a Tchaikovsky opera, the students studied the daily
life and art of late-19th-century Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But hard work, says Kurz, is not enough. ``You need to plan,
monitor and support it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When parents come in June to register for fall kindergarten,
they get a list of skills children are expected to have when they
start school, and specific ways parents can teach them. In school,
students are repeatedly tested. If they fall behind, reading and
math specialists provide tutoring. They also meet with parents as
often as every two weeks, lend them educational games and recommend
ways to work with the child. The lesson of P.S. 161 is that with
creative teaching, constant feedback and intense family
involvement, ``every child can learn'' can be more than a slogan.

EDITORIAL: ARIZONA SHOWS THE WAY ON DRUGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 24:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters, tired of paying the exorbitant costs of
imprisoning drug users and addicts who might be helped more
cheaply, voted twice to provide a treatment alternative to jail.
Now an Arizona Supreme Court study of the first year of probation
with mandatory drug treatment _ instead of prison _ has shown the
apparent wisdom of that decision. Congress and the legislatures of
New York and other states should take heed.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade and a half, since crack cocaine and its murderous
dealer wars frightened the electorate in the mid-'80s, the
knee-jerk political reaction has been to pass tougher criminal drug
laws, build more prisons and put more drug users and dealers in
them. Many states now spend more on prisons than on higher
education. More than 1.8 million people nationwide are in prison,
400,000 of whom are addicts or chronic users. But punishment has
not solved the problem. Addicts, untreated, emerge from prison and
quickly return to drugs, resorting to robbery or even murder to get
the money for them.
</P>
<P>
   The approach approved by voters in Arizona diverted people who
are convicted of or plead guilty to nonviolent drug-related crimes
from jail to probation and treatment. The treatment and supervision
are largely paid for by a tax on a legal drug _ alcohol. It is the
kind of program that an increasing number of law enforcement
chiefs, including Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the head of the national
drug policy office for the Clinton administration, have been
advocating.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the new policy's first year of operation in
Arizona suggest that it is a success. The cost of prison, the state
Supreme Court said, is $50 a day. The cost of treatment, counseling
and probation is $16 a day. The amount saved, it estimated, is more
than $2.5 million the first year, and more than three-quarters of
the people monitored on probation have stayed free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is a politically conservative state. Its voters showed
that they were tired of paying the costs of a bad idea. In
requiring that drug offenders be treated before being freed of
supervision, they may have made themselves safer. By treating drugs
as a health problem, they have shown states like New York, which
spends $700 million a year to imprison drug felons, a better way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 24: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Russia is ever to break free of the heritage that stunts its
development, it must overcome its reflexive allegiance to
bloody-minded tyrants like Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein.
As hard as it may be for Boris Yeltsin, he should use this critical
moment in Europe to push Russia toward an enduring partnership with
the West. Only then can Russia hope to build the modern economy and
democracy that its people want and deserve.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that Moscow is still dancing with
Milosevic as his forces brutally assault the people of Kosovo, but
none promise to benefit Russia as it struggles to rebuild its
dysfunctional economy. Slavic solidarity, a common antipathy to
NATO and fervent nationalism may play well in Moscow and Belgrade,
but they are dead-end policies for Russia. Making common cause with
Serbia and Belarus is not going to revive the Russian economy. The
preservation of Slavic culture, language and identity is an
honorable aim, but it is not a productive foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's embrace of dictators had a certain ruthless logic
during the Cold War, when Russia was prepared to use whatever
repression was required at home and abroad to protect and export
its ideology. The United States, in the name of advancing
democracy, closed ranks with anti-communist tyrants in Asia and
Latin America. But seven years after the disintegration of the
Soviet Union, at a time when democracy and economic integration are
reshaping the world, Milosevic and Saddam are political
anachronisms. Alliance with them brings estrangement from the rest
of the world, the last thing Russia needs.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kosovo, Moscow no doubt fears that NATO
intervention in Yugoslavia could lead someday to outside
interference in Russia's own ethnic conflicts. Yeltsin's brutish
attack on Chechnya comes to mind. But that is a false fear. NATO
well knows that it cannot intervene in Russia without igniting a
new Continental war in Europe. Russia, for all the cruelty of its
assault on Chechnya, did not conduct a genocidal campaign in the
breakaway territory.
</P>
<P>
   With anti-American sentiment rising in Russia, and parliamentary
and presidential elections scheduled over the next 14 months,
Yeltsin may feel he cannot afford to lean away from Milosevic, even
though the Russian leader is not seeking re-election himself. But
the paramount domestic issue in Russia is the ailing economy, not
Kosovo. There is little need for Moscow to align itself so ardently
with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's role as a potential peacemaker would be enhanced if
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's special envoy for the Balkans, were
free to tell Milosevic that the Serbian offensive in Kosovo is
intolerable. Milosevic might listen more closely to diplomatic
proposals if Moscow declared that he must allow ethnic Albanians to
return home under the protection of an international force of armed
peacekeepers. Chernomyrdin said Friday that Milosevic had agreed to
such a force when they talked in Belgrade this week, but the
Yugoslav government insisted that only unarmed peacekeepers had
been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's future development has little to do with Kosovo and a
great deal to do with how Moscow manages relations with the United
States and Europe. In the near term, Russia desperately needs $4.5
billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund, assistance
that is likely to be approved soon if the fund is satisfied that
the government budget is responsible. But that is just a fraction
of the foreign capital and commerce that Russia will need to
attract over the next decade if it is to build a new and prosperous
economy. Slobodan Milosevic is not going to be a big contributor.

`GOURMET' RANKS PHOENIX-AREA RESORTS AMONG WORLD'S TOP 10 HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX _  &UR; (EDITORS: LIST OF HOTELS AT END OF STORY) Two
Phoenix-area resorts _ the Boulders and the Phoenician _ were
ranked among the world's top 10 hotels in a ``Gourmet'' magazine
survey that named the Halekulani in Honolulu as the best.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulders in Carefree was seventh and the Phoenician ninth in
``Gourmet's''Rooms at the Top survey published in the May issue,
which hits newsstands Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased,'' said Steve Sampson, Boulders director of
sales and marketing. ``The awards and accolades that come to the
Boulders are spectacular and we consider this a worthy accolade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boulders is ranked No. 1 in the Southwest, just ahead of the
Phoenician. Arizona Biltmore is fourth and Marriott's Camelback Inn
is fifth in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent service by a stable staff along with the quality of
the restaurants, rooms and golf are why people keep coming back to
the 15-year-old Boulders and why ``Gourmet'' readers rated it so
high, Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenician spokeswoman Sally Cooper said the rankings are
important because they come from guests who have stayed at the
resort. The high marks from the magazine's readers validate the
staff's efforts to maintain high standards, she added.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year for the hotel survey, said Karen Larkin,
a spokeswoman for ``Gourmet,'' a Conde Nast magazine with a
circulation of about 850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenician was ranked sixth worldwide last year and 17th in
1997. The Boulders was ranked one of the top Southwest hotels the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's survey, more than 150 hotels, resorts and inns in
27 countries were ranked.
</P>
<P>
   Readers also determined their preferred hotels for
special-interest travel.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Grand Floridian Resort &AMP; Spa was ranked the best family
resort. The Regent in Hong Kong was cited as the best business
hotel and for romance, readers preferred the Ritz-Carlton Laguna
Niguel in Dana Point, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Ritz in Paris has the top-rated pool. Readers chose
Ashford Castle in County Mayo, Ireland, as the best in design and
architecture. &QL;

NATO DEFENSE MINISTERS AGREE ON OIL EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates and revisions throughout) (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the opening day of the NATO summit meeting
Friday, the alliance agreed on a plan to impose an oil embargo on
Serbia and to enforce it by searching ships in the Adriatic Sea
suspected of carrying fuel for forces fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Defense ministers of the 19-nation alliance undertook to enforce
the restrictions after NATO leaders made the decision at a
three-hour session focused on the Kosovo war. The leaders also
decided to order the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to carry
out heavier airstrikes against overland pipelines and railroads
that carry fuel from the ports of Montenegro to Serbia, a senior
Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance leaders have gathered here to celebrate 50 years of
the alliance, whose celebration has been overshadowed by the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   At their session, the NATO leaders issued a communique spelling
out their intentions for Kosovo's future. If President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia began to withdraw his forces according to
an agreed-to timetable, the communique said, the allies would
deploy an ``international military force'' and set up an
``international provisional administration'' in the province,
giving it autonomy, but not independence.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of deploying an international force and setting up some
form of protectorate has been intensively discussed in Brussels,
Washington and other NATO capitals. But the communique marked a
formal commitment by NATO to those conditions for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also pledged to seek a U.N. Security Council
resolution to demand the withdrawal of Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The specification that the force and the interim administration
in Kosovo would be ``international,'' and not necessarily NATO-led,
and the inclusion of the Security Council appeared designed to
encourage the participation of Russia in a diplomatic solution,
which in turn was expected to make it easier for Milosevic to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the allies officially rejected recent offers
of a settlement made by Milosevic through Russia's Balkan envoy,
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Without naming
Chernomyrdin, the communique said the Yugoslav leader's ``offers to
date'' did not meet NATO conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders have been pushing for ways to choke off oil
supplies to Yugoslavia, arguing that new oil was arriving even as
they were bombing oil installations.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Thursday that
``basically it didn't make a lot of sense for us to be bombing
refineries and at the same time not doing enough to prevent the
access of oil by sea.'' She added, ``We are particularly focusing
on oil because that is the way that forces move around.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the European Union pushed through a decision
to ban the supply of oil and refined products to Yugoslavia,
excluding supplies for relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ministers said they would provide ships to conduct
the searches and inspections on the Adriatic, the Pentagon official
said. The effort would be intended to stop oil flowing into the
ports of Bar and Kotor Bay, on the coast of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said an effort would be made to minimize the
damage to Montenegro, a republic of Yugoslavia that has opposed the
government of Milosevic. ``The question is how to stop the flow of
oil into Montenegro and to stop the flow out of Montenegro without
hurting the Montenegrins.''
</P>
<P>
   In their communique, the 19 leaders reaffirmed the five basic
demands that Milosevic must agree to for the bombing to stop. They
are a verifiable cease-fire; withdrawal of all Serb military and
police forces from Kosovo; the stationing of an international
military presence that would have NATO at its core; the safe return
of the ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo, and a willingness to
work toward a political agreement based on accords from the failed
talks held in Rambouillet, France, in February.
</P>
<P>
   The formal 17-point communique of the summit was released
against a backdrop of tough language. Phrases like ``resolve to see
this challenge through'' and declarations that ``NATO will
prevail'' reverberated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, set a tone that combined
perseverance and defensiveness. He said: ``NATO has an obligation
to succeed. We cannot afford to lose this one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a closed session of the 19 leaders, Clark gave an upbeat
10-minute briefing on the status of the air campaign. He told them
that NATO had ``achieved air superiority at mid to high altitudes
throughout Yugoslavia,'' according to his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Clark flew back to Brussels Friday night, without meeting with
President Clinton. His spokeswoman said he had to get back to the
war.
</P>
<P>
   And in public briefings by various NATO leaders, their ministers
and spokesmen invoked the idea of ground troops as they tried to
send a unified message. Much of that talk seemed aimed at
Milosevic, since the alliance leaders still insist that the air
campaign is effective.
</P>
<P>
   That option _ of when and how they would enter Kosovo _ was not
addressed in the official 17-point communique on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there was ``some discussion'' about ground troops at the
closed Kosovo session of the 19 leaders, the Canadian defense
minister, Art Eggleton, said in an interview. The talk focused on
asking the military planners at NATO headquarters to review all
options, but did not get into specifics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their discussion followed a decision two days ago by NATO's
secretary- general, Javier Solana, to review all plans for
introducing group troops into the region, a decision made at the
request of the allies.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who have been the most vocal on the subject of
ground troops, reiterated Friday that they envisioned a situation
where troops could enter Kosovo after Serb forces had been very
heavily punished and where Milosevic had not given his consent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain spent
two and a half hours with Clinton in a private dinner at the White
House, trying to explain to the president the necessity of being
prepared to send in troops without Yugoslavia's consent but after
Serb forces had been severely weakened, British officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's chief of the defense staff, Gen. Charles Guthrie,
repeated this theme at a news conference Friday, saying:
``President Milosevic's war machine has been seriously weakened.
It's going to be weakened again, day after day, week after week.''
He added, in reference to going into Kosovo, ``And we will be able
to choose our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said that there were now about 19,000 allied troops in
Macedonia and Albania and that more be sent in the coming weeks to
be ready to ``to take the refugees back.''
</P>
<P>
   The general said that he was not prepared to say how many troops
would be needed for the operation but that it would need to be more
than the 30,000 proposed as a security force in Kosovo before the
air attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   The British officials stressed that none of the allies would
agree to ground troops' fighting their way into Kosovo. ``We are
not talking about an invasion force,'' Defense Secretary George
Robertson of Britain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday night that about 2,300 troops
accompanied by heavy armor were being sent to Albania, adding to
the 3,000 American soldiers already there. The new troops were
being sent with 15 tanks, 14 Bradley armored vehicles, eight
howitzers and a company of soldiers armed with anti-tank weapons.

KNICKS BEAT HORNETS, 110-105  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Ewing stared down the shot clock as he stood
on the fringe of the paint with his back against Derrick Coleman
and the ball in his palm. Several seconds ticked off, and the crowd
bubbling inside Madison Square Garden grew edgy. What was he
thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts of all those missed last-second shots, all those
botched free throws in the pinch could have been circling his head
like buzzards. But Ewing was not pondering failure. Ewing believed
he was going to take the shot, make the shot and be the hero. And
perhaps be the one to salvage this tumultuous season for the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Ewing's faith was rewarded. After the Knicks watched
their 18-point lead shrink to 1 with 1 minute 2 seconds left, Ewing
provided the critical points of separation when he wheeled past
Coleman and delivered a running jumper with 24 seconds remaining.
That shot gave the Knicks the edge they needed to end their
four-game skid, poke their heads back into the playoff standing and
halt the Hornets' nine-game winning streak by desperately holding
on for a 110-105 victory Friday night. The Knicks (22-21) are tied
with Toronto for eighth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my shot,'' said Ewing, whose jumper put the Knicks
ahead by 106-102. ``I've been shooting that one my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a sure thing, though. As the shot clock wound down to
10, Ewing drove left and launched an off-kilter jumper over
Coleman, the player he had scuffled with earlier in the game, and
watched it bound off the rim four times before going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice, it bounced twice,'' Ewing said with a smile. No, four
times, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Ewing said, inhaling deeply, ``it went in, didn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   The bounce went the Knicks' way. And this time, despite some
nervous moments, the Knicks survived a nearly disastrous fourth
quarter. Somewhere, former team president Ernie Grunfeld might have
been saying, ``So, now they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was dismissed on Wednesday after watching the Knicks fall to
.500 and seeing the organization come apart. But this victory by
the Knicks was not an act of support for Coach Jeff Van Gundy or a
salute to Grunfeld. Next to the 30-point effort of Allan Houston,
Ewing scored 26 points, including 4 in the last two minutes,
because he could run and hop and spin on an Achilles' tendon that
had been given three days' rest.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of good bounces had everything to do with it. Just
before Ewing's shot, Marcus Camby missed a free throw with 47.8
seconds left, then tracked it down and started a play that ended up
with Ewing's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The shot came against the player who got in a shoving match with
Ewing midway through the third quarter. Already in the game, Elden
Campbell had been ejected for clobbering Kurt Thomas in the back of
the head and berating an official. Coleman shoved Ewing, who shoved
back. Ewing nearly got himself ejected when he tossed Charlie Ward
aside and rushed toward Coleman. He restrained himself just enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who led by 18 with five minutes left in the third
quarter, watched as the Hornets missed two shots, grabbed two
rebounds and ended the possession when Chuck Person hit 3-pointer
with 4:39 left to make it 96-91. The Hornets cut it to 103-102
after Coleman barged his way inside for a layup and foul that ended
with a 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks built a 17-point lead in the opening four minutes of
the third. The frustration with the whole ugly scene for the
Hornets boiled over with 5:50 left in the third quarter. Campbell
missed a layup in traffic, then sent a forearm to the back of
Thomas' head.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was called for a flagrant foul. In his disgust with the
call, Campbell pointed into the face of referee Scott Wall, who
slapped him with a technical foul and ejected him from the game.
With Eddie Jones already out with injury, the Hornets' most
important source of offense was headed to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   This was a switch. Usually, the Knicks are the team quickest to
lose its poise. And they didn't disappoint. After they appeared to
have everything under control, holding a 72-54 lead with 5 minutes
left in the third, Coleman and Ewing got into their scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the bottom began falling out for the Knicks. The
Hornets, using Bobby Phills to drive and a 3-pointer from Chuck
Person, went on a 16-7 run to cut the Knicks' lead to 79-70 with 32
seconds left in the third.

YANKS BEAT JAYS, 6-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells badly wanted to beat the Yankees, they
all knew that, and Wells's ballyhooed return to Yankee Stadium
arched the eyebrow of a former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Boomer wants to stick it to us tonight,'' said
the Yankee, using Wells' nickname. ``Well, I would imagine the guys
in here want to stick it to him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal. Wells took a businesslike approach to the
mound, all but ignoring the Yankee Stadium fans who cheered for him
in his first game in New York since being traded to Toronto, and
his former teammates reciprocated, taking him apart bit by bit in a
6-4 victory. Chili Davis slammed a two-run double in a
seventh-inning rally that knocked Wells (3-1) out of the game, and
made a winning pitcher out of Orlando Hernandez (3-1).
</P>
<P>
   Wells will receive his championship ring this weekend, but it
will come without bragging rights attached, after his loss Friday
night. Wells had allowed just four hits in maintaining a 1-1 tie
through six innings, but like many pitchers victimized by the
Yankees, he had worked hard, throwing 84 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill had been 1 for 16 in his career against Wells,
hitting into a double play and striking out in his first two
at-bats, but he drew a walk against Wells leading off the seventh.
Bernie Williams then fouled off four pitches with a full count,
until, on the 10th pitch of the at-bat, he walked, as well; two on,
nobody out. Mel Queen, the Toronto pitching coach, went to the
mound to give Wells a breather.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, aggressive on the bases all night against the
slow-moving Wells, ran again: O'Neill and Williams broke from
second and first, respectively, and Davis ripped a line drive to
right, the ball thumping off the wall. O'Neill and Williams scored,
the Yankees led, 3-1, and Wells was in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez then rolled a single through the middle, driving
home Davis and finishing Wells. After Wells trudged off the mound,
the crowd of 36,529 erupted respectfully in recognition of what he
did for them last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wells looked up briefly and flicked his glove before
disappearing into the dugout. Thanks, but no thanks. Nothing
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Those fans willing to stand in the last of the lingering showers
Friday evening sprinkled a warm greeting on Wells when he emerged
from the Toronto dugout at 7:25 p.m. en route to the bullpen to
warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Wells acknowledged those cheers with a few waves _ pointing with
his glove at the fans in right field _ and Wells was even more
animated in acknowledging the fans while returning from the
bullpen, when he received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   When Shawn Green grounded out to end Toronto's first at-bat, the
Yankee faithful began rising around the ancient ball park,
anticipating Wells' emergence onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The last out of Wells' perfect game was shown on the Yankees'
giant video screen, and the chilly air was shaken by the steely
sounds of a song played for Wells when he was in pinstripes _ Van
Halen's ``Running With the Devil.'' For Wells, the ultimate
welcome-home party.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as if Wells postponed his love affair with Yankee
fans, if only for a couple hours. As they stood for him and cheered
for him during Wells' first stroll to the center of the diamond,
Wells did not wave, did not glance into the stands, never looked in
the Yankee dugout. They stood and cheered for him, and Wells stared
downward and dug at the dirt in front of the rubber with his left
foot, as intent as any 6-year-old pushing Matchbox cars through a
sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   The clapping subsided gradually. When the fans in the
right-field bleachers chanted his name, making him the first
opponent to be honored in their roll call, Wells quickly jabbed his
glove in their direction, acknowledging and dismissing them
simultaneously: OK, I know you love me, now shut up while I work.
</P>
<P>
   Then David Wells went about the business of trying to beat the
Yankees, glaring at his old friends from behind the full goatee
that he had to shave when he pitched for George Steinbrenner, the
Yankees' principal owner, tugging on all corners of his uniform,
the top two buttons of his jersey undone. Maybe Wells had plans to
party after the game, straight through Friday night and into
tomorrow morning, but he took this very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, the player who caught the final out of Wells' perfect
game, would get lots of curveballs. Derek Jeter, who anchored the
infield behind Wells, would be jammed with fastballs on the hands.
Wells changed speeds on Davis, throwing curveballs when Davis
expected fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were all business as well, plotting methods of
beating the Boomer. Having watched Wells toil for the last two
years, his former teammates know the left-hander is vulnerable in
two ways: he hates bunts and little chopped ground balls, and he
has difficulty holding runners.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents stole eight bases in Wells' first three starts, the
most stolen bases allowed by any American League pitcher. ``If we
can get on base, that's when he's in trouble,'' said Jorge Posada,
the catcher in Wells' perfect game last May. ``You've just got to
be aggressive with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees'
lead-off batter, lined Wells' third pitch of the game into left
field, a ringing single. Knoblauch edged off first base, measured
Wells' delivery on the left-hander's first two pitches to Jeter,
then swiped second base. Knoblauch brushed off the dirt, took a
lead off second _ and broke for third. Darrin Fletcher, the Toronto
catcher, was ready, snatching a fastball and then whipping his
throw to third, where Knoblauch was tagged out easily.
</P>
<P>
   Wells had a prolonged fight with Martinez in the second inning.
Martinez fouled off eight two-strike pitches, but Wells cruised
into the middle innings, for the most part, allowing just two hits
through four innings. Hernandez, meanwhile, allowed no hits in the
first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto broke through with a single run in the fifth, and in the
bottom of the inning, Davis led off with a single before breaking
from second base with Martinez batting. Shortstop Alex Gonzalez
moved to cover second, Martinez lined a single through the hole
Gonzalez had vacated, and Davis took third and eventually came home
with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched out of a two-out, two-on jam in the seventh,
striking out Green, and the fans who cheered for Wells now yelled
for Hernandez.

A WARNING TO BOOT NEWEST VIRUS BEFORE IT BITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Wait! Have you scanned your computer for viruses
lately?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't, computer experts say, don't even turn on your
computer Monday morning until you take steps to kill a virus that
may be lurking within and set to activate Monday. To do so will
risk losing all your computer's contents and worse, a security
organization warned.
</P>
<P>
   A computer virus called CIH that destroys the contents of hard
disks and then prevents restarting the computer is set to attack at
midnight Sunday, according to the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The virus attacks stand-alone computers only if they're running
Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems, though networked
machines running any operating system can be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Though CIH is more dangerous than the recent Melissa virus, it
can be thwarted by killing it before Sunday at midnight, or by more
labor-intensive methods on Monday morning. Melissa, which last
month brought only a few corporate e-mail servers down, mostly
caused embarrassment by publishing documents without the writers'
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Strain 1.2 of CIH, also known as the Chernobyl virus, is
triggered on April 26, said an emergency response team spokesman.
April 26 is the anniversary of the catastrophic Chernobyl 1986
nuclear accident in Russia. Other strains, identical in effect,
trigger on June 26 and on the 26th of each month.
</P>
<P>
   Your computer is susceptible only if you've done something to
bring the virus into your machine.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is brought into a computer _ through an Internet
download or a network or floppy-disk file transfer _ on an
executable file that has been infected. Executable files, whose
names always end in ``.exe'', do the actual work within a computer.
Every application, such as Microsoft Word or Excel, has at least
one executable file.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's in a computer, CIH lurks until the first time any
executable file is launched after the virus' activation date. It
then overwrites a key portion of the hard disk with random data,
making it unusable. Before doing so, though, it overwrites part of
the computer's BIOS (basic input/output system), making it
impossible to restart the computer once it's turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The virus also infects every executable file that is launched.
Then, when an infected executable file is loaded onto another
machine's hard disk, it infects that machine.
</P>
<P>
   In networks, remote drives can be infected regardless of
operating system if a file on those drives is executed from an
infected Windows 95 or Windows 98 machine.
</P>
<P>
   The best course of action is to kill the virus before it's
activated at midnight Sunday, virus experts say. Computer users
with anti-virus software already installed should make sure they
have the latest anti-virus files downloaded. Those without such
software can download it from a number of Web sites (see list).
</P>
<P>
   If Monday morning arrives and you haven't killed the virus,
don't turn on your computer, experts advise. Instead, boot up from
the write-protected start-up disk you made when you first bought
your machine. Then immediately run updated anti-virus software that
you're sure hasn't been infected.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, some software companies, such as Symantec,
offer software that kills CIH without the need for floppy boot-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Once this crisis has passed, antivirus software should be set to
scan every file brought into a computer. Every file on the machine
should be scanned regularly, and the latest virus profiles should
be downloaded and installed once a week without fail, experts
advise.

STARS GRAB 2-0 SERIES LEAD WITH ANOTHER BIG FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The third period has been the Stars' downfall this
season _ a 20-minute span in which they've been outscored, bumbled
away leads and had almost no success coming back from deficits.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to the Stars to pick the right time to change their
fortunes. For the second consecutive game, the Stars scored two
third-period goals to bat away the best efforts of the Edmonton
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Last night before a sellout crowd of 17,001 _ the 39th
consecutive home sellout for the Stars _ the Stars picked up goals
from Jere Lehtinen and Jamie Langenbrunner to take a 3-2 victory
and a 2-0 edge in their best-of-seven Western Conference
quarterfinals series with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest sign of intelligence is learning from your
mistakes,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have done just that. Now, after two home games in
which the Stars controlled the third period, they head to Edmonton
for Game 3 tomorrow with a chance to seize complete control of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really big. We needed to protect home ice, and that's
what we accomplished,'' center Mike Modano said. ``Now, the ball's
back in their court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' regular-season statistics in the third period are
downright frightening for a team that went 51-19-12. They were
outscored 63-58, they five times lost leads to allow ties and they
were 1-14-2 when trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   But in two playoff games, the Stars have outscored the Oilers,
4-2, and never let them get an inkling that victory was close at
hand. In Game 1, the Stars scored 13 seconds into the third period
to tie the game and make a definitive statement. Last night, the
Stars drove a similar goal through the Oilers' net at just the
right time of the game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Oilers had tied the game at 1-1 at the 8:32 mark of
the third period on a Mike Grier wraparound goal, the Stars bounced
back 1:48 later on a hustling shift by Hull, Lehtinen and Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Modano and Hull flew into the boards to keep a puck in the
offensive zone and pushed the puck down into a scrum of bodies in
front of Oilers goaltender Tommy Salo. Lehtinen picked up the loose
puck and then wristed it through a crowd for the 2-1 lead at the
10:20 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner picked up the game-winner, however, four
minutes later when he took an errant Oilers pass and turned it into
an unassisted goal and a 3-1 Stars lead.
</P>
<P>
   That would prove crucial when Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk
deflected a Doug Weight pass into the Stars goal with 3:11
remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were able to fend off a frantic Oilers attack as Stars
goalie Ed Belfour put in a solid night's work with 17 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling to get the first two, to play well and
hard at home,'' Belfour said. ``But we have to take the same
attitude to Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will also have to take an improved power play. They
went 0-for-6 with the man advantage last night, including messing
up a 5-on-3 in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   That went right along with the Oilers' Game 1 plan. The Oilers
had a 65-34 edge in hits and put pressure on the Stars all night.
The Stars responded by spending most of the night in the Oilers'
end of the ice, firing 34 shots and adding 21 that missed the net.
</P>
<P>
   Salo was again solid and the Oilers' defense did a great job of
preventing second shots by the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   And all that, of course, made the third period heroics necessary
_ just like in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made the mistakes in third period and it's ended up
costing us the games,'' Oilers defenseman Janne Niinimaa said. ``It
was a little difference, but it was the difference in the game.''

OILERS FOLLOW GAME PLAN, BUT STILL LOSE
</HEADLINE>

By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The play was physical. The goaltending was good. The
shots were plentiful. The score was low.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmonton Oilers did everything they said they needed to do
to win Game 2 against the Stars, yet they trail the best-of-seven
series 2-0 after last night's 3-2 loss at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said the first day, we could lose,'' Oilers center Doug
Weight said. ``We could lose playing great hockey and playing our
game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   So the question is: What do they do now?
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers can't play any more physical. They were dangerously
close to playing too physical last night _ six power-play chances
were too many for a talented Stars bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Only an inept Stars power play saved the Oilers from regretting
their plan to play with muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to beat them without being physical, and we
hope the series goes longer than four,'' Edmonton coach Ron Low
said. ``That's what we're trying to do, just trying to extend it,
and if you can you keep hitting, maybe you wear them down. That's
our one chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers can't get much better goaltending. If goalie Tommy
Salo was a question mark coming in, he certainly isn't anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He missed Stars' shots No. 1 and No. 29 last night.
</P>
<P>
   He had 27 saves in between, including several late in Game 2 on
players like Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike Modano that kept Dallas' lead
at a single goal for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Salo allowed goal No. 3 with less than four minutes
remaining, a chip shot by Jamie Langenbrunner to seal Edmonton's
loss. Salo had been under heavy fire all game, though, and only his
play had kept the score that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, he gave us a chance to win,'' Low said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Salo: ``I think we played a great game, and we just ended
up losing. The breaks, we just have to start getting the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers aren't likely to get many more shots. They had 19 in
Game 2. The Stars only allowed 24 shots per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Oilers are going to win, they have to make better use of
their shots than they did last night.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like they didn't have chances. On his first day back
from injury, Edmonton winger Bill Guerin twice found himself
standing in front of Stars goalie Ed Belfour. Guerin didn't score
either time.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers had two goals. Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk
scored one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to be changing our game plan,'' Low
said. ``Two one-goal games are pretty indicative of how these games
have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The score isn't likely to get much lower either. The Stars had
plenty of good scoring chances in Games 1 and 2. Nieuwendyk alone
had a number that were just wide.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do now, Mr. Weight?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stay out of the box. We can score a little bit on our
chances,'' Weight said. ``We've been in this position before, and
it really doesn't scare us.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there won't be anything changing. It will be our glass
moving instead of theirs. ... We're going to play more of the same
hockey.''

STARS NOT EXACTLY SHINING, BUT STILL HAVE 2-0 LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Twinkle, twinkle, superStars, how we wonder, where you
are.
</P>
<P>
   Down there on the ice so clear, how is it you've managed to
disappear?
</P>
<P>
   A more pertinent question today: Does it really matter?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In the end, it probably will.
</P>
<P>
   We came expecting a series of exploding Stars, of Modano, and
Hull, and Nieuwendyk. They would be the difference, we were sure.
</P>
<P>
   Or not.
</P>
<P>
   What we have on our hands, instead, is plain old Stars grit and
resilience, Ken Hitchcock style.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' 3-2 victory over Edmonton last night at Reunion Arena
was yet another testament to the team's famous work ethic and
depth. It gives Dallas a commanding 2-0 lead in this best-of-seven
set with the Oilers, a team that had found itself down 0-2 only
five times in 43 previous playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' message has been sent loud and clear in the Queen's
English, simple enough for even the oafish Oilers to understand: Go
ahead and yuck it up while you tally your meaningless hits; we'll
count the goals and send you a postcard from St. Louis or Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution, however. Now that the Oilers have learned
that they're not going to be able to intimidate the Stars, they may
settle down and start playing hockey. They certainly haven't gone
away.
</P>
<P>
   As the Stars were clinging precariously to a 1-0 lead into the
third period, the question that hung over the ice like a cloud of
fog was just how long the team's offensive stars would let young
Oilers goalie Tommy Salo, playing in the first playoff series of
his career, shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Salo's superb play was the slender thread keeping the Oilers
alive against a far more talented team.
</P>
<P>
   He stonewalled them on half a dozen power-play opportunities,
including a 5-on-3 advantage for 92 seconds in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to finish our chances,'' said Hitchcock, who
didn't bother to conceal at least mild concern as the series shifts
to Edmonton for the next two games. ``We had some great
opportunities, and we just didn't finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're playing all right, but we're going to have to
take it to another level if we expect to win a game in Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau, the 39-year-old journeyman center who scored the
game winner in the opening game Wednesday, had given the Stars a
quick 1-0 lead only 2:34 into the game just after the Oilers had
killed off a Dallas power play.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau spun around from 15 feet out and flicked a shot past
Salo, who was screened by teammate Rem Murray and Stars winger
Blake Sloan as they danced in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the scouting reports on Salo are proving very accurate: What
he sees, he stops.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Stars, the same can be said of Eddie
Belfour, who was on his way to a 1-0 victory until the game got a
little weird in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars sent a flurry of shots at Salo just over six minutes
into the period, trying to put the Oilers away. Instead, they got a
little cavalier with the puck and Belfour, wandering out of the
goal as he often does, was forced to scoot back quickly and lost
track of Oilers wing Mike Grier, alone with the puck, behind the
net.
</P>
<P>
   When Belfour looked over his left shoulder, Grier came to the
right and knocked in the wraparound to the tie the score at 1.

RANGERS' GONZALEZ FINALLY ENDS HR DROUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Right fielder Juan Gonzalez issued a warning to
the Rangers' American League opponents.
</P>
<P>
   He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the league's reigning most valuable player, kept the
Rangers atop the AL West with his belated first home run of the
season, a three-run shot that gave the Rangers a 4-2 victory over
the Minnesota Twins last night.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run home run off Mike Lincoln _ on a 1-1, sixth-inning
fastball _ traveled 397 feet and put a smile nearly that length on
Gonzalez's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been trying too hard because I want to help this
team win,'' Gonzalez said, after his first home run since Sept. 22,
1998. ``It's my job to hit home runs and drive runs in. I've been
working hard, but you need to see rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez entered the game hitting .200 (9-for-45) with no
extra-base hits during the previous 12 games and found himself
mired in a season-high, seven-game drought without a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Gonzalez to report to the ballpark for early
batting practice for the first time this season. Nevertheless, he
was in good spirits despite his recent struggles, and handled the
slump ``better than I would have expected,'' manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is a very emotional, up-and-down guy,'' Oates said. ``I'm
not sure how much longer he could have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez almost put the matter to rest during his previous
at-bat with a deep fly ball that center fielder Torii Hunter chased
down on the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just missed hitting three homers tonight,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, though, knew his homerless drought _ which ended with
his 65th at-bat _ would come to a swift conclusion after his
afternoon batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time is coming, and it'll be soon,'' Gonzalez said before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's power _ and 2 1/3 scoreless innings from the bullpen
_ gave right-hander Mark Clark his first victory with the Rangers.
Clark (1-2) pitched a season-high 6 2/3 innings, allowing two runs.
It was only the fifth start of six or more innings by a member of
the Rangers' rotation this season.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, whose sinking, two-seam fastball sets up the rest of his
pitches, induced eight ground-ball outs. He also had a season-high
six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means I'm where I need to be,'' Clark said. ``My sinker
was down, and all of my pitches feed off that pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark surrendered three doubles in the first five innings, but
he stranded the runners on each occasion. ``I'm going to give up
hits,'' Clark said. ``But I've always been able to make good
pitches when I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins rallied with seventh-inning, run-scoring singles by
Hunter and Ron Coomer, but right-hander Tim Crabtree induced an
inning-ending ground ball to strand the tying run at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Munoz also produced a significant,
eighth-inning strikeout of Twins first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz.
That meant closer John Wetteland needed to record only four outs
instead of five for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big strikeout Munoz got on `Alphabet,' '' Oates
said, referring to Mientkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who returned to the lineup after
suffering a slight concussion and bruise to his left cheekbone
Thursday, gave the Rangers an insurance run with his ninth-inning,
bases-empty homer off Mike Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   That kept the Twins from playing for one run in the bottom of
the ninth inning after third baseman Corey Koskie's leadoff single.
But the evening's most significant at-bat belonged to Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he took a deep breath when he touched the plate,''
Oates said, ``and so did the manager.''

DEFENSE CONTINUES TO GIVE STARS' BELFOUR PLENTY OF REST

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ed Belfour wasn't quite as lonely in last night's Game
2 of the opening-round series with Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, he faced 19 shots and made 17 saves. On Wednesday,
Belfour stopped 12 of 13 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like we worked hard,'' Belfour said. ``They put more
pressure on, they were a little more determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Added coach Ken Hitchcock, ``Anytime can into your own building
and in both meetings they don't get 20 shots on goal, you've got to
be pretty happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stopped the first 12 shots he faced last night. When he
makes several stops in a short span of time. the fans begin to
chant ``Ed-eee! Ed-eee!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in the first game we didn't generate anything at
all,'' Edmonton coach Ron Low said. ``Tonight, he made a couple of
really good saves.
</P>
<P>
   After the Oilers tied the game in the second period, the Stars
regrouped to build a 3-1 cushion in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely a confidence-builder for us,'' Belfour said.
``We continued to forecheck hard and scored some goals.''  &LR; name:_
Eric Zarate Laughing it off Stars coach Ken Hitchcock yesterday
laughed off comments from Oilers general manager Glen Sather that
Hitchcock was a ``goon coach'' for sending out Grant Marshall to
take a faceoff in the waning seconds of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall cross-checked Oilers center Todd Marchant on the play
as retaliation for a high stick that had cut the eye of Guy
Carbonneau seconds earlier. Carbonneau also was cross-checked by
Oilers center Doug Weight, who received a five-minute major for
boarding on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock admitted the Stars were upset. ``Guy Carbonneau got
cross-checked from behind and stuck below the eye. And we knew who
cross-checked him from behind and we knew who stuck him,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Sather said he contacted the league to make them aware of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey said he hadn't heard from the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then again, I hadn't heard from them about the boarding call,
either, so maybe they're not considering every item that goes on in
every game.''  &LR; name:_ Mike Heika Move! Hitchcock said Stars players
not only have to be able to handle the hits of the Edmonton Oilers,
they also have to be able to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a player playing against that, your first obligation
is to get out of the way,'' Hitchcock said. ``If you have to stay
with the play to make the right pass, fine. But don't take a hit if
you don't have to.''  &LR; name:_ Mike Heika Facing off Since joining
the Stars on March 23, center Derek Plante has worked tirelessly at
practice on faceoffs. It's paid off, as Plante was 24-12 in the
three games heading into last night. He finished 6-5 in the circle,
but the Stars as a team were a dominant 47-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I know they stress here, so I've really been
working at it,'' Plante said. ``Obviously, it's important in this
system to have control of the puck.''  &LR; name:_ Mike Heika Patience
Hitchcock said he might try rookie defenseman Brad Lukowich in Game
3 in place of veteran Doug Lidster, who has played Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get both Lukowich and \RTony\S Hrkac in at some
time in this series, but I can't say when,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hrkac, who scored 13 goals in the regular season, said it's hard
to be patient. ``But I've done it before,'' he said. \Nname:_ Mike
Heika 2 `doubtful' Oilers play Doubtful just doesn't mean what it
used to.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Edmonton coach Ron Low called injured wingers Bill
Guerin and Josef Beranek ``doubtful,'' both recovered in time to
play in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin skated on the Oilers' first line last night with Rem
Murray and Doug Weight, and Beranek also logged plenty of ice time.
Both missed Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin had a less-than-impressive debut, though.
</P>
<P>
   Referees whistled him for roughing 32 seconds in, although the
Stars were was unable to capitalize with a goal. He bounced back,
getting a couple of good chances on Stars goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Only a sprawling save by Belfour early in the second period
prevented Guerin from scoring.  &LR; name:_ Jennifer Floyd Lineup
changes With Guerin and Beranek coming in, a couple of Oilers had
to be scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Vorobiev was an obvious choice. Ryan Smyth wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Vorobiev injured a groin muscle in Game 1. Smyth simply
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Playing 17:44 minutes for the Oilers on Wednesday, Smyth
registered a single shot.
</P>
<P>
   Low also decided to go with a little bit of experience on
defense, replacing Game 1 starter Sean Brown with Marty McSorley.
He provided plenty of the physical play that Low said he wanted,
including getting called for high-sticking Brett Hull in the second
period.  &LR; name:_ Jennifer Floyd Penalized Don't be surprised if the
guy who opens the door to the penalty box gets on the Oilers'
Christmas card list.
</P>
<P>
   They saw him enough last night to form a lifelong friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The line to the penalty box was long and continuous for the
Oilers. They had six penalties in the first period. There really
wasn't much motivation for stopping either. The Stars were 0-for-5
on power plays. \Nname:_ Jennifer Floyd A real hitter Edmonton
Oilers right winger Mike Grier says he's at his best when he plays
physical. He should feel at home in a series that has totaled 210
hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games, Grier has two blocked shots and has
issued 15 hits, including a game-high 10 last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight we played better because we mixed it up a
little more,'' Grier said. ``This team has to play physical and I
play best when I play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier tied the game at 1-1 at the 8:32 mark of the third period
when he took Todd Marchant's pass and skated from behind the net
and beat Dallas goalie Ed Belfour with a difficult wraparound shot
between the post and Belfour's right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd gave me a tough angle pass and I was just trying to get
it around,'' Grier said.
</P>
<P>
   It's good news for a team that managed 13 shots in the first
game. They increased that total to 19 last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played better and skated better tonight,'' Grier said. ``We
got a lot of good chances but we missed some point blank shots,
too.''  &LR; name:_ Mac Engel Buchberger OK With 8:29 remaining in the
game, Stars' defenseman Shawn Chambers collided with Kelly
Buchberger in the crease and leg whipped the left winger.
Buchberger was down for several minutes before skating off the ice
under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   The incident reaggravated an injury that Buchberger sustained at
yesterday's morning skate when he was hit in the back of his left
knee with a puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit a nerve this morning in practice and the same
place tonight,'' said Buchberger, who played in 10 minutes last
night and had one shot. ``It's OK now and I can play in the next
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger played one more shift after the collision and that
came with less than one minute remaining in the game.  &LR; name:_ Mac

SHERIFF DEPUTIES DEFEND ACTIONS AT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Sheriff's deputies have a simple answer for
those who said they moved too slowly in trying to stop the
Columbine High School massacre.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a Bruce Willis movie,'' said Sgt. Jim Parr,
``where one guy takes on a building of terrorists and in the end
he's coming out smoking cigarettes, cracking jokes and all the bad
guys are dead and all the good guys are alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real life just doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many questioned why it took a police SWAT team more than 20
minutes to enter the building when they knew shots were being fired
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been inside the school instead of outside the
school,'' said Marlene Moore, 23, who visited the shooting scene
Friday. ``They might have been able to save more lives, though it's
hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The carnage at Columbine _ which left 15 dead and 23 wounded in
the worst school shooting in U.S. history _ was every police
officer's worst nightmare: armed suspects who could easily blend in
with students, a massive rescue and evacuation operation and a
school wired with dozens of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had approximately 2,000 kids streaming out the doors, and
the gunmen were kids, so it's not like . . . it was really easy to
separate (them),'' Parr said. ``Supposedly one of them had on a
black trench coat. How long does it take to drop a black trench
coat?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many criticized the police response, including a local
radio host who asked what would have happened if the building had
been filled with unarmed cops.
</P>
<P>
   Others like Montay Singleton, 25, were more direct: ``They
should not have waited. They should have just went straight in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson County deputies said they did.
</P>
<P>
   They said that people watching the tragedy unfold on television
were misled by scenes of the SWAT teams milling around the school.
What the TV cameras didn't show were the officers who were already
in the school while others waited outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said, `Well, we saw pictures of SWAT teams just
standing out here,'' said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. ``Well,
that's very true. There may have been other SWAT teams on the back
side, the front side and SWAT teams waiting for an assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were officers in that school from the minute it went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The first deputy to respond, Neil Gardner, was actually
stationed at the school. Before he knew it, one of the suspects was
firing at him. On a 911 tape released Friday a dispatcher can
clearly be heard saying ``Seventy-one is under fire.'' Gardner's
call number was 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came under fire and exchanged shots with one of the
suspects,'' Parr said. ``The second officer literally arrived two
minutes later. . . . You can't get any faster than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officers arrived and fired back at the suspects, freeing
Gardner to help more students escape.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, officers arrived from three different jurisdictions _
Jefferson County, Denver and Littleton _ and quickly put together a
makeshift SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 20 minutes of the first phone call, the first SWAT team
went through the door,'' Parr said. ``I don't care what city you
live in in this country, if you have a SWAT team at your door
within 20 minutes of the first phone call, you can't beat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said officers had a daunting task: evacuate the building
and rescue the students, while all the while climbing over
explosive devices. Though the first SWAT team entered after 20
minutes, it took heavily armed teams hours of searching to clear
out the sprawling school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't run willy-nilly into the building and shoot the
place up,'' Parr said. ``We're trying to rescue people at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr said the officers had no way to tell victims from
assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we found the suspects deceased, we didn't know where
they were in the building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Preciado, an instructor in SWAT tactics for the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, said the officers were right not
to rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can only react to the information they have and
information comes slowly in that situation,'' said Preciado,
formally second in command of the Los Angeles Police Department
SWAT team. ``It's very easy to Monday-morning quarterback a
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They're damned if they do and damned if they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Preciado said officers use different tactics in different
situations, and using the wrong methods can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a hostage situation. It wasn't a barricade
situation. It seemed like a suicide mission. There's no prevention
for that.'' &QL;

MARINER RELIEF FALLS SHORT AGAIN AS RAYS WIN SIXTH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Ken Griffey Jr. threw three baseballs
over the center-field wall in the eighth inning Friday night at
Tropicana Field. The first two were directed at Raymond, the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays mascot, who was cavorting on the roof of an outfield
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing funny about the last ball Griffey tossed over.
It was Randy Winn's second major league home run, which crashed off
the platform for the center-field TV camera, 425 feet away, and
landed on the field. It sent the Mariners to a 5-4 defeat against
the surging Devil Rays before 20,322.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay is on a six-game winning streak for the first time
ever. The M's have lost three straight and seven of nine. For the
second game in a row, they lost after leading going into the bottom
of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a pair of former starters faltered in relief. After
working out of a jam in the sixth to preserve a 4-2 lead, Ken
Cloude walked the leadoff man in the seventh, then surrendered two
hits and a sacrifice fly to tie the game. John Halama got out of
the seventh, then fell behind Winn and gave up the decisive home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua came on for the fifth straight game to finish up,
and Mark Leiter remains on the disabled list with shoulder
tendinitis. Those two are the lone experienced relievers the M's
have before closer Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: what we have is not the most conducive
formula for winning,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``Outside of
that, sure I expect everyone here to pitch well. It's not going to
happen all the time, but certainly you've got to have pretty
rounded contribution. If you don't, invariably you're going to
(have to use) the same people every day. It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, whose prior relief appearance earned him a win Sunday,
relieved Freddy Garcia, who allowed just two runs but was not
sharp, giving up eight hits and two walks in five innings. Cloude's
walk to Dave Martinez leading off the seventh preceded a double by
Jose Canseco, and soon the lead was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good,'' Cloude said of the walk. ``You don't want
to walk the leadoff hitter in a close ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama, a control pitcher without a dominant fastball, was
disappointed with his command in Winn's at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm jumping ahead (in the count) and we lose, it's easier
to swallow,'' Halama said. ``But when I fall behind, that makes it
tougher because that's not the type of pitcher I am.''
</P>
<P>
   This also is not the type of hitting team the Mariners need to
be. Friday's lineup featured David Segui leading off for the first
time in his career and Edgar Martinez hitting second for the first
time since the '95 playoffs. Griffey hit next, but all of the six
players who followed in the order are hitting below .250, and four
are below .200.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabry had an especially frustrating night. He struck out in
the second, grounded into a double play in the third, lined out
with a man on in the sixth and popped up with two on in the eighth.
The left fielder is in a 1-for-12 slump and batting .186.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he plans to use Butch Huskey more often in left.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry said he's been trying to do too much, which is causing him
to swing at bad pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pressing,'' hitting coach Jesse Barfield said. ``I went 0
for my first 27 the first time I changed teams, with the Yankees
(in 1989). One thing about pressing is you're trying to prove to
your new team that it was worth it to take a chance on you. I can
see the same thing happening with him. He's a totally different
hitter in practice drills than in games. It'll come, because John
is a much better hitter than he's shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to get him on track. There are too many
right-handed pitchers in this league to have a left-hander not
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabry had company in his struggles. After Segui's three-run
homer in the second, the Mariners managed just four singles and had
only one runner past first base.

CARDS' TATIS MAKES HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire has been on his soapbox for the
better part of the year telling us there's more to the St. Louis
Cardinals than just Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Such as? Try Fernando Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis upstaged McGwire's quasi-homecoming by doing something
even baseball's top slugger hasn't accomplished. He became the
first player in major league history to hit two grand slams in the
same inning, powering the Cardinals to a 12-5 win against the
Dodgers in the first of a three-game series Friday at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the third baseman's home runs came in an 11-run third
inning that also saw the ejection of Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
before Tatis struck for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis joins Atlanta's Tony Cloninger as the only National League
players to hit two grand slams in one game. He's the 10th player in
major league history to do it, and first since Baltimore's Chris
Hoiles did it last August.
</P>
<P>
   And both grand slams came off Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park,
who entered a dubious club. The only other pitcher to give up two
grand slams in the same inning is Pittsburgh's Bill Phillips _ and
he did it last century. He was victimized by the Chicago Cubs on
Aug. 16, 1890.
</P>
<P>
   Things could have been worst for Park, who worked out of a
bases-loaded situation in the second inning before Tatis tattooed
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The third inning began with Darren Bragg's single. Edgar
Renteria was hit with a pitch and McGwire delivered a check-swing
base hit through the right side to load the bases with none out.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, 24, who hadn't hit a grand slam in his 1{-year career
with Texas and St. Louis, crushed Park's 2-0 pitch over the
Dodgers' bullpen to give the Cardinals a 4-2 lead. It was his fifth
homer of the season, but the inning continued.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew grounded out before Eli Marrero hit a solo homer. Park
then walked Placido Polanco and Joe McEwing and the bases were
loaded again when St. Louis pitcher Jose Jimenez's sacrifice bunt
was misplayed. Park tried to get the runner at third but the throw
was wide and everyone was safe.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for Johnson's ejection. Bragg grounded to
first, and the Dodgers' Eric Karros threw home for the force out.
But umpire Greg Bonin ruled catcher Todd Hundley's foot wasn't on
the plate as he stretched for the throw, allowing another run to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson immediately left the dugout to argue the call. After an
up-front and personal discussion, Bonin threw Johnson out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pumping up the Dodgers, it served as a minor
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria singled to right to put the Cardinals ahead 7-2, which
set the stage for McGwire. He popped out to right, but it brought
Tatis to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at a borderline 3-1 pitch called a strike, Tatis
hit Park's next pitch over the left-center-field wall as the
Cardinals went ahead 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   The homer also sent Dodgers officials scurrying for the record
books. In addition to other records, the eight RBI in one inning
established a major league record.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 runs the Dodgers allowed represents the most they've
given up in an inning since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles. It
also tied a Cardinals' record for runs in an inning. The
half-inning took 33 minutes and 44 seconds to complete and Park
threw 49 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Park (1-2) allowed all 11 runs _ six earned _ on 11 hits in 22/3
innings. His ERA sailed from an already hearty 5.29 to 7.32.
</P>
<P>
   Park has allowed six homers in four starts this season,
including the three grand slams, after not allowing any home runs
in spring training. In the first 118 games of his career, including
74 starts, Park allowed 48 homers. In 34 starts last season, Park
gave up 16 homers.

ANGELS PRODUCE FAN-TASTIC RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One out away from their sixth consecutive
loss, the Angels got a little help from the Kansas City Royals
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied for three runs with two out in the ninth
inning to beat the Royals 4-2 Friday night in front of 13,209 at
Kauffman Stadium, that total including two apparently inebriated
fans who might have inadvertently helped the Angels pull out the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had runners on first and third in the ninth inning
against Royals closer Jeff Montgomery, but trailed 2-1 and were
down to their final out when two fans _ shirtless in the 50-degree
weather _ ran onto in the outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fans struggled with five security officers, causing a
delay that lasted nearly five minutes. When play resumed,
Montgomery's second pitch to Orlando Palmeiro fell in the dirt and
skipped past catcher Chad Kreuter. Tim Salmon scored from third to
tie the game and Garret Anderson took second.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro followed with a soft liner to left field, and Anderson
slid around Kreuter's tag in a close play at the plate to give the
Angels a 3-2 lead. Randy Velarde added an RBI single to make it
4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his second save.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa (1-0) pitched two-thirds of an inning to get
the win in relief of starter Ken Hill, who had his best outing of
the season _ 71/3 innings, two runs, four hits, seven strikeouts
and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's performance almost went for naught _ until things turned
around in the ninth. But the Angels, who scored their first run of
the night on a passed ball, weren't about to give it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it, no matter what the circumstances,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``We needed it. Hopefully it's
something that kick-starts us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, one win like that can get you on a roll,''
Mo Vaughn said. ``When you're on a four- or five-game losing
streak, the first win is always a climb. A win like that can really
fuel you.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery wouldn't use the delay as an excuse _ ``I don't know
if it affected me or not. I refuse to believe it. I'm not making
any excuses,'' he said _ but Percival felt for his fellow closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had it happen to me a couple times with fans on the
field,'' Percival said. ``Nothing good can come out of it. The fans
look like idiots and it slows down the game. Jeff might've been on
a nice roll, then he's got to stand there for five minutes with no
warmups. It throws you off your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five losses during the Angels' losing streak came
by one run. ``We've been getting some bad breaks but people keep
coming out and playing,'' Anderson said. ``That impresses me.
People still run hard to first, are still backing up throws,
they're still coming out to play and not giving up. Because things
can get sloppy when things aren't going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill gave the Angels a shot in the arm early, retiring the first
eight batters he faced before walking No.9 hitter Rey Sanchez with
two out in the third. Through five innings he allowed just one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney had a two-run single in the sixth off Hill, but
that was the last hit he allowed before being removed with one out
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better, man. Shoot, I feel good,'' he said. ``I
told (catcher Matt) Walbeck we'll just keep slotting that fastball
down and away. We don't have to throw anything else until they make
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with his mechanics in his first two starts,
Hill has found himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mechanics thing ... I was thinking about it too much,''
he said. ``Now I've found where I need to be.''

CLIPPERS SAVE FACE IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ According to unsubstantiated reports, the Great
Clipper in the Sky looked down at the Sports Arena on Friday, shook
his mighty worried head and said this:
</P>
<P>
   ``When are they gonna bulldoze that place?'' He also mumbled
something about how his team's passive-regressive behavior has put
him on the bad side of the Great Bookie in the Sky.
</P>
<P>
   His predicament was created when Clippers coughed up a 19-point,
fourth-quarter lead against the Hall of Fame-heavy Houston Rockets
and dragged an 89-89 tie into overtime in front of 13,855 at the
House of Famine.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips were saved from premature humiliation when Troy Hudson
nailed a 3-pointer with eight seconds to play, and the team
followed up with a 106-101 overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Clips, obviously looking ahead to tonight's
rematch with 8-36 Vancouver, managed to invite their fourth
consecutive defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Like kids picking at their food, the Clippers have developed a
disturbing skill at not finishing. Before the date with Houston,
they had lost three games by a combined nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they led 21-16 after the opening quarter, with Maurice
Taylor (six points) and rookie center Michael Olowokandi (four
points, four rebounds) staying alive in the turf war with Houston's
Springfield-bound frontcourt. Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, who
spent part of the pre-game dispensing a some low-post wisdom to
Olowokandi (they both were born in Lagos, Nigeria), schooled
Olowokandi for eight points in the period.
</P>
<P>
   With customary bench contributions from Lamond Murray (six
points) and Lorenzen Wright (five points, four rebounds), the
Clippers looked feisty in round two.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers built 13-point leads on three occasions, but a late
6-0 run put the Rockets within six (44-38) at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Round three featured Taylor taking Charles Barkley, also on the
Hall of Fame short list, on a one-way trip to the woodshed. Taylor,
loading up with the complete arsenal of spins, jump hooks and
face-up jumpers, scored 12 points in the quarter that ended with a
68-57 Clippers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's watched the home team expected the final period to
get a bit dicey. But Clipper guard Eric Piatkowski's 3-pointer at
10:25 of the fourth quarter pushed the advantage to 73-59. Tyrone
Nesby the Good Clipper in the Sky followed with a swoop and scoop
that he converted while being fouled. His free throw made it 76-69
with 9:47 left.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Clippers decided to fold like a lawn chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets moved to within winning distance with a 12-0, then
pulled to within 86-85 on a 3-pointer by Olajuwon at the 1:03 mark.
Scottie Pippen, Hall of Famer No. 3, drilled a 20-footer to give
Houston the lead with 27 seconds left. Barkley added two free
throws, before Hudson became the hero.

McGWIRE MANIA FRESH IN L.A. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark McGwire and the St. Louis Cardinals came to
town to face the Dodgers Friday night, whereupon McGwire said the
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it upsets me when I read, `Mark McGwire and the St.
Louis Cardinals come to town . . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   His point being that this is and always will be a team game, and
no individual should get so much attention, especially when the
club is playing well, which it certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was Fernando Tatis, the 175-pound third baseman,
who stole the spotlight from a grateful McGwire, recording a
major-league first by hitting two grand slams in an inning in the
Cardinals' run-away victory.
</P>
<P>
   Good, solid, old-school thinking in the team-first speech by
McGwire. But, as it turns out, not the best argument against going
to a baseball game to watch a lone home-run hitter perform.
</P>
<P>
   The best argument is that it's sloppy consumering.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to one of the three Cardinals-Dodgers games this
weekend with the intention of seeing McGwire hit one of this year's
70 home runs, four things can happen, three of them bad.
</P>
<P>
   The game could get rained out.
</P>
<P>
   He could get hurt and miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   He could go 0 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are he (begin ital)won't(end ital) hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The first two almost happened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire sat out Wednesday's game in Milwaukee after leaving the
previous game in the fifth inning with a tight left hamstring.
After a Cardinals off day, and two Friday-afternoon massage
sessions in the clubhouse, it was determined that he'd be able to
play. The crowd of 46,687 wouldn't know for sure until the lineups
were announced at about 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, rain began to fall on Dodger Stadium, delaying
the first pitch by 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was the evening's second wave of showers. The first had
raised the awful prospect that (begin ital)batting practice(end
ital) would be rained out, costing the fans the sport's one sure
thing _ a McGwire BP display.
</P>
<P>
   His BP scoresheet Friday showed 20 swings, five for home runs,
the longest landing in the blue section of the right-center-field
bleachers, maybe 430 feet from home plate. The gathering crowd,
taking advantage of the Dodgers' decision to open the gates half an
hour earlier than normal, cheered the long pop-ups and groaned at
the line drives.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's initial paparazzi count was 12, and that's just the
ones who focused on McGwire when he stood at the first baseman's
position during other Cardinals' BP.
</P>
<P>
   It was insane, but people had this date circled in Cardinals red
since the major-league calendar came out, so what could you do,
tell them to take pictures of Manny Aybar?
</P>
<P>
   This was McGwire's first game at Dodger Stadium since he was an
Oakland Athletic in the 1988 World Series _ he missed the
Cardinals' three-game series here last May _ and presented the
prospect of his first homer here (begin ital)ever(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Los Angeles wasn't the least jaded about
McGwire Mania, even if Cardinals-watchers have noted some
subsidence elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers fans weren't quite as entertained when
the Cardinals jumped on Chan Ho Park for 11 runs in the third
inning, an inning in which McGwire delivered only a check-swing
single and a lazy fly-ball out amid the flashbulbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's you guys,'' McGwire said to reporters before the game,
assigning the blame for making his home runs sound routine. ``The
media have run it up so big that the public comes to expect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a hit every game. You can't get a home run every
day. You guys know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said what happened last year will never happen again in
our lifetimes. It's foolish to even talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has homered in four games this year _ including a
two-homer game at Pittsburgh on April 13. He has also gone hitless
in four games _ an 0 for 4, an 0 for 3, and two 0 for 2s. He missed
a game and a half with the hamstring injury. Rain wiped out a game
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to see a McGwire home run, you'll probably be
disappointed. It's not his fault, it's baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The memorable moments, as Tatis' grand slams demonstrated, will
always be the ones that are unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what stands in the way of McGwire replacing
basketball's Michael Jordan and hockey's Wayne Gretzky as the
greatest draw in sports. Even in subpar performances, Jordan and
Gretzky would do something only they could do. McGwire might hit
five ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   In place of Lawrence Olivier, the crowd gets Don Adams.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire remembers a different sports world, one in which he and
his Claremont friends would go to an Angels or Dodgers game to
watch a particular (begin ital)team(end ital), not the baseball
celebrity of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It loses what baseball's all about,'' McGwire said of the
fixation on one guy. ``It takes 25 guys to win a World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep that in mind tonight, when Fernando Tatis and the St. Louis
Cardinals are in town to face the Dodgers. &QL;

DUCKS DAZED BY DETROIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The 1998-99 season has been a series of lessons and
tests for the Mighty Ducks. After Friday's 5-1 drubbing in Game 2
of their opening-round playoff series with the Detroit Red Wings,
it appears Anaheim is in the middle of its final exam.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks insisted they had learned some valuable lessons from
their Game 1 loss, especially when it came to coping with Detroit's
relentless first-period pressure. Instead, Anaheim simply rolled
over and played dead _ at least for 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at how hard they played ... they played with pride
and we didn't ... We were awful,'' said Teemu Selanne, who scored
Anaheim's lone goal in the third period after Detroit had raced out
to a 5-0 lead less than 30 minutes into the game. ``If you lose and
play a good game, you have to accept it, but we didn't have a
chance tonight. They played harder and smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The purple octopus had barely been lifted back to the Joe Louis
Arena rafters when Brendan Shanahan knocked home a rebound exactly
one minute after the opening faceoff and the rout was on. Shanahan
made it 2-0 at 10:14 and Tomas Holmstrom scored at 13:43 to give
the Red Wings a three-goal advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised at our slow start,'' said Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg. ``But I was even more surprised by Detroit's start. It
was even better tonight and I didn't think that was possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, who led 2-1 after 20 minutes on Wednesday, took a
4-0 advantage into the first intermission Friday when Doug Brown
ripped a shot off Guy Hebert's shoulder with 42.3 seconds left in
the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman completed Detroit's onslaught at 9:42 of the
second when he scored the Red Wings' third power-play goal of the
game. It was Yzerman's fourth goal in two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks appeared dazed, confused and totally outclassed by the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. Detroit outscored,
outskated and outhit Anaheim. Not until 6:13 of the third period,
when Stu Grimson picked up six minutes in roughing penalties for
jousting with Chris Chelios and Darren McCarty, was Anaheim able to
give out some blows rather than absorb them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were one step behind all night,'' said Selanne. ``It's hard
to hit anybody when you're a step late.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's nondescript defensive corps had a night to forget,
especially Ruslan Salei, who was on the ice for all five Detroit
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year defenseman will likely being having nightmares
about Shanahan, as the veteran Detroit winger burned him three
times in the first period alone. Salei was late getting to the net
to prevent Shanahan's first goal, turned the puck over in the
neutral zone on his second goal and was left in Shanahan's wake on
a play that resulted in Holmstrom's goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were outshot 17-8 in the first period, 36-31 in the
game and didn't generate a decent scoring chance until Fredrik
Olausson's backdoor attempt on a power play was smothered by
Detroit goalie Chris Osgood midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are stuck in your zone all game it's tough to play
offense,'' said Anaheim's Paul Kariya, who managed just one shot in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as the Red Wings played in taking a 2-0 series lead,
Kariya said the Ducks simply didn't rise to the challenge in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs you've got to raise your game to another
level,'' he said. ``If they are working 110 percent you've got to
raise your level past that and we're not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks they don't have much time to take their game to new
heights, or learn from their latest lesson. Game 3 is set for the
Pond on Sunday at noon and elimination could come as quickly as
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got about 36 hours to fix things,'' said Selanne. ``It's
our turn to show character and come out hard.''

USC RESERVES STAND OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC concluded its spring practice Friday with a
36-play scrimmage highlighted by the play of the Trojans' reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Junior quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst completed 6 of 7 passes
for 65 yards and one touchdown _ a 24-yard scoring pass to walk-on
Matt Nickels.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Palmer completed 1 of 4 passes for 6 yards. Sophomore
tailback Frank Strong was the leading rusher with 36 yards in six
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the young guys one more shot at it,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``There's been great enthusiasm this spring. We've
got some holes, no question about it, but we'll fill them when new
guys come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Darnell Lacy, linebacker Sultan Abdul-Malik,
defensive end Lonnie Ford and walk-on strong safety John Morgan led
the defense with three tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 focus that needs to be accomplished is the
rebuilding of the premier defense in the Pac-10,'' Hackett said.
``I think we made those strides in the spring, particularly in the
defensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver R. Jay Soward and linebacker Jason Steen did not
participate to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   USC will return to practice Aug. 9, when its freshmen report to
campus. Returning players report Aug. 12 and the Trojans hold their
first practice at UC Irvine on Aug. 13. They will practice two
weeks in Irvine before returning for a final week at USC.

OSUNA FACES ANOTHER TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers need a right-handed set-up man in the
bullpen. Antonio Osuna could be that man, except for one thing:
he's on the disabled list with a bone spur in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   But he feels fine; in fact, he threw nearly 15 pain-free minutes
in the bullpen Friday to test the elbow the Dodgers said needed
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooomph,'' Osuna said when asked if the Dodgers acted too
quickly in putting him on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna's bullpen session was witnessed by pitching coach Charlie
Hough, manager Davey Johnson and physical therapist Pat Screnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the heck out of the ball,'' Johnson said. ``(Today)
is the critical day. If he's not sore (today), he's not going to
have the surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers struggle to find a capable arm in the bullpen,
Osuna must sit back and watch. If he's pain free today, he'll begin
a rehab stint with Single-A San Bernardino on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who complained of elbow soreness Tuesday, had an MRI on
Wednesday which revealed a bone spur in the same location as the
one surgically removed in September. Osuna is eligible to come off
the disabled list May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said there was no
second-guessing in placing Osuna on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got healthy on the drive back. There's a miraculous road
from Dr. (Frank) Jobe's office,'' Malone said. ``An important
element is dependability, and my concern is maybe he goes out and
pitches well but then he can't pitch (later).
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something he can pitch with, but my concern is will
it flare up again. I have to listen to what my doctors tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth activated: The Dodgers activated outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth and sent pitcher Robinson Checo to Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, who pulled his hamstring, batted .364 with a
double and three RBI in a rehab stint with San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely had a good test in San Bernardino,''
Hollandsworth said. ``I had to beat the pitcher to the bag (on one
play) and I stretched it out. Then I went (from) first to third two
pitches later. You can't test it much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth is the Dodgers' fourth outfielder, bumping Jacob
Brumfield to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The demotion of Checo means all three pitchers the Dodgers
acquired from Detroit in exchange for Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas are
at the minor league level. Checo will start for Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to get the ball over, get more sink on it and make
better pitches,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux works out: Auditioning for a spot in the Dodgers bullpen
is 37-year-old right-hander Mike Maddux. Maddux, who declined a
minor league assignment from the Montreal Expos on April 14, threw
a bullpen session and Johnson's report was favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful we'll be able to work something out where we'll
have Maddux available,'' Johnson said. ``We don't have a roster
spot right now, but I don't think he's ready to pitch to major
league batters yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who had a 9.00 ERA in four relief appearances for the
Expos, is 36-34 in his 14-year career. He pitched for the Dodgers
in 1990, going 0-1 with a 6.53 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: The game was delayed 21 minutes because
of rain. . . . Jose Vizcaino started his third straight game at
shortstop. . . . The lineup shuffle continued as Johnson shifted
slumping catcher Todd Hundley to eighth in the batting order. . . .
Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre extended his hitting streak to
11 games with a second-inning single. . . . Cardinals left fielder
Matt Howard left the game in the third inning with a strained left
hamstring.

A BOUT TIME: FENWAY THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Dan Shaughnessy  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, some excitement around Olde Fenway. The Red Sox woke up
Friday night. They hit. They got hit. They tackled and scuffled.
After nine innings of head-hunting, knuckle-wielding, toe-to-toe
action, judge Eugenia Williams had the Sox ahead on points, but the
Indians were up, 7-6, on the left-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   So the slump continues, but at least the Sox put on a show.
Boston baseball fans are starved for excitement, and Fenway's
Friday Night Fights povided a rare thrill in what has become a
dismal and dull start to the 1999 baseball summer.
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that Jaret Wright could have been throwing at
Darren Lewis (Lewis was hit with a curveball) in the fifth inning
of this series opener. Cleveland led, 5-2, the Sox had two on, with
no outs, and Wright needed only three outs to qualify for the win.
He was struggling and couldn't be dumb enough to intentionally load
the bases with a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it was great to see Lewis yell at Wright, then accept
the big righty's challenge to come get him on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said a few words to him,'' said Lewis, who was beaned by
Wright last year in the playoffs. ``You have to make a statement .
. . Obviously, he has a maturity problem.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the scuffle, Wright could be seen pointing to his
own head, as if to remind or threaten Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody to do that, it shows you where his head is,''
said Lewis. ``. . . Hopefully he doesn't get himself or one of his
teammates hurt in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said, ``I can understand why he'd be sensitive, but I
didn't throw at him last year and this pitch was a curveball. I
never try to throw at guys' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Both benches emptied after Lewis charged Wright. Both bullpens,
too. And that was only the beginning. There was another melee
moments later when Virtual Rheal Cormier hit Jim Thome to start the
sixth. The highlights of Bout II were Jason Varitek's takedown of
David Justice (somebody please call Bobby Grier) and Pedro
Martinez's bearhug restraint of an unusually animated Jimy
Williams. Joe Kerrigan, Boston's emotional pitching coach, was held
back by Saturday's starter, Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the heat of the moment,'' said Kerrigan. ``We're
just trying to protect our players. I've told our guys to be
responsible where they throw the ball. We would never tell anybody
to throw at anybody's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier, pleading the typical innocence, said, ``I was just
trying to come inside.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it made for an interesting evening at the Fens. The
Sox have fallen to .500 (8-8), which is unacceptable to a rabid
fandom that pays top prices, but the greatest danger is not the
losing, it's the boredom. Boston baseball fans will forgive losing,
choking, off-field embarrassment, high-ticket prices, and abject
front office buffoonery. Just don't bore them to death.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette has carved out a team that plays in
his image. The Sox, like their leader, too often are methodical,
cautious, and thoroughly unexciting.
</P>
<P>
   Not Friday night. In the spirit of Bruins forward Ken Belanger,
the Sox broke out the bats and the (boxing) gloves.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like another listless night when Jimy's Guys fell
behind, 5-0, in the fourth. Boston had scored only five runs in the
previous five games, and it seemed unlikely that they could match
that total in a single night. But the first fight appeared to spark
the Local Nine.
</P>
<P>
   After Lewis charged the mound (he and Wright were ejected), the
Boston bats came alive. Back-to-back doubles by Nomar Garciaparra
and Reggie Jefferson emptied the bases and produced a 6-5 lead _ a
lead that was wiped out when tough guy Wilfredo Cordero hit a
two-run homer after Cormier hit Thome with the first pitch of the
sixth. Cormier and Thome were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Another loss. But Sox fans were entertained by the two fights,
four ejections, seven hits, and six runs.
</P>
<P>
   Will the brawls ignite this slumbering Sox edition?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if that did happen,'' said Lewis. ``But even
though we have been struggling, we know what we are capable of as a
ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who wouldn't say much about the bench-clearing
incidents, said, ``If in fact this is a spark, you can get
something going. But we're going to hit anyway, I believe.''

CELTICS BEAT BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was the most frightening bit of information to come
out of the United Center Friday night. The Celtics had just
finished dunking on Kornel David's Chicago Bulls, 100-71, when the
truth came out: They were tired.
</P>
<P>
   So tired that they probably would have been better off if they
had taken a nap rather than played basketball. So tired that they
dragged through their morning shootaround, wondering where they
would find the energy to play for 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that scare you? A tired and injured Celtics team _ a
team that went to sleep at 5 a.m. Friday after a hellish night in
the air _ still found a way to sneak out of town with a 29-point
win. Now, this is the section of the story where two avenues will
be provided to you. You can say the Celtics are a resilient bunch
that fights through bruises and lack of rest. Or you can surmise
that the Bulls should actually have ``Rockford'' or ``Yakima'' on
their red-and-black jerseys and embrace the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   As Rick Pitino likes to say, the truth is probably somewhere in
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a victory and this was one of those nights when
everything goes well for one team and nothing does for the other,''
Pitino said.
</P>
<P>
   He was being kind. The truth is that it was never a game. Not
even six minutes into it, the Celtics had a 10-point lead. They led
by 16 after one, 20 by halftime, and 26 after three. The only
mystery was whether rookie David would score 20 points (he did,
which led to tremendous applause from the sellout crowd).
</P>
<P>
   It was a good night for everyone in green, and not just because
it was nearly the five-year anniversary of the Celtics' last win
here (April 22, 1994). It was a self-esteem booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw Damon Jones over there playing some ball,'' Walter
McCarty shouted to the rookie point guard. That's because Jones had
14 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists the day before his 10-day
contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you next year,'' Paul Pierce said to Jones, obviously
teasing him.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Jones will be with the rest of the Celtics Saturday
in Waltham, Mass., watching game tapes. There will be plenty of
good things to see. There were Pierce's 18 points, Ron Mercer's
return to the lineup for the first time in four games, Vitaly
Potapenko's 12 points and 10 rebounds and the performance of a man
Pitino has nicknamed Theo Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to Theo,'' Tony Battie said of the moniker.
``He's a great shot-blocker and has had a great year. But I think I
can be more than that in a couple years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was more than that Friday night. He had 15 points, 12
rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 blocked shots. On one of his blocks, it
looked as if he gulped the ball rather than blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just concentrating on rebounding and playing defense,''
he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the numbers, that's what all the Celtics did. They
outrebounded the Bulls by 10 and held them to 32 percent shooting.
Several of those Bull attempts were hideous airballs. After one of
them, a season ticket-holder sitting in his courtside seat simply
put his hands over his face.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bulls coach Tim Floyd was asked what his goals
were for the team's upcoming road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue to compete,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Continue?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, not only did the Celtics play differently than the
Bulls, they talked a different game when it was over. The Bulls
want to get to Secaucus, N.J., as soon as possible and see where
they will be drafting. Pitino, though, says he wants the season to
be extended. He thinks the Celtics are finally playing good
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing well the past two weeks,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Celtics aren't the first team to feel good after
playing the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's still a mystique here,'' Jones said. ``You look up
and see those six championship banners.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Bulls, the banners couldn't put up any
points.

INDIANS BEAT RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were two WWF-style brawls, a flying karate kick straight
out of a Jackie Chan movie, a pile-driving tackle by a Rambling
Wreck from Georgia Tech, four ejections, and enough f-bombs to earn
this game an NC-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   But a postfight testosterone rush that may have produced the Red
Sox' biggest inning of the season _ their five-run fifth equaled
the number of runs they'd scored in the previous five games
combined _ wore off too soon to satisfy either the Sox or 29,921
ringside observers in Fenway Park Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians emerged from the mud and the blood and the
beer with a 7-6 win over the Sox on a two-run home run by Wilfredo
Cordero, still accorded Public Enemy No. 1 treatment on Yawkey Way
18 months after being banned from Boston in the wake of a domestic
abuse incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just come running in from the bullpen for two fights and
I was trying to calm down, but the adrenaline was flying,'' said
reliever Jim Corsi, who gave up Cordero's game-winner to the
deepest reaches of center field, 420 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to carry over to the game, and I wound up
overthrowing a pitch. I made a bad pitch and he hit it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox lost for the third straight time and seventh time in
the last nine games. Their last hope expired when a deep drive by
rookie Trot Nixon (0 for 23), who was in the game only because
Brawl One principal Darren Lewis had been ejected, died in the
glove of right fielder Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero's sixth-inning home run off Corsi recaptured the lead
for Cleveland after the Sox had battled back, in every sense of the
phrase, from a 5-0 deficit to seize a 6-5 lead in the fifth. The
home run came two pitches after Sox reliever Rheal Cormier was
ejected for plunking Indians strongman Jim Thome in the ribs with a
pitch in apparent retaliation for Indians starter Jaret Wright
hitting Lewis in the fifth. Two batters before, Wright had buzzed
Damon Buford following Troy O'Leary's home run.
</P>
<P>
   While Cormier said he was merely trying to brush back Thome, Sox
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan acknowledged the pitch was no accident.
``You've got to protect your players,'' Kerrigan said. ``I think
Robbie Alomar (the Indians' second baseman) said it best on the
field when he said it's part of the game. I told Robbie we were
just trying to hit (Thome) in the butt. We're not going for the
face or the elbow or the hands. We were trying to hit him in the
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox went from passive to passionate after Lewis, whose quiet
demeanor should never be mistaken for a pacific nature, was hit by
a pitch in the left shoulder by Wright, who already had gone home
run (Troy O'Leary), walk, single to the first three batters in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   There's history here: Lewis was beaned in the left earflap of
his helmet in Game 1 of the playoffs last season by a Wright
fastball that he said caused him hearing problems (``it put an hole
in my eardrum'') more than two weeks after the season ended. When
he was hit again Friday night, Lewis barked at the 23-year-old
pitcher, even though Wright said (and replays confirmed) that the
offending pitch was a breaking ball and came at a most inopportune
time for the Indians, given that it loaded the bases with no one
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' Lewis said, ``but it was too close
to my head. That's all I care about. It was too close to my head. I
was hit in the head last year. There's no room for that. I'm not
going to tolerate it, and I wouldn't expect my teammates to
tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright responded to Lewis's invective by stepping off the mound,
discarding his glove and inviting Lewis for a closer encounter.
Lewis wasted no time accepting the summons, going airborne and
dropping the 6-foot-2-inch, 230-pound pitcher with a two-footed
kick. A general melee ensued, one in which Sox first base coach
Dave Jauss tried to pin Wright while Lewis was restrained from
inflicting further mayhem by the smallest man on the field, third
base coach Wendell Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, meanwhile, was pushed to the other side of the diamond,
from where he yelled at Lewis, pointing at his head, an apparent
promise of future beanballs to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw that,'' Lewis said. ``It didn't scare me, if it
was a threat, and second of all, it showed a lack of maturity as a
ballplayer on his part. He has some things to learn as a pitcher.
And maybe one day he'll pitch in the National League (where
pitchers bat) and someone will stick one in his earhole and he'll
find out what it's really all about.''
</P>
<P>
   When order was restored and Wright and Lewis were ejected, Sox
bats went to work against Indians reliever Steve Karsay. Jose
Offerman lined a drive that was caught in center field by Kenny
Lofton but brought home Buford to make it 5-3. John Valentin, who
had doubled and scored the Sox' first run in the fourth, tapped out
to third, but Nomar Garciaparra, who had just one RBI in his first
nine games, drove a double into left-center to tie the score.
Reggie Jefferson followed with another line-drive double to give
the Red Sox a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thome led off the sixth and didn't seem surprised to find a ball
planted in his ribs by Cormier. He headed for the mound with barely
a look at the little Sox lefty. Thome landed a punch to Cormier's
head, but his momentum carried him past the pitcher and sent him
sprawling in the dirt, where he was jumped on by Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia Tech grad Jason Varitek buried David Justice
with a tackle that would have resulted in a 10-yard loss at Foxboro
Stadium, and something set off both Sox manager Jimy Williams and
Kerrigan. Williams, erupting with a torrent of verbiage, was held
back by the $75 million arm of Pedro Martinez, while Kerrigan was
pulled out of harm's way by Bret Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Williams said when asked what provoked
his anger. But it appeared clear that his anger was directed at
Indians manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   The sides dispersed again, this time absent Thome and Cormier,
who had breezed through the first five batters he faced after
replacing starter Pat Rapp, who had been tattooed for five runs on
seven hits, including home runs by Kenny Lofton (leading off the
game) and Travis Fryman (two-run shot into the Sox bullpen in the
fourth).
</P>
<P>
   But then Corsi threw a ball to Cordero, before the Sox exile put
the Indians back in the lead with his 420-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   The deflated Sox went down in order the next two innings, before
Jefferson doubled to put the tying run aboard with one out in the
eighth. But reliever Paul Shuey struck out Mike Stanley, now 0 for
22, and lefty Paul Assenmacher induced O'Leary to pop to short.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, did the fight accomplish anything?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hurt,'' said Saberhagen, scheduled to pitch
Saturday afternoon. ``It keeps everybody together, fighting for one
thing. If anything, it might have woken us up a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not our solution. Our solution is going out and
playing better baseball.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RANDY HILL &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ According to unsubstantiated reports, the Great
Clipper in the Sky looked down at the Sports Arena on Friday, shook
his mighty-worried head and said: ``When are they gonna bulldoze
that place?''
</P>
<P>
   He also mumbled something about how his team's wacky skill
against good teams has put him on the bad side of the Great Bookie
in the Sky.
</P>
<P>
   His predicament was created when the Clippers coughed up a
19-point, fourth-quarter lead against the Hall of Fame-heavy
Houston Rockets, but managed to prevail 106-101 in overtime with
13,855 witnesses at the House of Famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was beginning to think this was going to be the low point of
our season,'' said Clippers guard Eric Piatkowski, who scored seven
of his 28 points _ his second-highest total for this season _ in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   This momentary brush with gloom was inspired when the 8-35
Clippers folded like lawn chairs in the fourth quarter. With
Scottie Pippen (23 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, six steals)
spearheading Houston's press, the Clippers coughed up nine
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My young guys kept coming over and saying they were getting
hit,'' said Clippers coach Chris Ford of the fourth-quarter horror
show.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford was asked if the officiating had changed to
accommodate the Rockets' collection of Springfield-bound
superstars, he said: ``You watched the game? You make the call; you
pay the fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nah, we'll just solicit a response from Maurice Taylor (29
points, seven in OT), who's going to be rollin' in dough someday:
``Down the stretch, we felt they (Rockets) would get all the calls.
But it worked out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked like a charm, thanks to a cold-blooded 3-point jumper
by Troy Hudson that tied the score at 89 with eight seconds left in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy when the shot went in,'' Hudson said, ``but not
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets (27-16) weren't exactly thrilled about the way
things turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice Taylor was kicking my butt all over the place,'' said
Hall-of-Fame trainee Charles Barkley (24 points, 10 rebounds) of
the young Clipper who took him to the woodshed for a dozen
third-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's third Hall-of-Fame lock, center Hakeem Olajuwon,
scored 18 points and grabbed 12 rebounds but fouled out with 3:15
left in overtime. Clippers rookie center Michael Olowokandi grabbed
a game-high 14 rebounds and scored eight points.

SONICS' PLAYOFF PUSH TRAMPLES GRIZZLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Motivation comes from the schedule when a team
is battling for playoff position this late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   It really should not matter the opponent or arena.
</P>
<P>
   But forgive the Sonics if their intentions were amplified by
their last visit here.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme, the Sonics' 97-84 victory Friday night
against the Vancouver Grizzlies kept them in a tie with the
Sacramento Kings for the eighth and final seed of the Western
Conference playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which snapped a two-game road losing streak, was
even sweeter in front of a sellout crowd of 19,193 at General
Motors Place. The Sonics lost five of seven games after losing here
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are now hoping the exact opposite happens.
</P>
<P>
   It has, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento beat Minnesota Friday night to remain tied with the
Sonics with seven games to play. The Sonics and Kings are just a
half-game behind the seventh-seeded Timberwolves and a game behind
No. 6 Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (April 9 loss against Vancouver) hurt,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said. ``It makes this playoff race tighter than if we
would have been able to pencil that win in. ... Now we need a push.
I figure we need to win four out of our last seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   The next three are the toughest for the Sonics (21-22).
</P>
<P>
   They take on the Western Conference-leading Utah Jazz at the
Delta Center tomorrow. Both teams complete the home-and-home series
by playing again Tuesday at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Sonics must play at Portland the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't count on Sacramento to lose. We have to win games,''
said Sonics forward Don MacLean, who scored 25 points to match Gary
Payton for game-high scoring honors. ``We're going to have to be
consistent if we're going to get on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the Sonics have been taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   Albeit just two games, their victory Friday night came after
crushing Minnesota on Wednesday. Friday night was the first time
the Sonics won consecutive games since March 16.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game where the Sonics displayed the superiority they
insist is there despite the team's record and the loss of All-Star
power forward Vin Baker. The Sonics kept the Grizzlies pinned under
a double-digit lead most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 79-62 heading into the fourth quarter, the Sonics
watched the Grizzlies use an 11-4 run to pull within eight points
with 7:54 to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   That was as close as the Grizzlies would get. Vancouver could
get no closer than 11 points in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing more aggressive and just playing faster,''
Sonics forward Detlef Schrempf said. ``We're moving the ball around
and helping each other out on defense. It's imperative that we keep
playing this way. We've got no low post game so we've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics took a 60-43 lead at halftime after a dominating
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 42-39 with 8:42 left in the period, the Sonics took off on
a 13-5 run. Payton finished off the barrage when he whirled around
Terry Dehere on the baseline. With Dehere planted, Payton scored an
uncontested layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tale of two halves in my mind,'' said Grizzlies coach
Brian Hill. ``The first half we came in with no focus, no defensive
intensity whatsoever. They just ran right by us. In the second half
we really didn't have any answers for Payton or Don MacLean. Both
of them were kind of a thorn in our side all night.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, MacLean helped the team get off to
a fast start. He scored 11 points in the first quarter, which the
Sonics dominated with their energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get easy buckets, we're pretty good,'' MacLean said.
``I just come out aggressive and try to set the tone. When I have
power forwards guarding me, I'm open a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have adapted to the different style they prefer to
play without Baker. The team used its run-and-gun approach to run
past the Grizzlies from the start.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean seems to benefit most from the pace. He made six of his
first 10 shots, and grabbed seven rebounds. MacLean's quick drives
off the dribble epitomized how the Sonics want to play the
remainder of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Hersey Hawkins fed a streaking MacLean for an easy layup that
put the Sonics in front 27-14 late in the first. The period ended
with the Sonics in front 33-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really took care of things in the first half,'' Westphal
said. ``In the second half we didn't shoot the ball as well and
they really worked hard. They didn't quit, but our defense did a
good job and held them in check.''

TATIS MAKES HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They came to see Mark McGwire. They will remember
Fernando Tatis.
</P>
<P>
   He upstaged McGwire's quasi-homecoming by doing something even
baseball's top slugger hasn't accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis became the first player in major-league history to hit two
grand slams in the same inning, powering the Cardinals to a 12-5
win against the Dodgers in the first of a three-game series Friday
night before 46,687 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Tatis' home runs came in an historic 11-run third inning
that also saw the ejection of Dodgers manager Davey Johnson. Tatis'
eight RBI in the inning is a major-league record and the 11 runs is
the most the Dodgers have allowed in an inning since moving from
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable. I still can't believe it,'' said Tatis, St.
Louis' 24-year-old third baseman. ``I said, `Wow.' I didn't think
(the second one) was going to go. It just happened. I thought, `I'm
going to fly.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was no question about either of the homers from the moment
they left his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, who went 2 for 5, joins Atlanta's Tony Cloninger as the
only National League players to hit two grand slams in one game.
He's the 10th player in major-league history to do it, and the
first since Baltimore's Chris Hoiles did it last August.
</P>
<P>
   Both grand slams came off Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park, who
entered a dubious club. The only other pitcher to give up two grand
slams in the same inning is Pittsburgh's Bill Phillips _ and he did
it last century. He was victimized by the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 16,
1890.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a terrible day,'' Park said. ``I was just
concentrating on studying McGwire a lot before the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Park limited McGwire to a single in five at-bats. Next time
he'll remember the guy who protects McGwire in the Cardinals'
order.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis' first homer came on a 2-0 fastball over the middle of the
plate, which he belted over the Dodgers' bullpen to give the
Cardinals a 4-2 lead. It was his fifth homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis capped the inning _ and Park's night _ when he hit a 3-2
curveball over the fence in left center for his second grand slam
as St. Louis took an 11-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was ugly,'' Johnson said. ``Chan Ho looks like he's
pitching defensive. He's been real tentative about going at people.
He cut off some fastballs and threw some fastballs in the dirt.
It's a different pitcher than I saw in the spring when he went
after guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson witnessed the first homer from the bench, but he wasn't
in the dugout for the second one.
</P>
<P>
   He was ejected after arguing with umpire Greg Bonin after Bonin
ruled Todd Hundley's foot wasn't on the plate for a force out on
Eric Karros' throw home. It allowed Placido Polanco to score and
gave the Cardinals a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see he was out,'' Johnson said. ``I had a better view
than the umpire. I thought it was a bad call. Things weren't going
any good and I don't like to see a simple play missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably for the best, Johnson missed one of the worst innings
in Dodgers history. The half-inning took 33 minutes and 44 seconds
to complete, during which Park threw 49 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Park (1-2) allowed all 11 runs _ six earned _ on eight hits in
22/3 innings. His ERA sailed from an already hearty 5.29 to 7.32.
Park has allowed six homers, including three grand slams, in 192/3
innings this season. He allowed 16 home runs in 2202/3 innings last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to pitch from behind in the count. That's a big
part of it,'' Hundley said. ``It seemed like he was trying to hit
his spots instead of being the power pitcher he is and letting it
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game Michael Lerner, a Simi Valley resident, presented
Tatis with the second home run ball. Lerner said he bought it from
a kid in the stands for $80. In exchange, Tatis gave him an
autographed jersey and six autographed baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ball belongs in the Hall of Fame,'' Lerner told Tatis.
``I hope they'll send it there.''

CALIFORNIA SPEEDWAY GEARS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ A plot of 529 acres, once the heart of San Bernardino
County's industrial base, will be transformed into a virtual city
by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it Penskeville or Speed City. However, all refer to
the grounds as the California Speedway, the benchmark for racing
facilities not only in the United States, but throughout the world.
It's expected that nearly a quarter-million people will spend some
time on the speedway grounds for this week's NASCAR racing
tripleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Activity begins Thursday and culminates next Sunday with the
third annual NAPA California 500, the Winston Cup Series event that
will draw more than 115,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Putting stock cars on the two-mile speedway is just part of the
challenge for the California Speedway management team. In fact, the
races are perhaps less taxing than most responsibilities. As with
any city, temporary or not, there are issues such as police and
security, fire safety, medical facilities, utilities,
entertainment, waste management, transportation and life's
essentials, food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Atherton, the speedway president and general manager, can
be called the mayor of the instant city, and it's not a role he
takes lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we posted a sign on Cherry Avenue saying, `Welcome to the
California Speedway, Population 200,000,' we would be committing
ourselves to meeting or exceeding an expectation of civic
responsibility that comes with being a city,'' said Atherton, who
will preside over his first event at the speedway. ``That is
precisely what we're trying to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the goal set by Roger Penske from the time he first
eyed the abandoned Kaiser Steel property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid the rusting and decaying pieces of what used to be a
steel mill, and a backdrop that resembled Hiroshima, he had a
vision of a race track,'' said Les Richter, the Southern California
racing icon who would help build the speedway for Penske and serve
as executive vice president for Penske Motorsports. ``He also knew
how he wanted to treat the people who would come.''
</P>
<P>
   The speedway is capable of providing virtually every need a fan
might have for five days. While the majority of the day's crowd
will leave at the end of the racing day, as many as 20,000 will
camp out for the duration in the 2,000 spots for recreational
vehicles and trailers. It's this group that benefits most in terms
of security and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our role so seriously that in many cases, the people
are serviced at a higher level than in their own homes by some
cities or counties,'' said Atherton. ``For the guests in the
infield, it's the equivalent of going to sleep with a policeman,
fireman and ambulance all parked in the driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the speedway is ready to respond to any situation
within its borders. In two years of operation, the track has
experienced one death (heart attack) and transported an average of
12 cases per weekend to area hospitals for more advanced treatment,
mostly heat-related medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual amenities at the track, fans can expect
things like a concert by rock star Chris Isaak, fireworks,
interactive displays, bands, magicians and mimes.
</P>
<P>
   IWERKS will have NASCAR simulators for children and adults,
while DeWalt will allow fans to perform pit stop duties. If
baseball is preferred, the Anaheim Angels will provide batting and
pitching cages along with the opportunity to make a play-by-play
tape of Jim Edmonds' famous catch in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In the air, warbirds from the Chino Planes of Fame Museum will
perform flybys, as well the F-16s of the 144th Fighter Wing
stationed at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   As with any city of this size, there are various degrees of
comfort. Those in simple tents in the infield will not get the
guest services provided to those in custom-built motorhomes worth
$250,000 and more. The speedway offers newspaper and pizza delivery
for infield RVs, along with a special playground donated by Mattel.
It's such guest services that set the Fontana facility apart from
other tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the innovator for many new ideas translated to
other Penske tracks,'' said Atherton, ``as well as other tracks.
For the VIP motorhomes, our concierge services are akin to a
five-star hotel.''

for Sunday, April 25, will move Saturday.

<P>
   On the section dress page:
</P>
<P>
   WARNING-SIGNS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ The boy stalking victims
through a video dungeon in the game Doom, or laughing at the
slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' might
well be the next person to shoot up a school in some polished
American suburb. But then again, he might be a quiet scholar with
an odd side. How to tell the difference is one of the more
difficult challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado. By
Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEE-CRISIS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Yet another specter is
haunting Europe, and not just Europe this time: the specter of the
permanent refugee. With hundreds of thousands of Albanians uprooted
in Kosovo and spilling across the borders of Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro, some diplomats see the crisis as a defining moment in
how the world thinks about the temporarily and permanently
displaced. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HUMOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today, alas, the
pronouncements of politicians seem more humorless than ever. That's
probably because, in this era of heightened sensitivities and
ubiquitous cameras, an off-the-cuff quip can bring you a world of
grief (though politicians' private peccadillos often provide laughs
enough). So whether you're a stolid Al Gore or a relentlessly sunny
Elizabeth Dole, it's best to stay on message while minimizing the
ad-libs. By John Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY-ETHICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Placebo surgery is on the
rise, to the horror of some doctors who say it is immoral and to
the delight of others who say it is time to apply the same rigorous
scientific standards to surgery as to the rest of the medical
profession. And with it comes a host of thorny questions. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREME-MUSIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ The killing spree by two young
fans of computerized gladiator matches and gut-wrenching industrial
rock last week in Littleton, Colo., was a calamity measured in
lives lost and damaged. But the tragedy at Columbine High School
also marked yet another battle over the meanings and effects of
youth culture. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   PROFILING-REVIEW (Washington) _ The spring day was bright and
sunny enough for sunglasses, yet cool enough to require a
sweatshirt and baggy sweat pants. As I walked along a busy street
in the predominantly white northwest Washington neighborhood where
I lived, I hardly thought that my clothing or, more important, my
dark skin would attract the attention of the police. But sure
enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser from the
Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer jumped
out and demanded to know what I was doing there. By Steven A.
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-REVIEW (New Delhi, India) _ The political turmoil that has
seen five governments come tumbling down here in just six years is
not merely the result of cantankerous rivalries among the country's
political parties or the often venal, self-serving antics of its
politicians. Even more crucial are profound political changes
taking place in hundreds of thousands of villages where most of the
nation's 980 million people live and vote. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-UNITY-REVIEW (London) _ For most of the half-century it is
celebrating in Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has
been rooted in the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety
of the West against the East, to forge a common defense of
democracy against tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War
III. But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat
mission in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their
neighbors are discovering that war is not just about the grand
design of thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and
political line calls. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-BOMBING-REVIEW (Washington) _ As commander in chief during
the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson insisted on having almost absolute
control over what to bomb and when to bomb it. But now, with NATO
unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an alliance-full of
political leaders is setting its own parameters for strikes. And
that has bogged down the military task of choosing targets _
complicated enough with NATO's multinational command structure _ in
a morass of competing political aims. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-IMAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ What journalists see of the air
war in Yugoslavia is what the NATO allies want them to see. What
they see of the destruction of Kosovo is what the Yugoslavs want
them to see. Only on the borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the
vast vistas of refugee misery, do journalists have relatively free
access and some ability to cross-check information. By Felicity
Barringer.

   INDIA-REVIEW (New Delhi, India) _ The political turmoil that has
seen five governments come tumbling down here in just six years is
not merely the result of cantankerous rivalries among the country's
political parties or the often venal, self-serving antics of its
politicians. Even more crucial are profound political changes
taking place in hundreds of thousands of villages where most of the
nation's 980 million people live and vote. By Celia W. Dugger.

<P>
   NATO-UNITY-REVIEW (London) _ For most of the half-century it is
celebrating in Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has
been rooted in the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety
of the West against the East, to forge a common defense of
democracy against tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War
III. But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat
mission in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their
neighbors are discovering that war is not just about the grand
design of thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and
political line calls. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-BOMBING-REVIEW (Washington) _ As commander in chief during
the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson insisted on having almost absolute
control over what to bomb and when to bomb it. But now, with NATO
unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an alliance-full of
political leaders is setting its own parameters for strikes. And
that has bogged down the military task of choosing targets _
complicated enough with NATO's multinational command structure _ in
a morass of competing political aims. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-IMAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ What journalists see of the air
war in Yugoslavia is what the NATO allies want them to see. What
they see of the destruction of Kosovo is what the Yugoslavs want
them to see. Only on the borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the
vast vistas of refugee misery, do journalists have relatively free
access and some ability to cross-check information. By Felicity
Barringer.

DISCOVERY SUGGESTS HUMANS ARE A BIT NEANDERTHAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill., Mich., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neanderthals and modern humans not only coexisted for thousands
of years long ago, as anthropologists have established, but now
their little secret is out: They also cohabited.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the interpretation being made by
paleontologists who have examined the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a
young boy discovered recently in a shallow grave in Portugal. Bred
in the boy's bones seemed to be a genetic heritage part
Neanderthal, part early modern Homo sapiens. He was a hybrid, they
concluded, and the first strong physical evidence of interbreeding
between the groups in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This skeleton demonstrates that early modern humans and
Neanderthals are not all that different,'' said Dr. Erik Trinkaus,
a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ``They
intermixed, interbred and produced offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some scientists disputed the interpretation, other
scientists who study human origins said in interviews last week
that the findings were intriguing, probably correct and certain to
provoke debate and challenges to conventional thinking about the
place of Neanderthals in human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthals and modern humans presumably were more alike than
different, not a separate species or even subspecies, but two
groups who viewed each other as appropriate mates.
</P>
<P>
   Recent DNA research had appeared to show that the two people
were unrelated and had not interbred. Neanderthals lived in Europe
and western Asia from 300,000 years ago until the last of them
disappeared on the Iberian peninsula about 28,000 years ago. In the
prevailing theory today, modern humans arose in Africa less than
200,000 years ago and appeared in great numbers in Europe, starting
about 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery could, at long last, resolve the question of
what happened to the Neanderthals, the stereotypical stocky,
heavy-browed ``cave men.'' They may have merged with modern humans,
called Cro-Magnons, who appear to have arrived in Europe with a
superior tool culture. In that case, some Neanderthal genes survive
in most Europeans and people of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton of the boy, buried with strings of marine shells
and painted with red ocher, was uncovered in December by Portuguese
archaeologists led by Dr. Joao Zilhao, director of the Institute of
Archaeology in Lisbon. The discovery was made in the Lapedo Valley
near Leiria, 90 miles north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the potential significance, Zilhao called in Trinkaus,
an authority on Neanderthal paleontology, who went to Lisbon and
examined the bones in January.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was about 4 years old at death, had the prominent
chin and other facial characteristics of a fully modern human. But
his stocky body and short legs were those of a Neanderthal.
Trinkaus compared the limb proportions with those of Neanderthal
skeletons, including some children. He said he was then sure of the
skeleton's implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex mosaic, which is what you get when you have a
hybrid,'' Trinkaus said. ``This is the first definite evidence of
admixture between Neanderthals and European early modern humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of the skeleton, determined by radiocarbon dating,
showed that full Neanderthals had apparently been extinct for at
least 4,000 years before the boy was born. ``This is no love
child,'' Trinkaus said, meaning that this was not evidence of a
rare mating but a descendant of generations of
Neanderthal-Cro-Magnon hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus and Zilhao have completed a more detailed scientific
report to be published soon in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. DNA tests on the skeleton have not yet been
done.
</P>
<P>
   Other Neanderthal specialists reacted favorably to the
discovery. Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University in De
Kalb called it ``very convincing and absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that he had come upon other skeletal material in
central Europe that raised the possibility of interbreeding between
the groups. Though most scholars in the field will probably accept
the possibility of interbreeding, he said, a significant number
will probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The more ardent exponents of the out-of-Africa hypothesis of
modern human origins may be holdouts. They have argued that early
modern humans all emerged from Africa and wiped out the Neanderthal
population in Europe. Whether the relationship was fraternal or
genocidal has been much debated. But many have argued that the two
groups were distinct, with humans displacing and probably
slaughtering their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chris Stringer, an expert on Neanderthals at the Museum of
Natural History in London, who is a leader of the out-of-Africa
forces, said that he was willing to consider the Portuguese
findings with an open mind. He told The Associated Press that the
current evidence was not sufficient to convince him of Trinkaus'
hybrid interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative theory, known as regional continuity, holds that
the earliest human ancestors arose in Africa and spread around the
world more than a million years ago. Modern humans then emerged in
different regions through separate evolution and interbreeding. A
leading advocate of this theory is Dr. Milford Wolpoff, a
paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This find should be devastating to the out-of-Africa people,''
Wolpoff said. ``It shows their theory doesn't work, at least in
Europe. And it shows that fundamentally, Neanderthals are the same
species we are and they contributed their genes to European
ancestry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By now, scientists said, only a small fraction of Neanderthal
genes have survived, the European gene pool having been further
mixed through migrations during the spread of agriculture and
invasions from the east.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolpoff cautioned that it would take more than one skeleton
to tell the effects of interbreeding apart from ordinary
evolutionary changes, the result of genes modifying in response to
environmental stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Mann, a specialist in human evolution at the University
of Pennsylvania, called the Portuguese hybrid skeleton ``some of
the most important data we ever got about Neanderthals in human
evolution,'' but said he was not sure that interbreeding had been
established.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus said the discovery ``refutes strict replacement models
of modern human origins'' and also seemed to undermine
interpretations of recent DNA research. Two years ago, Dr. Svante
Paabo of the University of Munich in Germany, reported that a study
of the genetic material DNA from Neanderthal remains and living
humans indicated that Neanderthals did not interbreed with the
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, scientists said the DNA results reinforced the idea
that Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans. If
the new findings are correct, though, the two groups were probably
more like different races of the same species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Templeton, an evolutionary geneticist at Washington
University, said that some hybridization occurs without the effects
showing up, for example, in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed only
through the mother. ``But if you look deep enough in evolutionary
time, you find a lot of interbreeding,'' Templeton said. ``That is
what humanity is all about: We interbreed a lot.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andrew Ramirez was watching a news program when
Max, his son's dog, began barking in the night. Hours before, he
had heard the latest on Kosovo, that three American soldiers were
missing in Macedonia, but had not connected them to his own quiet
life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an Army official stood outside the fence around Ramirez's
garden, locked so long he no longer had the key, and flashed a
lantern. His message was wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to notify you that your son Andrew is missing in
action with two other soldiers,'' the stranger said. It was not
clear whether his boy was alive or dead. ``I said, `Thank you very
much,' '' Ramirez, a 55-year-old shipping clerk, recalled, looking
away. ``Then I went inside and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Ramirez's estranged wife, Vivian, had been unable
to shake off a foreboding that something had gone wrong for her
son, part of the NATO forces in Macedonia on the border with NATO's
enemy Yugoslavia. When she got the call to return home from her job
at K-Mart, she knew. ``Is it Andy?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   And Celia Sanchez, the young soldier's grandmother, thought it
was some twisted April Fool's prank when told the next day that
``Little Andy,'' as his family calls him, had been taken prisoner
by the Serbs. Her daughter had to insist, breaking through a
grandmother's desperate wish that it somehow was not true.
</P>
<P>
   In the three weeks since the bruised faces of Ramirez, 24, Sgt.
Christopher Stone, 25, of Smith's Creek, Mich., and Specialist
Steven Gonzalez, 21, of Huntsville, Texas, first filled television
screens across the United States, the hopes for an early release of
the Americans, captured on March 31, have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramirezes, who were in the middle of their own emotional
dramas when crisis hit, have banded together in new constellations
while each member struggles against an uncertainty that now seems
as if it will last as long as the war.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO celebrates its 50th anniversary this weekend,
unofficially debating whether to send ground troops to Yugoslavia,
President Clinton has made it clear that however it is fought, the
conflict in the Balkans is unlikely to end quickly. Even now, as
many as 33,000 U.S. reservists are gearing up to join the war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Since capturing the Americans, Belgrade has turned down requests
from the International Red Cross to see them, in violation of the
Geneva Convention that is supposed to govern the conduct of war. It
has also turned away Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic told an
American television station that he would allow the Red Cross to
visit the prisoners. Nadine Ramirez, Andrew's older sister, said
she had not heard about the promise. ``We'll wait and see,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Red Cross announced in Geneva that its director
would meet with Milosevic in Belgrade on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade authorities at first accused the Americans of
spying, which carries a 16-year sentence in Yugoslavia, and said
last weekend that they had separated the three, a move that makes a
commando operation to free them _ always an unlikely and risky
enterprise _ ever more remote.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery surrounding the conditions in which the soldiers are
being held is heightening the anguish of the Ramirezes, whose
letters to Andrew remain undelivered.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez, a librarian at a local elementary school who
moonlights at the nearby K-Mart, has overcome her natural shyness,
appearing at numerous vigils for her son. She says she struggles to
build a wall between herself and dark thoughts to get her through
each day. But sometimes all that protects her mother's heart is a
thin shell of denial.
</P>
<P>
   She said she tries not to imagine the conditions of her son's
captivity, but her words suggest she does not always succeed. ``I
don't want to close my eyes and picture him in a dark room, maybe
all dirty or hurt or hungry,'' Mrs. Ramirez said. ``Or what's
around him. The sounds around him, also. I try not to think that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Andy'' Ramirez enlisted in 1992, as his brother Steven
had before him. At that time, ``there was no war, no threat of
anything,'' said his mother, who backed his decision. If he had
come up with the idea of joining now, Mrs. Ramirez joked in an
interview at home with her other children, ``we would have tied him
up and put him in the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez planned to leave the Army in May 2000 and join the
Police Department like Steven, 32, who is a detective. Their
sister, Nadine, 34, said Andrew saw the Army as a step toward a
good job, and would probably not have joined to fight a war.
Another relative, who requested anonymity, said that Andrew might
have joined up to fight, ``but would not make a big thing out of
it.''

<P>
   Ramirez's separated parents are both private people,
unaccustomed to publicity and the embrace of outsiders. And each
has handled the attention differently.
</P>
<P>
   As neighbors and well-wishers flocked outside his gate, lighting
candles and offering prayers for his son, the senior Ramirez stayed
inside, the blinds closed tight. He said he was trying to sleep,
for he gets up at 4 to catch the bus to work and has not missed a
day since his son's capture. ``I really don't want to deal with
it,'' he said. ``I'm not geared to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   A stranger might accuse Ramirez, who has not appeared at the
rallies for his son, of indifference, but would be profoundly
mistaken: He would later tell a longtime neighbor, Amparo Lopez,
that he didn't toss out the flowers left on the sidewalk, though
they began dying, so as not to hurt the feelings of the visitors
who troubled to leave them there.
</P>
<P>
   And though he shields himself behind jokes and a gravelly
exterior, saying that he will greet his son, once he is freed, with
the bill for seven years' of tending Max, worry lurks just beneath
the surface. Studying a stack of pictures of his son gleefully
parachuting from an airplane, Ramirez said: ``Look at his face, not
his build. To me, he's still a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the family is fathoming new meaning in the videos
released early in the American soldiers' captivity, shown over and
over. Ramirez wonders if an image that shows his son blinking
frequently is conveying a message, perhaps in Morse code, that he
is suffering. These days, ``life is very cheap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ramirez tried to sidestep the avalanche of attention that
rolled over her family at a time when they felt drained and
frightened. At one point, Steven Ramirez held a news conference at
the Police Department simply to tell reporters to stay away from
the family.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Ramirez surprised her children by swallowing her sorrow
and attending the first candlelight vigil days after her son's
capture. The children did not want her to attend, warning of the
certain media onslaught. But she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to thank all those people who had supported us,'' she
said, ``and the only way I could reach them all was through
television.''
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Mrs. Ramirez, Toby Viera, said, ``Her greatest
fear is that as this drags on, people will forget about Andy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Viera, 58, is the godmother of Andrew Ramirez and said she
was proud that he was supporting the effort to end the killing in
the Balkans. ``We should do everything we can to stop the killing
of those poor innocent people,'' she said. ``Otherwise, it'll be
just like what happened to the Jews in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Little Andy made it very personal for me,'' she said.
``He's warm and loving, but also very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's aunt, Loretta Magdaleno, agreed. ``I think Andy had a
job to do, and he was very disciplined,'' she said. ``In my mind,
that's what Andy would be saying: He was doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   For Nadine, his sister, seeing so many forgotten relatives and
strangers among the hundreds of people who showed up at that first
rally made the reality of his plight sink in. Since then, she has
stood beside her mother at a dozen or so rallies, and she is the
one who watches for news of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, who shares his father's reserve, has avoided the stage
at some of the vigils. As his mother and sister talked with a
reporter, he joined in but asked not to be quoted. But he has
stepped in to support his father and become a bridge holding his
family together.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Ramirez family has talked by phone with the
relatives of the two other American prisoners. They gave one
another solace and fed shared hopes of a meeting soon in Germany
when their boys are free. And Mrs. Ramirez found strength in a call
from President Clinton on Easter Sunday, brushing her hair
beforehand, as if the president were going to walk through the door
instead of phoning her.
</P>
<P>
   On the dining room table are tokens of support from strangers:
purple heather from Ireland, dirt from a holy site at Chemayo,
N.M., a feather sent from East Los Angeles, a teddy bear carrying a
rosary, and a flag that a 4-year-old boy had given Mrs. Ramirez at
a rally in her neighborhood two nights before.
</P>
<P>
   Now the family has hunkered down for the long wait. They are
considering speaking to counselors who can help them prepare for
Andrew's eventual return. Nadine said she prays that her brother
will ``come home safe, and that he's the same as he was before,
that he can laugh about this later on, and just say, `It
happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother suggests that may be too much to ask. The most
important thing is that her son, once free, will be ``able to talk
about it,'' she said. ``Just talk.''

<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ Across the street from First Parish Church
lies this town's historic Green, where the clash between Colonial
militiamen and British soldiers 224 years ago ignited the upheaval
that led to American independence.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, within the picturesque church, a symbolic moment in a
revolution of a cultural kind will take place in this community
just west of Boston. Rebecca Cohen will be ordained a minister in
the Unitarian Universalist church that her mother, the Rev. Helen
Lutton Cohen, serves as pastor. Afterward, the younger Ms. Cohen
will seek her own pulpit in the small Unitarian Universalist
Association, which has about 200,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   For one generation in a family to follow another into the
ministry is an old story, which can be told with reference to men
like Cotton Mather, Jonathan Edwards and Martin Luther King Jr.,
sons following their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   But for a daughter to follow her mother in this way represents a
new trend emerging in American religion, and striking evidence that
the movement of women into positions of religious authority is
entering its second generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a huge wave swept over,'' Helen Cohen said
recently of the influx of women into the ministry since she
undertook theological studies two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics suggest that the wave is still building. The number
of women studying in Christian seminaries for a master of divinity
degree increased eight-fold since 1972, to 8,203 students in 1997,
the last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Among denominations, the Episcopal Church did not ordain women
as priests until 1977. But now women make up nearly one in seven of
its clergy members. They also make up about one in six pastors in
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, formed from the merger
of three churches, none of which ordained women before 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Theological Seminary's rabbinical school, which
serves Judaism's Conservative movement, graduated only men until
1986. Women now make up one-third of its enrollment. Reform Jews
ordained their first woman in 1972. Since then, 29 percent of those
ordained for the Reform rabbinate have been women (a proportion
that has risen to 45 percent in the 1990s).
</P>
<P>
   But it is within the Unitarian Universalist Association,
historically the nation's most liberal religious body, that the
process has moved the furthest. The association will soon announce
that for the first time, women outnumber men among its active
clergy members, making up 51 percent of the total, up from fewer
than 3 percent in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect feminism's influence on organized religion,
a process that has had visually arresting moments.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the world's Anglican bishops gathered as an
entirely male body in their once-a-decade Lambeth Conference. But
when they met in July 1998 in Canterbury, England, the bishops
included 11 women, who gathered for a group photograph on a sunny
hillside with cathedral spires in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   But the entry of women into leadership positions has sharpened
differences among religious groups. Women's ordination separates
mainline Protestant denominations from many of the evangelical
churches, and from the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox
Churches, whose priesthoods are restricted to men. Women serving as
rabbis are a dividing line between Orthodox Jews, which do not
allow them, and the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative
movements.
</P>
<P>
   In the denominations that ordain them, women still encounter
significant barriers. A recent survey of female clergy members in
15 denominations found women to be paid less on average than men,
even when the levels of education and experience were similar.
</P>
<P>
   Adair Lummis, a professor of the sociology of religion at the
Hartford Seminary and a co-author of the study ``Women Clergy: An
Uphill Calling'' (Westminster/John Knox, 1998), said: ``Of the
better positions, I still think men are being called more than
women. I mean, the bigger churches with the higher salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Paula D. Nesbitt, director of the Carl M.
Williams Institute for Ethics and Values at the University of
Denver, said that while some women had reached senior church
positions, others had found openings only in part-time or
associate-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is for full-time, viable employment,'' said Ms.
Nesbitt, the author of ``The Feminization of the Clergy in
America'' (Oxford, 1997). Still, she said, she expected the new
generation of ordained women to find inspiration in those who had
attained prominent positions.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing their paths to the ministry, Helen Cohen, 56,
and Rebecca Cohen, 27, speak from the perspectives of different
generations.
</P>
<P>
   As an adolescent in a Unitarian congregation in Cincinnati in
the 1950s, a congregation with a male pastor, Helen Cohen felt that
she wanted to be a minister. But the idea seemed ``unthinkable,''
she said, and she told no one.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she embarked on an academic career, obtaining a
doctorate in old English literature and teaching, until she left to
devote herself to rearing the two daughters she had with her
husband, Don, a business writer. She also became involved in a
small Unitarian congregation, which rekindled her old sense of
calling. ``I didn't see a woman minister until I was 34,'' she
said, when she had one as a professor at the Harvard Divinity
School.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1980, she was hired by the Lexington church,
its first female pastor in a succession of ministers stretching
back to 1691, among them John Hancock, whose grandson and namesake
signed the Declaration of Independence. Ms. Cohen was also one of
only two women in the 20-member Lexington Clergy Association, an
interfaith body. (Its membership is now one-third female and she is
president.)
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter's experience has been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, most of the ministers I knew were
women,'' Rebecca Cohen said. ``I never had to wonder, could women
be ministers?''
</P>
<P>
   Her challenge, she said, came when members of First Parish asked
her whether she planned to follow in her mother's footsteps. She
told them no.
</P>
<P>
   But she found the ministry attractive, long before she entered
the Meadville-Lombard Theological School, in Chicago. ``Part of it
was how fulfilling it seemed to be for mom,'' she said. ``Watching
her, it seemed like important work.''
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, she said, did she learn that her mother had felt
that it was a struggle to be among the first generation of women in
church leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Helen Cohen said she has wrestled with the
question of when she, as a woman, should speak up and how loudly.
She confessed to feeling some envy at her daughter's sense of
assurance about the roles open to women.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Cohen's ordination service will include a traditional
feature, when a senior clergy member offers her a handclasp, ``the
right hand of fellowship,'' signaling her entry into the community
of ordained ministers. Daughter asked mother to take that part.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been my main model and inspiration,'' Rebecca Cohen
said. ``And I have felt very welcomed into the ministry by her.''

   &UR;  &LR; LONDON _ For most of the half-century it is celebrating in
Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has been rooted in
the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety of the West
against the East, to forge a common defense of democracy against
tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War III.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat mission
in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their neighbors are
discovering that war is not just about the grand design of
thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and political line
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is more than just America's war or even NATO's war. It is
an ominous prism refracting the national interests of the allies
(and their neighbors) from the most sweeping political
considerations to the most mundane. For each of the nations
involved, the conflict has shades of meaning and ambiguity,
revealing the alliance on its 50th anniversary as an assembly of
agendas in uneasy cohesion _ and raising the question of whether it
can survive an escalation into a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, matters as basic as river traffic on the
Danube halted by NATO's bombing of bridges, or faltering tourism in
Greece and Croatia _ consequences of war that show that the
conflict's price will be paid in many coinages, from Budapest,
Hungary, to Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast those economic consequences with much bigger, almost
metaphysical themes: Germany's fraught dilemma between avoiding
embroilment in war while joining in the common campaign against
horrors all too familiar from its own past. There is also the
perennial fear in Europe _ in Italy, Germany and France in
particular _ of being overwhelmed by unwelcome refugees whose
presence, political leaders fear, would feed domestic tensions and
right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   And consider the dynamics of those lands _ Italy and Greece _
that provide the ports and airfields for a war their people and
political elite do not universally approve. Then there is raw,
geopolitical ambition _ British in particular, but French, too _ to
show military leadership in a continent more used to Uncle Sam's
coattails, and to promote the idea of European cohesion, absent for
much of this decade's Balkan agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the potential for division, the unity has been quite
amazing,'' said Gordon Adams, deputy director of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
</P>
<P>
   To say that NATO's members come to the table with varied baggage
_ both from their histories and from more modern times _ is an
understatement. And it is difficult to categorize their concerns
without oversimplification: Like overlays on a presentation board,
they overlap, cross-reference and sometimes contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   In purely economic terms, the damage is felt not just by the
allies but by their non-alliance neighbors. At one point last week,
over 100,000 tons of waterborne freight intended for Austria,
Germany and Hungary were marooned on the Danube in Romania. An
Austrian shipping company said it was losing $77,000 a day because
of NATO bombing of Danube bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists in droves have canceled vacations on Croatia's Adriatic
cost _ much too close to the bombing for beach-lounging comfort.
Even in Greece, a tour operator said thousands of Americans had
postponed visits in case the Kosovo conflict spills southward. And
a ground war _ not to mention the likelihood of a massive postwar
reconstruction bill _ would strain budgets across Europe. Even now,
simply to keep one British Tornado warplane airborne for an hour
costs Britain's taxpayers $33,000. A single payload of bombs costs
$640,000, according to defense analysts.

</P>
<P>
   But economic woes may turn out to be far less intractable than
some of the political conundrums thrown up by the alliance's
embroilment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a patchwork of uneasy bedfellows. For example,
Spain and Turkey, different in so many other ways, are both NATO
members committed to supporting the alliance's aims in Kosovo. But
both are also locked in their own conflicts against separatists _
respectively, Basques and Kurds _ who are demanding pretty much the
same things sought by the Kosovars whom the two nations purport to
defend in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totalitarian exclusiveness of nationalism engenders
genocide and ethnic cleansing,'' warned Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's
prime minister. So why wage war in league with Kosovar
separatists? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Spain, of course, doesn't have a strategic interest in the
Balkans, but Turkey does. Its Ottoman forebears drew the very fault
lines of faith and ethnic division that have baffled Western policy
makers in the Balkans through two world wars and now for most of
the 1990s. And that legacy draws an arc of solidarity embracing
Muslim communities from Thrace in Greece to Albania and Bosnia
that, some fear, could pull Ankara toward a wider conflict.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more sensitive to that configuration of faith than the
Greeks, whose mirror-image sense of kinship with the Orthodox
Christian Serbs places the government of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis in a curious position, caught between the powerful pro-Serb
impulses of his compatriots and the broader pro-Western interests
reflected in Athens' enthusiastic drive to join the European single
currency. Orthodox Christianity, indeed, provides a critical link
of religious identities, stretching from Athens to Belgrade and on
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by the Greek Orthodox Church, Greeks have demonstrated
against NATO's Kosovo campaign, even as the Greek port of
Thessaloniki is being used to resupply the 12,000 NATO troops in
neighboring Macedonia. At the same time, Simitis' popularity has
risen sharply in opinion surveys, underlining the keen desire of
many Greeks to see the war contained as far as possible from their
borders, avoiding a broader conflict with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, too, is another overlay, this time from the Cold War:
If anyone within NATO supports Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, it is Europe's Communists and ex-Communists, who are
usually depicted as discredited and spent. The small Greek
Communist party _ in tacit alliance with the Orthodox Church _ has
helped stage anti-Western demonstrations in Athens. Elsewhere,
ex-Communist leaders from eastern Germany and Italy have rushed to
Belgrade. Significantly, German opinion surveys show support for
the war running at 59 percent in western Germany, but only 38
percent in the formerly Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, this catalog of diversity has not dented
the high degree of support across Europe for the Kosovo campaign.
Almost universally, Europeans have been horrified _ even ashamed _
by images of refugees streaming out of Kosovo and into a collective
memory of the even more massive upheavals of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, even those former central European lands that have
only just joined the alliance have not broken ranks: Hungary
hasn't, and it is on the very front line, with 300,000 Hungarian
brethren forming a minority in Yugoslavia's Vojvodina region, and
potentially vulnerable to Serbian reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   But, more cynically, it is the refugees that propel policies
that, in the words of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, are
about moral imperatives and a ``just war.''
</P>
<P>
   No European power wants a huge influx of outsiders straining the
social fabric and state coffers at a time of widespread
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Italy thus was among the first to send 2,000 troops to Albania
to help in humanitarian relief. As on many occasions in recent
years, Rome's policy was driven by a calculation that it is
preferable to deal with refugees' distress at long range rather
than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is already home to 400,000 Albanian immigrants, and the
authorities in Athens fear that a flood of Kosovo Albanian refugees
could unsettle their land.
</P>
<P>
   Only belatedly last week did France, with its uneasy immigrant
population, reverse its refusal to accept even small numbers of
refugees. And, after providing sanctuary for some 300,000 Bosnians,
many Germans feel they have done enough. Such thinking underpins
European calls for a postwar reconstruction strategy on the scale
of the Marshall Plan to stabilize the Balkans into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority should be to look after people in the region
where they have sought refuge and with which they are linked by
language and culture,'' said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of
Germany. ``Any other policy would make us de facto accomplices of
Belgrade's policy of deportation.''
</P>
<P>

 LONDON: defense analysts.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But economic woes may turn out to be far less intractable than
some of the political conundrums thrown up by the alliance's
embroilment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for a patchwork of uneasy bedfellows. For example,
Spain and Turkey, different in so many other ways, are both NATO
members committed to supporting the alliance's aims in Kosovo. But
both are also locked in their own conflicts against separatists _
respectively, Basques and Kurds _ who are demanding pretty much the
same things sought by the Kosovars whom the two nations purport to
defend in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The totalitarian exclusiveness of nationalism engenders
genocide and ethnic cleansing,'' warned Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's
prime minister. So why wage war in league with Kosovar
separatists? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Spain, of course, doesn't have a strategic interest in the
Balkans, but Turkey does. Its Ottoman forebears drew the very fault
lines of faith and ethnic division that have baffled Western policy
makers in the Balkans through two world wars and now for most of
the 1990s. And that legacy draws an arc of solidarity embracing
Muslim communities from Thrace in Greece to Albania and Bosnia
that, some fear, could pull Ankara toward a wider conflict.
</P>
<P>
   No one is more sensitive to that configuration of faith than the
Greeks, whose mirror-image sense of kinship with the Orthodox
Christian Serbs places the government of Prime Minister Costas
Simitis in a curious position, caught between the powerful pro-Serb
impulses of his compatriots and the broader pro-Western interests
reflected in Athens' enthusiastic drive to join the European single
currency. Orthodox Christianity, indeed, provides a critical link
of religious identities, stretching from Athens to Belgrade and on
to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by the Greek Orthodox Church, Greeks have demonstrated
against NATO's Kosovo campaign, even as the Greek port of
Thessaloniki is being used to resupply the 12,000 NATO troops in
neighboring Macedonia. At the same time, Simitis' popularity has
risen sharply in opinion surveys, underlining the keen desire of
many Greeks to see the war contained as far as possible from their
borders, avoiding a broader conflict with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, too, is another overlay, this time from the Cold War:
If anyone within NATO supports Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, it is Europe's Communists and ex-Communists, who are
usually depicted as discredited and spent. The small Greek
Communist party _ in tacit alliance with the Orthodox Church _ has
helped stage anti-Western demonstrations in Athens. Elsewhere,
ex-Communist leaders from eastern Germany and Italy have rushed to
Belgrade. Significantly, German opinion surveys show support for
the war running at 59 percent in western Germany, but only 38
percent in the formerly Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, this catalog of diversity has not dented
the high degree of support across Europe for the Kosovo campaign.
Almost universally, Europeans have been horrified _ even ashamed _
by images of refugees streaming out of Kosovo and into a collective
memory of the even more massive upheavals of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, even those former central European lands that have
only just joined the alliance have not broken ranks: Hungary
hasn't, and it is on the very front line, with 300,000 Hungarian
brethren forming a minority in Yugoslavia's Vojvodina region, and
potentially vulnerable to Serbian reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   But, more cynically, it is the refugees that propel policies
that, in the words of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, are
about moral imperatives and a ``just war.''
</P>
<P>
   No European power wants a huge influx of outsiders straining the
social fabric and state coffers at a time of widespread
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Italy thus was among the first to send 2,000 troops to Albania
to help in humanitarian relief. As on many occasions in recent
years, Rome's policy was driven by a calculation that it is
preferable to deal with refugees' distress at long range rather
than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is already home to 400,000 Albanian immigrants, and the
authorities in Athens fear that a flood of Kosovo Albanian refugees
could unsettle their land.
</P>
<P>
   Only belatedly last week did France, with its uneasy immigrant
population, reverse its refusal to accept even small numbers of
refugees. And, after providing sanctuary for some 300,000 Bosnians,
many Germans feel they have done enough. Such thinking underpins
European calls for a postwar reconstruction strategy on the scale
of the Marshall Plan to stabilize the Balkans into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority should be to look after people in the region
where they have sought refuge and with which they are linked by
language and culture,'' said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of
Germany. ``Any other policy would make us de facto accomplices of
Belgrade's policy of deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in Germany, of course, that the Kosovo campaign conjures
the sharpest dilemma of all, testing many of the nation's postwar
assumptions and straining the unity of its coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of German troops going to war _ in the Balkans of all
places _ deeply offends many Germans nurtured on postwar pacifism.
But the notion that, as a NATO member and European leader, modern
Germany should stand by is equally repellent, particularly to those
who have learned in school that they bear a special responsibility
to guard against a revival of the atrocities that mark their
nation's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our German history,'' Schroeder said, ``we cannot leave
any doubt about our reliability, determination and steadfastness.''

   Long before two teen-aged boys began their shooting rampage last
week at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., long before
violent video games, the Internet and nihilistic industrial rock
music, America's young were committing occasional acts of
destruction and violence. If the following examples fail to show a
pattern, it may be because there is none.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, 17-year-old Kenneth Skinner burned an apartment
building in San Francisco, killing eight people. Although the
building was on his paper route, he said he knew none of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Starkweather was 19 in 1958 when he led Caril Fugate,
14, on a weeklong killing spree across Nebraska and Wyoming in
which 11 people were shot, stabbed and strangled to death. Miss
Fugate, who confessed to killing her mother with a shotgun when she
threatened Starkweather, was sentenced to life in prison. Hours
before his death in the electric chair, Starkweather was asked if
he would donate his eyes for medical use. ``Hell no,'' he said.
``No one ever did anything for me. Why should I do anything for
anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1966, Charles Whitman, 24, an expert marksman and a
former Eagle Scout and marine, killed his wife and mother. Then he
took a footlocker full of ammunition, shotguns, rifles, Spam
sandwiches and water to a 27-story clock tower at the University of
Texas in Austin, where he was a junior. He shot 46 people in an
hour and a half, killing 16 before he was killed by the police.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy showed a tumor pressing on his hypothalamus. The
psychiatrist he had begun seeing a few months before revealed that
Whitman said he was ``thinking about going up on the tower and
shooting people.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, 18-year-old Robert Benjamin Smith took seven
female hostages in a beauty school and salon in Mesa, Ariz., and
fatally shot five of them, including a 3-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   He waited for the police, then confessed and cited as his
motivation the crimes of Whitman and those of Richard Speck, who
had killed eight student nurses in Chicago that year. ``I just
wanted to get myself a name,'' Smith said at the time. Smith's
student counselor, who was also the basketball coach at Mesa High
School, blamed his ``lack of physical coordination.'' Smith was
sentenced to death but won an appeal and remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 Anthony Barbaro, an 18-year-old in Olean, N.Y., entered
his high school, which was closed for Christmas, and set several
fires. When a custodian investigated, Barbaro, who was a member of
the school's rifle team, shot him dead, then fired from a
third-floor window at firemen and passersby, killing two more
people and wounding nine. An investigation of his home turned up
handmade bombs and a diary detailing five months of planning the
attack. Before he hanged himself in his cell, Barbaro told his
uncle that ``the pressure just got the best of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Spencer was 16 in 1979 when she fired on an elementary
school yard from the window of her house in San Carlos, Calif.
Using the .22-caliber rifle her father had given her for Christmas
a month before, she killed the principal and custodian and wounded
eight children and a policeman before she was arrested. Her
explanation at the time: ``I just don't like Mondays ... I did this
because it's a way to cheer up the day.'' Miss Spencer was
sentenced to life in prison; her next parole date is in two years.

   In 1939, long before high-tech drugs came along to treat the
chest pain known as angina, an Italian surgeon named Fieschi
devised a simple technique. Reasoning that increased blood flow to
the heart would ease his patients' pain, he made tiny incisions in
their chests and tied knots in two arteries. The results were
spectacular. Three quarters of all patients improved.'' One third
were cured.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the National Institutes of Health paid a
young cardiologist in Seattle, Dr. Leonard A. Cobb, to conduct a
novel test of the Fieschi technique. Cobb operated on 17 patients.
Eight had their arteries tied; the other nine got incisions,
nothing more. In 1959, the New England Journal of Medicine
published his findings: The phony operations worked just as well as
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   That was beginning of the end of the procedure, known as
internal mammary artery ligation; within two years, it became a
footnote in the medical history texts. It was also the beginning
and the end, apparently, for sham surgery in this country. By the
early 1970s, an ethics revolution had transformed human
experiments, and the idea of surgery as placebo was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Unthinkable until now. Sham surgery is on the rise, to the
horror of some doctors who say it is immoral and to the delight of
others who say it is time to apply the same rigorous scientific
standards to surgery as to the rest of the medical profession. And
with it comes a host of thorny questions.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the first sham brain surgery study were reported
last week in Toronto by a team of neurologists. Forty people with
Parkinson's disease participated. Each had neurosurgery: four tiny
holes, drilled through the forehead into the skull. But only half
got the injections of fetal cells that might have repaired their
damaged brains; the other half got nothing. One year later, three
members of the placebo group said their symptoms had improved.
</P>
<P>
   The study has drawn praise from officials at the National
Institutes of Health, who paid for it, but also criticism from
other quarters. ``A placebo is truly inert and harmless,'' said Dr.
Arthur Caplan, the bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.
``This is not a placebo. It is a phony surgical operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Caplan's protests, there are similar studies underway,
in part because the federal government is requiring them and in
part because new, less invasive, surgical methods make them
feasible. Two other groups researching Parkinson's are running sham
neurosurgery tests. A Rhode Island biotech company,
Cytotherapeutics, is using phony operations to study a treatment
for cancer pain that inserts analgesic capsules into the fluid at
the base of the spine. In Houston, the Department of Veterans'
Affairs is sponsoring a program to see if arthroscopic surgery, a
common treatment for knee injuries, works for osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we so well accept a placebo in medicine trials, drug
trials, why don't we accept it in surgery trials?'' asked Dr. Nelda
Wray, chief of general medicine at the VA Hospital in Houston. ``My
hope is for us to critically think about the risk of the placebo,
and if we can reduce it, we should think about doing placebo trials
before we disseminate surgical procedures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Weighing the risks and benefits, however, is not a simple task.
The 180 patients in Dr. Wray's study, for instance, will be placed
under general anesthesia. Dr. Baruch Brody, an ethicist at Baylor
University who advised Dr. Wray, said he approved the design
because the risks of sedation have dropped substantially in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect in medicine is well-documented. The word is
Latin, from the Catholic prayer for the dead, meaning ``I shall
please.'' In centuries past, doctors used placebos to placate
problem patients. ``You gave them something to send them away
happy,'' said Anne Harrington, a medical historian at Harvard
University. Experts estimate that 30 percent of all patients
getting placebo treatment today improve.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is profound in disorders like Parkinson's, where
patients have good days and bad, and in those diseases where pain
is common. And it is likely to be especially powerful in an
intervention as dramatic as surgery, said Dan Moerman, a medical
anthropologist at the University of Michigan at Dearborn. ``There
is probably more need for placebo tests in surgery,'' he said,
``than in other areas of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the Food and Drug Administration decreed that
placebo-controlled clinical trials, those in which half the
patients are treated and half get dummy pills, were the gold
standard for new drug approvals. Traditionally, the FDA has taken a
hands-off approach to surgical innovations. But that is changing,
now that biotech firms are using surgery to implant genetically
engineered cells that the agency classifies as drugs. When Genzyme
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., proposed injecting pig cells into the
brains of Parkinson's patients, the agency insisted on a placebo
design.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in all the studies know they stand a chance of not
being treated. But keeping patients in the dark can pose problems
beyond performing fake operations, as Genzyme found. The patients
getting the pig cells will receive anti-rejection drugs and
antibiotics, standard fare for transplant patients. The placebo
patients will get dummy anti-rejection pills. But making fake
antibiotics that look, taste and smell like the real thing was
impossible, said Dr. J. Stephen Fink, a neurologist at Genzyme, and
so the sham surgery patients will get real antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the ethics board at Columbia Presbyterian Center
in New York City, which helped run the fetal cell experiment
reported last week, to turn down Genzyme's project. The research is
now proceeding elsewhere. ``We really struggled with the
decision,'' Fink said, ``because it isn't an ideal thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom in ethics circles is that in routine health
care, intentionally deceiving patients is wrong. But the debate
over sham surgery raises an obvious question: If phony operations
can help people, why not just do them? ``That,'' said Dr. Wray, the
Texas knee researcher, ``is an important point. What to do with it,
medicine is going to have to decide.''

holes, drilled through the forehead into the skull. But only half
got the injections of fetal cells that might have repaired their
damaged brains; the other half got nothing. One year later, three
members of the placebo group said their symptoms had improved.
</P>
<P>
   The study has drawn praise from officials at the National
Institutes of Health, who paid for it, but also criticism from
other quarters. ``A placebo is truly inert and harmless,'' said Dr.
Arthur Caplan, the bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.
``This is not a placebo. It is a phony surgical operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Caplan's protests, there are similar studies underway,
in part because the federal government is requiring them and in
part because new, less invasive, surgical methods make them
feasible. Two other groups researching Parkinson's are running sham
neurosurgery tests. A Rhode Island biotech company,
Cytotherapeutics, is using phony operations to study a treatment
for cancer pain that inserts analgesic capsules into the fluid at
the base of the spine. In Houston, the Department of Veterans'
Affairs is sponsoring a program to see if arthroscopic surgery, a
common treatment for knee injuries, works for osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we so well accept a placebo in medicine trials, drug
trials, why don't we accept it in surgery trials?'' asked Dr. Nelda
Wray, chief of general medicine at the VA Hospital in Houston. ``My
hope is for us to critically think about the risk of the placebo,
and if we can reduce it, we should think about doing placebo trials
before we disseminate surgical procedures.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Weighing the risks and benefits, however, is not a simple task.
The 180 patients in Dr. Wray's study, for instance, will be placed
under general anesthesia. Dr. Baruch Brody, an ethicist at Baylor
University who advised Dr. Wray, said he approved the design
because the risks of sedation have dropped substantially in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The placebo effect in medicine is well-documented. The word is
Latin, from the Catholic prayer for the dead, meaning ``I shall
please.'' In centuries past, doctors used placebos to placate
problem patients. ``You gave them something to send them away
happy,'' said Anne Harrington, a medical historian at Harvard
University. Experts estimate that 30 percent of all patients
getting placebo treatment today improve.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is profound in disorders like Parkinson's, where
patients have good days and bad, and in those diseases where pain
is common. And it is likely to be especially powerful in an
intervention as dramatic as surgery, said Dan Moerman, a medical
anthropologist at the University of Michigan at Dearborn. ``There
is probably more need for placebo tests in surgery,'' he said,
``than in other areas of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the Food and Drug Administration decreed that
placebo-controlled clinical trials, those in which half the
patients are treated and half get dummy pills, were the gold
standard for new drug approvals. Traditionally, the FDA has taken a
hands-off approach to surgical innovations. But that is changing,
now that biotech firms are using surgery to implant genetically
engineered cells that the agency classifies as drugs. When Genzyme
Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., proposed injecting pig cells into the
brains of Parkinson's patients, the agency insisted on a placebo
design.
</P>
<P>
   The patients in all the studies know they stand a chance of not
being treated. But keeping patients in the dark can pose problems
beyond performing fake operations, as Genzyme found. The patients
getting the pig cells will receive anti-rejection drugs and
antibiotics, standard fare for transplant patients. The placebo
patients will get dummy anti-rejection pills. But making fake
antibiotics that look, taste and smell like the real thing was
impossible, said Dr. J. Stephen Fink, a neurologist at Genzyme, and
so the sham surgery patients will get real antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the ethics board at Columbia Presbyterian Center
in New York City, which helped run the fetal cell experiment
reported last week, to turn down Genzyme's project. The research is
now proceeding elsewhere. ``We really struggled with the
decision,'' Fink said, ``because it isn't an ideal thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom in ethics circles is that in routine health
care, intentionally deceiving patients is wrong. But the debate
over sham surgery raises an obvious question: If phony operations
can help people, why not just do them? ``That,'' said Dr. Wray, the
Texas knee researcher, ``is an important point. What to do with it,
medicine is going to have to decide.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The spring day was bright and sunny enough for
sunglasses, yet cool enough to require a sweatshirt and baggy sweat
pants. As I walked along a busy street in the predominantly white
northwest Washington neighborhood where I lived, I hardly thought
that my clothing or, more important, my dark skin would attract the
attention of the police.
</P>
<P>
   But sure enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser
from the Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer
jumped out and demanded to know what I was doing there. I live
here, I stammered, somewhat stunned. Incredulous, he asked to see
some identification. I produced a driver's license verifying that I
lived a few blocks away _ that this was, indeed, my neighborhood.
He seemed satisfied. I was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you stopping me?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a burglary in the area and you fit the description
of the suspect,'' he answered, sounding surprised at what he
clearly regarded as a cheeky question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' I replied. ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly gave me the name of a street where the crime
allegedly had occurred and departed, leaving me standing on the
sidewalk, seething. I later called the local police precinct to
check out this supposed burglary, and was not surprised to find out
that there was no report of any break-in on that street. The
officer's explanation, I assumed, had been concocted to cover up
what really had happened _ a random stop of a black man who to the
officer's eye did not fit the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the fatal shooting last month of an unarmed West
African immigrant by members of the Street Crimes Unit of the New
York City police, the issue of whether the police target minorities
for questioning and searches has been thrust onto center stage.
Figures compiled by the New York police show that in the 20
precincts where the Street Crimes Unit has been most active, 63
percent of the people stopped and frisked were minorities. Last
week investigators in New Jersey announced that a two-year study of
random stops on the New Jersey Turnpike showed that roughly
three-fourths of the people whose cars were halted and searched by
state troopers were black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are stark, and to civil rights leaders and liberal
politicians proof of the use of racial profiling by police. But the
figures give little sense of the depth of anger of people like me
singled out evidently because of race or ethnicity. The incident
left me frustrated and irate. (At the time I was in my mid-40s but
often could pass for someone much younger.) I thought: I'm a
middle-class black man who works hard, pays his taxes, keeps out of
trouble and tries to treat people with dignity and respect. Why
should I be an object of suspicion?
</P>
<P>
   I railed at the injustice of it all. Yet, as my anger cooled, I
asked myself a harder question: Hadn't I done the same thing
myself?
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to the time back in the early 1970s when, as a
college student in New York City, I supported myself by driving a
taxi at night. In many ways it was a great job for a student _
flexible hours, good pay, a way to meet interesting people,
especially women. It could also be dangerous. In three years, I was
held up twice; once at gunpoint, once when I let a passenger sit
next to me in the front seat and he put a knife to my throat. Both
times the perpetrators were young black men.
</P>
<P>
   Fear chastens you. I did not quit driving a taxi. I liked the
job too much. But I became more choosy about who I let in my cab. I
still picked up black women, older men, couples, families and men
dressed in suits. But my sense of tolerance and racial solidarity
was tested every time a casually dressed young black man,
especially one in sneakers, tried to hail my cab. Most times, I
drove right by. I sometimes wondered about their reaction, but I
kept thinking that if I guessed wrong, I could pay for my mistake
with my life.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, I was engaging in my own form of racial
profiling. But I rationalized. Racism, I told myself, would be to
decline to pick up every black person who hailed my cab. What I was
doing was playing the odds, playing it safe, taking no chances.
Looking back, I realized that those I declined to pick up looked
remarkably like I did when the cop stopped me as I walked down a
Washington street.
</P>
<P>
   As I contemplated this, my anger spread to many targets: the
police officer who had confronted me, and the young black hoodlums
whose criminal behavior had made the officer suspicious of all
African-American men in the first place. And I resented the
country's history of racism, which helped to ensure that the
presence of a black person in a leafy, affluent neighborhood of
Washington was still a rare sight.
</P>
<P>
   The nexus of race, crime and stereotyping raises difficult
questions that are often ignored. Even as crime rates tumble, young
black men still commit a disproportionate share of serious
offenses, a fact that is driven home in metropolitan areas by
television's seemingly incessant airing of crime news. And whether
the fear stems from real experience or media-driven perceptions,
people _ police and civilian, white and black _ play the odds all
the time when it comes to how they view and respond to young black
men.
</P>
<P>
   Too often the country fails to acknowledge how widespread the
practice is. Two years ago, at a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, President Clinton asked a group of whites who had
joined him onstage whether they felt fear when they saw a young
black man on the street who was not well dressed. A number
sheepishly raised their hands. Clinton thanked them for their
honesty. I sat there wondering, ``Mr. President, why don't you ask
the black participants the same question?''
</P>
<P>
   Even the seemingly clear-cut statistics on racial profiling
don't tell the whole story. New York's Street Crimes Unit did
indeed stop and frisk a disproportionately large number of black
men. Yet in those same precincts, 71 percent of the suspects, as
described by their victims, were black men.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, New Jersey state troopers arrested or seized
contraband from 13.5 percent of the minorities whose cars were
searched on the turnpike, compared with 10.5 percent of the whites.
At first blush that seems like a sizable difference. But then
consider that the troopers stopped three times as many non-whites
or Hispanics as others: Racial profiling hardly seems to be
producing enough arrests to justify the effort _ or the heartache.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the biggest argument against targeting some people
as suspects based on their race, beyond the constitutional argument
of equal treatment before the law. With crime rates tumbling in
virtually every big city in the land, racial profiling may have
outlived its usefulness. Perhaps if I were a young New York City
cab driver today I would not be as wary of young black men as I
once was. With the streets safer, it could be time for the public
and the police to shed the kind of attitude I held nearly three
decades ago _ the attitude that followed me into middle-aged
respectability on a Washington street.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The killing spree by two young fans of computerized gladiator
matches and gut-wrenching industrial rock last week in Littleton,
Colo., was a calamity measured in lives lost and damaged. But the
tragedy at Columbine High School also marked yet another battle
over the meanings and effects of youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   News analysts have dwelled on the ominous details of the leisure
pursuits of the youths, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18. The
boys had obsessively played cartoonishly bloody video games like
Doom and Quake, worn the black clothing long favored by hard-rock
fans and listened to the operatically gruesome music of Marilyn
Manson and the German bands Rammstein and KMFDM. They also appear
to have idolized Adolf Hitler, which is not true of many young
people who share their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports called the youths Goths, but practitioners of that
lifestyle, which favors more romantic music and androgynous
fashions, quickly declared that real Goths are not violent, racist
or fans of Marilyn Manson. The music industry also distanced itself
from the boys. Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, expressed sympathy for the victims but
insisted that music ``does not drive teen-agers to violent
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM, whose ferocious lyrics Harris had
posted on his Web site, released a statement saying his group
steadfastly denounced ``war, oppression, fascism and violence
against others.'' Marilyn Manson called the killings ``tragic and
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, psychiatrists and social workers offered the familiar
argument that popular images of carnage inevitably affect
susceptible youths, while editorial page writers wondered how two
young men with such floridly grisly tastes could proceed unnoticed
by parents or peers. Yet the limited nature of the continuing
debate about extreme popular culture points to how such an
oversight could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do either the advocates or the enemies of popular culture
approach the subject with clarity and close attention. KMFDM is a
case in point. The group, which recently disbanded, has long been
an industrial-rock pioneer, blending machine-generated dance beats
with pop melodies and random dissonance. Its lyrics are harsh, like
its sound, sometimes expressing destructive urges in blatant terms.
One that Harris might have taken to heart, from the song
``Piggybank,'' reads, ``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments, enforced by the music's body-thumping rush,
could be felt by a troubled listener as a prod toward destruction.
But like Harris' other favorites _ Rammstein and Marilyn Manson _
KMFDM links the tumult it generates to a longing for inner peace.
The group also has an absurdist side, obvious in performance, as
the 7-foot-tall cross-dressing vocalist En Esch vies for attention
with Konietzko, who appears as a Mad Max-like antihero. Humor is
just one way these artists tell their fans that they do not mean to
be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   Today's extreme rock music, like most popular culture, sends a
swarm of mixed messages. Its makers can be calculatedly brutish,
and often fail when they try for subtlety. After all, they are
operating in exile from adulthood, expected to be immature. Yet
even the rawest extreme music offers adolescents a symbolic
language with which to express the confusion they already feel.
Communicating the anguish of victims and outcasts in a voice of
vengeance and aggression, it theatricalizes rage.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans simply leave their frenzy at the concert hall door.
But organized adult responses to this difficult music often fail to
grasp the difference between metaphor and reality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The attempt to regulate popular culture is evident in the
nationwide phenomenon of gang- and cult-awareness seminars that
associate an interest in extreme rock with mental illness, only
confirms the fears, or fantasies, of many fans that they are doing
something terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Steve Rickard of the Denver Police Department, who gave
one such seminar to students at Columbine High School only three
weeks before the shootings there, hopes parents will look harder at
the culture their children consume _ if only to be better equipped
to dissuade them. ``Could you look your mother in the eye and
defend it?'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickard, who said he had deeply examined the materials he
criticizes, argued against separating one's tastes from one's self.
``I tell the kids they are who their friends are, and that to a
certain extent, you are what you expose your mind and body to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people do feel essentially tied to artists they
admire. Some need help to navigate their passions. Teachers have
long showed students how to grasp the nuances literature and
history. But instead of actually exploring youth culture in the
company of young people, many adults debate its legality among
themselves. Critics quote lyrics out of context and misinterpret
jokes as threats. Advocates _ often culture industry professionals
_ stress the First Amendment while expressing personal distaste for
adolescent fare. The artists themselves grow sullen and silent.
</P>
<P>
   Popular art aimed at adolescents often trades in alienation.
Adults who try to comprehend it violate the generational boundary
that is part of its appeal. They risk looking foolish and being
ignored. But it is impossible to understand young people apart from
their interpretations _ and misinterpretations _ of the fashions
and fads they love, for they add to the sense of self that leads
them to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the failure of anyone to gaze across this gap
apparently aided disaster.

   The killing spree by two young fans of computerized gladiator
matches and gut-wrenching industrial rock last week in Littleton,
Colo., was a calamity measured in lives lost and damaged. But the
tragedy at Columbine High School also marked yet another battle
over the meanings and effects of youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   News analysts have dwelled on the ominous details of the leisure
pursuits of the youths, Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18. The
boys had obsessively played cartoonishly bloody video games like
Doom and Quake, worn the black clothing long favored by hard-rock
fans and listened to the operatically gruesome music of Marilyn
Manson and the German bands Rammstein and KMFDM. They also appear
to have idolized Adolf Hitler, which is not true of many young
people who share their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports called the youths Goths, but practitioners of that
lifestyle, which favors more romantic music and androgynous
fashions, quickly declared that real Goths are not violent, racist
or fans of Marilyn Manson. The music industry also distanced itself
from the boys. Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, expressed sympathy for the victims but
insisted that music ``does not drive teen-agers to violent
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM, whose ferocious lyrics Harris had
posted on his Web site, released a statement saying his group
steadfastly denounced ``war, oppression, fascism and violence
against others.'' Marilyn Manson called the killings ``tragic and
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, psychiatrists and social workers offered the familiar
argument that popular images of carnage inevitably affect
susceptible youths, while editorial page writers wondered how two
young men with such floridly grisly tastes could proceed unnoticed
by parents or peers. Yet the limited nature of the continuing
debate about extreme popular culture points to how such an
oversight could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do either the advocates or the enemies of popular culture
approach the subject with clarity and close attention. KMFDM is a
case in point. The group, which recently disbanded, has long been
an industrial-rock pioneer, blending machine-generated dance beats
with pop melodies and random dissonance. Its lyrics are harsh, like
its sound, sometimes expressing destructive urges in blatant terms.
One that Harris might have taken to heart, from the song
``Piggybank,'' reads, ``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments, enforced by the music's body-thumping rush,
could be felt by a troubled listener as a prod toward destruction.
But like Harris' other favorites _ Rammstein and Marilyn Manson _
KMFDM links the tumult it generates to a longing for inner peace.
The group also has an absurdist side, obvious in performance, as
the 7-foot-tall cross-dressing vocalist En Esch vies for attention
with Konietzko, who appears as a Mad Max-like antihero. Humor is
just one way these artists tell their fans that they do not mean to
be taken literally.
</P>
<P>
   Today's extreme rock music, like most popular culture, sends a
swarm of mixed messages. Its makers can be calculatedly brutish,
and often fail when they try for subtlety. After all, they are
operating in exile from adulthood, expected to be immature. Yet
even the rawest extreme music offers adolescents a symbolic
language with which to express the confusion they already feel.
Communicating the anguish of victims and outcasts in a voice of
vengeance and aggression, it theatricalizes rage.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans simply leave their frenzy at the concert hall door.
But organized adult responses to this difficult music often fail to
grasp the difference between metaphor and reality.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The attempt to regulate popular culture is evident in the
nationwide phenomenon of gang- and cult-awareness seminars that
associate an interest in extreme rock with mental illness, only
confirms the fears, or fantasies, of many fans that they are doing
something terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Steve Rickard of the Denver Police Department, who gave
one such seminar to students at Columbine High School only three
weeks before the shootings there, hopes parents will look harder at
the culture their children consume _ if only to be better equipped
to dissuade them. ``Could you look your mother in the eye and
defend it?'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickard, who said he had deeply examined the materials he
criticizes, argued against separating one's tastes from one's self.
``I tell the kids they are who their friends are, and that to a
certain extent, you are what you expose your mind and body to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people do feel essentially tied to artists they
admire. Some need help to navigate their passions. Teachers have
long showed students how to grasp the nuances literature and
history. But instead of actually exploring youth culture in the
company of young people, many adults debate its legality among
themselves. Critics quote lyrics out of context and misinterpret
jokes as threats. Advocates _ often culture industry professionals
_ stress the First Amendment while expressing personal distaste for
adolescent fare. The artists themselves grow sullen and silent.
</P>
<P>
   Popular art aimed at adolescents often trades in alienation.
Adults who try to comprehend it violate the generational boundary
that is part of its appeal. They risk looking foolish and being
ignored. But it is impossible to understand young people apart from
their interpretations _ and misinterpretations _ of the fashions
and fads they love, for they add to the sense of self that leads
them to act.
</P>
<P>
   In Littleton, the failure of anyone to gaze across this gap
apparently aided disaster.

   NEW DELHI, India _ Since the Hindu nationalist-led government
collapsed a week ago, the noisy, gaudy spectacle of Indian
democracy has played out here in the capital on familiar public
stages: the steps of Parliament House, the courtyard of the
president's residence and at the closed gates of the Gandhi family
compound.
</P>
<P>
   But the political turmoil that has seen five governments come
tumbling down here in just six years is not merely the result of
cantankerous rivalries among the country's political parties or the
often venal, self-serving antics of its politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial are profound political changes taking place in
hundreds of thousands of villages where most of the nation's 980
million people live and vote. Researchers have learned from
election and survey data that in the 1990s the country's most
oppressed people _ the low castes, the poor, the illiterate _ have
been voting and joining political parties in growing proportions,
as have women, who were long at the fringes of the nation's
political life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these voters are flocking to the caste-based and
regional parties that more directly reflect their own identities
and interests and that now hold the power to make and to break
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The India that for most of its history was dominated by the
dynastic reign of the Nehru-Gandhi family in the Congress Party has
given way to a cacophonous multiplicity of parties, some of them
led by populist politicians who metaphorically poke a finger in the
eye of the country's Brahmin elite at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the poorest Indians are now more likely to vote than
the richest ones. This turns on its head what was true here only a
quarter of a century ago, and what is still true of American and
European democracies: namely, that the prosperous are more likely
to vote than the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've entered what political scientists call a decade of
realignment,'' said Yogendra Yadav, who has researched these trends
at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies here. ``The
stable alignments have broken down and a new era when these
linkages are rewoven has begun. One of the consequences of this
massive redefinition is instability at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's study of survey and voting data found that the
current decade has witnessed increased voter turnout, rising
membership in political parties and a deepening faith in democracy
itself among the people at the bottom of India's deeply inequitable
social structure. The study is to be published soon by Oxford
University Press as part of a book on Indian democracy produced in
cooperation with the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for the
Advanced Study of India.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of the trends, the percentage of people from
formerly untouchable castes who said they were members of political
parties rose from 13 percent in 1971 to 19 percent in 1996, while
the percentage from the upper castes who said they belonged to a
party declined from 36 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of very poor people who believe voting makes a
difference rose from 38 percent in 1971 to 51 percent in 1996, and
jumped from 42 percent to 60 percent for low caste people.
</P>
<P>
   At first, their belief in the power of the ballot seems
puzzling. State and national governments have often failed to
deliver to the poor the most basic services _ education, health
care and clean drinking water among them _ as well as a more
rapidly growing economy that could help more people escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where government still plays a central role in
the economy and dispensing public goods, politics has given the
lower castes the power to claim a share of patronage _ everything
from schools to housing to wells to jobs in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to come to power to make money,'' said Jairam
Ramesh, an economic policy advisor in the Congress Party. ``The
goodies are in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say politics has also provided a route to something
less tangible but perhaps even more potent politically: pride,
dignity and the confidence to fight back against the kinds of
indignities the low castes have suffered for millennia _ of being
contemptuously called by their caste names, of being forbidden to
draw water from the same wells as the upper castes, of being denied
the right to ride a horse in a wedding procession like an upper
caste groom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No place better exemplifies both the failings of government and
the democratic ferment transforming Indian politics than Uttar
Pradesh, India's most populous and most politically powerful state
and one of its most impoverished, dysfunctional ones.
</P>
<P>
   For the first four decades after Indian independence in 1947,
politics in Uttar Pradesh was dominated by upper castes in the
Congress Party, but Congress has been out of power there throughout
the 1990s. ``The Congress Party never saw fit to have a Dalit chief
minister in Uttar Pradesh, though Dalits have the single largest
proportion of voters,'' Ramesh, the Congress economic advisor, said
ruefully, referring to people from castes formerly regarded as
untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, two non-Brahmin, non-upper-caste parties have won
growing clout in Uttar Pradesh, and both have played important
roles in the latest bout of political turmoil in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mayawati, a Dalit woman and a leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party,
which is built on the votes of Dalits, pulled the rug out from
under the ruling coalition led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, which has been predominantly run by upper castes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayawati, who like many lower caste women goes by one name,
became a symbol of hope to Dalits in two brief terms as chief
minister of Uttar Pradesh in the late 1990s. She lulled the Hindu
nationalist leaders into believing her five members of Parliament
would remain neutral in the confidence vote on April 17. But in the
end, her party's legislators all voted against a government led by
people they believed had betrayed them in Uttar Pradesh politics.
The national coalition government lost power by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   And last Friday, the Samajwadi Party, whose voting base is with
Muslims and Yadavs, the middling cow herd's caste, foiled the
Congress Party's efforts to form a minority government with the
support of smaller parties. The Samajwadi Party leader, Mulayam
Singh Yadav, said his 20 members of Parliament would not support
any new government unless they were part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mayawati nor Yadav is willing to accept crumbs from the
tables of the two major national parties. They want to be at the
table themselves.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The boy stalking victims through a video dungeon in
the game Doom, or laughing at the slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie
``Natural Born Killers'' might well be the next person to shoot up
a school in some polished American suburb. But then again, he might
be a quiet scholar with an odd side.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell the difference is one of the more difficult
challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado, where 15 people
were killed in a long afternoon of gunfire and murder at Columbine
High School in Littleton, south of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shooting, Americans have been advised to
learn the characteristics of potential killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all do more to recognize and look for the early
warning signals that deeply troubled young people send often before
they explode into violence,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have sought out a checklist of
characteristics of young people prone to school violence, provided
by the National School Safety Center in California, which monitors
lethal action in the schools. Among the things to watch for in a
child:
</P>
<P>
   Mood swings. Loves violent television. Uses drugs or alcohol.
Fond of bad language, name-calling and cursing. Is often depressed.
Likes guns and blowing things up. Anti-social.
</P>
<P>
   The profile could fit most teen-agers on a bad day, and some on
a good day. And sure enough, the day after the killings, news
agencies reported a scattering of arrests of teen-agers around the
country for wearing trench coats, the uniform of a Columbine High
outcast clique of which the killers were said to be a part.
</P>
<P>
   But as educators develop a profile of a child who may murder his
classmates, they are wading into the same territory that airport
security personnel, police departments and federal agents have
already gone _ often with unhappy results.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey announced that
state troopers have improperly stopped and searched blacks on the
New Jersey Turnpike because of profiles developed to catch drug
dealers and other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the police department's Street Crime Unit has been
accused of indiscriminately frisking black and Hispanic pedestrians
who fit an informal profile of those suspected of carrying guns.
Four members of the unit have been indicted for killing an unarmed,
law-abiding African immigrant street peddler outside his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police commissioner, Howard Safir, said people were not
stopped because of their race, but because they represented ``the
demographics of known violent crime suspects as reported by crime
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, airport security workers and Secret Service agents
have been trying to develop something similar, with mixed results.
Three years ago, following the Oklahoma City bombing, Clinton
ordered federal agencies to develop a computer tracking system to
flag certain profiles of a ``terrorist type,'' people with
suspicious travel patterns or behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 51,000 of the 71 million people who passed through
United States customs were subject to body searches. Black and
Hispanic travelers were more likely to be searched, even though
they are no more likely to be smugglers or terrorists than other
groups, according to federal surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawsuits around the country, and growing public
pressure, seem likely to curtail widespread profiling based mainly
on race. But profiling for certain criminal tendencies, especially
among students, is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicting impulses are a product of two very modern
ideas that are often at war with each other. The first is the faith
that social science can protect society by classifying potential
malefactors so they can be detected and isolated before they can do
any damage. The second is the equally powerful conviction that the
act of categorizing is the more serious threat because the innocent
may become entangled in the social scientific net.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six multiple-victim school shootings over the
last 18 months, and the shooters have indeed shared many traits.
Guns and bombs figured prominently. The killers were all unpopular
types, never the jocks or student body leaders. They preferred
black clothing, often trench coats, or military camouflage gear.
They talked about death and acted out death fantasies through video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Doom, for example, the popular game that allows someone to track
and kill people, was a favorite of one of the Colorado shooters,
Dylan Klebold, and also of a 14-year-old boy who murdered three
people in West Paducah, Ky., Michael Carneal. A pop musician who
caters to dark fantasies, Marilyn Manson, always seems to turn up
on the list of child shooter tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the desires of parents for something _ anything _ to
make people feel safer, Mayor Wellington Webb asked promoters to
cancel the Marilyn Manson show scheduled for Friday in Denver,
which they promptly did. He asked the National Rifle Association to
cancel its convention there, too, and school officials announced a
ban on trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   What many schools really seem to want is a metal detector for
personality. But whether sweeping and elemental profiling will
prevent another massacre seems doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' said Dr. Delbert Elliott,
director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at
the University of Colorado. ``But when we get down to explaining
which of those kids will actually do something like this, that's a
tough question.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that often the invisible student is
the one most likely to explode _ not the gang member, bully or
loudmouth. Many students at Columbine High remember the killers as
wallpaper-shy students who played cards in the lunchroom and helped
others with computer problems.

   A boy who shot schoolmates in Springfield, Ore., last year, Kip

behavior. Even so, his teachers felt powerless to do anything. They
are, after all, not police officers or psychiatrists.

   Teachers know a lot more about some kids than parents do, who
tend to see them through a slanted lens,'' said Dr. Beatrix

Schools'' (Cambridge University, 1998). ``But teachers are not
trained to report when a kid may be going off the edge.''
</P>
<P>

potential shooters is to look for what experts describe as three

element will turn a brooding student into a killing machine. But
taken together, all three elements spell trouble.

school,'' said Craig LaMay, an adjunct professor of law at

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The boy stalking victims through a video dungeon in
the game Doom, or laughing at the slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie
``Natural Born Killers'' might well be the next person to shoot up
a school in some polished American suburb. But then again, he might
be a quiet scholar with an odd side.
</P>
<P>
   How to tell the difference is one of the more difficult
challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado, where 15 people
were killed in a long afternoon of gunfire and murder at Columbine
High School in Littleton, south of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the shooting, Americans have been advised to
learn the characteristics of potential killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all do more to recognize and look for the early
warning signals that deeply troubled young people send often before
they explode into violence,'' President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have sought out a checklist of
characteristics of young people prone to school violence, provided
by the National School Safety Center in California, which monitors
lethal action in the schools. Among the things to watch for in a
child:
</P>
<P>
   Mood swings. Loves violent television. Uses drugs or alcohol.
Fond of bad language, name-calling and cursing. Is often depressed.
Likes guns and blowing things up. Anti-social.
</P>
<P>
   The profile could fit most teen-agers on a bad day, and some on
a good day. And sure enough, the day after the killings, news
agencies reported a scattering of arrests of teen-agers around the
country for wearing trench coats, the uniform of a Columbine High
outcast clique of which the killers were said to be a part.
</P>
<P>
   But as educators develop a profile of a child who may murder his
classmates, they are wading into the same territory that airport
security personnel, police departments and federal agents have
already gone _ often with unhappy results.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey announced that
state troopers have improperly stopped and searched blacks on the
New Jersey Turnpike because of profiles developed to catch drug
dealers and other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the police department's Street Crime Unit has been
accused of indiscriminately frisking black and Hispanic pedestrians
who fit an informal profile of those suspected of carrying guns.
Four members of the unit have been indicted for killing an unarmed,
law-abiding African immigrant street peddler outside his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police commissioner, Howard Safir, said people were not
stopped because of their race, but because they represented ``the
demographics of known violent crime suspects as reported by crime
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, airport security workers and Secret Service agents
have been trying to develop something similar, with mixed results.
Three years ago, following the Oklahoma City bombing, Clinton
ordered federal agencies to develop a computer tracking system to
flag certain profiles of a ``terrorist type,'' people with
suspicious travel patterns or behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 51,000 of the 71 million people who passed through
United States customs were subject to body searches. Black and
Hispanic travelers were more likely to be searched, even though
they are no more likely to be smugglers or terrorists than other
groups, according to federal surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawsuits around the country, and growing public
pressure, seem likely to curtail widespread profiling based mainly
on race. But profiling for certain criminal tendencies, especially
among students, is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicting impulses are a product of two very modern
ideas that are often at war with each other. The first is the faith
that social science can protect society by classifying potential
malefactors so they can be detected and isolated before they can do
any damage. The second is the equally powerful conviction that the
act of categorizing is the more serious threat because the innocent
may become entangled in the social scientific net.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six multiple-victim school shootings over the
last 18 months, and the shooters have indeed shared many traits.
Guns and bombs figured prominently. The killers were all unpopular
types, never the jocks or student body leaders. They preferred
black clothing, often trench coats, or military camouflage gear.
They talked about death and acted out death fantasies through video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Doom, for example, the popular game that allows someone to track
and kill people, was a favorite of one of the Colorado shooters,
Dylan Klebold, and also of a 14-year-old boy who murdered three
people in West Paducah, Ky., Michael Carneal. A pop musician who
caters to dark fantasies, Marilyn Manson, always seems to turn up
on the list of child shooter tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the desires of parents for something _ anything _ to
make people feel safer, Mayor Wellington Webb asked promoters to
cancel the Marilyn Manson show scheduled for Friday in Denver,
which they promptly did. He asked the National Rifle Association to
cancel its convention there, too, and school officials announced a
ban on trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   What many schools really seem to want is a metal detector for
personality. But whether sweeping and elemental profiling will
prevent another massacre seems doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' said Dr. Delbert Elliott,
director of the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence at
the University of Colorado. ``But when we get down to explaining
which of those kids will actually do something like this, that's a
tough question.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that often the invisible student is
the one most likely to explode _ not the gang member, bully or
loudmouth. Many students at Columbine High remember the killers as
wallpaper-shy students who played cards in the lunchroom and helped
others with computer problems.

Kinkel, once wrote a class essay about his fantasy of blowing up
the school, and he was named, in his yearbook, ``Most Likely to

   ``If the American people wanted Bob Hope as their president,''
Jimmy Carter once remarked, ``they would have elected him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's political demise probably had more to do with the
presence of gas lines than a lack of punch lines, but it's still
ironic that he was replaced by an ex-actor who used humor as
successfully as any politician this century. In fact, Ronald Reagan
is one of only a handful of elected officials in the nation's
history who have distinguished themselves with their wit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, alas, the pronouncements of politicians seem more
humorless than ever. That's probably because, in this era of
heightened sensitivities and ubiquitous cameras, an off-the-cuff
quip can bring you a world of grief (though politicians' private
peccadillos often provide laughs enough). So whether you're a
stolid Al Gore or a relentlessly sunny Elizabeth Dole, it's best to
stay on message while minimizing the ad-libs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unscripted humor is an important element in the lives of
Americans. Shouldn't it be more central to American politics? Why
shunt it off to specially demarcated jocularity zones like
``Politically Incorrect'' or the Gridiron Club? Even those events
lately have been more awkward than amusing. At the White House
Correspondents Dinner next weekend, President Clinton has the
awkward pleasure of honoring a Newsweek reporter for his work
uncovering the Monica Lewinsky matter. That'll be almost as funny
as Paula Jones' appearance at last year's dinner. (``But other than
that, Mrs. Clinton, how was the meal?'')
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the voters of Minnesota were telling the political
establishment something last November when they elected a former
pro wrestler governor. Maybe they were saying that American
politics is as funny as a full Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The political hilarity dearth cannot be denied. It was amply
illustrated recently by the publication of ``Great Political Wit''
(Nan A. Talese/Doubleday) by former Sen. Bob Dole, who has a
well-deserved reputation for being a funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet _ and this is telling _ the book doesn't include any
examples of humor from his 1996 presidential campaign. Why? Because
there weren't any. His advisers felt it was too perilous to let
Dole be Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dole was gun-shy after his disastrous yet sharply witty
vice presidential run in 1976. ``I was supposed to go for the
jugular and I did,'' he observed afterward. ``My own.''
</P>
<P>
   At such a divisively partisan time, a lighter tone could help.
Reagan knew how to deploy humor when the chips were down. Who else
could laugh off an assassin's attack with lines like, ``Honey, I
forgot to duck,'' and, in a quip directed at his surgery team, ``I
hope you're all Republicans''?
</P>
<P>
   Dole wasn't the only Senate bigwig to use laughter to grease the
legislative wheels. Everett Dirksen, the former Senate minority
leader, came up with memorable quips like, ``I am a man of fixed
and unbending principles _ the first of which is to be flexible at
all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, more funny people would run for office. Many who
snickered about the prospect of Congressman Sonny Bono soon
welcomed the sense of humor and perspective that the California
Republican brought to Washington. Rep. Morris ``Mo'' Udall was a
pro basketball player before entering politics, but he could also
have been a professional humorist. ``The public has spoken,'' Udall
declared after withdrawing from the 1976 presidential race. ``The
bastards.''
</P>
<P>
   It would help if more American originals like Jesse Ventura and
Fred Tuttle threw their hats into the ring. Ventura's successful
gubernatorial candidacy in Minnesota is by now legendary. And ol'
Fred, an endearing Vermont dairy farmer who won the Republican
Senate primary, might have done even better last November if he
hadn't gone and endorsed his opponent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN's coverage of the British House of Commons has provided
Americans with a refreshing view of a deliberative body where
clever repartee is required. Hail C-SPAN, beacon for the humorously
challenged!
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if politicians talked in Washington the way they talk on
``Imus in the Morning.'' If they loosened up. Were candid. Laughed
at themselves. Of course, that can't happen unless the public cuts
politicians some slack if they happen to misspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jimmy Carter seemed to realize the value of humor by the
end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank all the people who supported me,'' he told
the assembled press corps, waiting a beat before turning to his
wife with a grin. ``Thank you, Rosalynn.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As commander in chief during the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson
insisted on having almost absolute control over what to bomb and
when to bomb it. ``They can't even bomb an outhouse without my
approval,'' he once declared of the American pilots conducting
raids over Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with NATO unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an
alliance-full of political leaders is setting its own parameters
for strikes, though not to Johnsonian extremes. And that has bogged
down the military task of choosing targets _ complicated enough
with NATO's multinational command structure _ in a morass of
competing political aims.
</P>
<P>
   France's leadership, including President Jacques Chirac, has
curbed NATO strikes on the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, which
is viewed as less hostile to the West than the government in
Belgrade. Lawyers in Britain review each target its forces hit _
either by air or by cruise missile _ to ensure each is justifiably
a military one.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vetted the entire list of targets,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, but has focused on the
most prominent ones, like President Slobodan Milosevic's party
headquarters and a presidential palace in Belgrade, both of which
were struck last week. Although Clinton has signed off on most
targets, his aides say, he has vetoed others, always exhibiting
what his aides describe as a profound aversion to unintended
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate recently, Cohen said, ``Each
president of the NATO countries, at least the major players,'' are
given ``an opportunity to at least express their judgment'' on the
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be in a position of having the commander in
chief or the president of a country have a chance to look the list
over and make at least a recommendation _ without getting into the
politics of it, but deciding whether or not that is a target which,
if hit, would carry such consequences that it would be
counterproductive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an alliance with 19 members, NATO operates by consensus, and
so the objection of any one member can in theory scuttle _ or at
least slow down _ decisions large and small. In reality, though,
those countries with the most forces involved have the greatest
influence.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters near Brussels, Belgium, the process
assures democratic inclusion but is, to some critics, no way to run
a war. ``Running a list of targets through 19 countries cannot be
an effective way of waging war,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes a month ago with a list of 100 targets,
according to a NATO diplomat. Those targets were selected by
military aides to NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
working in war rooms in Brussels, Germany and Italy. Although the
aides, from various allies, picked targets for their military
value, their choices were limited from the outset by the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, which is represented day to
day by ambassadors from each member. The council outlined three
phases of attacks, beginning with air defenses and other purely
military targets and escalating to targets at the heart of
Milosevic's power, like those struck last week.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack began, the council approved strikes in only the
first category. Early in the campaign, however, Clark sought and
received authority to move on to the other phases. Having approved
the broad categories of targets, the North Atlantic Council has now
largely removed itself from reviewing specific targets, though
individual governments have not.
</P>
<P>
   Most major targets still have to be cleared through the
political-military chains of command of each ally, leading to
second-guessing that has frustrated some commanders at NATO and the
Pentagon and, inevitably, slowed the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these criss-crossing objectives,'' said Andrew
Krepinevich, executive director at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. ``On the one
hand, NATO's credibility and viability will be best served by a
quick defeat of Milosevic. On the other hand, many NATO members
have reservations about going after certain targets or have
concerns about the risks to pilots.''
</P>
<P>

   As commander in chief during the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson
insisted on having almost absolute control over what to bomb and
when to bomb it. ``They can't even bomb an outhouse without my
approval,'' he once declared of the American pilots conducting
raids over Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with NATO unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an
alliance-full of political leaders is setting its own parameters
for strikes, though not to Johnsonian extremes. And that has bogged
down the military task of choosing targets _ complicated enough
with NATO's multinational command structure _ in a morass of
competing political aims.
</P>
<P>
   France's leadership, including President Jacques Chirac, has
curbed NATO strikes on the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, which
is viewed as less hostile to the West than the government in
Belgrade. Lawyers in Britain review each target its forces hit _
either by air or by cruise missile _ to ensure each is justifiably
a military one.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has vetted the entire list of targets,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, but has focused on the
most prominent ones, like President Slobodan Milosevic's party
headquarters and a presidential palace in Belgrade, both of which
were struck last week. Although Clinton has signed off on most
targets, his aides say, he has vetoed others, always exhibiting
what his aides describe as a profound aversion to unintended
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate recently, Cohen said, ``Each
president of the NATO countries, at least the major players,'' are
given ``an opportunity to at least express their judgment'' on the
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be in a position of having the commander in
chief or the president of a country have a chance to look the list
over and make at least a recommendation _ without getting into the
politics of it, but deciding whether or not that is a target which,
if hit, would carry such consequences that it would be
counterproductive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an alliance with 19 members, NATO operates by consensus, and
so the objection of any one member can in theory scuttle _ or at
least slow down _ decisions large and small. In reality, though,
those countries with the most forces involved have the greatest
influence.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters near Brussels, Belgium, the process
assures democratic inclusion but is, to some critics, no way to run
a war. ``Running a list of targets through 19 countries cannot be
an effective way of waging war,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes a month ago with a list of 100 targets,
according to a NATO diplomat. Those targets were selected by
military aides to NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
working in war rooms in Brussels, Germany and Italy. Although the
aides, from various allies, picked targets for their military
value, their choices were limited from the outset by the North
Atlantic Council, NATO's political arm, which is represented day to
day by ambassadors from each member. The council outlined three
phases of attacks, beginning with air defenses and other purely
military targets and escalating to targets at the heart of
Milosevic's power, like those struck last week.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack began, the council approved strikes in only the
first category. Early in the campaign, however, Clark sought and
received authority to move on to the other phases. Having approved
the broad categories of targets, the North Atlantic Council has now
largely removed itself from reviewing specific targets, though
individual governments have not.
</P>
<P>
   Most major targets still have to be cleared through the
political-military chains of command of each ally, leading to
second-guessing that has frustrated some commanders at NATO and the
Pentagon and, inevitably, slowed the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these criss-crossing objectives,'' said Andrew
Krepinevich, executive director at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. ``On the one
hand, NATO's credibility and viability will be best served by a
quick defeat of Milosevic. On the other hand, many NATO members
have reservations about going after certain targets or have
concerns about the risks to pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the United States, the chain of command flows
from Clark, who also serves as commander of all American forces for
Europe and Africa, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. A
group within the Joint Staff, called the J-2T, works closely with
Clark's planners.

   UNITED NATIONS _ Yet another specter is haunting Europe, and not
just Europe this time: the specter of the permanent refugee.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of Albanians uprooted in Kosovo and
spilling across the borders of Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro,
some diplomats see the crisis as a defining moment in how the world
thinks about the temporarily and permanently displaced.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has declared as a fundamental war aim that the Kosovo
refugees will get the chance to go back home when the fighting
stops. But that isn't the way most wars have ended in this century.
Look around the world, and the refugees who call themselves
Palestinians, or Cambodians, or Bosnians have by and large not
achieved that dream. In fact, millions of people around the world
have become permanent refugees or, at best, have found new lives in
a new diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   So if NATO can accomplish its war aim, and reverse a campaign of
ethnic cleansing, it would be achieving something quite new.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly will not be easy. Pushing out the Yugoslav
forces who expelled the refugees may well require a NATO invasion.
Even if NATO goes that far, how many Albanians will be eager to
return to a land where their homes have been burned, their husbands
and brothers herded off to unknown fates, their former lives
shattered?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Betts, a political science professor at Columbia
University, warns that in vowing that the refugees will return,
NATO ``may be making a promise we can't keep, or are unprepared to
keep.'' On the other hand, Arthur Helton, who teaches refugee law
at the New York University School of Law, worries that if return
remains the measure of victory or defeat in the conflict, refugees
may be forced or pressured into returning against their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, is it possible that the war will end somewhat
short of the goal, with a deal that implicitly acknowledges that
the refugees will not be able to return safely?
</P>
<P>
   That is already emerging as a fear among refugee advocates and
Albanian-American groups. Some of these people fear that NATO
betrayed a crack in its determination last week when the United
States decided to permit some 20,000 Kosovar refugees being brought
here for safety to be eligible, after a year, to become permanent
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Did this not suggest, some complained, that the refugees might
not be returning to Kosovo once the fighting ends? Would that not
be a victory for ethnic cleansing and its architect, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia began a month ago, the office
of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees estimates that almost
600,000 of Kosovo's 1.6 million ethnic Albanians have left their
homes and crossed into neighboring lands. Ominously, NATO said last
week, Yugoslav forces were herding together another 850,000
Albanians inside Kosovo, possibly preparing to expel them, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The element in this equation that may make this refugee crisis
different from others is that the Albanian Kosovars are more than
mere byproducts of war. They were the declared reason that NATO
went to war. One analyst calls them the ``glue'' of NATO
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   And for NATO's European members, the motives are not simply
altruistic. Even if the refugees don't flood into Western Europe
itself, NATO officials fear that their continued presence may upset
the delicate ethnic balance of Yugoslavia's neighbors, increasing
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond Kosovo, diplomats and relief groups agree that
finding a solution for refugee crises has become one of the world's
greatest challenges. At the century's end, some 22 million people
have been displaced by wars and civil conflicts. Some 2.6 million
Afghan refugees languish in Pakistan, Iran, and camps in other
countries, according to the U.N. Children's Fund. The total number
of African refugees, displaced persons, and still vulnerable
returnees now exceeds 7 million. At least 3.2 million Palestinians
are still classified as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking about these people has evolved over the past
decade,'' said David Malone, the president of the International
Peace Academy, an independent group that studies the United
Nations. ``Before they were considered unfortunate victims of war
whose plight had to be addressed. Over time they have become a
major factor in peace and security. They are increasingly seen as a
source of instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly the world is acknowledging that many of these people will
never go home. Still, ``permanent refugees'' pose daunting
challenges not only to relief groups but to the states that might
accommodate them. ``We hate that term; we never use it,'' said
Karen Koning AbuZayd, the refugee commissioner's Washington
representative. ``The term refugee implies a durable solution _
going home, being locally integrated, or being resettled.''
</P>
<P>
   Her agency's insistence on repatriation has sometimes been
criticized when people are encouraged to return to politically and
economically fragile countries. But Ms. AbuZayd says that it is
what most refugees want. In this respect, she said, her agency can
be proud. The numbers of people it cares for had dropped in recent
years from 27 million to 22.5 million, half of them refugees. The
agency has been closing down offices in Central America and Asia.
About 1.7 million Mozambican refugees have gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, in addition to contributing to U.N. relief
efforts, have been extraordinarily generous in taking people in.
Iran, she notes, is the world's biggest refugee host. In the
Balkans, the biggest host has been Yugoslavia, which has had to
accommodate Serbs driven out of Croatia and parts of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But taking in refugees is not what NATO has been talking about.
Getting them home is. And the Bosnian experience may be
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995 specified
that refugees could return home, but achieving safety for them in
their old neighborhoods was another matter. By mid 1997, Helton
says, about 300,000 refugees and displaced people had returned
home, but very few of these went to areas where they would be in an
ethnic minority. Meanwhile, 900,000 remained internally displaced
and another 900,000 live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Malone thinks that if Kosovo is cleared of Yugoslav pressure,
the refugees will return. ``So it's important for NATO to decide
soon what kind of Kosovo it wants and can achieve,'' he said. ``An
independent state? An international protectorate? A combination of
the two?''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, diplomats and relief workers have begun to wonder
what precedents are being set in Kosovo. Some think the crisis is
only receiving great attention because these refugees are
Europeans, and few lessons will be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Rubenstein, executive director of Physicians for Human
Rights, a private group, has another fear: ``If intervention to
save peoples' lives fails this time and people are not protected or
permitted to return, the impetus to try again next time may simply
not be there.''

   China Stole Design of U.S. Nuclear Warhead
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the furor over China's theft of America's nuclear
secrets began last month, President Clinton said he wasn't so sure
any spying had taken place. But a government report seems to have
stopped the debate. The new analysis concludes that in the 1980s
China stole design information related to America's most advanced
nuclear warhead from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on a select House
panel investigating allegations of illicit transfers of technology
to China met with Clinton Thursday to discuss incidents of Chinese
espionage, including what they described as ``current and ongoing''
problems.

   The American economy is booming and increasing its imports while
much of the world is drifting in economic doldrums with a
diminishing appetite for American goods. The result has sharply
increased the American trade deficit, which in February reached
$19.4 billion. The deficit renewed debate over just how ``free''
the nation's trade policies should be.

   The zoning theory behind Manhattan's landscape since 1961 is
called ``tower in the park.'' As in: throw down some concrete, call

around like chess pieces, and those ``parks'' become giant ashtrays
for the shiver-and-puff crowd. Now city planners, calling the old

   Signs of Bygone Days
</P>
<P>
   The age of the American tobacco billboard is over as part of
last year's settlement between tobacco producers and 46 states to
resolve all state claims for health costs related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   These signs gave smoking 50-foot-high credibility and romance,
the theory goes, tempting more people to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pollay, a marketing professor at the University of
British Columbia, says Big Tobacco will simply shift promotion
dollars elsewhere: ``It's like squeezing a balloon. You can shut
down one media, but the problem just moves somewhere else.''
Outsize tobacco signs, around for over a century, were largely
eclipsed by television spots until the early '70s, when smoking ads
were taken off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Something, though, is lost. Tobacco billboards _ whether the
Camel smoke rings in Times Square, the Marlboro Man looming over
Sunset Strip or the old Mail Pouch signs on the sides of barns _
have been a vital piece of this country's landscape, and some
people lament the passing of a genuine art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a time when they will be hanging in craft
museums on the wall next to patchwork quilts,'' the architect
Robert Venturi said of the billboards. Some pre-1970 Mail Pouch
signs, in fact, are now federally protected landmarks. Joe Camel,

   You may have heard that the new ``Star Wars'' movie is supposed
to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. How could you not have
heard _ given the torrential promotion surrounding ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phanton Menace,'' coming next month to a multiplex
near you with a milelong line and maybe a couple of kids getting on
your nerves?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's something curious about all that hype: It's showing
signs of being a little bored with itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last month CBS' ``60 Minutes'' dwelled not on the film itself,
but on the inability of the director George Lucas, a divorced
adoptive father, to find love.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has very high standards,'' the director Francis Ford
Coppola, a Lucas friend, tells Leslie Stahl. ``I mean, he wants
Queen Noor, or Grace Kelly, or someone. She can't be too tall, and
she has to be wonderful with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vanity Fair finds Natalie Portman less than
completely fulfilled after portraying Queen Amidala in the film:
The Long Island, N.Y., teen-ager has decided that acting is
something she can take or leave. ``It's so limiting to say, `This
is it for the rest of my life,''' she says. ``There are so many
things that interest me _ I love math, science, literature,
languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, who plays a Jedi master, is similarly blase about
his ``Star Wars'' encounter in an interview with Movieline: ``I'm
46 years of age. I'm married with two kids. I love to fly-fish.
That will never change. At the end of the day, you know something?
It's just a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ewan McGregor, who plays the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, told the
BBC he found making the movie ``the epitome of tedium.'' In the
magazine GQ, he as much as says that ``Star Wars'' fans should get
a life: ``Suddenly, all these people are coming to me with posters
to sign. `May the Force be with you.' People have actually said
that to me. `May the Force be with you, Ewan.' I think that's quite
batty.''

   China Stole Design of U.S. Nuclear Warhead
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the furor over China's theft of America's nuclear
secrets began last month, President Clinton said he wasn't so sure
any spying had taken place. But a government report seems to have
stopped the debate. The new analysis concludes that in the 1980s
China stole design information related to America's most advanced
nuclear warhead from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on a select House
panel investigating allegations of illicit transfers of technology
to China met with Clinton Thursday to discuss incidents of Chinese
espionage, including what they described as ``current and ongoing''
problems.

   For all the words that have been spilled to describe the
strategic, military, and bruisingly human dimensions of the
conflict in Kosovo, it is the images that linger. A crying child. A
hillside of houses, burning in unison. The corpse of an ethnic
Albanian lying in the rubble of an explosion. A grainy
black-and-white video of a railroad bridge in a NATO bomber's
sights, then a train coming out of nowhere, and an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The images carry obvious messages. Which is the problem. What
journalists see of the air war is what the NATO allies want them to
see. What they see of the destruction of Kosovo and the bombardment
of Yugoslavia is what the Yugoslavs want them to see. Only on the
borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the vast vistas of refugee
misery, do journalists have relatively free access and some ability
to cross-check information.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question in my mind we are seeing from NATO what
NATO wants us to see,'' said Al Ortiz, executive producer of the
CBS Evening News with Dan Rather. Still, he said, there is a
difference between the images NATO offers and those that emerge
from Yugoslav control. With NATO, ``You're also able to challenge
and question and dig back and check with sources,'' he said.
``You're not able to do that on the Serbian government side.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of verifying images from isolated or carefully
controlled sites has dogged photo agencies since people first
mouthed the untrue truism, ``pictures don't lie.'' Before the
digital era, photographs were manipulated with artful cropping or
darkroom retouching. In 1906, Frederick Cook took a picture of
himself supposedly atop Alaska's Mount McKinley _ but he wasn't
really there. Soviet authorities routinely airbrushed cosmonauts
and commissars out of pictures when they became inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   In a war, when propaganda is a weapon, manipulated images are a
chronic problem. Some are scrapped, but others are passed on to the
public hemmed in with caveats. In effect, the news organizations
seem to be saying, here is an image. You decide what it means.
</P>
<P>
   One of the starkest images from the Kosovo conflict raised the
eyebrows of photo editors when it came onto their computer screens
10 days ago. Nonetheless, it became the leading photograph in Time
and Newsweek last week.
</P>
<P>
   The image, which traveled from the camera of a freelance
photographer to a transmitter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then
through the hands of editors in Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, and
Washington, shows the corpse of a middle-aged man. He is lying in a
crater that could have been created by a bomb or artillery strike.
In the background, on a truck, are other bodies, charred and
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   But the body in the foreground is achingly whole, save for an
angry red cavity that covers his calf. The Yugoslav authorities who
took journalists to the site said he was an Albanian refugee
killed, like the others in the image, by a NATO bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mann, Agence France-Presse's director of photography for
North and South America, was at the end of the chain of editors who
passed the photo on. ``I thought, `They picked up that body and
threw it in there,''' she said. ``But I can't substantiate that. At
the same time I thought we had to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other photo and film editors in news organizations around
the world, she is conscious that every image from within Kosovo may
lie. ``We have to question what we're seeing every day,'' Ms. Mann
said. ``You have a sixth sense when you see something _ you know in
your gut something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the corpse was taken by a freelance photographer,
Vuc Brankovic, who, along with other journalists, was escorted to
the site by the Yugoslav authorities. Brankovic was engaged by
European Photopress Agency, for which he had not done much work
before, an editor there said.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Associated Press, which had a television crew at the
site, and Agence France-Presse clearly warned editors of their
concerns. In a caption, AP listed the source as
``APTN/Serb-Controlled Pool.'' Agence France-Press wrote that the
man was ``claimed by Yugoslav authorities to have been killed in a
NATO air raid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operating procedure is to tell everything we can in the
caption,'' said Vincent Alabiso, vice president and executive photo
editor of The Associated Press. ``As far as the editors at the
newspapers and magazines are concerned, they have the photo and the
captions explaining the circumstances. They have to make a judgment
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Agence France-Presse photograph made the pages
of Time and Newsweek last week, much of that context was gone.
Time's tight caption read: ``Whose Fault? NATO admits to a tragic
error, but this photo may have been staged.'' Newsweek's caption
made no reference to these concerns. Its article said that
journalists were taken to a site littered with body parts, ``some
perhaps, repositioned for effect by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report used a different photo of the scene.
Its caption stated unambiguously, ``Victims of a NATO bomb dropped
on a column of refugees.'' The magazine's editor, Stephen Smith,
said he was concerned that the magazine had been too categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Stephenson, director of photography of Time Magazine,
said of the dead man in the Agence France-Presse photograph:
``Clearly the guy was in this attack on the convoy and was killed.
We don't know if he was killed in the attack and was dragged over
there. We don't know if the crater was made by an earlier bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mann, a decision not to transmit the image would have
amounted to censorship. ``You need to have people draw their own
conclusions, given as much as you can know about the situation,''
she said. And she added, ``The fact that all the agencies were
there guarantees that the picture is going to be run.''

   One of the starkest images from the Kosovo conflict raised the
eyebrows of photo editors when it came onto their computer screens
10 days ago. Nonetheless, it became the leading photograph in Time
and Newsweek last week.
</P>
<P>
   The image, which traveled from the camera of a freelance
photographer to a transmitter in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and then
through the hands of editors in Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, and
Washington, shows the corpse of a middle-aged man. He is lying in a
crater that could have been created by a bomb or artillery strike.
In the background, on a truck, are other bodies, charred and
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   But the body in the foreground is achingly whole, save for an
angry red cavity that covers his calf. The Yugoslav authorities who
took journalists to the site said he was an Albanian refugee
killed, like the others in the image, by a NATO bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mann, Agence France-Presse's director of photography for
North and South America, was at the end of the chain of editors who
passed the photo on. ``I thought, `They picked up that body and
threw it in there,''' she said. ``But I can't substantiate that. At
the same time I thought we had to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other photo and film editors in news organizations around
the world, she is conscious that every image from within Kosovo may
lie. ``We have to question what we're seeing every day,'' Ms. Mann
said. ``You have a sixth sense when you see something _ you know in
your gut something is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the corpse was taken by a freelance photographer,
Vuc Brankovic, who, along with other journalists, was escorted to
the site by the Yugoslav authorities. Brankovic was engaged by
European Photopress Agency, for which he had not done much work
before, an editor there said.
</P>
<P>
   Both The Associated Press, which had a television crew at the
site, and Agence France-Presse clearly warned editors of their
concerns. In a caption, AP listed the source as
``APTN/Serb-Controlled Pool.'' Agence France-Press wrote that the
man was ``claimed by Yugoslav authorities to have been killed in a
NATO air raid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our operating procedure is to tell everything we can in the
caption,'' said Vincent Alabiso, vice president and executive photo
editor of The Associated Press. ``As far as the editors at the
newspapers and magazines are concerned, they have the photo and the
captions explaining the circumstances. They have to make a judgment
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Agence France-Presse photograph made the pages
of Time and Newsweek last week, much of that context was gone.
Time's tight caption read: ``Whose Fault? NATO admits to a tragic
error, but this photo may have been staged.'' Newsweek's caption
made no reference to these concerns. Its article said that
journalists were taken to a site littered with body parts, ``some
perhaps, repositioned for effect by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report used a different photo of the scene.
Its caption stated unambiguously, ``Victims of a NATO bomb dropped
on a column of refugees.'' The magazine's editor, Stephen Smith,
said he was concerned that the magazine had been too categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Stephenson, director of photography of Time Magazine,
said of the dead man in the Agence France-Presse photograph:
``Clearly the guy was in this attack on the convoy and was killed.
We don't know if he was killed in the attack and was dragged over
there. We don't know if the crater was made by an earlier bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mann, a decision not to transmit the image would have
amounted to censorship. ``You need to have people draw their own
conclusions, given as much as you can know about the situation,''
she said. And she added, ``The fact that all the agencies were
there guarantees that the picture is going to be run.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 25, have moved. This final budget adds
RANDOM-VIOLENCE-REVIEW in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   On the section dress page:
</P>
<P>
   WARNING-SIGNS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ The boy stalking victims
through a video dungeon in the game Doom, or laughing at the
slaughter in Oliver Stone's movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' might
well be the next person to shoot up a school in some polished
American suburb. But then again, he might be a quiet scholar with
an odd side. How to tell the difference is one of the more
difficult challenges left by Tuesday's carnage in Colorado. By
Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEE-CRISIS-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Yet another specter is
haunting Europe, and not just Europe this time: the specter of the
permanent refugee. With hundreds of thousands of Albanians uprooted
in Kosovo and spilling across the borders of Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro, some diplomats see the crisis as a defining moment in
how the world thinks about the temporarily and permanently
displaced. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HUMOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today, alas, the
pronouncements of politicians seem more humorless than ever. That's
probably because, in this era of heightened sensitivities and
ubiquitous cameras, an off-the-cuff quip can bring you a world of
grief (though politicians' private peccadillos often provide laughs
enough). So whether you're a stolid Al Gore or a relentlessly sunny
Elizabeth Dole, it's best to stay on message while minimizing the
ad-libs. By John Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY-ETHICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Placebo surgery is on the
rise, to the horror of some doctors who say it is immoral and to
the delight of others who say it is time to apply the same rigorous
scientific standards to surgery as to the rest of the medical
profession. And with it comes a host of thorny questions. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREME-MUSIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ The killing spree by two young
fans of computerized gladiator matches and gut-wrenching industrial
rock last week in Littleton, Colo., was a calamity measured in
lives lost and damaged. But the tragedy at Columbine High School
also marked yet another battle over the meanings and effects of
youth culture. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   PROFILING-REVIEW (Washington) _ The spring day was bright and
sunny enough for sunglasses, yet cool enough to require a
sweatshirt and baggy sweat pants. As I walked along a busy street
in the predominantly white northwest Washington neighborhood where
I lived, I hardly thought that my clothing or, more important, my
dark skin would attract the attention of the police. But sure
enough, after a few blocks, a brown and white cruiser from the
Capital Police suddenly pulled alongside. A white officer jumped
out and demanded to know what I was doing there. By Steven A.
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOM-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Long before two teen-aged
boys began their shooting rampage last week at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo., long before violent video games, the
Internet and nihilistic industrial rock music, America's young were
committing occasional acts of destruction and violence. But finding
a pattern is not easy. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-REVIEW (New Delhi, India) _ The political turmoil that has
seen five governments come tumbling down here in just six years is
not merely the result of cantankerous rivalries among the country's
political parties or the often venal, self-serving antics of its
politicians. Even more crucial are profound political changes
taking place in hundreds of thousands of villages where most of the
nation's 980 million people live and vote. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-UNITY-REVIEW (London) _ For most of the half-century it is
celebrating in Washington this weekend, NATO's very existence has
been rooted in the idea of a grand design _ to guarantee the safety
of the West against the East, to forge a common defense of
democracy against tyranny, to prepare, in effect, for World War
III. But now, as NATO's forces press their first true combat
mission in a messy conflict in Kosovo, the allies and their
neighbors are discovering that war is not just about the grand
design of thwarting tyranny, but about niggling details and
political line calls. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-BOMBING-REVIEW (Washington) _ As commander in chief during
the Vietnam War, Lyndon Johnson insisted on having almost absolute
control over what to bomb and when to bomb it. But now, with NATO
unleashing its air power against Yugoslavia, an alliance-full of
political leaders is setting its own parameters for strikes. And
that has bogged down the military task of choosing targets _
complicated enough with NATO's multinational command structure _ in
a morass of competing political aims. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-IMAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ What journalists see of the air
war in Yugoslavia is what the NATO allies want them to see. What
they see of the destruction of Kosovo is what the Yugoslavs want
them to see. Only on the borders of Albania and Macedonia, amid the
vast vistas of refugee misery, do journalists have relatively free
access and some ability to cross-check information. By Felicity
Barringer.

BLAIR'S WAY WITH WORDS ENLIVENS A CALL TO ARMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a media blitz reminiscent of an American
presidential campaign, British Prime Minister Tony Blair has so
captured the message at the NATO summit meeting here that his
detractors are wondering who crowned him NATO's ``King Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair made a grand entrance on Wednesday, announcing that he
would fly to Washington early and go immediately to the White House
to brief President Clinton on his new ideas for fighting
Yugoslavia. It was the first stop on his campaign to sound a call
to arms in the United States to win the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning he was on Capitol Hill, encouraging Senate
leaders to press harder for victory and earning praise from Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C, who called him ``the most eloquent leader in
the Western world'' _ an obvious, if unintended, slight of
Clinton's acknowledged role as leader of the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In those two days, Blair also managed to squeeze in an evening
speech at the Chicago Economic Club _ the first British prime
minister to visit that city _ and spread his message by television:
on CNN's show ``Larry King Live'' after the Chicago speech and,
this morning, on the ``Today'' program on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Blair even self-confidently announced a sweeping new doctrine in
Chicago of ``international community'' that he said was the
underpinning for the war for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all internationals now, whether we like it or not,'' he
said. ``We cannot refuse to participate in global markets if we
want to prosper. We cannot ignore new political ideas in other
countries if we want to innovate. We cannot turn our backs on
conflicts and the violation of human rights within other countries
if we want still to be secure.''
</P>

   Many European diplomats raised their eyebrows at Blair's
behavior, theorizing that he was trying to make Britain the
important link between the United States and Europe. While none of
them would speak on the record, saying now is not the time to
criticize a fellow NATO member, several referred to him as ``King
Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, the White House said he did not feel upstaged.
His aides said rather that he was thankful that the British prime
minister's omnipresence was helping persuade the American public
that the United States is not alone in the war against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. The Clinton-Blair roles called to
mind the way that the former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher shored up President Bush and American support for the
Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact of life that our media has a cultural affinity
with the British and that Tony Blair is much sought after,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``Rather than run from that we
try to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair is not alone in his media blitz. His foreign minister,
Robin Cook, and his defense minister, George Robertson, also took
their cause to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a considerable strength and determination and unity
of purpose among these legislators about what needed to be done,
and a great awareness of some of the deeper and bigger issues that
are involved in that,'' Robertson said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But giving such pep talks to Congress and holding regular
briefings for the international press is foreign to most of the
other European members of the alliance, who are watching the Blair
machine from a discreet distance. French President Jacques Chirac
declined invitations to appear on several American television
programs, including ``Larry King Live,'' even though France is the
second-biggest contributor of aircraft to the air campaign, with 83
planes, including 61 combat jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans and Italians, whose countries are also key members,
have kept equally low profiles. Italian Prime Minister Massimo
d'Alema came to the summit meeting early, like Blair, but he went
first to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York
and ask that the organization find a political solution to end the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   That was not part of the message of Blair, who has been making
almost daily speeches exhorting the British people to support the
war effort since the air campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Private Eye, the British satirical weekly, has dubbed him
``Winstony Blair'' and satirized Blair's message in a recent issue:
``Never in the field of human conflict have so many airplanes
dropped so few bombs on so few targets. We shall not fight them on
the beaches, we shall not fight them in the hills, we shall not
fight them on the streets. They will never surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair considers it his duty, according to his press secretary,
Alastair Campbell, to invigorate not only the British public but
the American public, the people in all NATO counties and even the
Russian public.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Tad Boles' mother bought him a black duster
for Christmas in 1996 because they were on sale at Miller Stockman,
a western wear outlet, for $99.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, Tad's closest friend, Chris Morris, had the
same kind of coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two little hipster sophomores going down the hallway
_ people started calling them the trench coat mafia,'' recalled
Mrs. Boles, who spoke on condition her first name not be printed.
``I personally thought they looked kind of goofy, but they're
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, it seemed like all of Tad's buddies were wearing the
coats. By last year, their girlfriends bought a business-card size
ad in the Columbine High School yearbook, ``Rebelations,'' and
devoted it to the ``trench coat mafia,'' running a photograph of
the group.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the name sounds a little menacing, now that it is
linked to the two young men behind one of the deadliest school
massacres in American history, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   But it started out as just a tease, a name thrust upon the
ragtag group of outcasts by the more popular kids at Columbine, who
seized on the appearance of the dark, ominous-looking dusters as
new fodder for their unending harassment of those on the fringes.
In the yearbook, Harris and Klebold are not even in the picture
(and those who do appear in it are not wearing trench coats).
</P>
<P>
   In the first hours after the shooting and bombings that left a
teacher and 14 students _ including Harris and Klebold _ dead at
Columbine in this middle class suburb of 35,000 southwest of
Denver, the group was described as devoted to Gothic music and
culture, computer video games with ominous names like Doom, and all
things German, including Hitler, whose birthday coincided with
Tuesday's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, members of the group, their parents and other
Columbine students have said it was just a tiny clique of boys who
had long been losers, finally finding a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just a group of friends that hung out like everybody
else,'' said Joseph Stair, who was in the Columbine Class of 1998
and is credited with ``founding'' the group, said Friday on NBC's
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids that did this, they're disturbed,'' Mrs. Boles said
of Klebold and Harris, whom she knew only slightly as Tad's
friends. ``The things that they did had nothing to do with what the
group was about.'' She said the group, ``wasn't about anything else
but hanging out with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   They were into computers. They all played Doom, like Harris. A
Web site attributed to him mentioned the trench coat mafia and
featured drawings of gun-toting monsters and directions for making
pipe bombs. Recently, Mrs. Boles said, members of the group were
more focused on making videos, like the one by Klebold and Harris
that is said to show them killing athletes in a school hallway.
</P>
<P>
   The group used to hang out at Amazing Fantasy Comics in
Littleton, but the manager of the store, Shawn Carey, said members
stopped coming about a year ago because they grew more interested
in paintball and girls. Friends said they were heavily into
role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, and often played the
card game ``Magic.'' They liked to drink shots of ``After Shock,''
a brand of cinnamon or peppermint schnapps.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the group, which had anywhere from seven to 20 members,
wore the black lipstick and black fingernail polish associated with
the Goths. But Klebold and Harris did not, friends said; some say
they were not even part of the core of the trench coat group, just
friends of a core member.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles, a mother of five, insisted that the trench coat
owners were just like any other teen-agers, interested in bamboo
sword fights, ``Star Wars'' and computer games, but also ``the
teeny-boppers bopping at the prom'' and that great American
teen-age tradition, working on their cars.
</P>
<P>
   When Stair was asked about the group's interest in pipe bombs
and other weaponry used in Tuesday's massacre, he just shrugged.
Members were interested in medieval warfare, too, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a fascination, but we knew how to
manufacture them,'' Stair said of the bombs that the authorities
believe were built in Harris' garage and later found throughout
Columbine High. ``It was just something we looked at. We looked at
lots of things. It was just something to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine students said the trench coat group often spoke in
German and wore clothes decorated with swastikas. Klebold was said
to have had a German flag sewn onto his coat. Stair said they took
German classes and read books about Hitler, but ``it really wasn't
a fascination or an obsession at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Denee Taylor, 17, who has six rings in her ear and a stud in her
tongue, has socialized with the group since she came to Columbine a
year ago from Newark Valley, N.Y. The group was ``a little weird,''
she acknowledged, ``but what's wrong with being different?''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Nelson, 18, a Columbine senior who describes himself as ``an
outcast by choice,'' said he had played Doom with Klebold and
Harris over the Internet and, yes, ``they always seemed a little
different to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They dressed a little different,'' Nelson said, noting that
that kind of thing can be stupidly important in high school. ``They
wore the trench coats all the time, 90 degrees, 20 degrees,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The preppies and jocks who rule the school taunted the group in
the hallways with sarcastic jibes of ``nice coat.'' Some Columbine
students said members of the group rarely showered, and were
shunned because of their body odor. One member was quoted in
Saturday's Denver Post as saying that they had been pushed against
lockers and had rocks and lunchroom mashed potatoes thrown in their
faces by jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't dress like them, if you walked or rode your
bike, if you didn't get into sports and weren't athletic, then you
were an outcast,'' said the young man, who was not named in the
Post story. ``It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Koeniger, a 17-year-old junior on the Columbine Rebels
football team, acknowledged that some athletes teased the trench
coat mafia, but said the group often seemed to be asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're different, why wouldn't we look at them as weird?''
he asked, recalling a student last year who wore tight jeans, had
long hair and seemed to never shower.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many groups before them, the trench coat mafia
embraced what started as a kind of epithet and made it their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it up; we were like, oh, look at them, the trench coat
mafia,'' recalled Ashly Beeson, 18, who left Columbine a couple of
months ago to escape the cliques and finish her senior year at an
alternative school. ``It's nothing they gave themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the people in town appear at makeshift memorials
of flowers and banners, sobbing on television about the events that
have overtaken the community, members of the trench coat mafia and
their friends have spent much of the past week talking to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that the arsenal of bombs and other
weapons was more than two boys could carry even under their large
trench coats. If they had help, most people suspect it came from
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles, a large woman in a housecoat, would not let a
reporter talk to her son, who quit school a few months ago and was,
she said, sleeping upstairs in the small house near noon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just kids,'' she said, pointing out that her son plays
the cello, while his friend, Morris, plays the violin. ``All of
them are in shock. They're all destroyed; I don't know, they're
never going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the little ones, even this one's affected, he senses our
moods,'' she said, bouncing her 5-month-old grandson Seth, whose
mother also attended Columbine, on her lap. ``His mom sat here with
us the other day. She said, `We're going to teach our kids
better.'''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO began its second month of bombing against
Yugoslavia on Saturday, ordering a new flurry of strikes against
army barracks and industrial sites, disrupting electricity and
water supplies and again knocking state television briefly off the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting here to commemorate the alliance's 50th anniversary,
NATO's leaders have vowed to sharpen pressure on Yugoslavia's
president, Slobodan Milosevic. On Friday, they agreed to impose an
oil embargo enforced by NATO warships plying the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Although details of that blockade must still be worked out by
NATO's military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, the Pentagon said
allied warships would search tankers suspected of carrying oil to
Yugoslavia and divert them if necessary. A Pentagon official said
Saturday that the allied ships would fire on those that defied the
blockade, first as a warning and then to disable, if not sink,
violators.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's latest step brought a new denunciation from Russia, which
has strongly opposed the raids on Yugoslavia. Russian officials
vowed Saturday to continue shipping oil to Yugoslavia's ports on
the Adriatic coast, Bar and Kotor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blockade is bad,'' Russia's special envoy to Yugoslavia,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, said Saturday in Moscow. ``The problem in
Kosovo can neither be solved by bombing nor by a blockade.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 32nd day of its air campaign against Yugoslavia, however,
NATO showed no signs of easing its raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to intensify the air operations,'' NATO's
spokesman, Jamie Shea, said Saturday morning. He said NATO forces
carried out ``significant strikes'' despite ``some very bad
weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The second day of NATO's summit meeting shifted to a discussion
of the alliance's long-range strategies, including how NATO can use
its collective resources to slow the proliferation of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons. But the air war in the Balkans
loomed over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In opening remarks Saturday morning, President Clinton urged his
colleagues to remember the three American soldiers who were
captured near the Kosovo-Macedonian border on March 31 and remain
prisoners of war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross announced Saturday
that its director, Cornelio Sommaruga, would meet with Milosevic in
Belgrade on Monday to discuss the fate of the three Americans and
the plight of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton attacked Yugoslavia's refusal to allow
the Red Cross to visit the prisoners, as explicitly required by the
Geneva Convention of 1949, despite Milosevic's pledge in a
television interview last week. The Red Cross' spokeswoman in
Geneva, Amanda Williamson, said, ``We will be reminding the
Yugoslav authorities of their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Although cloudy weather limited NATO's air campaign, allied
missiles and aircraft carried out attacks overnight in Yugoslavia's
second- and third-largest cities after Belgrade, Novi Sad and Nis.
</P>
<P>
   The official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, reported a
particularly intense barrage of 26 missiles during a half-hour in
Nis. The agency said the railway, water mains, an office building
and the Nis machine industry complex, another of the industrial
sites NATO has been attacking with greater ferocity, had all been
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The state television network, whose studios in Belgrade were
struck early on Friday morning, went off the air again early
Saturday and did not resume for five hours. There was no immediate
explanation for the disruption, but NATO forces hit a number of
television transmitters overnight. And officials have vowed to
knock the television off the air permanently.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said the strikes in Nis focused on
the airfield and the barracks of Yugoslavia's Third Army, the force
leading the offensive against Albanians in Kosovo. The officials
said allied forces also struck the refinery in Novi Sad, which has
been hit before, and an oil-storage facility, as well as still more
radar sites and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the deputy chief of the Defense Staff, Air Marshal
John Day, reported strikes on radio relay towers and on electrical
power transformers ``which serve military facilities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the bombings continue, they are starting to take a toll on
Yugoslavia's civilian society. The strikes on electrical grids have
caused outages. Water pressure has become erratic in some cities.
In many cases, water mains are carried on the bridges that NATO has
been systematically knocking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an aspect of civilian inconvenience,'' Shea, the NATO
spokesman, said Saturday. ``I acknowledge that, but it is not our
intention to render the life of Serbs any more difficult than it
already is.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's fuel production and storage have been a focus of
NATO's attacks. Despite the damage inflicted to the country's
refineries and depots, however, Yugoslavia has still received
shipments through its ports. Some NATO commanders have argued for
the destruction of the port oil facilities, but some NATO countries
are wary about significant strikes in the Yugoslav federation's
smaller republic, Montenegro, whose government is seen as less
hostile to the West.
</P>
<P>
   France had objected to a naval blockade, but in a meeting of
NATO's defense ministers on Friday, it joined the other allies in
agreeing to a blockade of those shipments. Several countries agreed
to provide ships, though the size of the armada and the range of
its patrols must still be worked out by Clark's staff in Brussels,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   It could take several days before the blockade begins.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said it was vital to cut off the oil to Milosevic's
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without oil, the Yugoslav military machine will come to a
halt,'' he said.

WHEN VIOLENT FANTASY EMERGES AS REALITY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are Hollywood words, describing fantasies of revenge that
flicker, in some form, through the minds of thousands of hurt and
raging adolescent boys, yet are almost never acted on. ``You all
better hide in your houses because I'm coming for everyone, and I
will shoot to kill and I will kill everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Harris, who is believed to have written these phrases
last year in an Internet message, did not stop at words, but
crossed into the world of action. And as experts in child
psychology struggled last week to extract some kind of meaning or
lesson from the terrifying events at Columbine High School, in
Littleton, Colo., it is this passage _ and the environment that
nourished it _ that they sought to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Too little is known about Harris and Dylan Klebold, the other
student identified as a gunman in the massacre, for mental health
experts to say anything about them as individuals. Nor do most feel
comfortable speculating about people they have not interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the experts said that school shootings, and perhaps that in
Littleton most of all, raise wider questions about how adults can
best help children negotiate the difficult tasks of adolescence.
Among them is learning to sort through and deal with strong
emotions and fantasies _ and to control the impulses to act on them
_ in a society where images of violence are ubiquitous, morality
increasingly relative, and the stresses on teen-agers much greater
than they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Such tasks are all the more difficult in a culture where the
message children receive in movies, music, and even news broadcasts
is that acting violently is a usual, or even preferred, way to deal
with anyone who offends or challenges you.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what propels young perpetrators like those in Littleton,
Jonesboro, Ark., and other communities, remains largely a mystery.
Though psychologists and psychiatrists can in hindsight identify
warning signs of serious trouble, no one can predict which troubled
child will express rage, alienation and impotence in small ways,
which in extreme and violent actions.
</P>
<P>
   Money for research on school violence _ and for mental health
services for vulnerable children _ lags far behind public concern,
experts said. ``This country doesn't think as much about its
children and their future as it does about how to clean up
streams,'' said Donald Cohen, director of Yale University's Child
Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, the challenge is to distinguish the
experimentation and idiosyncratic leaps that are characteristic of
normal adolescents testing their independence from the signs of
more serious difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbine High shootings, for example, reporters have
drawn attention to the Gothic culture, video games like Doom,
violent movies and the popularity of figures like Marilyn Manson.
But none of these things is by itself evidence that something is
wrong, said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many adolescents who go through periods where they
dress funny, wear trench coats, put things in their noses and ears,
and dye their hair pink,'' he said. More worrisome, he noted, is
when it becomes clear that a teen-ager's family relationships are
breaking down, or when adolescents become aggressive, seriously
depressed or highly anxious. And in some cases, he and other
experts said, parents are neither aware of the problem, nor can
they be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can blame a parent only until you've become a parent,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal world, even when parents do not recognize the
signals of trouble, other adults in the community will. But William
Damon, director of Stanford University's Center on Adolescence and
author of ``Greater Expectations'' (Free Press, 1995), said many
communities have lost the necessary social cohesion. The question
that haunts him about Littleton, he said, is, ``Where were the
grown-ups?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people like neighbors, coaches, ministers, police officers
who once did not hesitate to become involved in the lives of
others' children, Damon said, now worry about intruding or are
simply too busy and overwhelmed in their own lives to pay much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are letting a lot of kids in our communities get isolated
for long periods of time,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Adults play a crucial role, said Gordon Harper, associate
professor of psychiatry at Harvard University, in offering children
reality testing and balance as they absorb images in the media and
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play between fantasy and reality is part of life for
everybody,'' he said. ``But historically, excursions into fantasy
occurred in the context of relationships in which the fantasies
could be grounded. The child heard the fairy tales read to him by
an adult, and the kids sitting around the campfire were in a group
with a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Harper said, the Littleton gunmen ``did not seem to
have a counterbalancing force.''
</P>
<P>
   In normal development, the process of learning to distinguish
fantasy from reality begins at an early age, said Cohen, of Yale.
The boundaries are defined in a thousand small moments, a thousand
interchanges between adult and child.
</P>
<P>
   When a 3-year-old boy, for example, tells his mother, ``I hate
you and I want to kill you,'' the mother might respond: ``I know.
You're angry because you want to go out and it's raining outside.
But we'll go out tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Through this interplay, Cohen said, the parent is both letting
the child know that it is acceptable to have and to speak about
angry thoughts and fantasies, and indicating that such fantasies
need not be acted on.
</P>
<P>
   In an adolescent version of this exchange, a teen-ager might
tell a parent: ``My teacher hates me. I know he's out to get me.''
The parent, in turn, might respond by encouraging the child to
entertain another perspective: ``I wonder why the teacher might be
acting this way toward you.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17 and 18, the Littleton gunmen were clearly old enough to
have a firm grasp of death's permanence. ``These were big kids,''
Cohen said. Yet the two students, he said, ``obviously had
fundamental failures in the development of their sense of reality
and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, said Steven Marans, also at Yale's Child Study
Center, the normal work of adolescence _ which includes achieving
autonomy, building a capacity for intimate relationships, and
learning to regulate emotions and impulses _ becomes derailed. And
if the adolescent finds a kindred spirit who identifies with his
rage and isolation, what conscience and self-control is left may
erode, fantasy and reality merge. The result, in Littleton, was
disaster.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The scenes of children fleeing Columbine High
School here on Tuesday afternoon are now seared into the memories
of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But while those images have kept people tuned in to their
television sets _ providing an unexpected increase in ratings of
some news programs _ the equipment and people needed to provide the
images have turned a corner of this town into an overnight
international media village.

   ``They're from San Diego, do you suppose they drove here?'' said
a Littleton resident, Inez Schaffer, looking at the cluster of
satellite television trucks and blue and white interview tents.
``I've seen them from Alberta and from Nebraska. There's one from
Oklahoma City. I can't believe they could get here that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schaffer stood with her daughter, Barbara, looking with
amazement as hundreds of reporters slogged through mud and grass on
a corner of Clement Park, just within sight of the school. ``I'm
shocked,'' said Barbara Schaffer. ``I thought it was in our
backyard, but it's global.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to a tent covering a makeshift memorial where mourners
had left flowers, stuffed animals and condolences, teary-eyed
students had to step over tangles of cables that provided the power
for television camera lights, and make their way past reporters,
some from overseas, looking for accounts of the shootings or tales
of personal sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims wouldn't want their friends and families hassled
like this,'' said Willow McMurray, a 17-year-old student from
Columbine who had come to lay flowers on the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   While some people recoiled from the media onslaught, others
sought it out. ``The Montel Williams Show'' flew eight Columbine
High School students and six parents to New York on Wednesday.
``They wanted a good and safe place to express their grief,''
Williams said shortly after taping the show, which was broadcast on
Friday. ``The town is inundated with the media right now. Instead
of flying me out there to become part of the rest of the media, the
children came here.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, talking to the media was even a relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good to talk to you guys,'' Kevin Koeniger, a
17-year-old senior told one reporter. Koeniger, who had been
interviewed by Dan Rather on CBS News, added that he wanted
everyone to know what had happened at his school, and that it
helped him to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Koeniger's friend Beth Bradshaw, also 17, said she had done
interviews with the Fox Network and ``Good Morning America'' on
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   And others found themselves a part of the coverage as well as
the audience. ``Every night we go home and watch it on the news,''
said Teri Haney, whose daughter is a senior at the school. ``It's
helping us heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those living the story said they found themselves drawn to
watching it on television. ``I am glued to the TV coverage,'' said
the Rev. Bill Oudemolen during a memorial service on Friday for
John Tomlin, a 16-year-old sophomore who was killed. ``All of our
hearts and minds are drawn to it because we can't escape it.''
</P>

<P>
   Similar interest by viewers around the nation was reflected in
the ratings this week. Two networks devoted their newsmagazine
programs to the Littleton killings on Wednesday night and scored
some of their highest ratings of the television season.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at 9 p.m., ``Dateline'' put on a special hourlong
broadcast on the killings in Colorado and scored a 13.2 rating, the
best rating for an hour of ``Dateline'' this season and the highest
ratings NBC has scored on Wednesday at 9 p.m. all season.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m., ABC's newsmagazine ``20/20'' did almost as well,
hitting a 12.4 rating. That was the highest for that program on
Wednesday night this year, except for Barbara Walters' interview
with Monica Lewinsky. (Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, was squeezed both by the other two newsmagazines
and its own plans for a special edition of ``60 Minutes II.'' A
hidden camera report on abuses in a mental hospital had made news
of its own when the hospital involved, Charter Behavioral Health
Systems, sought a restraining order to prevent CBS from
broadcasting the report. CBS blocked the effort in court.
</P>
<P>
   Had the report not been so long-planned and the legal issue not
been deemed so important, CBS would surely have put off the
hospital report for a week and devoted ``60 Minutes II'' to the
Littleton incident, said Jeff Fager, the program's executive
producer.
</P>
<P>
   The competition with the news from Colorado on NBC resulted in
the lowest rating for ``60 Minutes II.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's anniversary pageant is playing on two
stages, as political theater and in the theater of war, and its
powerful rhetoric clashes with the forces of battle in Belgrade and
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was alone in his residence Thursday night
shortly after 8 p.m., reviewing his summit speeches, work left
undone in a hectic week. At that moment, the state television
station in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, exploded in flames, wrecked by
NATO's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 a.m. Friday, black limousines bearing prime ministers
tore through downtown Washington toward the White House, and green
tractors hauling refugees groaned toward a mosque in the Macedonian
border town of Lipkovo. Among the exiles was an old man named Rifat
Bajrami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have made me live like an animal,'' he said. ``For
what? What harm have I brought to them? A man spends his entire
life building a home for himself. Then his life is destroyed by
irrational hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, rescue workers searched the rubble of the ruined
television station for survivors as Clinton took to the world's
airwaves, opening the summit meeting in Washington at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic's forces burn and loot homes and murder innocent
people,'' he said. ``Our forces deliver food and shelter and hope
to the displaced. Mr. Milosevic fans the flames of anger between
nations and peoples.'' The Serbian leader, he said, ``knows only
one way to achieve his aims _ through force.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Branko Novakovic, a retired Yugoslav diplomat
with pleasant memories of his nine years in Washington, looked out
his seventh-floor apartment window in Belgrade at the ruins of the
former Communist Party headquarters, hit by NATO on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Novakovic, who is 78, awoke Friday morning after a fitful night
punctuated by explosions, turned on his radio, and heard of the
television station's destruction _ a dozen dead, many missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very bad news,'' he said over a clear telephone line. ``This
has been bombed, that has been bombed. Many people are living in
shelters, under very hard conditions, and they are very distressed,
psychologically in a poor condition. They don't know what to expect
the next day. They live in fear. Some people cannot bear it. The
bombing goes on, and they don't understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not guilty,'' he added. ``They did not expect this
from the countries they considered friends. They used to like these
countries and now they are beginning to hate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The words of Clinton's opening speech were read to him.
``Whatever he thinks and whoever they blame, this is not the right
way to do it,'' Novakovic said. ``We don't have any idea what the
situation is down there in Kosovo. But to keep the whole population
under siege for so long, this is horrible. It is not human.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 1 p.m. in Washington, NATO's 19 leaders began
speaking in turn, some at length. The shortest speech by far was
from Costas Simitis, the prime minister of Greece, a nation less
than enthusiastic about NATO's air war. It was a kind of parable,
and this was it in its entirety:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, in 1949, the government
troops entered a Greek village and killed two young people. Asked
why, they answered: They were Bulgarian communists. Two days later,
the rebels came and they killed also two young people. Asked why,
they said: They were American fascists. NATO was and should be an
effort to put an end to such practices and such mentalities. NATO
should be an effort to secure cooperation, peace and prosperity. I
think it's a great aim and we must work for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quoted a 1949 speech by Dean Acheson, the secretary of
state who was present at the creation of NATO and who hoped it
would ``free the minds of men in many nations from a haunting sense
of insecurity and enable them to work and plan with confidence in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., the leaders had finished speaking, and the exiles
from Malisevo, a village of 800 homes outside Gnjilane in Kosovo,
were bedding down on blankets laid over newly spread crushed stone
in a cleared garbage dump. They had just arrived at a refugee camp
in Neprosteno, Macedonia, and they told their stories to a
researcher for Human Rights Watch, Ben Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian paramilitary squads had come to the village. They
stole everything they could and separated the old from the young.
The young were told to lie face down with hands behind heads. The
masked men pulled out a list of peoples' names and told their
captives to inform or die. Two men, ages 18 and 20, were shot.
Another man, age 34, was ordered to bury them with his bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that came through strongly was the absolute terror
people felt,'' Ward said by telephone from Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:15 p.m. Washington time when air-raid sirens pierced
the night in Belgrade. A few minutes later, a bolt of lightning
flashed and an enormous thunderclap broke over Washington, setting
off electronic security alarms in the streets near the White House,
a neighborhood on high alert against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:40 p.m., the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
the consensus of NATO's leaders was to attack ``more, not less;
stronger, not weaker.'' The alliance would step up its attack on
the political, military and economic architecture of Milosevic's
power by aiming more bombs and missiles at Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade at that hour, Gordana Ristic, 33, was preparing to
spend another night in the basement-cum-bomb shelter of her
apartment building, a mile from the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really horrible night last night,'' she said by
telephone. ``There were explosions every few minutes after 2 a.m.
This morning I woke up in a totally strange situation. I went to my
job, marketing and public relations, in the center of Belgrade, and
when I came in I looked around to see if everything was in its
right place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: `Maybe this is my last day. Tomorrow things will
not be there. My plants. My computer.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love Belgrade,'' added Ms. Ristic, no fan of
Milosevic, but of late a Serbian nationalist. ``I'm sorry that
leaders in your country are not willing to read history. You
destroy what is material in this country. Buildings. Bridges. But
never people.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter read her some of Clinton's speeches at the summit
meeting. She sounded torn between anger and tears. ``This is the
bottom to which civilization, in which I believed, has gone,'' she
said. ``Clinton is playing a role, singing a song in an opera. It
kills me.''
</P>
<P>
   As she slept, NATO's leaders dined on soft-shell crabs and
spring lamb in the East Room of the White House. Dessert was a
little chocolate globe. Jessye Norman sang arias after dinner. And
as the last limousine left, near midnight, Saturday morning's
all-clear sounded in Belgrade, dawn came up over the Balkans, and
rivulets of people rose in the mountains and began to flow down
toward the mosque in Lipkovo.

AT NATO SUMMIT, CORPORATE SPONSORS PURSUE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the leaders of NATO, meeting here, debate the
next steps in the Balkan war, the leaders of District Cablevision
are hoping their participation in the alliance's 50th-anniversary
summit meeting will bring them more business from Washington's big
convention hotels.
</P>
<P>
   District Cablevision, the cable-television franchise for the
District of Columbia, is among 41 companies that have paid from
$25,000 to $250,000 in cash, goods or services to become an
official sponsor of the NATO summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them signed up many months ago, long before anyone knew
that the summit meeting would be a war council rather than a
celebration. Yet none seems bashful or apologetic about using the
gathering to pursue their commercial interests _ and several firms
said through spokesmen that they actively wanted to show their
support for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Altruism is scarcely the only motivation, so it is no
coincidence that most of the highest-paying corporate sponsors are
large U.S. companies with important business interests in Europe _
like Boeing, TRW and United Technologies. They donated $250,000
each. Intelsat, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon donated $50,000 to
$100,000 each toward the total summit-meeting cost estimated at $24
million _ one-third of it met by corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those companies are defense contractors who make the
weapons being used against Yugoslavia. Boeing and Raytheon produce
the cruise missiles that have devastated Belgrade; Raytheon also
makes HARM anti-radar missiles, while Boeing makes the Apache
helicopter. Northrup Grumman is one of the leading producers of jet
fighters and other warplanes. Like other defense contractors, it
does business not just with the Pentagon but with most of the
defense ministries of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors earn the right to send representatives to
receptions and parties. Along with heads of state, most NATO
countries are also sending trade representatives. And depending on
the size of their donations, some corporate leaders have also been
awarded honorary titles.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Notebaert, chairman of Ameritech, the regional Bell
telephone company based in Chicago, is vice chairman of the host
committee board of directors. The host committee is managing
sponsorship of the summit meeting. Ameritech now controls
Tele-Denmark, the Danish phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the largest foreign investor in European
telecommunications,'' he said in a statement, ``Ameritech is proud
to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   With its $250,000 donation, Lucent Technologies was also named
to the host committee's ``board of directors.'' On Thursday, Lucent
reported a 33 percent increase in quarterly revenues _ helped
greatly, the company said, by strong overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are providing services. Daimler-Chrysler is
providing Mercedes limousines and Jeeps; Motorola, cell phones;
Microsoft, software that is running on the computers in NATO
offices.
</P>
<P>
   In every conference and reception site, delegates and visitors
see bouquets of flowers, donated by USA Floral Services, a
worldwide flower wholesaler, and worth $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers are an instrument of peace,'' said Christina Vaughn,
an executive with USA Floral. ``That is our contribution to the
summit. You know, if two or three of them negotiate in front of a
vase of white flowers, maybe it will help.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the most important thing, the No. 1 goal of our company,''
she finally confessed, ``is to increase the per capita spending on
flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman Public Relations Worldwide donated $50,000, and its
company spokeswoman, Dana Vickers Shelley, said, ``We want to show
our support for the federal government, our support for the global
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edelman _ with offices in Brussels, London, Paris, Madrid,
Milan, Dublin, Frankfurt and Hamburg, among 34 locations worldwide
_ is also providing public-relations services for the summit
meeting, and Ms. Shelley is serving as a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we have copiers that work, phones that work _
that's because of the sponsors,'' Ms. Shelley said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Being a corporate sponsor is not like sponsoring the Olympics,
or the NCAA basketball championship. The flower arrangements, for
example, are not labeled with the floral equivalent of the Nike
logo. But notices of the sponsors are not subtle.
</P>
<P>
   There is little mystery behind Coca-Cola's interest in
sponsoring the summit meeting, or Honeywell's. Both have
significant business in Europe. But what about Potomac Electric
Power Co., the Washington area's electric company, or District
Cablevision?
</P>
<P>
   Jean Davis, a spokeswoman for the cable company, said District
Cablevision agreed to run cable to 12 local hotels in recent days
so delegates staying there could follow the summit meeting on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do our part to make the city look good,'' Ms. Davis
said. At the same time, she continued, ``We are hoping that the
hotel operators will see the benefits of our service and decide
they want to keep it after the summit is over.''

ARMED FORCE IS ACCEPTABLE TO BELGRADE, RUSSIAN INSISTS  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's special envoy to the Balkan conflict tried
again Saturday to edge the two sides in the war closer to a
cease-fire and a compromise, insisting _ despite earlier Yugoslav
denials _ that Yugoslavia would accept an international military
force in Kosovo as part of a broader peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's Foreign Ministry had said only hours earlier that
the nation would permit only an unarmed U.N. force to supervise a
peace accord, something NATO leaders have unequivocally rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The special Russian envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, met with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for
much of Thursday trying unsuccessfully to work out terms of a
cease-fire. He had said earlier that Milosevic would also accept
``wide autonomy'' for the Kosovo region in return for a NATO
cease-fire and the resumption of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic had agreed to autonomy, a reduction of Serbian forces
in Kosovo and an outside force to supervise a Kosovo peace during
failed negotiations earlier this year. It was unclear how much
Chernomyrdin's latest proposal advanced that position, if it did at
all, but the offer nevertheless represented more than Milosevic had
been willing to discuss since the bombing began in March.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a political party conference in Moscow,
Chernomyrdin said it was time for Western leaders to offer some
compromise in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will convince the two sides to come to a peaceful
compromise,'' he said. ``Yugoslavia has already made a compromise.
Now I shall talk with NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders have set down five inviolable conditions for a
peace agreement, including total withdrawal of Serbian troops from
Kosovo, autonomy for the region and an armed international presence
to patrol the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's statement came against a backdrop of growing
tensions between Russia and the Western alliance over the
Yugoslavia bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov responded to NATO's
decision to put an oil embargo in place against Yugoslavia by
stating that Russia would continue to ship oil there ``in keeping
with our international commitments.'' Ivanov spoke in Cairo, where
he was meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Russia is one
of Yugoslavia's largest suppliers of oil.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have said they would inspect ships on the high
seas for oil products, but they have neither ruled in or out the
use of military force to stop vessels from making deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Russian city of Ekaterinburg Saturday, a bomb
exploded near the building that houses the U.S. and British
consulates, blowing out windows and causing minor damage but no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian security police said they believed the explosion had no
connection with the NATO campaign, which has openly angered many
Russians. Witnesses said the bomb appeared to have been left by a
car in a garage near the consulate building.

DEALING WITH SLAVERY IN THE SUDAN

 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YARGUT, Sudan _ Over the last few years, evidence has solidified
that slavery not only exists, but may be widespread in parts of
Sudan. On a recent day in this village, there seemed little to
dispute that. Seated under trees, were several hundred women and
children. They told stories of abduction and rape and tending goats
for their captors.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been growing scrutiny over the kind of transaction
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 1 million,'' John Eibner, a quietly intense American,
said as he reached into a bag fat with Sudanese money. ``That's 2
million.''
</P>
<P>
   He was counting out cash to pay a trader for 535 of the slaves,
Dinka people from the south taken captive by Arabs from the north.
The cost: 26.8 million Sudanese pounds, about $27,000, or $50 a
person, the price of two goats. In a week, Eibner, an official with
a Swiss group called Christian Solidarity International, bought
freedom for 1,783 slaves _ by far the greatest number since he
started coming to Sudan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of redeemed slaves and groups trekking to the war
zone of southern Sudan to free them has risen, the practice is
coming under fire. Critics say that redemption, which began locally
in the early 1990s, is becoming big business, and that people like
Eibner may even be inadvertently encouraging slave raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the numbers started to increase drastically, that caused
people who follow the slavery issue to have a look at what is
really going on,'' said Jemera Rone, counsel for Human Rights Watch
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rone recently wrote a paper accusing the Sudanese government
of using slave raids as a weapon in its 15-year war with southern
rebels and warning of the dangers of redemption. She worries that
unscrupulous middlemen _ traders who bring the slaves back south _
may increase profits by packing groups of slaves with ``borrowed''
children, and that peace in Sudan may be discouraged if raiders
have a financial incentive to keep the war going.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.N. Children's Fund also raised some questions,
partly in response to the American schoolchildren, in
Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon, who raise money for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to deal with ending slavery as a fundamental
change within Sudan, rather than having to watch human beings being
bought and sold,'' said Stephen Lewis, UNICEF's deputy executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   He said UNICEF officials were working with Sudan _ which denies
slavery exists but concedes ``tribal'' hostage-taking _ to allow a
study of slavery and a mechanism for freeing captives. ``We have to
get rid of the practice, period,'' he said. ``We need a political
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Cox, who runs a British group that redeems slaves,
acknowledged that redemptions were ``a gray area'' but said they
were unavoidable. ``We justify it by saying: It's not the answer
but I don't think you can look a child in the face and say, `I'm
sorry, you have to remain a slave until there is a political
solution,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eibner, whose group claims to have freed 7,725 slaves since
1995, also sees redemptions as imperfect but necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that tens of thousands of people are still enslaved
and knowing that we can get them out,'' he said, ``I couldn't live
with myself and say, `Sorry, I'm stopping because of some criticism
from an ivory tower in London or New York.''' Eibner, 46, is a
native of Valhalla, N.Y., who lives in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing in a field between two groups of women and
children who said, in interviews, that they had been escorted south
after spending as long as five years in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say slavery has long existed to some extent in Sudan,
often involving Muslim masters and slaves who are Christians or
animists. But, they say, the raids picked up in the late 1980s
along with fighting between north and south. According to a recent
U.N. report, an Arab militia known as the muruhaleen and the
People's Defense Force, both aligned with the government, guard a
train that runs from the capital of Khartoum in the north to Wau, a
government garrison in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 miles of either side of the track, these forces raid
Dinka villages, mostly to steal cattle. But they also take hundreds
of captives to carry booty and to be used, the U.N. report alleges,
for ``cooking, cultivation, tending to animals, collecting
firewood, washing clothes and other domestic chores.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the U.N. special envoy to Sudan, also alleges
``rape, forced `marriage' and other sexual abuse amounting, in some
cases, to sexual slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories of the women and children, in three groups
interviewed over several days, were consistent. Achol Tong Nyan, a
Dinka woman about 27 years old, sat on the ground holding a baby
whose bronze skin was lighter than hers. The girl, she said, was
the result of rape by her master, Ishmael.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' she asked. ``I will treat her as my child.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been captured about a year earlier in the town
of Warawar. Uniformed men on horses stormed the village.
</P>
<P>
   She said 250 people were marched north. Ten died of thirst on
the way. Another 20 were shot. One night, she said, she was raped
by 10 men.
</P>
<P>
   After spending time in a camp with other slaves in the town of
Muglad, she said, she went to live with Ishmael. She slept in the
kitchen, washed clothes, fetched water and was forced to have sex.
Then, two weeks before she was redeemed, a trader visited. ``I
don't know what they paid Ishmael, but one day he called me in and
introduced the trader,'' she said. ``Ishmael said, `He will take
you back to your people.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thik Anon Thik, a tall and thin boy of 11, said he too was taken
in a raid about a year ago, kidnapped with his mother and five
siblings from a village called Kuiel. In the north he lived in a
camp with other slaves and tended goats. He said he was often
beaten. One night a guard helped him escape, bringing him to one of
the half-dozen traders Eibner works with. Their business is to go
to Arab homes and camps in the north and offer money for the
slaves, even though they say they would be arrested if discovered.
</P>
<P>
   One trader, who uses the name Ahmed Bashir, said he bought the
slaves for $20 to $80 and averaged about $10 in profit per slave.
He and the other traders who deal with Eibner claim that they only
buy slaves that will be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that such stories are so numerous, and the slaves'
movement so hard to conceal, that the government must know about
the trade, and may profit from it. Another suspicion is that
southern officials, including the rebel groups, are getting a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of redemption say it has, at a minimum, raised
awareness about slavery in Sudan. Eibner defends the program by
saying he will not pay more than $50 a person. He says he will stop
if redemption evolves into a ``free market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slavery long predated CSI's presence here,'' he said,
referring to his organization. ``There is no evidence that there is
any more slavery since we started this. The fact is that slavery is
not primarily economically motivated. The primary motive is
political. The motive is the government using these slave raids as
a way to wage war on these people.''

<P>
   ATHENS _ Anti-American demonstrations, like dinner, start late
in Athens. But for some Greek teen-agers, too young to remember
similar riots of the 1960s and 1970s, protesting against the United
States is still novel.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before protesters and riot policemen clashed in front of
the American Embassy on Thursday night, two sisters, Eleni and
Constantina Vafiadou, sat by a fountain in Constitution Square
expectantly ready to register their anger over the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous to say the bombing is to help humanity,''
Eleni, 18, said over the rally's amplified Serbian music _ the
soundtrack to ``Underground,'' a popular Serbian film. ``It's about
the U.S. pursuing its own expansionist strategic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 16-year-old sister explained the film's allegorical anti-war
message her own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like what Ashley told Scarlett,'' Constantina said,
referring to characters in ``Gone With the Wind.'' ``After all the
war and destruction, nobody remembers what they were fighting about
in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for the Serbs _ and a cultural affinity with the United
States _ is deeply rooted in Greece. But the latter sentiment is
being sharply tested. More than any other country in NATO, Greece
has been struggling between loyalty to the Western alliance and
outrage over the bombing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   While Prime Minister Costas Simitis is attending the NATO
anniversary summit meeting in Washington this weekend and has
restated Greece's support, back home Greeks of every age and
political conviction are voicing fierce opposition to what they
view as an unjust war.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wrath stems from Greek ties to Serbia, a historic
ally and key trading partner that shares the Orthodox Christian
faith. Much of it is caused by anxiety over what a new war in the
region could do to Greece's fragile economy and uneasy borders. But
it is fueled by a revival of anti-American sentiment that, though
dormant, has never really died.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, which has been steering toward full integration with
Europe, now finds itself pulled back into a tragic Balkan history,
and into feelings that the United States played a pivotal role in
Greek suffering. Greeks blame the United States for supporting the
military dictatorship and for failing to prevent the Turkish
invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The bombing has not only created new
fears but has also resurrected old grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, way on the other side of the world, keeps interfering
in something that is not their business, and that will not affect
them,'' Margaret Liaveris, 25, a civil servant, said. ``I find it
so annoying when Clinton says, `Our children need a free Europe.'
Most of their children never even come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Her views, among them a fear that the conflict could destabilize
the region and reignite tension with Turkey, are widely shared. A
recent poll published by Greece's largest daily newspaper, Ta Nea,
indicated that more than 95 percent of Greeks oppose the bombing.
Some 63.5 percent of those polled expressed a favorable view of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. And 94.4 percent said they
had a negative view of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Greek newspapers and television have fanned public discontent,
stressing the suffering of Serbian civilians over the plight of
Albanian refugees from Kosovo. That has alarmed the country's
500,000 Albanian immigrants, who mostly work illegally, and are
viewed with suspicion by many Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask myself, why is Greece supporting Serbia; aren't they in
NATO?'' a 52-year-old unemployed immigrant said, adding that he
relied on the Albanian-language service of Voice of America.
</P>
<P>
   Some Greek journalists agree that there is an imbalance. ``Greek
television shows the exact opposite of what Americans see,''
Stelios Koulogrou, a well-known television documentary filmmaker,
explained. ``On CNN you see 80 percent refugees and 20 percent
Serbs. On our channels it is the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of American news, meanwhile, is newly shaded by the
war.
</P>
<P>
   To the newspaper Ethnos, a center-left daily, the mass killings
at a high school in Colorado last week had a direct link to NATO
bombings. ``The violence that Pentagon hawks are using in their
foreign policy has boomeranged on social life in the U.S.,'' a
front-page headline said on Thursday. ``The evidence is
overwhelming: 10,000 assaults in American schools each year.''
</P>
<P>
   A Greek naval officer who was given a two-and-a-half-year
sentence last week for refusing to serve on a destroyer set to join
NATO forces in the Adriatic has become a hero of left- and
right-wing groups, as well as many in the Greek Orthodox clergy.
Archbishop Christodoulos Paraskevaidis has described the bombers as
``pawns of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Greeks have not taken their anger out on their government, which
has given NATO access to two air bases and its land routes into
Macedonia, and is seeking a cautious balance between loyalty to
NATO and support for a cease-fire. Since the crisis broke out,
Simitis' ratings have risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a silent majority that feels that Greece has no
choice but to be prudent, prudent, prudent,'' said Thanos Veremis,
who runs a foreign policy research institute in Athens. ``We are a
small, weak country and people feel that poor Simitis has no choice
for now.'' He added, ``But that of course could change.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Turkey and Greece have been relatively free of
strain since the bombing began on March 24, but many Greeks
nevertheless worry that the war will reignite that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thrace,'' a 25-year-old engineering student replied when asked
about his opposition to the war. He was referring to the small
Muslim minority in Thrace, whose rights are yet another sore point
between Greece and Turkey, which is largely Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turks could use Kosovo as a precedent,'' he said. ``As an
excuse to demand autonomy for Muslims in Thrace.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like many others, complained that NATO was applying a double
standard on human rights in the Balkans. As Eleni Vafiadou put it:
``Albanians had some rights in Kosovo, but the Kurds in Turkey
don't have any. Why hasn't the United States bombed Istanbul?''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety over the war is free-floating. The Greek stock
market has fallen, some tourism agencies are reporting
cancellations and Greek investment in Serbia, worth more than $1
billion, is at obvious risk.
</P>
<P>
   Greek political leaders and voters speak passionately about the
need to protect borders, fearing that any redrawing of the map of
Kosovo could infect Macedonia or spawn Muslim aspirations of a
``Greater Albania'' including northern parts of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing talk of sinister American goals in the Balkans
that have little to do with defending an oppressed minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America is threatened by an independent Europe,'' said
Leon B. Karapanayotis, editor in chief of Ta Nea, ``and it is no
accident that now the euro is falling against the dollar. The U.S.
is asserting itself in Europe, and Europe is now considerably
weaker. I suspect the U.S. has no reason to feel unhappy about
this.''

<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ In a dusty neighborhood of
wooden barracks here that house 1,600 families left homeless in a
hurricane last year, Yudelki C. Savinon said she appreciated
President Leonel Fernandez's efforts to help the victims, including
starting construction on permanent housing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But even in her gratitude, she longs for another leader whom she
regards almost as a father, one who is 92, blind and ailing. His
name and face have been plastered all over this capital in posters
and murals that proclaim, ``Balaguer _ one more time, out of
necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do anything, as long as he wants it,'' Ms. Savinon, 65,
said of Joaquin Balaguer, the strongman who ruled here for 22 years
and for whom she would vote again.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer was forced to step down in 1996 by a constitutional
amendment that bars a second consecutive term for a president. But
because the measure also prevents Fernandez from running again,
Balaguer looms as a potential candidate for the elections in May
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events reassures some and haunts others among the
nearly 8 million Dominicans. But it hardly surprises anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Balaguer loves power more than life itself,'' said
Milagros Ortiz Bosch, a niece of former President Juan Bosch, and
one of the people who are vying for the nomination of the Dominican
Revolutionary Party, one of three major parties. ``He wants a quota
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Balaguer's candidacy, political analysts
said, underscores how the nation that elected Fernandez in 1996,
expecting sweeping changes, is still in transition from an
authoritarian tradition to modern democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said Fernandez's administration had had mixed
results. He has presided over high economic growth and made the
Dominican Republic an active player in Caribbean affairs after
decades of isolation. Under his leadership, the nation restored
diplomatic ties with Cuba, began high-level contacts with Haiti and
was host to several top-level international meetings, with another
planned for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's admired as a young president with a relatively novel
platform, with an understanding of the need to modernize
institutions and with a very accessible personality,'' Jose Oviedo,
a sociologist at Catholic University here, said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fernandez, 45, a lawyer who grew up in New York, is also
criticized for not having done enough about corruption and
patronage, or about poverty, a fundamental problem for 60 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane that killed more than 200 Dominicans in September
and exposed serious flaws in warning and emergency systems ``showed
how inadequate the state still is in the fulfillment of its
obligations,'' said Anibal de Castro, publisher of Rumbo, a
newsmagazine.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, who inherited the problems from Balaguer, was forced
into an alliance with Balaguer and his Social Christian Reformist
Party to win in 1996. That, analysts and American diplomats said,
has tied Fernandez's hands in making certain changes.
</P>
<P>
   He has also joined the Reformists in decidedly undemocratic
maneuvers to wrest control from the Revolutionary Party, which
dominated congressional and municipal elections in May and now has
a majority of legislative seats and mayoralties.
</P>
<P>
   In one highly publicized incident in January, the police
surrounded the headquarters of the Dominican Municipal League,
through which the central government channels money to
municipalities. The police moved to prevent elections for league
leadership during a fight for control of the institution among the
three major parties. Fernandez eventually called for a dialogue
among the parties, and the dispute is now in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country that is stumbling toward a new way of
government,'' an American diplomat here said. ``It's not pretty.
But it's not particularly violent or repressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties have scheduled their nominating conventions for this
year. Advertising is flooding the news media and the streets for
the ``precandidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer himself has not spoken on whether he wants to be a
candidate. But political veterans say the Reformists do nothing
without his consent. One called the party ``his personal
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Balaguer's chances of returning to the presidency
are remote because his party has less than 10 percent backing in
polls, trailing the Revolutionary Party, with 35, and Fernandez's
Dominican Liberation Party, with 27.
</P>
<P>
   Because no party has a majority, the Reformist push to nominate
Balaguer is a way to maximize its political influence as a swing
force. That makes him more likely to be a kingmaker than a serious
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Balaguer's readiness to enter the fray hinges on his health,
which was set back this year. He was flown to Houston to treat
circulatory problems and the flu. He returned walking better and
looking more alert, many said, and apparently ready to seek a
seventh presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extraordinarily lucid,'' Donald Reid Cabral, 76, acting
president of Balaguer's party, said. ``One is surprised at how many
things he does during a day. He writes. He answers letters. He sees
10 to 15 people a day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Balaguer, who remains a prolific writer and released his latest
book, on ancient Greece, last week, declined an interview request
through Reid Cabral. The former president said he was booked up.
</P>
<P>
   In a television broadcast on Monday about the book, ``Eternal
Greece,'' he looked frail and shrunken, sitting in a high-back
chair, as he listened with semiclosed eyes to speeches in his
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried in a simple language within the reach of all human
intelligence to make available to Dominican youths a fundamental
aspect of the universal culture, that of eternal Greece,'' Balaguer
said in a raspy whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Many Dominicans smile and roll their eyes when Balaguer is
mentioned, saying that nothing about the long-serving former
president surprises them. But some stressed that even when the
country seems to take a step backward, it is going inevitably
forward toward democracy, as shown by the two elections since
Balaguer ruled politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is marching slowly but profoundly toward
solidifying its democracy,'' said de Castro, the publisher. ``In
the next years, we'll see a strengthening of institutions, an
understanding of how the separation of powers works, and we'll have
more accountable gs, no matter who wins.''

 &HT;    Despite bad press, `Parade' on march
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Atlanta-bred playwright Alfred Uhry, the parade
has not passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade,'' his controversial musical about the 1915 Atlanta
lynching of murder suspect Leo Frank, drew sharply mixed reviews
and ran less than three months on Broadway, but Uhry is convinced
``the show will outlive us all.'' Awards may spark interest in
revivals. The Lincoln Center production is the surprising leader
among all Broadway shows, with 13 nominations for the Drama Desk
Awards, announced earlier this week, to be presented May 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade'' is also a shoo-in for Tony Award nominations (to be
announced May 3) if for no other reason than the scarcity of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Uhry, whose ``The Last Night of Ballyhoo'' overcame a New York
Times pan to win the 1997 Tony for best play, noted by phone
Wednesday from his New York home, ``The Tony voters almost never
like a show that's closed.'' Yet there is no overwhelming favorite
for 1999's best musical. ``Fosse'' is a hit, but some observers
question whether an anthology of old material shouldn't be
classified as a revival. Judging by reviews of its Houston tryout,
``The Civil War'' is a long shot to garner good notices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, revivals of ``Parade'' are under consideration at
regional theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Prince Music Theatre in Philadelphia is close to a decision
on whether to mount ``Parade'' in its 1999-2000 season, said
artistic director Marjorie Samoff. Also, Chris Manos, producer of
Theater of the Stars, the summer musical series based at the Fox
Theatre, is considering ``Parade'' for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious piece, and I wouldn't make a penny on it,''
Manos said, ``but it has great qualities and deserves to be seen in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhry, though still smarting from the ``bum rap'' the musical
received (meaning, mainly, its pan in the Times), says, ``I never
had a doubt the show would survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Driving Miss Daisy'' author is delighted by the irony of
Monday's release date of the ``Parade'' cast album (music and
lyrics by Jason Robert Brown). April 26 is Confederate Memorial
Day, the day Mary Phagan was murdered by an unknown assailant while
a parade (hence the title of the musical) moved through the streets
of downtown Atlanta.

COMMENTARY: FROM BRADLEY, A REFRESHING WHIFF OF IDEALISM ON RACE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By   BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I looked around to see who might be yawning or nodding off. Bill
Bradley had been speaking for more than half an hour, and there had
been no jokes, no glorious turns of phrase, no splendidly worded
calls to action. In fact, the former senator who is now running for
the Democratic nomination for president had a tendency to botch
this line or that, and then go back and dutifully say it correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King he's not.
</P>
<P>
   But the young men and women in the Wollman Lounge at Cooper
Union were paying close attention, and their body language was
interesting. Bradley was talking about race relations, a topic that
is talked about incessantly but still makes most people
uncomfortable. Yet as he spoke last Tuesday afternoon the people in
the audience were focused intently on his every utterance, with
some of them leaning forward in their seats, as if straining to
hear at least one clear and intelligent voice in the midst of a
maddening din.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's approach to race relations is an almost irresistible
target for cynics. He did not tell his audience that Americans can
do better, but rather that we can be better.
</P>
<P>
   He said the road that lies ahead ``for those of us who want
better racial understanding'' stretches far beyond the struggles of
the civil rights movement, or the continuing fight over affirmative
action and equal treatment in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task is more difficult,'' he said, ``and more subtle _ but
if we're successful, more long-lasting. It is to vanquish racial
discord from our hearts and spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   As you watch Bradley earnestly delivering his speech you come to
realize he actually believes this is possible. Maybe he knows
something. Maybe it's not so strange for someone who has been a
champion athlete and a U.S. senator (and who thinks he can be
president) to aim incredibly high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about getting beyond the stupidity of racial division
to a time when we can accept each other for who we are,'' he said.
For whatever reasons, probably the quiet sincerity of Bradley's
delivery and the trusting and attentive attitude of his young
audience, the words did not sound platitudinous.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it would take an almost unimaginable effort to
hoist ourselves to the level of social and moral excellence
envisioned by Bradley did not seem to concern him. ``For something
so palpably right to be so demonstrably hard to accomplish only
strengthens my determination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's speech would have gotten more media attention if it
had not been delivered on the same day that the massacre occurred
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. But the speech was not
a one-time thing. Bradley has made his commitment to ``a deeper
racial unity'' a cornerstone of his campaign and insists it will be
a major focus of his administration if he is elected President.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you
wanted to please the boss you talked about cutting taxes,
increasing military spending and fighting Communism,'' he said.
``If I'm president, I want one thing to be known: If you want to
please the boss, one of the things you'd better show is how your
department or agency has furthered tolerance and racial
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   This is risky stuff. The economy and whatever is happening in
Kosovo next year will be far higher on the list of most voters'
concerns than a quest for deeper racial unity. I asked Bradley in
an interview why he had decided to make race relations such an
important part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is one of my most deeply held beliefs,'' he said.
``And it's important, I think, when you run for president that you
share the deepest part of yourself with the people so they
understand who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out soon enough whether a heartfelt commitment to
racial unity is a plus or a minus in a national campaign.
Meanwhile, it's refreshing to have a presidential candidate engage
the subject in a sustained and unequivocal way.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have had a field day with politicians who believe
in little or nothing and are shaped largely by the polls. Now comes
Bill Bradley with, gasp, a whiff of the idealist about him. He
thinks the public is ready for honest leadership on some of the
weightier issues of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.

 &HT;    IRS decision puts tax deduction for skybox leases in jeopardy
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Major Texas universities are worried they could
lose one of their best selling points in leasing stadium skyboxes,
potentially costing them millions in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics directors at Texas schools are watching a dispute
between an Iowa State booster and the Internal Revenue Service over
donors' ability to take a tax deduction on part of the cost of
leasing skyboxes.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the IRS should treat gifts to athletic
departments, for which donors receive the use of luxury suite
seating, the same way it treats gifts for special game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Groff, Texas A&AMP;M University's athletic director, said many
schools are ``totally dependent'' on the deduction. ``If we lose
that ability for people to write that off, it would be a major loss
to athletics,'' he said. ``It would wipe us out, I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year _ if they aren't able to deduct them _ we wouldn't
be able to sell them for half the price,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas officials say revoking donors' ability to
take tax deductions on lease prices could jeopardize almost
one-fourth of UT athletics' $30 million annual operating budget.
UT, which has built 64 skyboxes in the past two years, raises about
$7 million a year through premium seating.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around a 1986 revision of U.S. tax laws
that allowed for the cost of tickets to athletic events to be
deducted under the ``80-20'' rule. The rule said athletic tickets
are not tax deductible. But because some schools were offering
tickets only with minimum donations, the IRS allowed donors to
deduct 80 percent of the donation.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics officials nationwide have applied that rule to skybox
leases for years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa State dispute, booster Rod French paid $200,000 in
1996 for a 10-year lease on a stadium suite. Iowa State determined
the market value of the suite and parking spaces to be $20,520, and
French's corporation took a deduction on 80 percent of the
remaining $179,480. The IRS denied the deduction. French's appeal
is pending with the IRS's national office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Heidenreich, with the IRS's regional office in Dallas,
said there is no language allowing deductions on skybox packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your purpose is to help the school, you give the money with
no strings attached,'' Heidenreich said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics officials at UT, Texas A&AMP;M and Texas Tech University
said they advise donors who buy skybox leases to consult an
attorney when taking any deductions. However, brochures for all
three schools advertise the tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax deductions are a very attractive feature which does
attract donors,'' said Red McCombs, a San Antonio businessman and
UT alumnus who leases a skybox on Royal-Memorial Stadium's west
side. ``It would very definitely have a very serious effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidenreich would not comment directly on the Iowa State case
but said other university donors could find themselves in the same
situation. He said he is unaware whether the IRS is looking at
skybox leases at Texas schools.

SERBS WANT SOME ALBANIANS IN KOSOVO, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Serb authorities in Kosovo say they are
trying to remake the demographic balance of the province and
sharply reduce Albanian power there, according to a senior European
diplomat who was recently in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Kosovo, where all governmental power has been
wielded by Serbs since President Slobodan Milosevic stripped the
province of broad autonomy in 1989, say they hope to have about
600,000 Albanians living there when the war is over, the diplomat
said. That would be two-thirds fewer than was previously estimated
living in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But these Serb officials also seem to understand that they must
do more ``to help their image,'' the diplomat added, ``now that
they feel they have a roughly tolerable level of Albanians'' and
have swept the armed Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army
from most of their strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of brutal population shift has been a feature of
politics in the Balkans for much of the last century. Yugoslavia's
earlier wars this decade saw the Serbs purge eastern Bosnia of
Muslims and Croatia drive out most of its Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said that Kosovo's Serb authorities are encouraging
thousands of hungry Albanians _ who are coming down from the
forbidding mountains to which they had fled _ to return home to
their empty villages.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those Albanians are men of military age, the diplomat
said. Western officials have noted the small numbers of such men
among the refugees pushed out of Kosovo, raising questions about
how many of them remain alive.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat, along with international aid workers, saw about
20,000 Albanians _ many of them men _ moving along the roads near
Podujevo, near the provincial border with Serbia. The Albanians,
speaking to him in a driving rain, said they had spent several
weeks in the far reaches of Kosovo's mountains, still snow-covered,
as Serb forces tried to clear armed rebels from Kosovo Liberation
Army strongholds around Lapastica, in the hills west of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   These Albanians showed signs of long exposure to hunger and
cold, with extremely chapped lips and flaking skin. They said that
they had had little food, and that they no longer felt that the
rebel army could protect them, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said right now they just want security and peace,'' he
said. When asked about food and medicine, they said their families
needed both.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his observations matched those of foreign correspondents
who were taken on a guided tour of Kosovo by the Yugoslav Army last
week. Other aspects of the diplomat's account could not be
independently confirmed because foreign correspondents are barred
from traveling freely to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Andjelkovic, the Serb chief of the Executive Council of
Kosovo, the local head of administration for the province, has gone
to speak to the refugees and urge them to return home, promising
them safety, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Serbs are presenting the situation in Kosovo as
peaceful and claiming that their offensive there is now over. They
say they are busy trying to negotiate a settlement for political
autonomy for Kosovo and safety for returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Serb state television has also shown columns of
Albanians inside Kosovo said to be returning home. Nearly every
televised interview is with a young Albanian man of military age,
as if to undermine Western allegations of mass killings and up to
40 mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Near Decani, between Pec and Djakovica, an area that the
security forces are trying to sweep of armed rebels, the Serbs
``are trying to get people to return to their homes after the
sweep,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is entirely sinister and eerie,'' the diplomat
said. ``Serb authorities try to present the situation as relatively
normal, but one is struck by the presence everywhere of large,
tough guys in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, the security forces wear different-colored ribbons
tied to different parts of their uniforms, to try to discover armed
rebels disguising themselves in Serb uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   There are long lines for food in the cities, with Serbs
complaining of the time wasted getting essentials, but there is no
food rationing, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general impression is of driving through emptiness, with
packs of dogs, animals untended, fallow fields and the growing
season lost,'' he said. ``With most food reserved for the military,
there is the potential for a real humanitarian crisis.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kosovo capital, Pristina, is peculiarly empty, given its
size, and the Albanian part of the town has been evacuated and
looted, he said. But electricity still functions there.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, about 600,000 ethnic Albanians have left or been expelled
from Kosovo since NATO air attacks began March 24 and the Serbs
began their swift sweep through Kosovo. Before spring 1998, there
were an estimated 1.8 million Albanians in the province and just
under 200,000 Serbs, but these figures are suspect, since the last
census was in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations now, Serb authorities indicate a kind of
``revanchism,'' the diplomat said, ``a sense of old accounts being
settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials regularly claim that as many as 300,000 Albanians
moved in from Albania to Kosovo in the last decade, but were never
Yugoslav citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, the Serbs have argued that the Albanians put
pressure on Kosovo Serbs to sell their land and leave the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb litany about Albanians goes roughly: ``They pushed us
out, they overpopulated, they took advantage of autonomy in Tito's
time and they made us sell our land,'' the diplomat said. ``Now,
the Serbs feel they have a chance to rectify mistake after
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, Serb officials say that ``500,000 or
600,000 Albanians are no problem for us.'' They are conscious that
an Albanian-free Kosovo is both absurd and impossible, he said, but
also believe that a sizable number of Albanians in the province
will help protect the Serbs from a NATO ground attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb position is that any Albanian with documents, who can
prove that he or she is a citizen of Kosovo, can return, the
diplomat said. He noted, however, that Serb officials carefully
destroyed the documents of many refugees as they left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a demographic remaking of Kosovo, Goran Matic, a
Serb cabinet minister, denied it. ``We would like all the Albanians
to come back,'' he said, ``all those who can prove that they were
citizens of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic, who belongs to the Yugoslav United Left party of Mirjana
Markovic, Milosevic's wife, is a former information minister who is
increasingly taking on a spokesman's role in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a Kosovo where Albanians won't be forced to leave and
Serbs won't be forced to leave,'' he said. ``There is enough room
for all.''  &QL;

AMID THE FUNERALS, WORDS FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Still reeling from the worst school shooting
in national memory, this community embarked Saturday on a numbing
weekend of funerals for some of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   With emotions still raw, a girl from the loose group of students
known as the trench coat mafia stood at the first memorial service
and apologized before 900 mourners for the actions of the suspects,
also members of the Columbine High School clique.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no sign that they would do this,'' said the girl,
Nicole Makham, of the suspects, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
Addressing a church filled with the family and friends of John
Tomlin Jr., one of those slain, she said on Friday, ``We would just
like to say that we're sorry for what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of loss, as many as 150 investigators
worked on the case, with much of their effort concentrated on
trying to discover whether anyone helped the suspects take about 30
bombs into the school.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators quoted in The Denver Post on Saturday speculated
that some bombs may have been taken into the school last Saturday,
when the school was open for a party after the prom.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, Steve
Davis, said Saturday morning that the authorities had received an
e-mail after the shooting containing what may be a suicide message
from Harris. Noting that the e-mail arrived either Thursday or
Friday, Davis said someone else may have sent Harris' note or it
may be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the possibility exists that it is a hoax,'' he said.
``We want to verify its authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mountain News on Saturday published the contents of
what it said was a note left by Harris on Monday, the day before
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the note, Harris shifted all responsibility from himself to
adults in his world. ``I may have taken their lives and my own _
but it was your doing,'' the note reads.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Saturday he did not know if the message published by
the newspaper was the same as that in the e-mail received by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people, including a teacher and the two suspects, died
in the shooting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a representative of the sheriff's office had said
that there were other people who seemed to have had ``limited
participation, knowledge'' related to the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Saturday that the authorities had not ruled out
another gunman, or any suspects. But, he added, ``We still haven't
named anyone else as a suspect, there have not been any arrests or
charges filed against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continues, a picture emerges of a suburban
world where adults had superficial understandings of the lives of
the two teen-age suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, the two graduated from a yearlong
court-ordered juvenile diversion program in Jefferson County. After
completing the program and anger management classes, both had their
records wiped clean. They had pleaded guilty to breaking into a car
last year and stealing electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeAngelis, the principal of the 1,800-student high school,
said on Friday that no teacher had alerted him to behavior problems
in the suspects, both seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard of the trench coat mafia until Tuesday,''
the principal said, although the group had a small photo in the
1998 yearbook. In his first public comments since the massacre,
DeAngelis said that school records indicated the two young men had
never been ``suspended or expelled or in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, dozens of students have been suspended and
arrested for making what were regarded as threats to carry out
copycat attacks. In big cities, small towns and suburbs like this
one, schools have been evacuated.

SOUTH KOREAN POLICY ON NORTH LEADS TO VACATIONS ON ENEMY BEACHES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Thousands of South Korean tourists will
spend time this summer on mountain trails in an unlikely place:
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most visible breakthroughs for President Kim Dae
Jung's sunshine policy toward the North, South Koreans began taking
tour ships there in November and this summer may even be able to
relax on enemy beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's aim is to demonstrate to North Korea's secretive Stalinist
dictatorship that it will be better off if it cooperates with the
South and opens up its economy. But critics worry that
camera-toting tourists could conceivably end up as hostages and are
also concerned that the Hyundai industry group, which is investing
in the six-year tourist project, will turn over $942 million to
North Korea, the longtime enemy of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai has transferred $25 million a month since December to a
North Korean bank account in Macao in exchange for the right to
develop a tourist site on scenic Kumgang Mountain. In June, the
amount will drop to $8 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that the North will spend that money on guns aimed
at the South. The two Koreas have technically been at war for more
than 45 years, and the border between them has the greatest massing
of hostile troops in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   The North could also spend the cash on sorely needed food and
medicine. Several years of flooding have devastated the country's
crops, creating a famine that is believed to have killed several
hundred thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   The South's government is sending 50,000 tons of fertilizer,
rather than food, partly to encourage the North to rebuild its
farming.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 50,000 tourists have visited the North, spending three
nights aboard a ship docked in a North Korean port. During the day,
tourists are bused to the mountains for hiking along a specially
built road, bordered by a specially built iron fence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists are elderly, and many were born in the
North before the war broke the country in two. But honeymooning
couples and the curious have also been boarding cruise ships, which
sail about every other day. Only South Koreans are eligible, for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the ships will leave daily, but as the season warms up,
critics are increasingly voicing concern that the cash might be
spent on artillery or materials for nuclear arms, which could be
used against the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not give cash to North Korea; we should give
fertilizer,'' said Lee Shin Bom, an opposition National Assembly
member, who opposes President Kim's approach. ``They can buy
materials for missiles from Russia with cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee says that it takes $100 million to launch a missile, like
the one North Korea fired over Japan last August. He says that
while millions of its people are starving, North Korea may not use
most of the money to feed people.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, the
reclusive son of the founding father, Kim Il Sung, may also spend
money on gifts to buy loyalty from his aides. Or the money could go
to strengthen the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would partly contribute to North Korea's military
buildup,'' said Koh Il Dong, a North Korea expert at the Korea
Development Institute. ``But even if the deal was not realized,
North Korea would still stockpile for military purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Koh says that the arrangement will reduce the risk that North
Korea will do something rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a goose that lays the golden egg,'' he said. ``Are they
going to kill it?''

L.A. RESIDENTS MOURN TRANSFER OF BEAT OFFICERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They refuse to go quietly into the night, so they
meet for coffee in the morning. And what happens next could turn
out to be very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Page Miller stops by Sandy Munz's place in North Hollywood in
Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, and they go through the list of
RSVPs they've already received for this mock wake they're throwing
in a couple of weeks for 168 Los Angeles Police Department
officers.
</P>
<P>
   No, they didn't die. They've all been transferred back to patrol
units after serving long stints as senior lead officers dealing
one-on-one with the people in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   They were the closest thing we had to the old beat cop, and
residents involved in Neighborhood Watch programs all over this
city miss them big time.
</P>
<P>
   They want them back, but so far the LAPD brass isn't budging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from a Neighborhood Watch captain from over the
hill in the Wilshire Division yesterday,'' Miller is telling Munz.
``He said they're bringing a couple of van loads of people over for
the memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   The women smile and put a check by another name. It's working.
This small groundswell of grass-roots protest over the passing of
their old beat cop is slowly building into what they and a lot of
others are hoping will be a tidal wave of community anger hitting
City Hall pols and LAPD brass.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Marz have already heard from the leaders of most of
the Neighborhood Watch programs in LAPD's 18 citywide divisions,
and all of them are planning to attend the mock wake with their
members to pay their respects to the dearly departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let these officers go without a fight,''
Marz says. ``We want our beat cops back.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial is a not-so-subtle backhanded slap at Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, who dismantled the program
instituted about nine years ago by then-Deputy Police Chief Mark
Kroeker and expanded over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Kroeker liked the concept of more community policing and thought
it could be enhanced by bringing back a version of the old beat cop
to have a one-on-one relationship with people in the neighborhoods.
Parks sees it a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Parks said that the chief didn't want to talk
about the planned memorial celebration for the officers and that
he's already been out in the community explaining why he changed
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that people develop a relationship working with
one individual, and while we appreciate our officers being thought
of fondly like this, the chief feels it is important that every one
of our officers gains some community experience and is available to
the public as a senior lead officer,'' said Lt. Tony Alba.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of one cop you know working the beat, a sergeant in
each division is now parceling out different officers to handle
calls when they come in from the eyes and ears out in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't working, though, say civilian police community
representatives such as Brendan Breslin in the Van Nuys in the San
Fernando Valley and Connie Holmes in the west San Fernando Valley
who coordinate the block captains for hundreds of homes in their
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me give you an example,'' Breslin said Friday. ``On March
6, I get a call from one of my block captains who just had a drug
deal happen in front of his house. He recognized one of the guys
from previous dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I would call up our senior lead officer, and he'd be
out that morning taking down the information to pass it on to
narcotics officers. But when I called this time, I got a sergeant's
answering machine saying leave a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four days later, I got a call back,'' Breslin said. ``Two days
later, I was referred to another sergeant who told me the
information was too old and of no value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not blaming the sergeants, because they're overworked, but
don't tell me the system is as good as it used to be,'' Breslin
said. ``It isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also troubling, say Miller and Munz, is that the number
of people attending Neighborhood Watch meetings around the city
seems to be dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief says we can still have our monthly Neighborhood
Watch meetings without a senior lead officer being there, but
people on the block come to them (the meetings) to see that uniform
and a face they recognize,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to hear one of us telling them they need to
lock their doors. They want their beat cop.''
</P>
<P>
   So the women continue the fight, refusing to go quietly into the
night. They meet for coffee in the morning and plan their next move
_ a mock wake.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Munz have sent invitations to all the City Hall pols,
with one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked that they come, but not speak,'' Miller said.
``They've already had that opportunity, and now it's our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Mayor Richard Riordan's office has responded. The
mayor won't be able to attend, an aide said. He has a scheduling
problem.

program is to show that we should have tax-funded vouchers, the

 BISHOPS URGE DEBT RELIEF FOR POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic bishops in the United States have called on
the federal government, other wealthy governments and international
lending agencies to grant debt relief to the world's poorest
nations, so those nations can spend more of their resources on
their citizens, rather than on repaying loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19-page statement, released on Friday, the bishops link
their call to the approach of the year 2000, which a growing number
of religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, as well as some
secular organizations, have said ought to be the occasion of a
``jubilee,'' a concept envisioned in the Book of Leviticus as a
time of financial relief for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hebrew Scriptures, the jubilee was to be a time to free
slaves, to return land to its rightful owners, and to forgive
debts,'' says the statement, ``A Jubilee Call to Debt
Forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It was issued by the U.S. Catholic Conference's Administrative
Board, which speaks for the bishops outside their twice-a-year
meetings. In the statement, the bishops said they began from the
presumption that countries, like individuals, had an obligation to
repay their debts. But, the bishops added, that condition may not
apply in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such instance,'' the statement said, ``is when a country
cannot repay its debt without critical reductions in spending for
health, education, food, housing and other basic needs, and when
the debt has become a serious obstacle to development.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar call for debt relief was issued in December by the
World Council of Churches, which represents 339 Protestant and
Eastern Orthodox churches, at a meeting of the council's
policy-making Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishops' statement grew out of a conference on poor
nations' indebtedness, sponsored in October by the Catholic
Conference, at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. The
conference was attended by James Wolfensohn, president of the World
Bank, and Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, along with Catholic officials from the Vatican and
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   One participant, Archbishop Medardo Mazombwe of Zambia, said his
nation's debt was such that ``every man, woman and child owes
$750,'' a crushing burden that had led to a lack of spending on
education, health care, housing and other necessities. The
archbishop is quoted in the bishops' statement, as is the pope, who
recently called for ``reducing substantially, if not canceling
outright,'' poor nations' debts.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, N.J., who helped
arrange the Seton Hall meeting and has been an outspoken proponent
of debt relief, said the bishops' statement, which couched
discussion of the issue in terms of Catholic social teaching, was
meant to ``create some moral ground'' from which possible solutions
could be devised.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCarrick said the bishops were particularly interested in
drawing attention to the issue as the millennial year approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jubilee means something to the Judeo-Christian ethic,'' he
said. ``We can't let a moment like this in the history of our
world, in the calendar of our time, go without bringing the
attention of the world to one of the great tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' statement said the United States, as a major
creditor nation, ``has a special responsibility'' to help find
solutions to poor countries' debt crises.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement also placed responsibility on debtor nations,
saying that the debt relief must include ``accountability'' on the
part of those countries, and that poor citizens are the ones who
truly benefit from the process.

 SUIT TARGETS SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE KEY DESEGREGATION CASE
OCCURRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ One could hardly blame Bill Capacchione for
wanting his 6-year-old daughter Cristina to attend Olde Providence
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The sparkling school set in Charlotte's fast-growing Southeast
quadrant has 30 up-to-date Apple computers in its computer
laboratory, a television studio where students produce and
broadcast programs to all the school's classrooms, and an involved
parents' organization that raised $26,000 for supplies and student
activities last year.
</P>
<P>
   Olde Providence is a magnet school with an enriched academic
program set up as part of a school desegregation plan ordered by a
federal judge in 1969. Some of the school's pupils are assigned
there by lottery to maintain a student population that is 60
percent white and 40 percent black, reflecting the makeup of the
district.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cristina, who is white, was denied admittance to Olde
Providence because she was not selected in the lottery. Her father
sued the school district, charging that his daughter had been
denied admission because of her race. There are separate lotteries
for blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the lawsuit by Capacchione, who was joined by six
other white families, against the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of
Education is under way in U.S. District Court. The suit, which was
broadened by the Reagan-appointed trial judge, Robert Potter, into
a full legal assault on the district's integration plan, is being
watched closely by civil rights advocates and conservative
opponents of affirmative action and school desegregation plans that
are based solely, or in part, on race.
</P>
<P>
   The families are also seeking monetary damages because of the
harm they say their children suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The case has both historic and legal implications. In a 1971
decision, Swann vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, the
Supreme Court allowed federal courts for the first time to impose
far-ranging actions _ including the busing of students _ to
integrate schools.
</P>
<P>
   The school district curtailed the use of busing several years
ago and nearly all of the 12,000 students who are still bused are
black. Still, the school board and lawyers for black students who
have intervened in the case want to retain the desegregation plan
to insure that African-American students have access to some of the
better schools, which tend to be in white neighborhoods, as is Olde
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlotte, after an initial period of resistance, became known
as the place that made'' massive transportation for desegregation
work, said James Ferguson II, a lawyer representing the black
students in the case, as he did in the original case that brought
about the desegregation plan. ``So I think the eyes of the nation
are on this place.''
</P>
<P>
   The white plaintiffs say the fact that Charlotte is under a
federal court order to integrate its schools is no defense against
their complaint of reverse discrimination. The desegregation order,
they argue, is 30 years old. The judge who issued it and monitored
compliance has long since died and the school board has not filed
any reports recently on how well its school integration efforts are
proceeding, or whether such efforts are still practical or needed.
</P>
<P>
   Should the plaintiffs win, and should the court award them the
monetary damages they seek for the alleged harm done to their
children, then the dozens of school districts still under
decades-old court desegregation orders could be vulnerable to
lawsuits from white parents, lawyers on both sides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this case goes in our favor,'' said Lee Parks, the
plaintiffs' main lawyer, ``it's going to signal to a bunch of
districts that they have to bring these desegregation plans to an
immediate close or run the risk of paying damages to parents who
are harmed. There is going to be a price to pay if you try to hide
behind court orders.''
</P>
<P>
   The current lawsuit threatens to disrupt the tenuous racial
harmony that has existed in an area where conflict has been
submerged by a rising tide of prosperity. The case has been a
heated topic in the local newspapers and on radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks say the suit stems from the influx of white
professionals from the North who have helped increase the number of
Charlotte school pupils to 100,000 over the last 10 years, making
it the nation's 23rd largest district, up from from 29th. Many of
the newcomers, drawn to Charlotte's suburbs by the area's balmy
weather, low taxes and booming economy, have no memory of racial
segregation and see little justification for maintaining efforts at
integration.
</P>
<P>
   As she watched her son Matthew hustle around a dirt running
track at Olde Providence Elementary, Naomi Ballard spoke of being a
volunteer at the school office and answering questions from
newcomers who were surprised they could not automatically send
their children to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had moved into the neighborhood because they heard it was
a good school and now they were being told they might not be able
to send their kids there,'' said Ms. Ballard, who is white.
``They're confused. It's like a foreign system to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are particularly incensed over the idea that the white
plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages for the emotional harm they
contend their children suffered from not getting into particular
schools. On the witness stand this week, Capacchione, who moved to
California after the suit was filed, testified that his daughter
``felt she wasn't smart enough to get into Olde Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials scoff at the notion that the girl suffered
any emotional damage, noting that as a result of her rejection at
Olde Providence, Cristina ended up at a school that was rated
academically as one of the top 10 elementary schools in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me how they are harmed,'' said Arthur Griffin, chairman
of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board. ``Tell me how you are
harmed by going to a brand-new school. Tell me how you are harmed
with teachers that have higher credentials. Tell me how you've been
harmed when you have access _ there's been no denial _ to quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks, the plaintiffs' lawyer, agrees that the harm to Cristina
and the other white plaintiffs may seem trivial compared with the
suffering of blacks during segregation. But, the lawyer said, that
should affect only the size of the award, not whether it should be
granted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You might make that comparison and say, `Cristina, get over
it,' '' he said. ``But the board's policy still categorized people
and told them where to go and where they can't go because of their
race. You're talking about degrees of harm. When you get into
constitutional law there aren't degrees of constitutionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the desegregation plan say the lawsuit is part of a
coordinated strategy to attack any state policies, like affirmative
action plans, that confer advantages on blacks and other
minorities. They note that Parks, the plaintiffs' lawyer, led the
legal fight earlier this decade to overturn a Georgia redistricting
plan that had created congressional districts with large majorities
of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Parks does not dispute that he is seeking to attack the use of
race in a number of settings. But he argues that eliminating its
use would merely put the country through some tough therapy that
will not be as harmful to minorities as many fear. As evidence, he
noted that those black representatives in Georgia like Cynthia
McKinney and Sanford Bishop Jr., both Democrats, who saw the
percentage of black voters in their districts plummet as a result
of his suit, still won re-election.

COMMENTARY: MOSES COMMANDS: HUNKER IN THE BUNKER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the actual text of a letter sent Thursday
to the NRA's members by its president, Charlton Heston. We offer
simultaneous captioning, in parenthesis, conveying what Heston must
really think.
</P>
<P>
   Dear NRA Member:
</P>
<P>
   We are writing to ask for your patience, your prayers, and your
presence.
</P>
<P>
   (We're in the crosshairs again, men. The p.c. libs like Rosie
O'Donnell are yelping. Every time some teen-age loser who couldn't
make the football team or date the cheerleader abuses our
pump-action, sawed-off product line, we catch hell. But the
networks will get bored with Columbine. Oklahoma City and Jonesboro
passed. All we need to do is hunker in the bunker.)
</P>
<P>
   We had long looked forward to the 1999 Denver meeting and
exhibitions as a time to conduct necessary NRA business, enjoy your
fellowship, express our unity and celebrate our precious freedoms.
But the tragedy in Littleton last Tuesday calls upon us to take
steps, along with dozens of other planned public events, to modify
our schedule to show our profound sympathy and respect for the
families and communities in the Denver area in their time of great
loss.
</P>
<P>
   (All Columbine needed was armed guards and a more conservative
dress code. No black trench coats, just beige Burberrys. As Jesse
Ventura said, if only the concealed weapons law had passed in
Colorado, students and teachers secretly packing heat could have
cut down those two outcasts. The problem is not that bad guys have
guns; it's that good guys don't.)
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, we have canceled the Exhibit Hall Exposition
and all other seminars, luncheons and festive ceremonies normally
associated with our annual gathering.
</P>
<P>
   (Dagnabit. We know how much you fine citizens love to fondle
those M-2 Carbines and Ruger Redhawks. And the ladies will miss
checking out the ultimate fashion accessory: the ``feminine
protection handbag'' for concealing a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   But we just have to lie low while Clinton and all those bearded
TV shrinks offer psychobabble about healing. Then we resume our ads
instructing America's youth on their right to own a handgun, a long
gun, a black gun, a purple gun, a pretty gun, an ugly gun. There's
nothing like a gun to give a lonely guy a little confidence, to
make him feel the lifeblood of liberty coursing through his veins.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we will only conduct the Annual Meeting of Members at
10 a.m. on Saturday, May 1, in the Colorado Convention Center, as
required by New York not-for-profit statutes which govern our
Bylaws. Saturday night's member's Reception with Oklahoma
Representative J.C. Watts will also remain scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   (Too bad Watts chickened out after we sent the letter. Hey,
let's invite Dan Quayle. As Dan said so profoundly after Littleton:
``Do you really believe that if we had stricter gun control laws in
the state of Colorado that this accident, this tragedy, would not
have happened? . . . So, I hope we don't try to use this as an
excuse to go and take away guns. Let's focus on behavior.'')
</P>
<P>
   Our spirits must endure this terrible suffering together, and so
must the freedoms that bring us together. We must stand in somber
but unshakable unity, even in this time of anguish.
</P>
<P>
   (Just blame Marilyn Manson, Oliver Stone, the Internet, video
games, Magic cards, Goths. Here's a good sound bite: Software makes
people go nuts, not hardware. Guns don't kill people; trench coats
kill people. Guns don't kill people; people who have not reached
closure with their anger kill people.)
</P>
<P>
   That's why we need you, more than ever, to attend this
gathering. Each of us, Charlton Heston and Wayne LaPierre, will
make a major address on the crisis all Americans now face, and we
will do all we can to help your voice be heard.
</P>
<P>
   (Clinton won't be a problem. He sounded so limp, talking about
teaching kids to ``express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.'' The wimpy Democrats are still
scared because we wacked 'em in '94. We'll rev up Bob Barr and the
other pols we own.)
</P>
<P>
   In light of these changes we ask you to give us your patience,
to give the families of Littleton your prayers, and to give freedom
your presence at 10 a.m. Saturday morning, May 1.
</P>
<P>
   (Denver can't keep us out. We paid for this microphone. Lock and
load!)(BOX)

IMMIGRANT MEASURE SPLITS CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last fall, when Cruz Bustamante, a soft-spoken
assemblyman from California's farm-rich Central Valley, was
campaigning to become the first Hispanic official elected statewide
in more than a century, he ran a series of television commercials
that brought new meaning to the phrase ``low-key.'' In them,
Bustamante talked quietly of parents and children and ended by
saying, ``I'd appreciate your consideration for lieutenant
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week in Sacramento, Bustamante made a big noise by
announcing that he not only opposed the efforts of his fellow
Democrat, Gov. Gray Davis, to seek federal court mediation in a
lawsuit over Proposition 187 _ the ballot measure to curtail social
services for illegal immigrants _ but would also file a
friend-of-the-court brief aimed at blocking the governor's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That news landed with a thud in the Capitol's corridors, opening
to public view tensions that had been simmering quietly for weeks.
And it exposed Davis to precisely the sort of criticism, from an
influential member of the state's growing Hispanic political
establishment, that he had hoped to avoid by seeking mediation in
the legal fight over Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was passed by nearly 60 percent of voters in 1994,
but has been tied up in court ever since, and last year a federal
judge ruled most of it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels uncomfortable to be in this position with a
Democratic governor,'' Bustamante said in a telephone interview on
Friday. ``I respect the governor tremendously and probably will be
able to work with him on the other 99 issues that we agree on. But
this is something that is core to me. It's an issue of principle
and of conscience, and I can't back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Hispanic officials here, Bustamante had urged
Davis to drop the state's appeal of a lawsuit filed by opponents of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, who campaigned last year for an end to divisive
``wedge-issue'' politics and opposed Proposition 187 personally,
argued that the California Constitution compelled him to seek an
appellate court ruling _ a contention disputed by some legal
experts _ and sought mediation as an alternative to filing an
outright appeal with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is no stranger to Sacramento infighting, or the
indignities of being No. 2. He served four years as lieutenant
governor under Pete Wilson, his predecessor, a Republican who went
so far as to try to move Davis' offices out of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   So Davis' political advisers regarded Bustamante's declaration
of independence as a virtual declaration of war, and by week's end
some were talking quietly of Bustamante's potential influence with
the governor in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lieutenant governor, for all practical purposes, doesn't
matter,'' one Davis confidant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante's advisers counter by complaining that although Davis
eagerly campaigned with Bustamante last year and basked in the glow
of his alliance with the first Hispanic statewide official since
1871, the governor has largely failed to include Bustamante in
important deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, allies of Bustamante say, the governor did not even
grant him a private audience to make his case against appealing the
Prop. 187 lawsuit, instead summoning him to a group meeting just
before the decision was to be announced. Bustamante declined to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely inappropriate to claim that there's going to
be a real partnership and you then take the most fundamental issue
of the last two decades for this constituency and you don't make
him a part of whatever decision-making process you have.''
Bustamante's political consultant, Richie Ross, said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis aides contend that Bustamante promised the governor last
week that he would urge the parties in the case to work to settle
their dispute constructively, only to have his staff announce
publicly that he intended to ask the appeals court to uphold the
lower court ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bustamante, a barber's son who grew up in the farm town of
Dinuba and now lives in Fresno, made political history in 1996 by
becoming the first Hispanic speaker of the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   During his less than two years in that job, even some of his
Democratic allies said that he was not a forceful leader in budget
and policy debates with Wilson, but he earned a reputation for
candor. ``I think with Cruz, what you see is what you get,'' said
state Sen. Jim Brulte, an influential Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante insisted that he still wanted to be a ``team player''
with Davis, and said his position was really no different from that
of other Hispanic politicians who have been less vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happen to be saying what everyone else is thinking,''
he said. ``Sometimes there's a risk in that. There's a risk this
could damage my relationship with the governor. I hope it doesn't.
I am still on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But allies of Bustamante said Davis warned him last week that if
the dispute continued, the governor would expect Bustamante to step
down from positions to which Davis has appointed him, like the
co-chairmanship of a commission on the states' 21st-century
infrastructure needs.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Davis also said it was unclear whether Bustamante could
even file a court brief, since the governor's request for mediation
means that there is no formal appeal pending.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever retribution they might threaten in private, the
last thing the Davis team wants is a nasty public fight with the
state's top-ranking Hispanic politician. Davis' press secretary,
Mike Bustamante, who is no relation to the lieutenant governor,
went out of his way to sound a conciliatory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor feels very comfortable with the fact that every
day more people begin to see the wisdom of his decision to proceed
with mediation,'' the press secretary said. ``Being a leader means
sometimes taking a path that isn't the most popular path, but the
best path to take.''

PEOPLE TRAPPED IN KOSOVO DESPERATE FOR FOOD, MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Food and medicine are urgently needed by the
tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians on the run in Kosovo, and by
those still living in towns but barred from shopping in Serbian
stores, said Albanian doctors from Kosovo who arrived in Macedonia
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer Leaning, a member of the Boston-based group
Physicians for Human Rights, interviewed 18 doctors who recently
arrived in Macedonia, who reported that many of those living in the
rough or in remote mountain hamlets were ``trapped'' by Yugoslav
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians are still living in the capital, Pristina, and
in the towns of Mitrovica, Prizren and Pec, the doctors from Kosovo
told Dr. Lansing. But they are barred from shopping in Serbian
stores, which are the only ones open, and they are are struggling
to find food.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor, who requested anonymity, arrived last week from
western Kosovo reportedly saying that he had visited 3,000 people
sheltering in the countryside just a few miles outside the town of
Pec. ``Some of the people are living in small homes, but a lot of
them are in the open,'' said Dr. Leaning.
</P>
<P>
   The same doctor reportedly estimated that 15,000 people were
living in the Rugova Canyon, a long river valley west of Pec.
Doctors with them ``have no gauze, no antibiotics, no pain
medicine, no syringes, no intravenous fusions, no needles. They
cannot do anything with no medicine,'' Dr. Leaning said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not die of starvation. But when weakened by
malnutrition, they die of dehydration, exposure or infection,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many ethnic Albanians remain inside Kosovo. Dr.
Leaning said the estimates range from 200,000 to 800,000 people,
dispersed across the whole region.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has no immediate plan to conduct airdrops in Kosovo. The
alliance is concerned for the safety of pilots of cargo planes,
which are slow and heavy and would have to fly low to drop food.
Kosovo's mountainous terrain and the uncertainty that the food
would reach Albanians are also drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   American planes, under the U.N. flag, made successful airdrops
during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. There, however, NATO controlled
the air and could target the enclaves with more certainty that the
drops would reach the Muslims who needed food. In Kosovo, there are
more people to reach, and they are much more scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacking medicines in over mountain trails is considered
impractical and dangerous, since the Yugoslav army has mined a
10-mile stretch along the border of Kosovo to prevent armed
Albanian rebels from infiltrating weapons and supplies, said Luan
Jaha, an ethnic Albanian doctor who recently left Kosovo.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ After being given just minutes to make the
heartbreaking choice of what to take with them and what to leave
behind as they were being expelled from their homes in Kosovo,
thousands of refugees here now are being forced to make another
hard decision.
</P>
<P>
   Local Albanian authorities have sent special policemen into the
refugees' tractor camps to order them to leave Kukes, saying there
are too many people now too close to the border with Kosovo.
Albanian officials are also working on an evacuation plan for the
entire city, which is only 10 miles from the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go now. Tomorrow will be too late,'' the policemen shout
through bullhorns as they walk, carrying rifles, through uneven
rows of tractors that, rigged up with wooden frames and plastic
sheeting, have served as homes to many refugees since they arrived
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes are terrifyingly similar to refugees' expulsion by
Serbian police in Kosovo over the past month. But while some
followed the orders, others have decided to dig in even deeper
here, vowing not to leave until they are forced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go,'' said Abdullah Haziri, 56, ``the tractor goes with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most refugees do not want to stay in the mud and chaos of the
camps. But neither do they want to leave behind the tractors, old
and battered though they might be, that represent just about the
only thing of value besides their own lives that they have left.
Many of these refugees are farmers, with no other motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian authorities are transporting the refugees by bus to
other towns within Albania, and are not allowing them to take their
tractors with them. They fear that if one or more of the
slow-moving tractors breaks down, the road _ the only road leading
out of Kukes _ will become clogged, blocking relief supplies from
coming through.
</P>
<P>
   So the refugees must decide what to do with their tractors. Some
pay local Albanians $15 to $500 to store their machines for a
month, hoping they can return by then.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no guarantee that the tractors will still be here
by the time the refugees come back. Criminals have already popped
up at the camps, and even items that are bolted down get stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees have sold their tractors to local Albanians,
settling for a small percentage of what they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Other men send their families' women and children on buses to
other cities and towns in the region, and stay behind to guard the
tractors. While they may keep the tractor safe, they run the real
risk of being separated from their families because it is not
always clear where the buses are headed.
</P>
<P>
   The forced clearing of Kukes has upset not only fearful refugees
but the relief agencies here as well. Some have criticized the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees for having allowed the refugees to
settle so close to the border in the first place. Now they say the
United Nations should stand up to the police and insist that they
stop.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials reject the charge. ``In our discussions with the
government we really stressed the point that any form of force must
be avoided,'' said Daniel Enders, head of the U.N. agency's
operation in Kukes. However, Enders said, the refugees cannot be
allowed to settle here either.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Kukes is already overcrowded, with around 100,000
refugees living in the fields or doubled up in crumbling
communist-era apartment buildings. While clean water is not a
problem now, experts say it will be once the weather warms.
</P>
<P>
   There also are security concerns. The separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army recruits and trains in and around the city, and
several Serbian rockets landed just outside the city limits the
week before last. At 10 miles from the border, Kukes is well short
of the 50-mile distance from borders that U.N. regulations require
for refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of the United Nations to expel people.
Once is enough,'' said Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N.
refugee agency. ``But these people have no choice. They have to
go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, about 3,000 people who arrived on 200 to 300 tractors
have left Kukes, the United Nations said. But as many as 11,000
people remain, and with them about 1,200 tractors. Some of these
people have lived outdoors, in soaking rains and unseasonably cold
temperatures that have left many weakened and sick.
</P>
<P>
   But while some have agreed to leave, others are digging in, and
vow not to go until they are absolutely forced to. ``They'll have
to physically force me out,'' said Ymer Rahmani, 43, a miner from
the Mitrovica area in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been two basic
groups of tractor refugees: those who never unpacked and those who
put down roots immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Rahmani belongs to the latter. On the day he arrived in Kukes on
his 8-year-old tractor, he paid the equivalent of $20 for wood
strips and plastic sheets. With the material, he built a small
tent, about 12 feet long and 8 feet wide. He dug a trench around it
and covered the wagon behind it with a plastic tarp given to him by
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 days since he arrived, he and his extended family _ 15
people altogether _ have established their own domestic
tranquillity. They have set up the old wood-burning stove they
brought from Kosovo, and Rahmani's wife, Zahide, bakes bread in it
every day.
</P>
<P>
   They also use the stove to heat water that they use to wash
themselves and their clothes. With a neighbor, they built an
outhouse from wood strips and burlap.
</P>
<P>
   Rahmani said he might leave if the authorities could tell him
exactly where he was going, and what conditions he would find
there. And, of course, if he could take his tractor along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never leave the tractor,'' he said. ``It's all I have
left.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A flow of moist air from the western Gulf of Mexico north
through the Plains states will result in an expanding area of damp
conditions. Strong, shifting winds between the ground and 10,000
feet will combine with warm, humid air over parts of western Texas
and Oklahoma to produce potent afternoon thunderstorms which may
spawn a few tornadoes. Farther north over parts of the central
Plains and central Mississippi Valley, frequent showers and a few
imbedded thunderstorms will result in locally heavy rainfall.
Patchy light showers will occur from the western Dakotas to
northeastern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled and cool weather will cover much of the interior West.
Variable clouds with scattered valley showers and intermittent
mountain snow will be common, especially where moist winds ascend
the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front accompanied by showers will bring an end to the
recent mild weather in the Pacific Northwest. Gusty onshore breezes
will follow the front along the Washington and Oregon coasts.
Farther south, the California and the deserts of the Southwest will
be sunny and mild.
</P>
<P>
   After a cold dawn with widespread suburban and rural frost in
the Northeast, abundant sunshine will boost temperatures to within
a few degrees of seasonal values during the afternoon. Patchy
clouds will accompany the arrival of the milder air in upstate New
York and New England. Farther south, patchy clouds and
thundershowers will surround a wavering front in the Southeastern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Last Frost
</P>
<P>
   The growing season is about to begin in many parts of the
Northeast. From the mid-April to late May most of the Northeast
typically has its last frost of the spring. There can be dramatic
variations in frost dates, however, over very short distances. The
heat generated in cities can account for up to 30 days difference
between the date of the last urban and the last suburban frost.
Nearby bodies of water also will help prevent frost. Moreover,
since cold air is heavier than warm, chill collects in lowlands on
calm spring mornings making valleys more susceptible to frost than
hillsides.

VENEZUELAN VOTE COULD YIELD MORE POWER FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ For the last month, Venezuela's new
president, Hugo Chavez, has been demanding that Congress be
dissolved and threatening to declare a state of emergency, which
would allow him to rule by decree.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he also vowed to disband the Supreme Court
after it rebuked him for exceeding his authority. And he has
derided leaders of the main opposition party as ``a nest of dying
venomous vipers.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that contentious political backdrop, Venezuelans will
troop to the polls Sunday to vote on a proposition to convene a
constitutional assembly to write a new charter for this South
American country of 23 million people. If the proposal is approved
as expected, the prospects that Chavez will soon get the expanded
powers he wants will automatically be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is a 44-year-old cashiered army colonel who led a coup
attempt in 1992 that killed dozens of people. But he has been
calling for a ``peaceful revolution'' ever since he arrived on the
scene as an independent candidate last year.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a 131-member elected assembly creating a
constitution that will bring ``a true democracy'' to Venezuela,
which in recent years has become the largest single exporter of oil
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Chavez say his purpose in stirring up the recent
turbulence was to insure that his supporters go to the polls
Sunday. At the peak of the confrontation in mid-April, the
president's followers blocked the entrance to the capitol building
for two days, preventing lawmakers from entering or leaving the
building, and shouted insults and imprecations at the legislators.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, an abashed, discredited and weary Congress
approved an ``enabling'' law that grants Chavez fast-track
authority to rule by decree on economic matters for the next six
months. But he has made it clear that he will settle for nothing
less than a complete and permanent overhaul of the structure of the
Venezuelan state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Institutions in Venezuela have broken into pieces,'' he said
in an interview late last month, ``and it is necessary to rebuild
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we reconstruct the architecture of a political system
that has lost legitimacy and ethical content, whose powers are
worm-eaten and decadent, it will not be possible to carry out an
integrated national project of social, economic, political and
cultural development.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say, though, that those arguments are a
facade for a more sinister scheme.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Chavez has said he wants any new constitution to
allow him to seek a second consecutive five-year term, something
the current charter prohibits. And they contend that the
president's real objective is to establish a dictatorship under the
cloak of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants us to give him a blank check, to sign everything over
to him,'' said Sen. Alberto Franceschi of the Project Venezuela
Party. ``He wants complete power, as in a banana republic, so that
his followers can go to the constituent assembly and propose a
tropical monarchy with Chavez as emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a public letter issued this week, Chavez's predecessor,
Rafael Caldera, said that ``my conscience impedes me from
participating'' in a vote he described as intended to destroy, not
strengthen, the rule of law. He cited as especially dangerous
Chavez's ``insistence on the proposal to eliminate `no immediate
re-election.'''
</P>
<P>
   Protests have also been made about the fairness of the
government's efforts to insure that voters endorse the president's
proposal. Citing equal-time provisions in the electoral code, the
National Electoral Commission last week ordered Chavez's press
office to stop official advertisements and television commercials
urging a yes vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, who won 57 percent of the vote in December's
presidential election, has a job approval rating of more than 80
percent at the moment, according to recent polls. His calls to
sweep away an inefficient state apparatus seem to have struck a
deep chord among Venezuelans, who feel that the country's vast oil
wealth has been squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution of 1961 is a straitjacket that needs to be
removed,'' said Jose Cabeza, a bellhop at a hotel here. ``It was
drawn up not to enable the people to express their will, but to
permit a pack of corrupt politicians to line their pockets and
perpetuate themselves in power.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the outcome of the vote Sunday seems barely in
doubt, with even the phrasing of the issues on the ballot intended
to coax a yes response.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to ``transform the state and create a new juridical
order that permits the effective functioning of a social and
participatory democracy?'' the first of the two referendum
questions says.

STUDENT CRITICS PUSH ATTACKS ON ANTI-SWEATSHOP ASSOCIATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., N.C., Mass.)   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Just as it is about to get off the ground, a factory-monitoring
association backed by the White House is facing strong attacks from
students at more than a dozen universities who assert that the
association will not be tough enough in ferreting out sweatshop
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Harvard, Brown and other universities are making a
concerted attack against it. The association has been joined by 56
colleges, whose officials view it as an important tool to insure
that the apparel carrying their school names is not made in
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   But the students have less faith in the monitoring association
than do their universities, and last week student protesters at
Brown persuaded university officials to consider withdrawing from
the association if it does not meet certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The storm of criticism has been a setback to the association,
which is comprised of human rights groups and seven prominent
manufacturers, including Liz Claiborne and Nike Officials say the
association is intended to prevent sweatshops by adopting a code of
conduct and monitoring factories for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Many students complain that the group, called the Fair Labor
Association, is dominated by apparel manufacturers and does not
require enough disclosure about what monitors unearth. They argue
that the association gives companies too much say over which
factories are monitored and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations are the ones we're trying to monitor, and they
have too much control over the process,'' said Nicholas Reville, a
Brown sophomore from Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring association grew out of a two-year-old group, the
White House Apparel Industry Partnership. The association's members
are expected to begin factory inspections this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intended to provide public accountability for companies
and a system of monitoring,'' said Michael Posner, a member of the
association and executive director of the Lawyers Committee for
Human Rights. ``It doesn't solve all the problems. But to try to
destroy it before it's even up and running would be
counterproductive. Let's give it a chance to work and then build on
what we learn from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many universities joined the association in the belief that it
would placate students who had held protest rallies that called on
their schools to guarantee that apparel carrying their school names
was not made in sweatshops. But as soon as universities joined,
student groups started protesting that move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it provides for truly independent monitoring,''
said Marion Traub-Werner, one of 40 University of North Carolina
students who participated in a four-day sit-in last week at the
school. ``And we don't like that it lets manufacturers choose what
sites will be monitored.''
</P>
<P>
   That sit-in, like previous ones at Duke and Georgetown, sought
to press school officials to embrace anti-sweatshop measures.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Brown announced that it might pull out of the
Fair Labor Association if certain conditions were not met by
October. Brown wants universities and not corporations to choose
the factory monitors and to establish criteria that determine which
factories are monitored and when. Brown also wants the association
to make monitoring reports public and to require unannounced
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Association supporters say many student critics misunderstand
its procedures. They note that while manufacturers can recommend
factories to be monitored, the association's executive director can
choose other factories to monitor. They insist that the association
provides for unannounced inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Karp, Liz Claiborne's general counsel and co-chairwoman
of the Apparel Industry Partnership, said universities were free to
demand that their apparel licensees agree to stricter conditions.
Ms. Karp said the association would not agree to complete
disclosure of monitoring reports, but she said colleges might
require that of their licensees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent over two years putting together a system,'' she
said. ``If it doesn't work, companies, nongovernment organizations
and universities will either not do it or will force changes in the
process.''

TWO TRAGEDIES LEAD TO U.S.-GERMANY DISPUTE OVER COMPENSATION TO
SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Va.)   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The surviving relatives of the Germans killed in
the cable car accident in Italy were getting close to receiving
compensation from the United States, until the issue of the crew
killed in an Air Force C-141 Starlifter five months earlier delayed
the action.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty people on the cable car, including seven Germans, were
killed when a low-flying Marine Corps jet hit the ski gondola's
support cable on Feb. 3, 1998. Last month the Senate voted an
immediate payment of $40 million, or $2 million per victim.
</P>
<P>
   By a grim happenstance, five months before the gondola accident,
on Sept. 13, 1997, an Air Force Starlifter and a Luftwaffe plane
collided 35,000 feet over the South Atlantic, off Namibia. On March
31, 1998, the German government said in a report that the German
crew were at fault, because they were flying their Tupelov 154
eastward at an altitude reserved for westbound traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The crashes were five months and 3,000 miles apart, but both
were instant tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Italian Alps, the crew of the plane, a Prowler EA-6B, saw
the cables less than a second before impact. People in the car
probably had no idea what happened, but plunged about 360 feet to
their deaths. In the midair collision, a crew member on the German
plane saw the Starlifter at the last second, and the Americans
swore and called for oxygen and flashlights as their plane plunged.
Everyone on those planes _ nine Americans and 24 Germans _ was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The two accidents are linked now because in late March, Sen.
Charles S. Robb, D-Va., attached an amendment to a catch-all
spending bill to provide $2 million for each victim of the accident
in Italy. Two days later Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., approached
Robb with new language that would bar payment to the German
families _ but not the families from Belgium, Poland or Italy _
until the German government settled the claims of the American
families.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did not vote on that suggestion, but Robb accepted
it, and it is now part of the package that House and Senate
negotiators are considering as they iron out their other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. Senate does not look out for the interests of the
American servicemen and women, who will?'' Thurmond said in a
statement. ``In this case, it certainly is not the German
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Wunderlich, of Hartmannsdorf, Germany, whose husband was on
the cable car, said: ``I feel very sorry for these women, because I
know what they are going through. But we have been fighting for
compensation for a year now, and now people are trying to use us to
get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond wrote to the German ambassador, Juergen Chrobog, who
responded in a letter, saying, ``It goes without saying that the
families of the victims of the crash off the cost of Namibia
deserve our deepest sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chrobog complained that their lawyers had not filed a claim
until March 30. (The lawyers say the Germans did not establish a
claims procedure until February.) He added: ``I do not think it is
helpful to link compensation issues. Nor is it customary in light
of the close cooperation of our two countries within the NATO
alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he pointed out, the victims of the accident in Italy
were civilians ``and, for the most part, the sole providers of
their families,'' and deserved ``prompt and unbureaucratic
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Monica Cindrich, widow of the Starlifter's pilot, Capt.
Gregory M. Cindrich, that added insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cindrich lives in South Carolina near the air base where her
husband was stationed. She spoke to Thurmond soon after the crash
to lobby for the Air Force to install the same anti-collision
systems that airliners carry. She contends that there should be no
distinction: ``Take the word civilian out, take the word military
out, and you know what _ you still have victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cindrich has a 4-year-old son. She was pregnant at the time
of the crash but lost the baby as a result of the emotional trauma,
she said. Her husband's body was not recovered, and she had to
fight the Air Force to get a plot at Arlington National Cemetery to
bury his flight suit.
</P>
<P>
   After he was declared dead, she said, the Air Force demanded
back his last 15 days' pay, leaving her broke because she had just
used their checking account to pay the bill on his government
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   She receives $1,400 a month in benefits, she said, and in the
beginning could not have met her $1,200-a-month mortgage without
the help of her grandmother, who wired her $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As low as morale is, in the active-duty military community, I
am saying, stick up for your fallen brother,'' she said.

DISCOVERY SUGGESTS HUMANS ARE A BIT NEANDERTHAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new graf before final graf.)  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ill., Mich., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neanderthals and modern humans not only coexisted for thousands
of years long ago, as anthropologists have established, but now
their little secret is out: They also cohabited.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the interpretation being made by
paleontologists who have examined the 24,500-year-old skeleton of a
young boy discovered recently in a shallow grave in Portugal. Bred
in the boy's bones seemed to be a genetic heritage part
Neanderthal, part early modern Homo sapiens. He was a hybrid, they
concluded, and the first strong physical evidence of interbreeding
between the groups in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This skeleton demonstrates that early modern humans and
Neanderthals are not all that different,'' said Dr. Erik Trinkaus,
a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis. ``They
intermixed, interbred and produced offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some scientists disputed the interpretation, other
scientists who study human origins said in interviews last week
that the findings were intriguing, probably correct and certain to
provoke debate and challenges to conventional thinking about the
place of Neanderthals in human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Neanderthals and modern humans presumably were more alike than
different, not a separate species or even subspecies, but two
groups who viewed each other as appropriate mates.
</P>
<P>
   Recent DNA research had appeared to show that the two people
were unrelated and had not interbred. Neanderthals lived in Europe
and western Asia from 300,000 years ago until the last of them
disappeared on the Iberian peninsula about 28,000 years ago. In the
prevailing theory today, modern humans arose in Africa less than
200,000 years ago and appeared in great numbers in Europe, starting
about 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery could, at long last, resolve the question of
what happened to the Neanderthals, the stereotypical stocky,
heavy-browed ``cave men.'' They may have merged with modern humans,
called Cro-Magnons, who appear to have arrived in Europe with a
superior tool culture. In that case, some Neanderthal genes survive
in most Europeans and people of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton of the boy, buried with strings of marine shells
and painted with red ocher, was uncovered in December by Portuguese
archaeologists led by Dr. Joao Zilhao, director of the Institute of
Archaeology in Lisbon. The discovery was made in the Lapedo Valley
near Leiria, 90 miles north of Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing the potential significance, Zilhao called in Trinkaus,
an authority on Neanderthal paleontology, who went to Lisbon and
examined the bones in January.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was about 4 years old at death, had the prominent
chin and other facial characteristics of a fully modern human. But
his stocky body and short legs were those of a Neanderthal.
Trinkaus compared the limb proportions with those of Neanderthal
skeletons, including some children. He said he was then sure of the
skeleton's implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex mosaic, which is what you get when you have a
hybrid,'' Trinkaus said. ``This is the first definite evidence of
admixture between Neanderthals and European early modern humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of the skeleton, determined by radiocarbon dating,
showed that full Neanderthals had apparently been extinct for at
least 4,000 years before the boy was born. ``This is no love
child,'' Trinkaus said, meaning that this was not evidence of a
rare mating but a descendant of generations of
Neanderthal-Cro-Magnon hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus and Zilhao have completed a more detailed scientific
report to be published soon in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences. DNA tests on the skeleton have not yet been
done.
</P>
<P>
   Other Neanderthal specialists reacted favorably to the
discovery. Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University in De
Kalb called it ``very convincing and absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that he had come upon other skeletal material in
central Europe that raised the possibility of interbreeding between
the groups. Though most scholars in the field will probably accept
the possibility of interbreeding, he said, a significant number
will probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The more ardent exponents of the out-of-Africa hypothesis of
modern human origins may be holdouts. They have argued that early
modern humans all emerged from Africa and wiped out the Neanderthal
population in Europe. Whether the relationship was fraternal or
genocidal has been much debated. But many have argued that the two
groups were distinct, with humans displacing and probably
slaughtering their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chris Stringer, an expert on Neanderthals at the Museum of
Natural History in London, who is a leader of the out-of-Africa
forces, said that he was willing to consider the Portuguese
findings with an open mind. He told The Associated Press that the
current evidence was not sufficient to convince him of Trinkaus'
hybrid interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative theory, known as regional continuity, holds that
the earliest human ancestors arose in Africa and spread around the
world more than a million years ago. Modern humans then emerged in
different regions through separate evolution and interbreeding. A
leading advocate of this theory is Dr. Milford Wolpoff, a
paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This find should be devastating to the out-of-Africa people,''
Wolpoff said. ``It shows their theory doesn't work, at least in
Europe. And it shows that fundamentally, Neanderthals are the same
species we are and they contributed their genes to European
ancestry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By now, scientists said, only a small fraction of Neanderthal
genes have survived, the European gene pool having been further
mixed through migrations during the spread of agriculture and
invasions from the east.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolpoff cautioned that it would take more than one skeleton
to tell the effects of interbreeding apart from ordinary
evolutionary changes, the result of genes modifying in response to
environmental stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Mann, a specialist in human evolution at the University
of Pennsylvania, called the Portuguese hybrid skeleton ``some of
the most important data we ever got about Neanderthals in human
evolution,'' but said he was not sure that interbreeding had been
established.
</P>
<P>
   Trinkaus said the discovery ``refutes strict replacement models
of modern human origins'' and also seemed to undermine
interpretations of recent DNA research. Two years ago, Dr. Svante
Paabo of the University of Munich in Germany, reported that a study
of the genetic material DNA from Neanderthal remains and living
humans indicated that Neanderthals did not interbreed with the
modern humans.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, scientists said the DNA results reinforced the idea
that Neanderthals were a separate species from modern humans. If
the new findings are correct, though, the two groups were probably
more like different races of the same species.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the DNA research was the interpretation,''
Trinkaus said. ``It's demonstrably wrong. All that they showed is
that Neanderthal biology is outside the range of living humans, not
modern Homo sapiens back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Templeton, an evolutionary geneticist at Washington
University, said that some hybridization occurs without the effects
showing up, for example, in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed only
through the mother. ``But if you look deep enough in evolutionary
time, you find a lot of interbreeding,'' Templeton said. ``That is
what humanity is all about: We interbreed a lot.''

AARON DESERVES TO INHERIT DIMAGGIO'S TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years Joe DiMaggio was always introduced at
Yankee Stadium as ``baseball's greatest living player.'' But with
his memory joining those of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle
and Miller Huggins Sunday in the Stadium's monument park beyond
left-center field, it's time to identify the heir to that
``greatest living'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams was the first name to come to mind, and he's the
greatest living hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays would be many people's choice, and he's the greatest
living center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   But Hank Aaron, now 65, deserves to inherit the title of
baseball's ``greatest living'' player, with the emphasis on player
_ hitter, slugger, fielder, base runner, work ethic, dignity,
leader by example, statesman of the game. The same qualities that
DiMaggio had.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, of course, also has the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody knows he hit the most home runs, 755, but
he also drove in the most runs, 2,297, and scored more runs, 2,174,
than anybody except Ty Cobb. He had more hits, 3,771, than anybody
except Pete Rose and Cobb. He played more games, 3,298, than
anybody except Rose and Carl Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   Until he approached and then surpassed Ruth's record of 714
homers, he did it all without much acclaim. Even after his 715th,
he slipped into relative obscurity again. And now, 25 years after
hitting that 715th homer, he's finally being appreciated again. If
he's bitter, it doesn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good things come to those who wait,'' he was saying the
other day. ``I played in Milwaukee and Atlanta. I had no other
choice but to wait. I have no animosity against anybody. I just had
to wait my time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in New York to promote his book, ``Home Run'' (Total
Sports, $39.95), which celebrates the 25th anniversary of his
breaking the Babe's record. The profits will go to the Hank Aaron
Chasing the Dream Foundation that has already awarded financial
support to 44 youngsters in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to identify and reward elementary and middle-school
students who were working hard to achieve their dreams,'' Henry's
wife, Billye, said. ``It could be acting lessons, computer classes,
whatever. But to qualify for support, an applicant must also
succeed in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where Hank Aaron goes, he is asked if he thinks his
record of 755 homers will be broken someday, especially after Mark
McGwire's record 70 homers last year. McGwire started this season
with 457 homers, but he's 35. And realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can be named the greatest home run hitter is
to beat Hank Aaron's record,'' McGwire is quoted in Aaron's book.
``Hitting 70 home runs is not that record. The greatest ever is
Hank Aaron. He hit 755, didn't he? That is the greatest, and that's
quite a few years down the road for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McGwire averaged 50 homers for another five seasons, his
total would be 707, still far short of 755.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Aaron thinks Ken Griffey Jr., who started the season
with 350 homers at age 29, has the best chance to threaten 755
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey's still young enough,'' Aaron said. ``If he keeps
doing what he's doing, he's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a career-threatening injury, Griffey should continue as
a productive slugger for another 10 seasons or more, especially if
the designated hitter remains. And if he were to average 40 homers
for the next 10 years, he would have 750 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Seattle for opening day there,'' Aaron said, ``I
had a long talk with Griffey. I told him the only thing that stands
in his way is if he got hurt or got complacent. You start thinking
you're better than what you are.''
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey did average 40 homers for the next 10 seasons, it
would mean doing what only Aaron did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what Hank did, you must be very consistent until late in
your career,'' said Frank Robinson, who hit 586 homers. ``I was
ahead of his pace hitting home runs early in my career. But he hit
a lot of home runs late in his career. That's difficult to do.
You're supposed to be on the decline then.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when Aaron was 37, he hit 47 homers, his one-season
high. In 1973, when he was 39, he hit 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anybody would hit 70,'' he said, alluding to
McGwire's record. ``But it couldn't have happened at a better time.
It put baseball back on the front pages. Imagine, 70 home runs.
When I hit my little 40 homers, I thought I was doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   But by hitting those 40 homers, more or less, for so many
seasons, Hank Aaron was doing great, doing what nobody else has
ever done. That's why he's now baseball's greatest living player.

   NEW YORK _ For years Joe DiMaggio was always introduced at
Yankee Stadium as ``baseball's greatest living player.'' But with
his memory joining those of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle
and Miller Huggins Sunday in the Stadium's monument park beyond
left-center field, it's time to identify the heir to that
``greatest living'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams was the first name to come to mind, and he's the
greatest living hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays would be many people's choice, and he's the greatest
living center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   But Hank Aaron, now 65, deserves to inherit the title of
baseball's ``greatest living'' player, with the emphasis on player
_ hitter, slugger, fielder, base runner, work ethic, dignity,
leader by example, statesman of the game. The same qualities that
DiMaggio had.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, of course, also has the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody knows he hit the most home runs, 755, but
he also drove in the most runs, 2,297, and scored more runs, 2,174,
than anybody except Ty Cobb. He had more hits, 3,771, than anybody
except Pete Rose and Cobb. He played more games, 3,298, than
anybody except Rose and Carl Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   Until he approached and then surpassed Ruth's record of 714
homers, he did it all without much acclaim. Even after his 715th,
he slipped into relative obscurity again. And now, 25 years after
hitting that 715th homer, he's finally being appreciated again. If
he's bitter, it doesn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``All good things come to those who wait,'' he was saying the
other day. ``I played in Milwaukee and Atlanta. I had no other
choice but to wait. I have no animosity against anybody. I just had
to wait my time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in New York to promote his book, ``Home Run'' (Total
Sports, $39.95), which celebrates the 25th anniversary of his
breaking the Babe's record. The profits will go to the Hank Aaron
Chasing the Dream Foundation that has already awarded financial
support to 44 youngsters in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to identify and reward elementary and middle-school
students who were working hard to achieve their dreams,'' Henry's
wife, Billye, said. ``It could be acting lessons, computer classes,
whatever. But to qualify for support, an applicant must also
succeed in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter where Hank Aaron goes, he is asked if he thinks his
record of 755 homers will be broken someday, especially after Mark
McGwire's record 70 homers last year. McGwire started this season
with 457 homers, but he's 35. And realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can be named the greatest home run hitter is
to beat Hank Aaron's record,'' McGwire is quoted in Aaron's book.
``Hitting 70 home runs is not that record. The greatest ever is
Hank Aaron. He hit 755, didn't he? That is the greatest, and that's
quite a few years down the road for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McGwire averaged 50 homers for another five seasons, his
total would be 707, still far short of 755.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Aaron thinks Ken Griffey Jr., who started the season
with 350 homers at age 29, has the best chance to threaten 755
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Griffey's still young enough,'' Aaron said. ``If he keeps
doing what he's doing, he's got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a career-threatening injury, Griffey should continue as
a productive slugger for another 10 seasons or more, especially if
the designated hitter remains. And if he were to average 40 homers
for the next 10 years, he would have 750 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Seattle for opening day there,'' Aaron said, ``I
had a long talk with Griffey. I told him the only thing that stands
in his way is if he got hurt or got complacent. You start thinking
you're better than what you are.''
</P>
<P>
   If Griffey did average 40 homers for the next 10 seasons, it
would mean doing what only Aaron did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do what Hank did, you must be very consistent until late in
your career,'' said Frank Robinson, who hit 586 homers. ``I was
ahead of his pace hitting home runs early in my career. But he hit
a lot of home runs late in his career. That's difficult to do.

 &HT;    Kosovo reveals GOP intervention-isolation split still exists
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 10 Republican presidential hopefuls agree on
one thing about the fighting in Yugoslavia. They do not like
President Clinton's conduct of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they accuse the president of ordering air strikes
without a clear idea of U.S. goals and how to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   But, reflecting an age-old split in the GOP, the candidates
differ over whether U.S. vital interests are at stake and whether
American combat troops should be used in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they find themselves on both sides of Clinton, with Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) leading the charge for sending in U.S. troops
and commentator Pat Buchanan saying the dispute between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians is none of America's business.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia have forced the candidates into
an unexpected debate on foreign policy, an area in which many lack
expertise. ``They have been blindsided by world events,'' said Ross
Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist and expert on
presidential elections. ``Few of them feel terribly comfortable
speaking out on these issues. Politically, it's kind of a
labyrinth.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, McCain has been the most outspoken about using
massive force _ including ground troops _ to compel Serbian troops
to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do what is necessary even if there is significant
risk associated with that, or don't do it,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leader in campaign fund-raising
and in opinion polls, has absorbed the most criticism for his
stance, which analysts initially called timid. Bush now favors
doing whatever is necessary to win, even if that includes the use
of ground troops. Former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole also
has moved close to McCain's position, calling for troops to be
pre-positioned in the region so that they could quickly move into
Kosovo if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must win this war and win it absolutely,'' she told an Iowa
audience Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is the only candidate to have visited the region since the
fighting began, touring refugee camps in Macedonia last weekend.
Neither Bush nor Dole has officially entered the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander support the bombing campaign, but they oppose sending in
U.S. combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they would arm the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebels
who have been fighting the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experts say it would take several months to move NATO forces
into Kosovo,'' Forbes said. ``In that time, we could train and
equip tens of thousands of willing Kosovars to do the job
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Five candidates are opposed to any American military
involvement: conservative activist Gary Bauer, Rep. John Kasich
(R-Ohio), former Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.)
and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Quayle have led the way in calling for a negotiated
solution in the Balkans. Kasich doubts that U.S. intervention will
resolve a ``centuries-old civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   The political ramifications of the candidates' stands on Kosovo
are as murky as the military situation itself.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's early, unambiguous statements may have helped him. His
standing has improved in several polls, and in South Carolina, one
lawmaker who had favored Bush told the Los Angeles Times he would
support McCain because of their views on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not clear that Bush has done himself any irreparable
damage.
</P>
<P>
   In Baker's view, the electorate does not typically reward the
boldest candidates or punish the most cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ross) Perot could get up and be a truth teller and so could
(Democratic presidential candidate Paul) Tsongas to some extent in
'92,'' Baker said. ``But it is hard to say that it really gained
them much except an initial burst of attention. The ultimate prize
has tended to go to the more cautious candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in elections in which foreign policy and war have
dominated, the winning candidate has taken a nuanced position, open
to interpretation, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon had a secret plan for ending the Vietnam war in
1968, a position he said differed from the Johnson administration,
but he did not offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to visit Korea if elected.
Implicit in his promise was that he would work out an end to the
fighting, but Eisenhower provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also have to reckon with the fact that most
Americans are not yet paying attention, according to a poll
conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Only 17 percent of Americans are familiar with McCain's
position, which was the best-known among the candidates, the poll
found.
</P>
<P>
   Past elections and the poll results lead Baker to conclude that
the wiser political course may be caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain, for the boldness of his statement, may be
advocating a position that a year from now may be very much in
disfavor,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarity is a good thing, but you can have too much of a good
thing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' Baker said, ``that Walter Mondale was praised for
clarity in saying he would raise taxes.

NATO'S NEXT APPLICANTS PREEN, JOSTLE AND HOPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Embassy of Bulgaria, five diplomats strong, was
humming with hope.
</P>
<P>
   The second secretary, a world-class linguist and stateswoman,
was dashing about, even making coffee for any visitor who asked.
</P>
<P>
   In similar spirit, Bulgaria's handsomely uniformed military
attache would operate the fax machine when need be this weekend as
the NATO summit meeting took over the city _ a dizzying event for
the warrens of resident diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the iron doors of the Bulgarian Embassy, of course, even
the ambassador, Filip Dimitrov, was not above driving himself
hither and yon. He has been without an embassy driver lately but
hardly at a loss as he campaigns persistently and smartly for
Bulgaria to be in the next wave of NATO inductees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for sure,'' said Dimitrov, a former prime minister in
Bulgaria's initial flirtation with democratic government nine years
ago and back now as his nation's resident salesman here for its
case to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't _ what's the proper word? _ mess it up ourselves
we'll naturally, soon, in due time, however you call it, be members
of NATO,'' he declared in an interview as he bolted about the city
from airport arrival ceremony to NATO briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to see as many people as you can and try to bring home
the message,'' Dimitrov said of his special pitch for admittance to
the club during the larger NATO anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sad preoccupation with Kosovo and the NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia, the summit meeting is laced with a certain yearning,
too, on the part of the next wave of applicants for NATO, including
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   These nations desperately want admission to the alliance as a
priceless step in their climb through post-Soviet democratic
recovery and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   On the cusp of the summit meeting, a half-dozen competitive
aspirants are vying like long-distance runners dreaming of victory
as they jostle toward the starting line. Prime Ministers Janez
Drnovsek of Slovenia and Mikulas Dzurinda of Slovakia went jogging
together Saturday morning to symbolize their own rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was ``advanced'' by hired media specialists who,
with some justification, are treating the NATO gathering like the
latest slice of political Americana _ a convention that lacks
balloons but not a horde of back-slapping candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Bulgaria has hired BSMG Worldwide, a public
affairs company, and a separate lobbying specialist, Jefferson
Waterman International, for stratagems on how to approach NATO. ``I
think they're very well positioned,'' said Jim Mezzaros, BSMG's
principal executive.
</P>
<P>
   But Dimitrov seems at least as good a strategist in the cause.
He is an eloquent, bearded lawyer who ignored politics during the
Communist decades but caught his nation's eye as the author of a
best-selling book, a rewriting of the Arthurian legend seen as a
subtle and inspiring parable on the need for political justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to achieve now is not just a safe Bulgaria,
a safe home,'' he said, noting that the nation has enjoyed four
peaceful elections since the fall of Communism and that its economy
is Western-oriented, growing 4.5 percent last year. ``Now we want a
safe neighborhood,'' he emphasized, polishing his nation's
credentials for regional stability. He proudly noted that Bulgaria
is tending to Kosovo refugees at the Macedonian border and
absorbing without complaint the economic disruption of the NATO
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitrov was carrying an important dispatch from home in his
pocket. It is a fresh ruling by Bulgaria's constitutional court
that it would be legal for NATO to use the nation's airspace in its
attempt to defend the Kosovo Albanians, who are on the run from the
forces of Slobodan Milosevic. It is a troth of sorts, an important
credential for the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our day is Sunday,'' Dimitrov declared happily of NATO's
special agenda meetings with neighboring states and NATO
applicants. His visiting colleagues from Sofia, President Petar
Stoyanov and Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova, will be more than
ready for the occasion, the Bulgarian ambassador promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, the agenda brings the representatives of the
aspiring nations into the room,'' exulted Dimitrov, sounding as if
he would be among the first through the door.

SELIG MOVES TO GET MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS INTO DECISION-MAKING
ROLES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his clearest and strongest effort to induce clubs to hire
members of minorities in key positions, Commissioner Bud Selig has
ordered owners to consider minority candidates for openings in five
positions, including general manager and manager, and to give him
their list of all candidates for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a club has an opening in any of these positions, the club
owner must notify me personally,'' Selig said in a letter to
owners. ``In addition, your list of candidates must be provided to
me. I expect the list to include minority candidates whom you and
your staff have identified. I will provide assistance to you if you
cannot identify candidates on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding weight to his words, Selig told the owners he would
discipline clubs that did not ``aggressively pursue equal
opportunities and initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner acted after an April 13 meeting at which
Leonard Coleman, the National League president, and Frank Robinson,
the hall of famer who works out of the commissioner's office, led a
group that urged Selig to take steps to increase the number of
blacks and Hispanics hired for major jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Selig acknowledged writing the letter to owners but declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The positions he listed in his letter were manager, general
manager, assistant general manager and directors of player
development and scouting. No major league team has a general
manager who is a member of a minority group. Since Don Baylor, Tony
Perez and Dusty Baker were hired in a two-month period at the end
of 1992, teams have named 36 managers, not counting interims, and
Jerry Manuel of the Chicago White Sox has been the only black or
Hispanic hired.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which a recipient read to The New York Times,
Selig said that ``significant'' progress in minority hiring had
been made, but ``it has not been enough,'' adding that he was not
satisfied with the overall results or the intentions of some clubs.
He served notice that he will monitor future hirings closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations in this area are very high but clearly
attainable,'' he wrote. ``Your enthusiastic and aggressive support
of this initiative as well as your continued and expected support
of affirmative behavior in all your employment decisions will be
regularly monitored by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest any clubs fail to take his directive seriously, Selig
reminded owners that in January 1998 the executive council adopted
a resolution authorizing disciplinary measures for clubs that ``do
not aggressively pursue equal opportunities and initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be reluctant to impose sanctions on clubs that do
not comply,'' Selig wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also advised the owners that he and his aides will
``aggressively recruit and hire diverse candidates for all open
central office positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office itself has been criticized for failing
to consider members of minorities for high-ranking positions.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, four new positions have been created, and
members of minorities were not interviewed for any of them. In the
midst of the seasonlong celebration in 1997 of the 50th anniversary
of Jackie Robinson's historic entry into the major leagues, Paul
Beeston was named president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sandy Alderson was named executive vice president of
baseball operations, Robert DuPuy executive vice president for
administration and Rob Manfred executive vice president for labor
relations and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, three members of minorities were named assistant
general managers. Dave Stewart of Toronto, David Wilder of the
Chicago Cubs and Ruben Amaro Jr. of Philadelphia joined Omar Minaya
of the Mets and Darrell ``Doc'' Rodgers of Cincinnati in that role
as well as two women, Elaine Steward of Boston and Kim Ng of the
New York Yankees. Al Avila was named the Florida Marlins' scouting
director and Don Reynolds the Montreal Expos' farm director.
</P>
<P>
   Selig focused on the four front-office positions because the
people who hold them have decision-making authority and control
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who in his sixth year as NL president is baseball's
highest-ranking black or Hispanic, led a five-man group at the
April 13 meeting in Milwaukee. He and Robinson, who has been a
manager and assistant general manager, were joined by Hank Aaron,
Joe Morgan and Roberto Clemente Jr., a sportscaster and son of the
late Hall of Fame outfielder. Selig was joined by William
Bartholomay, co-chairman of the owners' equal opportunity
committee, and Wendy Selig-Prieb, president of the Brewers.

   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter, on several occasions, had the pleasure
of meeting Joe DiMaggio, and the pleasure, at least on the surface,
was usually all his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hello and a handshake,'' Jeter said. ``He pretty much
kept to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The truly great Yankees come in all shapes, sizes and
personalities. When Mickey Mantle died, Willie Randolph fondly
recalled being a rookie infielder, and Mantle, on opening day,
1976, suddenly appearing at his dressing stall with a smile as wide
as Oklahoma. ``That was Mickey,'' said Randolph, the Yankees'
third-base coach. ``He never big-leagued me.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't DiMaggio, old and more aloof than ever by 1996, when
Jeter claimed shortstop at Yankee Stadium for a generation, unless
the demon dollar someday wreaks historical havoc. That was fine
with Jeter, who as a child summered at his grandparents' house in
northern New Jersey. He didn't need DiMaggio to compare batting
stances or recite his Hall of Fame statistics. Only one number
mattered to a 21-year-old who wanted so much to be right where he
was.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was No. 5, then and forever, a single-digit legend. And
Jeter, like a child born into royalty, was No. 2, about to launch
his own reign in pinstripes that could one day take him from
shortstop out to Monument Park, where DiMaggio's new granite
memorial will be unveiled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fitting for Derek to have one of the last single-digit
numbers that remains,'' David Cone said. ``I'm not sure if it was
intentional, but whoever made that decision, it was a pretty good
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   There are great Yankee moments, and there are great Yankees, and
people should not confuse the two. On Friday night, when David
Wells returned with Toronto to pitch against the champions he
helped make, the Yankees replayed the last out of his perfect game
against Minnesota last May 17, just as Wells was taking the mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classy gesture, compared with say, the cheesy half-time
video the Knicks played when Charles Oakley came home in his
Toronto Raptors Barney suit.
</P>
<P>
   This display of appreciation and warmth on a cold, damp night
was long dissipated by the time Chili Davis, appropriately enough,
doubled home two seventh-inning runs, sending Wells off to a 6-4
defeat and the rest of his career. It sure would spice up the
season if he and the young Blue Jays could push the Yankees in the
American League East, but these Yankees won before David Wells, and
they will win after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely made his mark in Yankee history in a short
period of time,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   They were two endearing seasons, one memorable. Wells pitched 10
years in the majors before he set foot in the Yankee clubhouse. The
notion of him as Mr. Yankee is about as far off base as DiMaggio
being remembered as Mr. Coffee. Bucky Dent won a pennant in Boston
with a home run for the Yankees in 1978, which made him the
architect of a great Yankee moment, not a great Yankee. The
standards are higher around these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells may be a Babe Ruth fanatic, a student of Yankee history,
but Jeter is living it. His rocketing career is being nurtured by
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many teams in any sport where there is so
much tradition and where so many players are showing up to remind
you of it,'' Jeter said. ``When I first got here, I had a chance to
play with Mattingly, and that was an honor. In spring training, you
look up and you see Goose Gossage, and then walk around the corner
and you see Reggie Jackson. You come here, and Yogi Berra is
throwing out the first ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, 24 and already a two-time champion, said, ``You get
spoiled around here.''
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Yankees in September 1995 and was handed No.
2, Jeter said he figured it was the smallest jersey, the best fit
for a wiry middle infielder. He was asked if he knew which other
Yankees had worn No. 2, and didn't have to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crosetti and Murcer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the clubhouse said that Wayne Tolleson, a 1970s spare
infielder, also wore No. 2. Maybe there was a grand design to this
assignment, maybe not. All Jeter knows is that he has one of two
remaining single-digit numbers. His manager, Joe Torre, No. 6, has
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Torre already has two rings, one more than Billy Martin, retired
No. 1. On another day when this most famous of American sports
franchises relishes its past, it is not unreasonable to wonder if
both numbers, 2 and 6, will ever again be worn by anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being No. 2. It's been mine since I got here,'' Jeter
said. ``But I don't think about the retired-number stuff. I'm just
getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes about his work with an attitude that presumes nothing,
which is why Cone calls him ``the future captain of the Yankees.''
Jeter is filling out now in that No. 2 jersey, driving the ball
with power, hitting around .400.
</P>
<P>
   Three years does not make a great Yankee any more than Wells'
two, but Jeter isn't going anywhere soon. He has a chance to be the
last single-digit hero, another monument to Yankee history, Joe
DiMaggio's neighbor forever. The pleasure in achieving it would be
all his.

SPORTS COLUMN: A NATION TURNS ITS EYES TO CENTER FIELD, ONE MORE
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most haunting question in all of sports _ ``Where
have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?'' _ should be answered Sunday. Joe
DiMaggio has gone to the monument valley beyond center field in
Yankee Stadium. While his body is not buried there, his spirit will
be consecrated in that hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   What each of us makes of his spirit, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Private to the point of paranoia, DiMaggio took charge of his
final illness with the same steely reserve that informed his
baseball career, his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, his afterlife as
living legend. He was his own curator. He allowed us to believe
that his genius, like Albert Einstein's, Greta Garbo's, Orson
Welles', had earned him the right to be left alone except when he
wanted attention, to be excused whatever smudges might appear on
the shiny image.
</P>
<P>
   We scrabbled to justify his aloofness as dignity (but never
shyness or contempt), to find grounds for forgiveness in his
coffee-maker commercials, to place him in historical context. He
had ridden into our consciousness just as the myths of the frontier
West were receding, one of a posse of cowboys in the outfield who
became our new manly heroes, lone individuals standing just outside
the group, our last defense.
</P>
<P>
   He was the son of an immigrant, but graceful and cool, so all
the immigrants' sons who were writing about sports identified with
him and, in the words of the old sports editor Stanley Woodward,
``Godded him up.'' DiMaggio was a demanding employee, especially
around contract time, but fans forgave him because he seemed like
such a passionate performer.
</P>
<P>
   But that still doesn't quite explain this: Even though some of
his replacements in that very same outfield _ Mickey Mantle, Reggie
Jackson, yes, Darryl Strawberry _ were infinitely more interesting
and entertaining as human beings, it is DiMaggio who will continue
to be beatified.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a major New York City highway will be renamed for
DiMaggio, a major mistake. He may not deserve such a civic
immortality, but he certainly doesn't deserve to be cursed by
thousands of motorists every day stuck on an outmoded, graceless
road. He will end up remembered for traffic jams, overheated cars,
noise and fumes.
</P>
<P>
   But then he does owe New York. The other great outfielders of
his era might have become crossover personalities had they played
here in the days when all the national media were only a cab ride
away. Stan Musial, a harmonica rascal of almost silly geniality,
could have become Lawrence Welk as a Yankee. Ted Williams was the
man whom John Wayne tried to play in movies. When you recall that
another Marine fighter pilot, John Glenn, spoke of the joy and
comfort of flying into combat with Ted Williams on his wing, it is
hard to ever again take another outfielder more seriously. Ted
Williams' spit was too good for the fans it hit.
</P>
<P>
   So why DiMaggio? There could be clues in the retirements of
Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky, two men of privacy, discretion
and cool who quit while they were still pleasures to watch. But
Jordan and Gretzky overwhelmed and ennobled their sports; they
might as well have been superior beings from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was not in their league.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he didn't embarrass us, perhaps because we
never got into all the nooks and crannies of his life. He was just
smart enough to know he wasn't smart enough to unspool sound bites
and commentary. We saw just enough to be able to make up the rest
of him. Always dressed for dinner at ``21,'' he drifted through the
rest of his life with the same outward economy he displayed as he
drifted under fly balls. He knew just where they would drop.
</P>
<P>
   This was a lonely man of the night, we could imagine, a Sinatra
without the mean streak. His skin color helped him; when Hank Aaron
broke Babe Ruth's career home-run record, DiMaggio's 56-game
hitting streak suddenly became the most important record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was supposed to be the next DiMaggio. You could look
it up. When the New York Mets brought him up in 1983, before his
time, an unfinished 19-year-old, the front-office people actually
compared him to the Clipper. What was done for Darryl and to him,
what he could and couldn't do for himself, is another story, yet
unfinished, too, but I must admit I have felt far more human
interest for him than for DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators have been beating up on Strawberry for letting us
down. Poor Darryl, a wildly talented, madly destructive charmer,
let only himself down. A case could be made for how poorly he was
served by the Mets, and how even the Yankees needed to show more
support. A recovering addict and recovering cancer patient who is a
fading athlete unsure of his place on a team needs help and
encouragement to come back from a slip.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this could never have happened to the Great DiMaggio.
The Clipper was too tightly wrapped, the cops, gangsters and news
media would have protected him, and he usually had a bobo at his
side to hold his coat and bimbo, much less anything that could have
been considered a controlled substance. Another haunting question
is this: Groomed to mature rather than just star, would Strawberry
have become the next DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   Last haunting question: Where will you go, Darryl Strawberry?

<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Reynaldo Ordonez Fiallo received a gift from
America one day last month _ a new, unmarked baseball glove made of
beautiful tanned leather. As a bonus, the glove came with a tag
bearing a color photograph of his father, the slick-fielding
shortstop for the New York Mets, who is also named Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The ecstatic 6-year-old ran around his grandmother's apartment,
showing off not only the new-smelling glove but the picture of the
star shortstop. The glove, though, had not come from his father,
but from a godmother in Miami. In fact, family members here say
that the elder Rey Ordonez, who will make $1.6 million playing for
the Mets this season, has played almost no role in the boy's life
since leaving Cuba in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never taken any interest at all in the boy,'' the
child's mother, Hilda Maria Fiallo, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo's sense of abandonment is not the only kind of
experience lived out by the families left behind as many of Cuba's
best baseball players have fled the island in recent years. There
are, too, tales of success and responsibility, even reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the details of Ordonez's defection and what has happened
since are complicated. When Ordonez defected, his son was an
infant, and he and Ms. Fiallo hoped they would be reunited in the
United States as soon as he broke into professional baseball. But
those plans were ultimately derailed by time and distance.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, roughly 30 players have defected. For all of them,
the decision was a calculated gamble involving conflicting
ambitions and risks: the dream of playing in the major leagues; a
desire to provide for their families; the possibility that they
would never see their families again, or that their relationships
with them could be permanently damaged.
</P>
<P>
   And those gambles have played out differently. Some families
have risked their lives at sea to escape and reunite. Some players
have only been able to funnel money, clothing and mementos to their
relatives. And there are a few, like Ordonez, who have become
estranged from those they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colina, a former first baseman on the Cuban national
team, defected in 1996 and has managed both to support his family
and reunite with his wife and daughter in Florida as he tries to
earn a spot with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He is now a designated
hitter in the minor leagues for the Class AA Orlando Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jorge Luis Toca, his act of daring and selfishness has
produced more mixed results. Also in the minor leagues, he has sent
money back to his parents and brother, but his relationship with
the mother of his 3-year-old son has deteriorated, and it is
unclear if they will ever share a life together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult step to take this decision,'' Colina said of
the option to defect. ``One doesn't know if one will be able to get
the family out. It's not easy. I decided to go ahead and whatever
happened, happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The exodus began in earnest in 1991, when Rene Arocha, a pitcher
with the Cuban national team, walked off an airplane that made an
emergency stop in Miami and, in short order, stepped into a
contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he pitched from
1993 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Arocha's success, and a Cuban economy devastated by the collapse
of the Soviet Union, underscored the promise of American baseball
and multimillion-dollar contracts. Meanwhile, the government's
attempts to brand the players as traitors and stanch the exodus
have backfired. In 1996 and 1997, for instance, the authorities
banned several prominent players from baseball, accusing them of
plotting to defect, only to see several loyal players, like Orlando
Hernandez, defiantly leave the island.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the defectors have made it to the major
leagues. Among them are Rolando Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins, Orlando Hernandez of the
Yankees and Osvaldo Fernandez of the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the Cuban authorities have not permitted the
families to follow. A notable exception was made when a personal
request to Fidel Castro by Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop
of New York, resulted in Orlando Hernandez's being joined by his
former wife and two children. They now live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the government treats the players who left as if they
do not exist, never mentioning them again in the state-controlled
press. On the streets, however, they have become folk heroes to
many citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For their families left behind, the players are often something
between invisible and heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cuban emigres, most of the players send dollars back
to their families, either through licensed travel agents or an
established underground system of couriers. The remittances provide
a desperately needed economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond financial support, players who make it onto professional
teams, even in the minor leagues, are also a source of great pride,
a pride, however, often tempered with a sense of loss, especially
for older parents, who cannot envision themselves emigrating.
</P>
<P>
   Tears still form in Francisca Gomez's eyes when she explains the
decision of her son, Toca, to leave Cuba. Sitting in her living
room in the town of Remedios, Gomez says she understands why he
left, but she wonders if she will ever see him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to go,'' she says. ``He had everything here. A
house. A family. His son.''
</P>
<P>
   Toca is currently playing first base for the Binghamton (N.Y.)
Mets, the franchise's Class AA club. He escaped Cuba on a tiny
launch last year with three other players and a pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Toca's relatives, however lonely, still support his decision,
saying he had no choice. He had been suspended for life from Cuban
baseball in July 1997, after he and several other players spoke on
the telephone to Arrojo, the pitcher who had fled Cuba in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no other way out,'' said his father, Juan Antonio Toca
Garcia, a 56-year-old dental technician. ``His life and his only
job was to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Toca's parents say he calls every week and sends money. But they
say the financial assistance is secondary to his athletic success.
They feel an injustice was done to him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even have to send anything home,'' Toca's father
said. ``As long as he triumphs. That's enough. That's enough joy
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many in Orlando Hernandez's family feel the same way. The
pitcher was suspended from Cuban baseball in 1996, after the
government accused him of plotting to defect, as his half brother,
Livan, did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had regularly pitched for thousands of Havana
fans, found himself relegated to working as a physical therapist in
a psychiatric hospital for $8 a month. Now, since his defection,
his relatives in his old Havana neighborhood say he has continued
to help them in large and small ways, with even distant cousins
receiving autographed pictures. He sends money to his father, his
former brother-in-law, his nieces, his aunts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's maternal grandmother, Maria Julia Pedrozo, said she
recognized that she will probably never see her grandson again, but
she is still proud he left. ``He had to leave,'' she said. ``There
was no other remedy. He was shut down completely and for this he
left.''
</P>
<P>
   However envious, even some younger family members of ballplayers
who have made it in America are desperately grateful. For instance,
Miguel Colina, who said he makes less than $20 a month delivering
bread on a bicycle, respects his brother, the first baseman in the
Tampa Bay organization. The $300 a month his brother sends is just
enough to keep the extended clan fed and clothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically everyone here is in flames,'' Miguel Colina said,
with a tinge of bitterness. ``I feel good because I know that at
least someone escaped from here and he's got a secure future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is pain, though, for others left behind, including some
who helped the players escape. For the understandings some players
reached with their families before they left have later been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said it was she who first urged a frustrated Ordonez
to leave the island. Though an enormously talented fielder, Ordonez
feared he would never surpass German Mesa, the top shortstop in
Cuba, she said. Every year Mesa started ahead of Ordonez on the
Havana Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who encouraged him to do it,'' said Ms. Fiallo,
who met Ordonez in 1991 and married him a year later. ``He could
never have done it alone. He is the most timid there is. The day he
left here he told me that he wasn't sure he had the courage to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ordonez was chosen in April 1993 for a spot on the national
team going to play in a tournament in Buffalo, N.Y., the couple
began plotting his defection, Ms. Fiallo said. She wrote her father
in Miami, Arnaldo Fiallo, who had left Cuba in the early 1980s, and
laid out careful instructions to pick up her husband, Ms. Fiallo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the government can deny exit visas to the families of
people who leave illegally, Ms. Fiallo said they decided to get
divorced. It was supposed to be only a paper divorce, she said.
They intended to reunite as soon as Ordonez found work.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Ordonez walked away from his team's lodgings
in Buffalo and climbed into a car driven by Lazaro Megret, a radio
executive from Miami who was also a friend of his father-in-law's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no food for my son to eat in Cuba,'' Ordonez told a
reporter from The New York Times shortly after his defection. ``I
felt making $118 a month, which I get playing baseball, there was
little I could do. I can do more for them by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez was eventually drafted and signed by the Mets, and he
has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars over the last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said she and Ordonez talked on the telephone over the
next year, planning their future, but she was repeatedly denied
official permission to leave. Distance and time took their toll on
the relationship, she said. In December 1994, she learned Ordonez
had remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said she has not spoken to or heard from Ordonez
since that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez declined two requests to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write what you want in your newspaper,'' he said
earlier this month in Miami. ``I'm not going to talk about my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   His former wife says Ordonez has done virtually nothing for his
son _ no money, no gifts, no mementos, not even a letter, she said.
Once, two years ago, Ordonez called the boy on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, it's as if the people here don't exist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Toca, now with the Binghamton Mets, also left
behind some wreckage. Barbara Alvarez, 29, says she lived with Toca
for five years and bore his son in 1996. She says she agreed to
allow him to marry a Japanese woman, Miyo Yamasaki, so that he
could get a visa to leave Cuba. Now, unemployed and alone with her
son, she feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Toca met Yamasaki in 1995 during a tournament in Japan and
married her in Havana two years later while still involved with
Alvarez, family members said. When he defected, Yamasaki picked
Toca up in the Bahamas and because of the marriage he eventually
was granted asylum in Japan. He later moved to America and signed
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Toca told her the marriage to Yamasaki was merely a
legal tactic to gain residency in Japan, and indeed Toca and his
Japanese wife were divorced shortly after their arrival in Japan.
Toca's mother called the marriage one of ``convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on relatives, Alvarez said Toca appears to have
forgotten his son. ``He doesn't call the boy or anything,'' she
said. ``If he has sent anything to us, then I don't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had to do it for himself and for the well-being
of us,'' Alvarez said. ``I feel tricked.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Toca said he had sent money for his son, but
said he had given it to his parents because he mistrusts Alvarez.
He said their relationship had died long ago. He also denied that
his marriage to Yamasaki had been a ruse. ``We had problems,'' he
said of the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Toca, 28, said he aches to bring his son to America. ``I don't
have anything I love more in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the families left behind are forced to confront
the idea of how they, too, might get to America. Many players have
repeatedly petitioned the Cuban authorities to release their
families. They have rarely prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   And traveling with smugglers can be risky. If they make it to
U.S. soil, Cubans can apply for political asylum, but those who are
caught at sea or wind up in nations like the Bahamas can be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the efforts to smuggle relatives out of Cuba are
often shrouded in secrecy. Most players whose families have made it
to America have denied they knew about or had a hand in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the wife and two sons of Rolando Arrojo, the Tampa
Bay right-hander, joined him two months after his 1996 defection,
but the details of their flight by sea have remained closely
guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Silence is the rule among relatives of defectors in Cuba, as
well. The secrecy is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Chinea, a 42-year-old pitching coach, was among the four
players who, along with Toca, boarded a 16-foot boat and made the
run northward across the straits of Florida 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at sea, the players were picked up by a Bahamian
fishing boat, but only Toca was ultimately allowed to stay aboard
because of his Japanese wife. Chinea and the others _ Angel Lopez,
Jorge Diaz and Maykel Jova _ were returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chinea says, life has become intolerable. His house
is kept under surveillance, he said. He has been banned from
working as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future is very uncertain,'' he said. ``I cannot even be
sure of my life here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Colina, the 28-year-old first baseman, life in America
for the moment is blessed because he has been joined by his wife
and daughter. Colina defected one night in November 1996, along
with Jesus Ametller and William Ortega of the Havana Industriales,
during a baseball tournament in Chiapas, Mexico. Saying they were
taking a walk, they met up with Joe Cubas, a Miami agent who
specializes in helping Cuban athletes defect, in a nearby cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   After six months in Costa Rica, all three signed minor league
contracts with American teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then Colina's family had to execute its own escape. Dianelis
Colina, 30, said she tried unsuccessfully for nearly two years to
persuade the Cuban immigration authorities to let her rejoin her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made our lives impossible,'' Ms. Colina, who worked as a
basketball instructor here, said of the government. ``As far as
legal means, he did everything he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting versions of what happened next, offered by those
in America and those in Cuba, reflect the persistent fear of
retaliation. Roberto Colina's relatives in Cuba maintain that he
hired a speedboat in Miami to pick up his family and whisk them
directly to Tampa, paying $9,000 for each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Colina maintains that she and the wives of Ametller and
Ortega did it on their own. Using money saved from their husband's
remittances, the women hired a smuggler in Havana and paid him $385
per person to take them to Florida in a rickety boat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colina also said he knew nothing of his wife's plan until she
arrived in the United States, and that he had battled despair with
the consolation that he at least could send money. ``I still don't
know how my wife arranged things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that their telephones were tapped, the women spoke
about their plans in code, pretending to plan a ``birthday party''
and referring to the boat as a ``cake,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colina said she told her relatives the story about a
speedboat coming from Florida to allay their fears.
</P>
<P>
   When the escape ultimately took place, she said, there were 15
people crammed in the boat. The engine gave out twice during the
night, and in the enormous quiet of the warm sea, Ms. Colina
thought they might not make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard,'' she said, her voice catching.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen hours later, they arrived in the Florida Keys and waded
ashore. Dirty and tired, they hid in some bushes by the roadside
until a relative arrived with a car that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Colina, when he saw his daughter at a relative's house in Miami
later that night, fell to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an immense joy,'' he said.

<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Reynaldo Ordonez Fiallo received a gift from
America one day last month _ a new, unmarked baseball glove made of
beautiful tanned leather. As a bonus, the glove came with a tag
bearing a color photograph of his father, the slick-fielding
shortstop for the New York Mets, who is also named Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The ecstatic 6-year-old ran around his grandmother's apartment,
showing off not only the new-smelling glove but the picture of the
star shortstop. The glove, though, had not come from his father,
but from a godmother in Miami. In fact, family members here say
that the elder Rey Ordonez, who will make $1.6 million playing for
the Mets this season, has played almost no role in the boy's life
since leaving Cuba in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never taken any interest at all in the boy,'' the
child's mother, Hilda Maria Fiallo, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo's sense of abandonment is not the only kind of
experience lived out by the families left behind as many of Cuba's
best baseball players have fled the island in recent years. There
are, too, tales of success and responsibility, even reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the details of Ordonez's defection and what has happened
since are complicated. When Ordonez defected, his son was an
infant, and he and Ms. Fiallo hoped they would be reunited in the
United States as soon as he broke into professional baseball. But
those plans were ultimately derailed by time and distance.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, roughly 30 players have defected. For all of them,
the decision was a calculated gamble involving conflicting
ambitions and risks: the dream of playing in the major leagues; a
desire to provide for their families; the possibility that they
would never see their families again, or that their relationships
with them could be permanently damaged.
</P>
<P>
   And those gambles have played out differently. Some families
have risked their lives at sea to escape and reunite. Some players
have only been able to funnel money, clothing and mementos to their
relatives. And there are a few, like Ordonez, who have become
estranged from those they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Colina, a former first baseman on the Cuban national
team, defected in 1996 and has managed both to support his family
and reunite with his wife and daughter in Florida as he tries to
earn a spot with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He is now a designated
hitter in the minor leagues for the Class AA Orlando Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   But for Jorge Luis Toca, his act of daring and selfishness has
produced more mixed results. Also in the minor leagues, he has sent
money back to his parents and brother, but his relationship with
the mother of his 3-year-old son has deteriorated, and it is
unclear if they will ever share a life together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult step to take this decision,'' Colina said of
the option to defect. ``One doesn't know if one will be able to get
the family out. It's not easy. I decided to go ahead and whatever
happened, happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The exodus began in earnest in 1991, when Rene Arocha, a pitcher
with the Cuban national team, walked off an airplane that made an
emergency stop in Miami and, in short order, stepped into a
contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he pitched from
1993 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Arocha's success, and a Cuban economy devastated by the collapse
of the Soviet Union, underscored the promise of American baseball
and multimillion-dollar contracts. Meanwhile, the government's
attempts to brand the players as traitors and stanch the exodus
have backfired. In 1996 and 1997, for instance, the authorities
banned several prominent players from baseball, accusing them of
plotting to defect, only to see several loyal players, like Orlando
Hernandez, defiantly leave the island.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the defectors have made it to the major
leagues. Among them are Rolando Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
Livan Hernandez of the Florida Marlins, Orlando Hernandez of the
Yankees and Osvaldo Fernandez of the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the Cuban authorities have not permitted the
families to follow. A notable exception was made when a personal
request to Fidel Castro by Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop
of New York, resulted in Orlando Hernandez's being joined by his
former wife and two children. They now live in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, the government treats the players who left as if they
do not exist, never mentioning them again in the state-controlled
press. On the streets, however, they have become folk heroes to
many citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For their families left behind, the players are often something
between invisible and heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cuban emigres, most of the players send dollars back
to their families, either through licensed travel agents or an
established underground system of couriers. The remittances provide
a desperately needed economic boost.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond financial support, players who make it onto professional
teams, even in the minor leagues, are also a source of great pride,
a pride, however, often tempered with a sense of loss, especially
for older parents, who cannot envision themselves emigrating.
</P>
<P>
   Tears still form in Francisca Gomez's eyes when she explains the
decision of her son, Toca, to leave Cuba. Sitting in her living
room in the town of Remedios, Gomez says she understands why he
left, but she wonders if she will ever see him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to go,'' she says. ``He had everything here. A
house. A family. His son.''
</P>
<P>
   Toca is currently playing first base for the Binghamton (N.Y.)
Mets, the franchise's Class AA club. He escaped Cuba on a tiny
launch last year with three other players and a pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Toca's relatives, however lonely, still support his decision,
saying he had no choice. He had been suspended for life from Cuban
baseball in July 1997, after he and several other players spoke on
the telephone to Arrojo, the pitcher who had fled Cuba in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no other way out,'' said his father, Juan Antonio Toca
Garcia, a 56-year-old dental technician. ``His life and his only
job was to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Toca's parents say he calls every week and sends money. But they
say the financial assistance is secondary to his athletic success.
They feel an injustice was done to him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even have to send anything home,'' Toca's father
said. ``As long as he triumphs. That's enough. That's enough joy
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many in Orlando Hernandez's family feel the same way. The
pitcher was suspended from Cuban baseball in 1996, after the
government accused him of plotting to defect, as his half brother,
Livan, did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had regularly pitched for thousands of Havana
fans, found himself relegated to working as a physical therapist in
a psychiatric hospital for $8 a month. Now, since his defection,
his relatives in his old Havana neighborhood say he has continued
to help them in large and small ways, with even distant cousins
receiving autographed pictures. He sends money to his father, his
former brother-in-law, his nieces, his aunts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's maternal grandmother, Maria Julia Pedrozo, said she
recognized that she will probably never see her grandson again, but
she is still proud he left. ``He had to leave,'' she said. ``There
was no other remedy. He was shut down completely and for this he
left.''
</P>
<P>
   However envious, even some younger family members of ballplayers
who have made it in America are desperately grateful. For instance,
Miguel Colina, who said he makes less than $20 a month delivering
bread on a bicycle, respects his brother, the first baseman in the
Tampa Bay organization. The $300 a month his brother sends is just
enough to keep the extended clan fed and clothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically everyone here is in flames,'' Miguel Colina said,
with a tinge of bitterness. ``I feel good because I know that at
least someone escaped from here and he's got a secure future.''
</P>
<P>
   There is pain, though, for others left behind, including some
who helped the players escape. For the understandings some players
reached with their families before they left have later been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said it was she who first urged a frustrated Ordonez
to leave the island. Though an enormously talented fielder, Ordonez
feared he would never surpass German Mesa, thetop shortstop in
Cuba, she said. Every year Mesa started ahead of Ordonez on the
Havana Industriales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who encouraged him to do it,'' said Ms. Fiallo,
who met Ordonez in 1991 and married him a year later. ``He could
never have done it alone. He is the most timid there is. The day he
left here he told me that he wasn't sure he had the courage to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ordonez was chosen in April 1993 for a spot on the national
team going to play in a tournament in Buffalo, N.Y., the couple
began plotting his defection, Ms. Fiallo said. She wrote her father
in Miami, Arnaldo Fiallo, who had left Cuba in the early 1980s, and
laid out careful instructions to pick up her husband, Ms. Fiallo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the government can deny exit visas to the families of
people who leave illegally, Ms. Fiallo said they decided to get
divorced. It was supposed to be only a paper divorce, she said.
They intended to reunite as soon as Ordonez found work.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Ordonez walked away from his team's lodgings
in Buffalo and climbed into a car driven by Lazaro Megret, a radio
executive from Miami who was also a friend of his father-in-law's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no food for my son to eat in Cuba,'' Ordonez told a
reporter from The New York Times shortly after his defection. ``I
felt making $118 a month, which I get playing baseball, there was
little I could do. I can do more for them by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez was eventually drafted and signed by the Mets, and he
has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars over the last several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said she and Ordonez talked on the telephone over the
next year, planning their future, but she was repeatedly denied
official permission to leave. Distance and time took their toll on
the relationship, she said. In December 1994, she learned Ordonez
had remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiallo said she has not spoken to or heard from Ordonez
since that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez declined two requests to be interviewed for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write what you want in your newspaper,'' he said
earlier this month in Miami. ``I'm not going to talk about my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   His former wife says Ordonez has done virtually nothing for his
son _ no money, no gifts, no mementos, not even a letter, she said.
Once, two years ago, Ordonez called the boy on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, it's as if the people here don't exist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Toca, now with the Binghamton Mets, also left
behind some wreckage. Barbara Alvarez, 29, says she lived with Toca
for five years and bore his son in 1996. She says she agreed to
allow him to marry a Japanese woman, Miyo Yamasaki, so that he
could get a visa to leave Cuba. Now, unemployed and alone with her
son, she feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Toca met Yamasaki in 1995 during a tournament in Japan and
married her in Havana two years later while still involved with
Alvarez, family members said. When he defected, Yamasaki picked
Toca up in the Bahamas and because of the marriage he eventually
was granted asylum in Japan. He later moved to America and signed
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Toca told her the marriage to Yamasaki was merely a
legal tactic to gain residency in Japan, and indeed Toca and his
Japanese wife were divorced shortly after their arrival in Japan.
Toca's mother called the marriage one of ``convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on relatives, Alvarez said Toca appears to have
forgotten his son. ``He doesn't call the boy or anything,'' she
said. ``If he has sent anything to us, then I don't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had to do it for himself and for the well-being
of us,'' Alvarez said. ``I feel tricked.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Toca said he had sent money for his son, but
said he had given it to his parents because he mistrusts Alvarez.
He said their relationship had died long ago. He also denied that
his marriage to Yamasaki had been a ruse. ``We had problems,'' he
said of the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Toca, 28, said he aches to bring his son to America. ``I don't
have anything I love more in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the families left behind are forced to confront
the idea of how they, too, might get to America. Many players have
repeatedly petitioned the Cuban authorities to release their
families. They have rarely prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   And traveling with smugglers can be risky. If they make it to
U.S. soil, Cubans can apply for political asylum, but those who are
caught at sea or wind up in nations like the Bahamas can be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the efforts to smuggle relatives out of Cuba are
often shrouded in secrecy. Most players whose families have made it
to America have denied they knew about or had a hand in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the wife and two sons of Rolando Arrojo, the Tampa
Bay right-hander, joined him two months after his 1996 defection,
but the details of their flight by sea have remained closely
guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Silence is the rule among relatives of defectors in Cuba, as
well. The secrecy is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Chinea, a 42-year-old pitching coach, was among the four
players who, along with Toca, boarded a 16-foot boat and made the
run northward across the straits of Florida 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at sea, the players were picked up by a Bahamian
fishing boat, but only Toca was ultimately allowed to stay aboard
because of his Japanese wife. Chinea and the others _ Angel Lopez,
Jorge Diaz and Maykel Jova _ were returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chinea says, life has become intolerable. His house
is kept under surveillance, he said. He has been banned from
working as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future is very uncertain,'' he said. ``I cannot even be
sure of my life here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Colina, the 28-year-old first baseman, life in America
for the moment is blessed because he has been joined by his wife
and daughter. Colina defected one night in November 1996, along
with Jesus Ametller and William Ortega of the Havana Industriales,
during a baseball tournament in Chiapas, Mexico. Saying they were
taking a walk, they met up with Joe Cubas, a Miami agent who
specializes in helping Cuban athletes defect, in a nearby cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   After six months in Costa Rica, all three signed minor league
contracts with American teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then Colina's family had to execute its own escape. Dianelis
Colina, 30, said she tried unsuccessfully for nearly two years to
persuade the Cuban immigration authorities to let her rejoin her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made our lives impossible,'' Ms. Colina, who worked as a
basketball instructor here, said of the government. ``As far as
legal means, he did everything he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting versions of what happened next, offered by those
in America and those in Cuba, reflect the persistent fear of
retaliation. Roberto Colina's relatives in Cuba maintain that he
hired a speedboat in Miami to pick up his family and whisk them
directly to Tampa, paying $9,000 for each passenger.

KENTUCKY CENTER RECALLS CELEBRATION THAT DESTROYED THREE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, Ky. _ The last time some 60,000 people saw Jason
Watts, most of them cheered lustily for him and his University of
Kentucky football team in Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington. It was
Nov. 14, a beautiful fall afternoon in bluegrass country. Fans
waved their blue-and-white banners, and the Wildcats walloped
Vanderbilt and were joyously headed for a bowl game, their first in
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was the starting center, snapping the ball to Tim Couch,
the all-America quarterback and eventual No. 1 pick in the National
Football League draft. Watts, a senior, was playing his last game
before the home crowd, in front of his proud family and friends.
There was a lot to celebrate and that night, Watts and two of his
closest friends did.
</P>
<P>
   That was five months ago. On Tuesday afternoon, the day after
his 22nd birthday, Watts shuffled into the small, gray courtroom in
the Pulaski County Courthouse here on Main Street in this quiet
south-central Kentucky town. His walk was impeded because his
ankles were chained. He also wore handcuffs with a chain that wound
around his back and glinted under the fluorescent lighting when he
took his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before, on March 31, Watts had pleaded guilty to two
counts of reckless homicide and asked to begin his jail term
immediately. His celebration with his friends that November night
had turned tragic. Drunk, and on a whimsical predawn hunting
excursion, the young men were involved in a horrific crash that
sent all three flying out of Watts' black pickup truck. Only Watts
survived.
</P>
<P>
   So last week Watts was back in court for sentencing, facing a
maximum of 10 years in prison, reduced in plea bargaining from 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even with head bowed and wearing navy blue jail garb, Jason
Watts, at 6 feet 3 inches, 270 pounds, appeared imposing. His dark
hair was cut short, and his features clean and fresh-faced. Genial
and seemingly big enough to lift the front end of a bus, he sat at
a table with his lawyer, James Lowry, and faced the bespectacled
judge, Daniel Venters.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering of a football crowd was not even an echo now. The
only sounds were the scraping of chairs and an occasional low sob
from the nearby visitors' bench, where Watts' mother, Debbie, and
older sister, Laura, sat holding crumpled tissues in their fists.
Alongside them was Watts' father, Jim. They had driven 12 hours
from their home in Ovieda, Fla., to attend the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Absent were the parents of Christopher Scott Brock and Artie
Steinmetz, the two friends who were killed in the crash on Highway
27 in the gray, early morning some 12 hours after the 55-17 victory
over Vanderbilt. Watts was behind the wheel. None of them wore seat
belts. Blood tests showed that all three of them were drunk at the
time of the crash, with Watts having a blood-alcohol content of
0.15 percent, well above the legal limit of 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry made an appeal to the judge for leniency because Watts had
shown profound contrition, accepted responsibility from the
beginning and agreed to speak to high school students in alcohol-
and drug-prevention programs. The prosecutor, Ed Montgomery,
acknowledged all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, two people were killed in an accident he
caused,'' Montgomery said. ``We have to make clear the severity of
the offense, and a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked Watts if he had anything to say. ``I just want
to say,'' he said, eyes lowered, words coming slowly, ``that _ that
I'm sorry again for all the people I let down.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge acknowledged the various positions, said he was
somewhat skeptical about Watts' talking to students _ implying that
obtaining a lighter sentence might have been an ulterior motive _
but said that if it had done some good, then it was, ultimately,
good. ``Ten years,'' he decreed.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Watts' mother let out a low moan, and his sister sobbed
and buried her head in her mother's shoulder. His father had
reached over and was holding their hands, tears welling behind his
glasses, as Watts was led out of the courtroom and back to the
Pulaski County Detention Center.

   Alcohol Abuse Leads to Disaster
</P>
<P>
   ``It began,'' said Watts, hands self-consciously in his pockets,
``on what was the greatest day of my life. I could never have
imagined that 12 hours later it turned into the worst day of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in mid-April, and Watts was in the Russell Springs High
School gymnasium, talking to 1,200 students as part of a state
Drive Smart campaign. He noted the victory over Vanderbilt. ``After
the game we were screaming and yelling and we were all on cloud
nine,'' he continued. ``Nothing could bring us down. After I
showered and changed clothes, I went outside and there was a big
crowd of people waiting for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those waiting at the gate was Brock, 21, whom everyone
called Scott, a high-school teammate of Tim Couch's who attended
Eastern Kentucky but who still visited Couch and Watts a lot. They
went back to Watts' apartment and were eventually joined by Artie
Steinmetz.
</P>
<P>
   Steinmetz, 19, a lineman, practiced with the team but as a
transfer had to sit out a year. ``Artie and I became good friends
because we played against each other in practice every day,'' Watts
told the students. ``We'd insult each other, but it was all in
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The three of them, along with a few others in the house on
Linden Walk, broke out some beers, and they laughed and talked and
went out for dinner and returned and drank some more in what became
a long night of partying. ``Old Scott had them laughing, as he
always did,'' Watts told the students. ``Everyone loved Scott. And
Artie was like Scott in that nothing you could do could make them
mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott kidded me that I couldn't hit a deer if my life depended
on it, and I argued about that. And we kept talking and laughing
and we decided to go hunting. Right then.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Watts was a thrill seeker. He would race motorbikes and take his
truck mudding near his home in central Florida. On the football
field, he was quick and mobile, and he enjoyed the hitting. He had
started every game for Kentucky for three years.
</P>
<P>
   He was an agriculture major but did not have quite enough
credits to graduate this spring, and he planned to return to
Florida after school. He said that perhaps he would work with his
father, who harvests lotus pods in an airboat in the swamps for the
floral industry. And, he said, he would try ``to just relax with
whatever life brings me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the accident, he says, he has come to
believe that one reason he may have been spared was so that he
could talk to young people about the dangers of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet alcohol had been a dangerous part of Watts' life previously;
16 months before the accident, he paid a fine after shooting a
teammate, Omar Smith, in the buttocks as they handled a rifle
together. He had been drinking then, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Watts missed no playing time because of the incident but was
made to undergo alcohol tests at random twice a week for nine
months. He was also given a curfew and a strict schedule of
classroom and practice time. ``Jason's a good, bright young man,''
said Kentucky's athletic director, C.M. Newton, ``but he is very
much a risk taker who is an alcoholic.'' Newton persuaded Watts to
attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings but said he was not sure how
many Watts had gone to.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting incident did not prevent the drinking and
subsequent recklessness that caused Watts to get behind the wheel
of his truck last November.
</P>
<P>
   It was already 4 or 5 in the morning when the young men headed
out to go hunting. Alcohol was on their breaths. The three pals
drove southeast from Lexington on a two-lane highway. There were
few other vehicles on the road as they sped past Junction 70. One
car, though, was just ahead of them. Watts tried to pass it and
slid off the road into a rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hold on to the steering wheel and I threw my
arm up to shield me from smashing into the window, thinking, `This
is going to hurt.''' The last thing he remembered was feeling a
terrible thump on his head. ``I guess,'' he said, ``that's when I
went through the windshield, and when they went through the
windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell Springs students, some with graduation and prom
night just around the corner, were quiet and still as Watts talked
to them.
</P>
<P>
   When he opened his eyes, he said, he found himself in a ditch.
He saw the truck, crushed, toppled over some 25 yards away. He was
covered in blood. The pain in his ribs and lungs was excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I saw Scott lying on the ground, a bad cut in his
head,'' Watts said. ``I ran over to him. `Come on, Scott. Come on,
buddy. Please don't let this happen. I'm begging you.' He didn't
answer me. Then I saw blood draining from the side of his lips. I
looked around for Artie. I saw him lying not far away. I ran over
to him. `Come on Artie, man, you're all right.' He breathed, a kind
of whoosh, and then that was it. I started screaming: `Help! Help!'
Some people had stopped their cars and come over. The sheriff was
there. He said, `Your friends are gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Watts was carried into an ambulance and taken to a nearby
hospital. ``On the way,'' he said, ``I kept thinking, `I was the
one driving; I should've been the one to go.' And I tried holding
my breath, hoping I would die.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying in University Hospital in Lexington, Watts wondered how he
could ever face the families of Brock and Steinmetz. ``I had ruined
my life and killed two of my best buddies,'' he said, ``and all
because of doing something so stupid, something that could have
been so easily avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors Struggle With Consequences
</P>
<P>
   Then, several days later, he was told, ``Mrs. and Mrs. Brock are
here to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a bolt of lightning,'' he recalled. ``It gave me
cold chills. I said: `I can't speak to and Mrs. Brock. Their son is
dead because of me.''' But they came in, with Scott's brother,
Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   Watts went on to describe the scene:
</P>
<P>
   ``How're you doing?'' he was asked, and they hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be like this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to let you know, this can happen to anybody,''
came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Watts paused in the telling. ``I was crying. I didn't know what
to say. Except how sorry I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Scott Brock's mother, Wilma, says, ``We went to visit
Jason because, well _ I don't know hardly how to say this _ but
because he was Scott's friend.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether they hold Watts responsible for their son's death,
she said: ``My emotions _ and my husband's _ are so mixed up we
don't know exactly how to feel. But we do believe in forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence among those involved _ the Watts, Steinmetz and
Brock families _ is profound. Two young men are dead, and the
survivor, their close friend, seems full of remorse. He had been
reckless, fatally so, but he is not viewed as a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' parents called the Brocks and asked permission to come to
their son's funeral. Therlo Brock, Scott's father, a retired
vocational teacher, and Wilma Brock, a retired kindergarten
teacher, said yes. They spoke to Watts' parents after the services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show that we cared deeply about their
loss,'' Jim Watts told the Brocks, according to Wilma Brock. ``I
just could never fathom what it would be like to lose a child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God has to have a reason for all this,'' Wilma Brock told
them. ``Some good has to come out of it because my son was such a
good boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said that after his nine-day stay in the hospital, which
included three operations on his arm, he decided to visit the
Steinmetz family, who live in northern Kentucky. ``I was scared to
death to do it,'' he said. ``But it was something I just felt I had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Theresa Steinmetz were not condemning. ``The
Steinmetzes said, `God spared you for a reason, and it's up to you
to figure out what that reason was for,''' Watts recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But recently Steve Steinmetz, who owns a trucking company near
Cincinnati, said, ``I don't care to comment on Jason Watts.'' And
when asked if he had said that about God's sparing Watts, he
replied, ``I didn't say anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread Problem On U.S. Campuses
</P>
<P>
   A study on drinking on college campuses published last September
by the Harvard School of Public Health stated that 42 percent of
American college students have engaged in binge drinking, which it
defined as a man's consuming five or more drinks in a row or a
woman's consuming four or more. Athletes were found to be the
greatest abusers of any group.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Palumbo, a former bartender at Haney's, a Lexington bar,
testified at Watts' trial that one night she saw him drink 11 cans
of beer in 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Staten, a substance-abuse counselor at the University
of Kentucky Health Service, said alcohol abuse was all too common
among American college students. ``Getting drunk, vomiting in
dorms, urinating in elevators, seems just to be an accepted
societal norm on campuses by too many students,'' she said. ``It's
considered just part of Friday night.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Watts, Brock and Steinmetz caused people in
Lexington and beyond to look at the problem of drinking in various
ways. One week after the accident, Newton, the athletic director,
issued new guidelines for punishing abusers of drugs or alcohol.
They stipulate that any Kentucky athlete convicted of driving under
the influence will be immediately dismissed from the team and lose
his or her scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Watts could get out of prison in two years, or a little more.
But his true punishment, he told the Russell Springs students, was
having to ask himself, ``How can I live with this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about Scott and Artie, and I don't see them in happy
times,'' he said. ``I picture them the last time I saw them, at the
scene. I picture them bloody and broken up. I picture my two
buddies dying in my arms. I know their families can't sleep either.
Mine can't either. You make a terrible mistake, and you pay the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I wake up and look in the mirror, I see the scar
on my arm from my wrist to my elbow. I'm reminded about what
happened, and while I'm brushing my teeth I see the scar on my
shoulder, and there's one on my back, and these physical scars will
be with me the rest of my life, like the memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pulaski County Courthouse on Tuesday, Venters' last words
to Jason Watts were: ``Remanded to the custody of the jailer.''
Watts shuffled out in handcuffs and leg irons. Just before the rear
door closed behind him, he turned with difficulty to catch a
glimpse of his family over his shoulder, and moved his lips. ``I
love you,'' he said silently.

ROBERT JOHNSTON, NAVAL ENGINEER WHO DESIGNED HYDROFOILS, DIES AT
80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Mass., Wash., Canada)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Robert James Johnston, a naval engineer who became an innovative
designer of hydrofoils and other high-speed watercraft, died April
16 at his home in Daytona Beach, Fla. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston focused on improving hydrofoils, which skim over the
water on winglike structures attached to the hull, enabling the
craft to go faster than conventional boats and ships. In 1993 the
International Hydrofoil Society singled out his lifetime
contributions as a ``significant force in the design, development
and application of hydrofoils.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Purdue University in 1940 and received
advanced degrees in naval architecture and marine engineering from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947. His work in the
Office of Naval Research in and after World War II led to the
construction of the Navy's first hydrofoil missile ships.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Navy with the rank of captain in the
mid-1950s, he held executive positions in industry and directed
hydrofoil projects for the Grumman Corporation, including a
commercial hydrofoil, the Dolphin. He returned to the Navy in 1973
as the civilian manager of its Advanced Hydrofoil Program, which
built and deployed hydrofoil gunships.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s he founded a firm to provide data on
high-speed watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Marcia McColly Johnston; her
daughters, Cynthia Redick of Washington and Alicia Stickel of
Toronto; his son, David, also of Washington, and seven
grandchildren. His first wife, Dixie Girard Johnston, died in 1976.

DONALD JOHN BRUCKMAN, SUPPORTER OF GARDENS AND ANIMALS, DIES AT
70

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald John Bruckmann, a New York investment banker
who was the board chairman of the Animal Medical Center, a trustee
and former chairman of the New York Botanical Garden and an
enthusiastic gardener, sailor and conservationist, died Wednesday
at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He was 70 and also
lived in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He had been ill with prostate cancer, said Thomas J. Hubbard,
his longtime friend and successor as chairman of the Botanical
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckmann retired in 1983 as president of Dean Witter Reynolds
International. At his death he also was a director of the historic
Garden Conservancy, which was restored under his leadership as
board chairman of the Botanical Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Montclair, N.J., he graduated from Lafayette College
in Easton, Pa., in 1950 and served as a lieutenant in the Army
during the Korean conflict. He graduated from Columbia University
Law School in 1955 and worked at the New York firm of Simpson,
Thatcher &AMP; Bartlett until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a director of the Wall Street firms of Smith Barney
&AMP; Company and Dean Witter Reynolds before being named chief
executive and president of Dean Witter Reynolds International in
1974. From then until 1996 he was a director and financial adviser
at Bank Audi (USA).
</P>
<P>
   He was a breeder of shelties _ Shetland sheep dogs that look
like a smaller version of collies _ and his association with the
Animal Medical Center dated to 1976, when he sought midwifery
assistance. He felt that all life was precious and that pets
deserved the same level of technology and care available to people.
</P>
<P>
   He became a supporter and joined the board of the center in
1980. Elected chairman in 1996, he led the hospital through a
period of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckmann became a director of the New York Botanical Garden, in
the Bronx, in 1974 and served as chairman from 1977 to 1987. Under
his stewardship the Conservatory was reborn, the Peggy Rockefeller
Rose Garden was planned, a new Children's Garden was dedicated, and
the Botanical Garden set up its Institute of Economic Botany.
</P>
<P>
   He created a two-acre garden of his own on Lily Pond Lane in the
Hamptons, complete with a pond and stretching from the road to the
dunes. The property is included in sightseeing tours by garden
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former vice chairman of the Asia Society and past
chairman of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design. A Republican, he
served as vice chairman of the Pennsylvania Avenue Corp. during the
Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckmann is survived by his wife of 42 years, Polly Thudium
Bruckmann.

W.H. ARMSTRONG, TEACHER PRAISED FOR THE NOVEL `SOUNDER,' DIES AT
87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Va., Pa.)   By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William H. Armstrong, a teacher and writer best known for his
1969 children's novel ``Sounder,'' died April 11 at his home in
Kent, Conn. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Set among a community of black sharecroppers, ``Sounder'' told
the story of a loyal dog, his ill-fated master and the boy who
loved them both. The book, Armstrong's first novel, was awarded the
Newbery Medal in 1970 and was made into a movie starring Cicely
Tyson in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Collierstown, Va., Armstrong graduated from
Hampden-Sydney College and later attended the University of
Virginia. He wove the stories of his childhood in the Shenandoah
Valley into ``Sounder'' and three other novels, ``Sour Land,''
``The MacLeod Place'' and ``The Mills of God.'' The unnamed boy in
``Sounder'' and later, the teacher Moses Waters in ``Sour Land,''
grew from the tales Armstrong heard as a boy from Charles Jones, a
schoolteacher who worked afternoons and summers for Armstrong's
father.
</P>
<P>
   Epic in form, ``Sounder'' had neither place nor family names.
``With names they would represent one family,'' Armstrong wrote.
``Without names they become universal _ representing all people who
suffer privation and injustice, but through love, self-respect,
devotion and desire for improvement, make it in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of his books, Armstrong identified himself
primarily as a teacher. He spent 52 years at the Kent School in
Connecticut, where he taught general studies and ancient history to
ninth graders. He wrote about his educational philosophy in several
books, including ``Study Is Hard Work,'' ``Study Tips'' and ``87
Ways to Help Your Child in School.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong lived in Connecticut in a farmhouse he had built for
his wife, Martha, on a hill above the Housatonic River. Her sudden
death in 1953, three months after she moved into the house, was the
subject of his 1957 nonfiction work, ``Through Troubled Waters.''
</P>
<P>
   His son David, a landscape painter who illustrated ``The Mills
of God,'' died in August.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Christopher F., of Danville, Pa.; a
daughter, Mary Armstrong Conley of Newton, Mass.; three sisters,
Ashley Lucas of Blacksburg, Va., Coreta Agnor of Fairfield, Va.,
and Glenden Scott of Clifton Forge, Va., and three grandchildren.

 By   DAVID M. HALBFINGER WITH ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE, N.J. _ By late in the morning of April 10, several hours
after heavily armed, masked state troopers broke down the door of a
house near here and arrested Terrance Everett in the murder of an
Orange police officer, seasoned investigators in the office of the
Essex County prosecutor were certain that Everett was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   According to a high-ranking law enforcement official, they told
the office's second-in-command, First Assistant Prosecutor Patrick
Toscano, that Everett had just given a convincing account of his
whereabouts on the night of the murder _ from the two bacon
cheeseburgers with no tomatoes that he had eaten at a fast-food
restaurant to the bank machine where he had withdrawn cash _ and
had even passed two polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced, Toscano urged his boss, Prosecutor Patricia A. Hurt,
to let Everett go free.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurt overruled Toscano and others who made the same
recommendation, at one point even pounding a table with her fists,
according to a county official with knowledge of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   After all, four eyewitnesses had independently identified
Everett from an array of police mug shots. And that night, she
announced Everett's arrest in time for the news to make the Sunday
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was not released for six days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two weeks after the April 8 death of Officer
Joyce Anne Carnegie, Ms. Hurt maintains that the real killer is
safely behind bars and that she and her subordinates handled the
case well. ``Overall, I think that this office did a good job,''
she said at a news conference last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet details of their joint investigation, gleaned from
interviews with police officers, prosecutors, witnesses and others
_ most of whom were under strict orders not to discuss the case and
who insisted that their names not be published _ suggest that it
was the antithesis of a textbook case.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring lapse, according to those interviewed, seems to
be the failure to interview a key alibi witness for Everett.
Although Everett told investigators that he was eating at a nearby
Wendy's when Carnegie was killed, detectives did not interview the
restaurant manager until after his account appeared in a newspaper
_ six days later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the man now accused of killing Carnegie, Condell B.
Woodson, was not arrested until April 17, two days after detectives
flew to Georgia. The detectives found the person from whom Woodson
is believed to have bought the 9-millimeter pistol, which
prosecutors contend is the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But as early as the night of April 9, even before Everett was
arrested, federal agents told Orange and Essex County investigators
that they had traced the gun to Georgia. Neither Ms. Hurt nor the
Orange police director, Richard Conte, has explained why it took
nearly a week to make the trip south.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, two other men were arrested in the
investigation into Carnegie's murder. One, Earl Faison, died in
custody an hour after being pulled out of a taxicab. His family
claims he was beaten by officers.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has put the Essex prosecutor's office and the
Orange police on the defensive. The state attorney general and the
U.S. attorney in Newark have opened inquiries into the death of
Faison and the treatment of Everett, who says the police beat him
during his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, FBI agents removed documents from the Orange police
station under a subpoena. Everett's and Faison's families are
considering civil rights lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's image within law enforcement circles was damaged even
further when it became known that Toscano, her second-in-command,
had resigned in protest within hours after pushing her to release
Everett. Toscano has repeatedly declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most harmful result of the problems with the murder
investigation could materialize later, when the case against
Woodson winds up in court. Law enforcement officials here and in
surrounding jurisdictions are already speculating privately that a
skilled defense lawyer could make much of the three arrests
preceding Woodson's.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodson indeed confessed to the killing, as has been
reported, ``it saves them,'' said one veteran investigator,
referring to the Essex prosecutor's office. ``But even then, he
could argue that he was scared he'd die, like Faison.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt has refused repeated requests for an interview since
Monday, when she defended her handling of the investigation at a
news conference after Woodson's arraignment. At the time, she
denied there had been deep divisions among her staff on how to
proceed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, her spokesman, Ray Weiss, reiterated that Ms. Hurt
``believes it would be inappropriate for her to make any comments
while this is still an ongoing homicide investigation.'' He called
back later to add that Ms. Hurt ``cannot comment about the Everett
case, because the attorney general's office is in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte, the Orange police director, conceded in an interview this
week that ``mistakes were made.'' But he declined to say what the
mistakes had been and refused to answer many questions about the
case.

 &HT;    Winston Cup champ hitting bumps in '99
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Pain and frustration, strangers to Jeff Gordon
throughout his seven-year NASCAR career, have become frequent
companions since his victory at the season-opening Daytona 500 in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won three of the last four Winston Cup titles,
still has sore ribs from a crash at Texas Motor Speedway nearly a
month ago. He hasn't finished two of the eight Winston Cup races
this year, equaling his total DNFs in 33 events last season.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the emergence of Jeff Burton and Bobby Labonte as serious
contenders, along with the usual challenges from Dale Jarrett and
Mark Martin, and Gordon isn't counting on running away with a
fourth title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's other people kind of imagining things,'' Gordon
said. ``We know how tough the competition is in Winston Cup. We
know how tough it is to be on the leaderboard and win a race. We
know racing is a tough sport, where you have your ups and you have
your downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of ups, and we're still having a lot of ups
this year, but maybe we're just not getting the results that we had
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, going into today's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway, Gordon is fourth in the Winston Cup standings, 129
points behind leader Burton. With 26 events remaining on the
schedule, Gordon says his Hendrick Motorsports team isn't about to
panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in pretty good shape,'' Gordon said. ``We're not
having that just unbelievable year like we had last year, where it
just seemed like nothing went wrong, but we don't expect to have
years like that every year. This is one of those years where you've
got to work hard, keep your head and keep going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gordon's results early this year aren't much different
from those in his three championship seasons. Last year, when
Gordon beat Martin for the title by 364 points, he was fourth in
points after eight races, 106 behind leader Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Gordon was third and 94 points behind Jarrett at this
point. During his first title season in 1995, Gordon was third and
trailed the leader by 70 points after eight events.
</P>
<P>
   ``As great as last season was, we're really not any different in
points from where we were last year, except for maybe one more
win,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, crew chief for Gordon's Rainbow Warriors, agrees.
``It's like I told our guys,'' Evernham said. ``We're right on
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his strong standing in points, Gordon has faced more
obstacles than in seasons past. After winning the Daytona 500 for
the second time, the engine in Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet blew up
the following week at North Carolina Speedway, where he finished
39th after failing to complete the final 83 laps. The last time
Gordon failed to finish a Winston Cup race because of an engine
failure was in March 1997 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, where he
placed 42nd.
</P>
<P>
   After his jaw-dropping mechanical problems at Rockingham, Gordon
rallied to win at Atlanta two weeks later, and then he finished
third at Darlington. Over the last month, however, Gordon hasn't
been able avoid the wrecks that he's missed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas on March 28, Gordon blew a tire and crashed into the
outside wall only 68 laps into the 334-lap race. He finished 43rd,
his worst outing in 197 career Cup starts.
</P>
<P>
   At Bristol two weeks ago, Gordon and rookie Tony Stewart were
knocked out of contention during a pileup sparked by Jerry Nadeau.
Gordon's car received extensive damage, but he was able to recover
and finish fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have as much good luck as we've had, you're going to
have some tough times eventually,'' Gordon said. ``I look at this
year and see a blown engine (at Rockingham), a cut tire (at Texas),
and, of course, Bristol was just short-track racing. To be where
we're at in points and have the trouble that we've had, I'm still
very impressed with the way the team has reacted, especially with
the performances where we haven't had problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, says he has never dealt with injuries during his
racing career, which includes several years of driving sprint cars
and midgets in Indiana. He comes into today's race in better shape
than the previous two races, when his ribs were battered on short
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some serious wrecks, and I think because of my
physical size, it helps me come out of them a little better than
some other guys who have a little more mass to them,'' he said.
``I'm 145 or 150 pounds, depending on the time of the race because
I sweat it off. When you hit the wall that hard you don't create as
much force and usually don't do as much damage. A bigger guy will
do a lot more damage to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the wall a couple of years ago at Michigan really,
really hard. I was pretty sore, but I was fine for the race. I
flipped several times in the midgets and sprint cars and tried to
tear my head off, but I've been very fortunate, knock on wood, that
I haven't broken any bones. I've never had an injury that kept me
out of a race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon says the only time he's been kept out of a car was when
he was about 16, when a bad case of poison ivy prevented him from
driving in a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poison ivy was a bad situation,'' he said. ``If you live
in Indiana, you know there's a lot of poison ivy around, and a lot
of pollen. I never had any allergies until I moved to Indiana. Now,
I'm allergic to everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one day I was pulling some vines off the house, just
doing some housework. In Indiana, out in the country, you can burn
leaves, so we threw the poison ivy in the fire. We always had a
little methanol back in the shop from the race car and you can
really get the fire going that way. I remember watching it burn,
and that night it had gone through all my clothes. ... Some poison
ivy scratched my arm, and I couldn't even bend it, and I had to
cancel my race that weekend.

 ORANGE: the case.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Investigation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The call came over the police radio around 8:15 p.m.: two armed
robberies on the south side of town. Be on the lookout for a bald
black man with a stocky build wearing a leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mile north of the robbery scene, three Orange police
officers were taking a break, chatting alongside their squad cars
in a parking lot. Hearing the radio call, they headed for the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie made the first right turn onto Day Street, heading
south. Almost immediately, she spotted someone and called in to
double-check the description of the robbery suspect. She never
asked for backup, and no one heard from her again.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 minutes later, Carlos Gonzalez, a former Orange
police officer driving home from work in Brooklyn, saw Carnegie's
patrol car stopped on the sidewalk, partly blocking northbound
traffic on Day Street, its lights flashing, the driver's door open.
Gonzalez, now an agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, pulled over and found Carnegie lying face up near the
door.
</P>
<P>
   She was mortally wounded, shot in the abdomen and the back of
the head. Her weapon had never left its holster.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez flagged a passing ambulance, which took Carnegie to the
trauma center at University Hospital in Newark. But doctors could
not save her.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:40 p.m., the Orange police dispatcher reported an officer
down at ay Street and Freeway Drive West. Conte, the police
director, was called at home and told that, for the first time in
more than 30 years, a member of the department had been gunned
down. As friends and relatives of Carnegie headed for the hospital,
the search began for her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers immediately began searching the area around the
crime scene. Someone reported seeing a black man running down the
railroad tracks, and an officer gave chase but could not catch up
to the man, Orange police officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the next day, scores of police officers on foot and
in squad cars pressed a chaotic manhunt. The normal weekday calm
was shattered every few minutes by the sounds of blaring sirens and
screeching tires.
</P>
<P>
   At one point near the scene of the shooting, an unmarked cruiser
burst airborne from a parking lot, spun wildly on the rain-slicked
asphalt and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investigators from the Orange force and from the Essex
prosecutor's office, which handles most homicide cases in the
county outside Newark, had plenty to go on.
</P>
<P>
   They had the accounts of three witnesses to the robberies, which
investigators believe were committed by the killer of Carnegie. And
they soon found a witness to the shooting itself.
</P>
<P>
   That person told officers that the gunman had run along a
service road to Interstate 280, toward a public housing complex on
the other side of the interstate, according to a homicide
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the investigator said, the police had canvassed
the grounds of the complex and found a 9-millimeter handgun in a
patch of grass. The gun was handed over to agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for examination.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Green, a spokesman for the bureau, said that by the next
evening, agents had traced the weapon to the Barrow Gun Shop in
Butler, Ga. A licensed gun dealer there had sold it in 1993 to a
Butler resident, Green said. The bureau immediately gave that
information to the Essex County prosecutors, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of the store said that she received a few calls from
officers identifying themselves as agents of the bureau over the
next several days. But no one visited the shop until New Jersey
investigators and federal agents arrived on April 15, a week after
the shooting, she said. They removed records about the 1993 gun
sale and left, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that bureau agents spent the days in between trying
to locate the buyer, whose name has never been released. The buyer
was interviewed by two federal agents and New Jersey investigators
on April 15, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, investigators say, provided the name of Condell
Woodson, an Orange native who had lived in Georgia. He was arrested
in Newark two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrest  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, April 9, the day after Joyce Carnegie was
killed, Terrance Everett, a warehouse clerk for a computer repair
company, was eating breakfast with his wife, son and mother in
their home in East Orange. The television news carried the report
of the Thursday night murder in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Everett said in an interview this week, he
shook his head. ``Whenever they find him,'' he said to his family,
``they're going to whup him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn the next day, Everett was asleep in the third-floor
bedroom he shared with his wife, Ebony, who is 6{ months pregnant.
Sometime after 5 a.m., Mrs. Everett was startled awake by a loud
bang. ``I thought the boiler was exploding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mrs. Everett opened the door to the hallway, she met
eyes with a masked man holding an automatic rifle. Other armed men
downstairs, later identified as members of the entry team of the
New Jersey State Police, were yelling, ``Where is Terrance
Everett?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Everett, wearing only a nightshirt, was led down to the
second floor of the house and pushed to the floor, she said. Her
hands were strapped together behind her back.
</P>
<P>
   Everett followed his wife into the hallway and was ordered to
freeze. He said he was thrown to the floor, cuffed, then pulled
down to the second floor and thrown to the floor again, face down.
One officer stood on Everett's back; others kicked, spit on and
cursed him, he said. Another blew his nose on him.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned down, he peered past the officers who crowded into the
room and saw his son, Terrance Jr., 5, staring back. ``He was
sitting there on his bed, with his mouth hanging open,'' Everett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he asked what he was being arrested for, but no one
answered him. ``They took me downstairs and flung me into the
kitchen,'' he said. ``I fell into the table. One cop picked me up,
then another threw the table out of the way and threw me into the
stove. I bumped into a cabinet, and he tore the door off the
cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   To walk Everett outside to a van, officers needed the key to
unlock the fence that surrounds the front yard. Everett said he
asked if he could turn around to show the officer the right key. He
said another officer hit him in the face with his gun, saying,
``Nobody told you to turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing only the T-shirt and boxer shorts, Everett was taken
outside into the cold light of morning. ``There was a sea of
officers,'' he said, ``clapping and applauding.''

 ORANGE: and applauding.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only after the police van arrived at the Essex County
prosecutor's office in Newark a few minutes later, Everett said,
did he learn that he had been arrested as a suspect in the killing
of the Orange police officer.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, he said, different interrogators came and
went, leaving him alone for long stretches in an interview room.
Over and over, he described where he had been on the night of April
8. He was read his rights, he said. ``But every time I asked for a
lawyer, they'd say, `If you're innocent, you don't need one,' get
up, and walk out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators asked Everett to take a polygraph test. He agreed,
and by 10 a.m., he had taken the test twice, answering the same
questions. He was not told how he had done until about 3 p.m., he
said. ``They told me I'd failed the polygraph.'' In fact, he had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Everett had an easy enough time recalling the details of
Thursday night. He got off work at 6 p.m. and picked up his wife an
hour later at home. The two, who live in Everett's mother's home,
drove off to look at an apartment in Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they drove to the Wendy's on Main Street for dinner.
Everett ordered two junior bacon cheeseburgers with no tomatoes.
His wife ordered two junior bacon cheeseburgers with mayo and
onions only. They had fries and a Frosty, too. Everett noticed an
East Orange police officer enter the restaurant and order a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9 p.m., the couple left for a park in West Orange. They
walked around outside for a while. From there, he said, they
stopped at a cash machine, then headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the interrogation room, investigators resumed questioning
Everett about 3 p.m., he said. By then, the Essex County
prosecutor's office had been torn apart by an explosive debate
about his guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest had been a good one, investigators said. He was a
bald black man who fit the general description of the robber and
shooter. Witnesses identified his photograph the day after the
shooting. And he was a paroled felon who had served three years in
prison for a robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But several investigators felt that his alibi was too thorough,
too calmly delivered, too easily verifiable, law enforcement
officials said. And he had passed the polygraphs. Experienced
investigators grudgingly concluded that they had the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Toscano and others argued to free him, officials said. But Ms.
Hurt refused. About 2 p.m., Toscano resigned, a decision not made
public for four days. Later that night, Ms. Hurt announced that
Everett had been charged with murder, criminal possession of a
weapon and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt would later say that the investigation of Carnegie's
murder had by that time become ``two-pronged'' _ with officers
examining Everett's alibi while continuing to follow other leads
and evidence from the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, a Sunday, that two-pronged approach produced
the odd scene of officers' scouring the streets of this
working-class town, carrying the composite sketch of a killer who
their superiors were saying was already in jail on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that night, the police arrested two more suspects.
James Coker, an unemployed man with a record of at least two
convictions on drug charges, was at his aunt's apartment in Newark
when police officers broke through her front door around 6 p.m. The
police say that officers saw him try to swallow a bit of crack
cocaine as they burst in.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they tracked down Coker, who also fits the
general description of Carnegie's killer, after he bragged to
others that he had killed a police officer and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Essex County Jail on Thursday, Coker, 30,
said he had no part in the shooting. He said he volunteered to take
a polygraph test, but none was given to him. He remains in custody
on charges of drug possession, attempting to destroy evidence and
other outstanding charges, his lawyer, Albert Kapin, said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, sometime after 10 p.m., a police officer
ordered Earl Faison to get out of a green taxicab across the street
from his girlfriend's apartment on the south side of Interstate
280, two blocks from the scene of Carnegie's murder.
</P>
<P>
   But because officials have provided so little information about
the case, it is still unclear why the cab was stopped. But at her
news conference on Monday, Ms. Hurt said that Faison, an aspiring
rap performer who happened to be bald, was picked up because he,
too, fit the killer's description.
</P>
<P>
   When approached by the police, he ran, the authorities said. He
was caught after a chase, carrying a gun, and was arrested after a
struggle. According to an account in The Star-Ledger of Newark, he
was subdued with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Essex County prosecutor's office, Faison
collapsed and died at the Orange police station. One law
enforcement official said that Faison, who was carrying an inhaler
at the time, had suffered an asthma attack, which can be fatal if
untreated. While a preliminary autopsy report ruled out blunt
force, the cause of his death is still undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Faison's father, Earl Williams, believes the police killed his
son and has retained a private pathologist for an independent
autopsy. He said he went to view the body at the county morgue on
April 12 but was shown a picture of the corpse instead. There were
many cuts and bruises on his son's face, which was swollen,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alibi
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fajimolu, the assistant manager on duty at Wendy's the
night of the murder, clearly remembers Terrance and Mrs. Everett
from the night of Carnegie's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   They came in around 8:30 p.m. and sat at a table against the
windows for at least a half hour, he said. In an interview this
week he recalled the special orders they placed, as well as other
details.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple ate, an East Orange officer, a regular customer,
came in for a sandwich and told Fajimolu that an Orange officer had
just been gunned down six blocks away. ``He told me to call if I
saw anyone matching the description,'' Fajimolu said.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, April 10, a detective came by asking to see
the restaurant's security tape. Fajimolu played it back for him.
But images from the night of April 8 had already been erased, he
said. The detective left without asking Fajimolu any other
questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that detectives returned on April 12 and 13 bearing
subpoenas, and another assistant manager printed out receipts.
Investigators say the receipts showed that someone had ordered the
cheeseburgers and soft drinks that Everett said he had ordered, at
the time he said he had.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators did not question Fajimolu. On April 15, he
told his story to reporters for The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Fajimolu was picked up at home and brought to the
Essex County prosecutor's office. He repeated his story for
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That night, as word surfaced that Woodson was the new suspect in
the slaying, Ms. Hurt hastily called a news conference at her
office to announce that Everett had been exonerated. Around the
corner, Everett walked out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   In her office, Ms. Hurt abruptly ended her news conference by
bundling her papers and rising. A reporter shouted a last question.
Would she apologize to Everett and his family?
</P>
<P>
   Saying nothing, the prosecutor walked out of the room.

 &HT;    Pistons harmony just not in cards
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Minnesota, the media got Christian Laettner. That
and his coaches weren't up to his standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the media got him again. That and his teammates
couldn't stand criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, well, here's a start: Wednesday night on the flight
home from a loss in Charlotte, Laettner and Jerry Stackhouse got
into an argument over the nightly card game. Stackhouse, suffering
from the loss of his sister, concerned over his girlfriend's
difficult pregnancy, nursing an injury, wanted out. Laettner
repeatedly called him a name that denotes weakness in a man.
Stackhouse took exception.
</P>
<P>
   According to an obeserver on the plane, Stackhouse punched
Laettner, the two scuffled and fell into the lap of radio announcer
George Blaha.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons say it didn't happen. But writers on Friday noted
Laettner with a very blackened eye, Stackhouse with scratches on
his right hand. The Pistons have closed down the card game and
threatened any player who talks with a $25,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner was supposed to return from injury today, but may have
aggravated his healing rib.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, just another day in the life of a slumping team.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching carousel
</P>
<P>
   TNT commentator Doc Rivers, who has run clinics for NBA players
the past two offseasons but has no other coaching experience, and
Paul Silas, who has turned the Charlotte Hornets around since Dave
Cowens resigned, figure to be hot commodities at season's end.
Silas wants to stay in Charlotte. Rivers is flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams making changes will be forced to turn to unproven
assistants such as Gar Heard, Maurice Cheeks and Rick Carlisle or
dip into the recycle bin for a Bob Hill, Doug Collins or Del
Harris. University of Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins tops the list of
college coaches, while former Georgetown coach John Thompson has
been mentioned with the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Loose tongues
</P>
<P>
   After ripping Charles Barkley for ripping him, Allen Iverson had
second thoughts _ sort of. Iverson's original response: ``To me,
he's the Houston Rockets' problem. Can't no little kid come up to
me and ask why I spit on him. But he's got kids that can come up
and ask him. He's nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Iverson said, ``I don't hate the guy. I don't have any
problems with him. I was wrong to say those things because all I
did was step down to his level, which was wrong for me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The word from Bird
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird says he has no problem with Iverson. ``Who says five
years from now everybody won't have cornrows? Things change. If the
kid can play, he can play. I think he's going to get better. I'm
happy to see him in our league.'' ... The Pacers get booed at home
after every close loss, and Bird says they're not tough. ``They
call that booing? That wasn't booing. You should walk off the
Boston Garden floor when they're booing. They'd meet you out in the
parking lot by your car. Wait until some of these fans wait out
there in the parking lot and challenge them to a fist fight, like
they did in Boston.''

 &HT;    Wormy Big Apple
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Someone had to take the hit in New York for the
Knicks' underachievement this season. It was not going to be the
coach because Jeff Van Gundy had the backing of the players. It was
not going to be Madison Square Garden president because Dave
Checketts would not dare fire himself.
</P>
<P>
   That left the general manager, Ernie Grunfeld, as the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   With unlimited resources, Grunfeld spent $68 million on a roster
that went into the weekend out of the playoffs. Not good anywhere,
but particularly in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Grunfeld traded the heart of the team in Charles Oakley
for a soft and unproductive Marcus Camby and the soul of the team
in John Starks for embattled and inconsistent Latrell Sprewell,
moves that broke the Knicks, but were only part of the reason
Grunfeld was bounced.
</P>
<P>
   Back to that later. The question of the day: Why would Checketts
fire Grunfeld with just eight games to go in the regular season?
That's where this story gets fishy.
</P>
<P>
   When Checketts announced Wednesday that Grunfeld had been kicked
downstairs, the Knicks were only 1 1/2 games out of a playoff
position. There was time to make the postseason, and with no
clear-cut dominant team in the Eastern Conference, no telling what
a hot Knicks team could have done.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts had assured that neither Van Gundy nor Grunfeld would
be let go after the season, saying ``we're all responsible'' for
the team's woes. But with the New York Rangers, also owned by MSG,
out of the NHL playoffs for the last two seasons and the Knicks in
a position to miss the postseason for the first time in 12 years,
Checketts' job hung in the balance, too.
</P>
<P>
   Smart guy that he is, Checketts realized this and made a move on
Grunfeld before his bosses made a move on him. What else could be
the motivation for axing Grunfeld now? Certainly, firing a general
manager would do nothing toward firing up the team. For sure, only
coaching changes spark a reversal in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I did what I did was,'' Checketts said, ``frankly,
so that for those eight games and hopefully the playoffs I can be
involved in a day-to-day way _ and, this summer, understand fully
what the issues of this club are and where we go next.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to go likely will be Van Gundy _ unless the Knicks make a
remarkable about-face. Any reversal would come too late for
Grunfeld, who cannot justifiably feel like the scapegoat when
reviewing his entire tenure with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his shipping of Oakley and Starks were his ultimate
downfall, but Grunfeld contributed to his own demise with a
collection of questionable moves. His draft record is abominable:
Jerrod Mustaf, Greg Anthony, Hubert Davis, John Wallace, John
Thomas, Walter McCarty, Dontae Jones, Monty Williams and Charlie
Ward. Only Ward remains with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he traded a first-round draft choice to Dallas for
guard Rolando Blackman, 34, who was hurt and never reached his old
stature. He traded Mark Jackson for Doc Rivers (who got hurt), Bo
Kimble (no factor) and 6-foot-10 Charles Smith (who never fit in).
</P>
<P>
   And the huge contracts of Patrick Ewing, Ward, Allan Houston,
Larry Johnson, Chris Childs and Camby have the Knicks strapped,
with limited maneuverability. So, he had to go. Where the Knicks go
from here, no one knows. But Grunfeld won't have the burden, which
isn't all bad.

 &HT;    Charlotte showing chemistry
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ Usually, it takes a few years
<TEXT>
to determine the value of a significant trade. But the Charlotte
Hornets are showing that it can be measured in a matter of weeks.
<P>
   With nine straight wins going into the weekend, the Hornets'
acquisition of guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell for
Glenn Rice looks decidedly Charlotte teal blue. Jones and Campbell
have been at the heart of the Hornets' resurgence. After looking to
be out of playoff contention when the deal with the Los Angeles
Lakers went down, Charlotte took over eighth place last week in the
Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, interim coach Paul Silas, with 17 wins in 26
games after replacing Dave Cowens, likely has done enough to get
the long-term job. The Hornets are playing with much more
confidence and greater unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Silas' work with Campbell has restored his confidence, while
Jones has functioned fluidly and freely, knowing he will get ample
shots and playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hornets guard David Wesley: ``I know we've shocked people.
A lot of people had given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, hope has turned into expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A., Rice has been ordinary and the Lakers less than that.
The chemistry that has carried Charlotte is nonexistent in L.A. And
with the Lakers in fifth place in the West, it is not outrageous to
consider that they might be eliminated from the playoffs in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   MORE KNICKS MESS
</P>
<P>
   Guard Charlie Ward, a devout Christian, felt the wrath of
Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts when Ward passed to
teammates an opinion article written by Reggie White. In it, White
criticized women journalists in locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that some guys may be uncomfortable with it,'' Ward
said. ``Or their wives may have the same values expressed in the
article.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts was hot. ``I had a discussion with (Ward) about
that,'' he said. ``I believe in the freedom of speech, but he may
not use our locker room as his pulpit. It's not allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a New York magazine article on Latrell Sprewell
talked of Larry Johnson's affinity for ``tricking the Knicks' young
publicist, Lori Hamamoto, into seeing him naked.'' It went on to
say Johnson would sit naked at his locker room stall after games
with a towel over his lap, then uncross his legs while pretending
to lift his towel. ``Look over here and tell me what my free-throw
percentage was tonight,'' Johnson said to Hamamoto, according to
the article.
</P>
<P>
   Hamamoto said there was no sexual harassment and that she and
Johnson have a great working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson: ``I don't flash people. Definitely not Lori.''

 &HT;    Spurs set sights on dethroning Jazz
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Spurs suddenly find themselves within striking
distance of the conference lead. Three consecutive wins, over
Portland, Houston and Utah, can do that. Tuesday's 83-69 triumph in
Salt Lake City was a boost to a team scorched by the Jazz there in
the playoffs a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team _ more than any other team I've been on _ just
absolutely hates losing,'' David Robinson said. ``We almost hate
each other when we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan enhanced his growing reputation with 36 points, 10
rebounds and 7 blocks against the Jazz. ``We're trying to dethrone
them,'' Duncan said. ``That's the way it is. They've been doing
this for a number of years. This is one game. We haven't knocked
them off, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan scored 14 points in the third quarter. Six came on
20-footers off the pick-and-roll, a play that's synonymous with the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was phenomenal. He was awesome,'' Greg Ostertag said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't spare the Rod(man)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suggestion that Kurt Rambis started Dennis Rodman's
exit by booting him from practice for being late, the truth is that
Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak reached the decision while Portland
was cleaning up against the Lakers the night before. Both were at
the Desert Classic in Phoenix, getting frequent updates by
telephone from a Laker official. They told Rambis, who had avoided
calling Rodman on anything before, to crack down on him the next
time he got an inch out of line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers' defense has fallen apart since the Glen
Rice trade. Before the deal, the Lakers were a top offensive team,
had a 15-6 record and were middle-of-the-pack defensively, giving
up an average of 92.6 points. In the first 20 games after the
trade, they maintained their offensive pace, but lost 10 times as
opponents averaged 99.3 during the stretch. points. Deduction: Rice
could be traded in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Not drowning his sorrows
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen's DUI arrest Thursday morning came after
Houston's 109-95 embarrassment at home against Dallas, but there's
no link between Pippen's erratic play _ he was 2-for-8 in the game
_ and what happened later.
</P>
<P>
   In Pippen's case, he went to dinner, drank beers and was heading
home when he mistakenly turned onto Main Street in Houston,
believing it was one of the downtown one-way streets heading out of
the city, and ran a red light. Stopped, Pippen did not take a
breathalyzer test but failed a field sobriety test.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested at 1:30 a.m., released at 6:50 a.m. and was home
at 7:30. He and the Rockets barely cared at all about playing the
Mavericks until they were whipped so thoroughly that the Mavs began
taunting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jaw-jacking them all night,'' Mavericks forward Gary
Trent said, laughing openly. ``I told Scottie Pippen, there's only
one No. 33 that was going to show up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen wasn't talking, about the game or the arrest.

 &HT;    Vols looking to repeat championship victory
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _Tennessee's Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida
State and the national championship that went with it are almost
four months old. But a quick trip up and down Cumberland Avenue,
better known as ``The Strip,'' makes it clear that the Big Orange
celebration will not be stopping anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Here in East Tennessee, creativity knows no bounds. If you can
sell it, somebody has slapped a big orange ``T'' and the words
``1999 National Champions'' on it. And somebody, somewhere, has
proudly put it in their den.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday a radio voice was hawking color prints of scenes from
Tennessee's Fiesta Bowl victory. Squeeze the bottom left-hand
corner and the voice of John Ward, Tennessee's legendary radio
broadcaster, counts down the game's final seconds. Sterling Marlin,
the Tennessee-born stock car driver, has turned his Busch Grand
National car into a high-speed tribute to his beloved Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, about 15,000 participants in this gleeful insanity
gathered at Neyland Stadium for the annual Orange and White spring
game. Yes, they were curious about next season's team, which has a
good chance of winning the school's third consecutive SEC
Championship. But more importantly, they wanted just one more
opportunity to celebrate the Volunteers' first national title since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame them. If I was a fan I'd be doing it too,'' said
center Spencer Riley. ``The important thing is that we're not doing
it. We stopped celebrating a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 45-5 record the past four seasons and a veteran team
returning for 1999, you might think Tennessee's spring practice
would be low key. You'd be wrong. From the first day of winter
conditioning in January to Saturday's end of spring drills, head
coach Phillip Fulmer has pushed this team even harder than the one
before, lest they even be tempted to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been crazy or anything in our approach but the
message has been clear,'' said Fulmer, now 67-11.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Getting to the top may be hard. Staying on top is
even harder. Fulmer made his point in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's first full practice of the spring lasted two hours
and 50 minutes, a marathon by Fulmer's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' said offensive tackle Chad Clifton, ``we knew it
was going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago during a seven-on-seven tackling drill,
Fulmer detected a lack of intensity. Fulmer stood over the players
and for the next 15 minutes they repeated the drill until the head
coach was satisfied and the players were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that Fulmer publicly dressed down some of
Tennessee's talented but little-used underclassmen, saying they
were ``fat and happy'' after watching the veterans win 24 of their
last 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real wake-up call for some of those guys,'' said
quarterback Tee Martin. ``If this team is going to be as good as we
think it can be, a lot of those guys are going to have to step
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer's stern approach is not so much psychological window
dressing, but a straightforward attempt to push this particular
team to its potential, which is considerable. Simply put, if the
Vols can win at Florida on Sept. 18, they are good enough to get
back in the national championship mix.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Martin returns for his senior season with a 13-0
record as a starter. His favorite receiver, Peerless Price, is
gone, but the stable of pass catchers at Tennessee remains deep.
The offensive line will again be the SEC's best and running back
Jamal Lewis is back after sitting out the last half of the 1998
season with a knee injury. The defense will miss the leadership of
linebacker Al Wilson, the first-round choice of the Denver Broncos,
but still has plenty of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that we can be as good as last
year and even better if we work at it,'' said Lewis, who has had no
contact this spring but pronounced himself ready to go. ``These
guys are still hungry. They remember what it felt like after the
Fiesta Bowl. We want to feel that way again.''

 &HT;    Elway to announce retirement
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Placing health above the potential to make history,
Denver Broncos star John Elway has decided to retire after 16 NFL
seasons, thus bypassing the opportunity in '99 to become the first
quarterback to author a Super Bowl three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than prolong the suspense about his future, as he did
last spring, Elway decided last week to leave the game and began
informing family and friends. He originally planned to announce his
retirement last Wednesday but postponed the media session in the
wake of the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
Despite published reports that a news conference will be held
Monday at noon, the only certainty is that the end of Elway's
brilliant career will be made official early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and coach Mike
Shanahan are aware of the decision. The silence emanating from team
headquarters and Elway's business associates through Saturday was
deafening, but also telling. Agent Marvin Demoff, reached in
Florida, declined comment. Jeff Sperbeck, who supervises Elway's
marketing endeavors, did not return telephone calls. Jack Elway,
his father and the director of pro scouting for the Broncos, said
he ''could not address'' his son's future.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, 38, was at an undisclosed site in Florida playing golf
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is true, I'm sure it's a decision based on health and
lifestyle and spending more time with his family,'' said
quarterback Bubby Brister, who would succeed Elway as the Denver
starter. ''There's no doubt John still loves the competition. But
the last couple of years, even with winning the Super Bowls, have
been tough ones physically. Me and everyone else were surprised
when he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver has reached a contract agreement in principle with former
Falcons quarterback Chris Miller to augment Brister and second-year
veteran Brian Griese, who played in only one game last season. A
series of concussions forced Miller to curtail his career after the
1995 season, but he has recently been cleared to play by several
neurologists.
</P>
<P>
   Elway holds the league record for most victories by a starting
quarterback (148) and ranks No. 27 in all-time passer rating
(79.9). He is second in career attempts (7,250), completions
(4,123) and passing yards (51,475) and third in touchdown passes
(300).

 &HT;    Colorado tragedy too close for West
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week's tragedy at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., hit a little too close to home for Arizona
Cardinals backup offensive lineman Derek West. His brother, Ryan,
teaches drafting and computer technology at Columbine and he
coaches the offensive and defensive line. But Ryan West currently
is on a one-year sabbatical as he pursues a career as a
professional baseball umpire, so he wasn't on campus on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I went to bed and couldn't sleep the whole night,''
Derek West said. Added guard Lester Holmes: ``(Derek) said he spent
the whole night playing the `What if?' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan West's classroom is around a corner from the library, where
most of the slayings occurred. One of the deceased students,
Matthew Kechter, played offensive line for him. He knew another
victim, Isaiah Shoels, a member of the football team. Kevin Harris,
older brother of suspect Eric Harris, is a former defensive
lineman. While a thousand miles away _ working a game at Clinton,
Iowa, in the Class-A Midwest League _ Ryan West was in anguish.
``It tore my heart out watching (on TV),'' Ryan West said. ``I kept
wondering if I might have made some kind of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasing Ricky
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans coach Mike Ditka has taken plenty of flak for
trading all his draft choices this year, with first- and
third-rounders in 2000, to secure Heisman tailback Ricky Williams.
It turns out, though, Ditka and Saints general manager Billy
Kuharich weren't the only ones who offered a king's ransom for
Williams. After taking quarterback Tim Couch with the first overall
selection, Cleveland Vice President Dwight Clark phoned Redskins GM
Charley Casserly and offered the Browns' remaining 12 picks. By
that time Casserly, who actually wanted Williams but deferred to
coach Norv Turner, had agreed to a trade-down with the Saints and a
trade-up with the Bears. To this point, Cleveland has downplayed
the tailback position. It looks like journeyman Terry Kirby will be
the starter, backed up by Sedrick Shaw. Word is, the Browns want to
wait until next year to spend big bucks on a back. Among the
potential unrestricted free agents next spring are Jamal Anderson
(Atlanta), James Stewart (Jacksonville) and Karim Abdul-Jabbar
(Miami). Disgruntled Bengals tailback Corey Dillon will be a
restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Wise guys
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that Oregon quarterback Akili Smith had unfair
assistance improving his Wonderlic test score repeatedly has been
denied by agent Leigh Steinberg. The first choice of the Bengals
raised his score from 17 to 37 (maximum: 50) after a tutor hired by
the agent worked with him. Steinberg claimed Smith didn't obtain a
copy of the test before he took it a second time. Notable, though,
is that Jason Maas, the quarterback with whom Smith split time his
junior season, recently had a 43 after getting a score down in the
mid-teens his first time around. ``We were study buddies,'' Smith
said. The scores of the other first-round quarterbacks: Couch, 22;
Donovan McNabb, 16; Cade McNown, 28; and Daunte Culpepper, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Iron fisted
</P>
<P>
   Given that his NFL resume features stints as an assistant for
Bill Parcells and Tom Coughlin, it isn't surprising that Browns
rookie coach Chris Palmer is running a tight ship. The approach to
discipline was obvious Thursday when Palmer released defensive
tackle Antonio Anderson, a two-year veteran with size (6-6, 318)
and potential, but a player whose work ethic didn't meet Palmer's
standards. The next player out the door could be Clemson linebacker
Rahim Abdullah, a second-round pick who missed a plane and was late
to a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cap-ology
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' salary-cap figure for starting quarterback Vinny
Testaverde in 1999 is $1.3 million. The team's salary-cap charge
for quarterback Neil O'Donnell, who was cut last spring by the Jets
and last week by the Bengals, is $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Corner market
</P>
<P>
   The veteran free-agent pool has been picked over and, outside of
starters such as LB Jamir Miller (Arizona), OG Matt O'Dwyer (N.Y.
Jets), DT Jerry Ball (Minnesota), DE Marco Coleman (San Diego), LB
Marvcus Patton (Washington) and LB Anthony Davis (Kansas City),
there isn't much left. The one position, however, where teams are
going to land bargins is at corner. High-profile players Ashley
Ambrose (Cincinnati), Ryan McNeil (St. Louis) and Darrien Gordon
(Denver) still are available.
</P>
<P>
   Jump(y) street
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't played in two seasons, but former Falcons defensive
tackle Jumpy Geathers hopes to make a comeback at 38. One of the
most powerful inside defenders in recent league history, Geathers
terrorized guards for 14 seasons with his trademark ``forklift''
pass-rush maneuver. His agent, Brett Senior, has phoned several
teams, including the Falcons, but hasn't gotten any nibbles yet.
``No player wants to end his career injured,'' Senior said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus Jumpy looks at the (lack of) quality in the league and
thinks he's still as good as most guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bargain basement
</P>
<P>
   One AFC personnel director's take on the best ``value'' choices
in each round of the draft: First round _ OT Aaron Gibson
(Detroit); Second _ LB Barry Gardner (Philadelphia) and WR Peerless
Price (Buffalo); Third _ CB Chris Watson (Denver) and FS Marquis
Smith (Cleveland); Fourth _ RB Sedrick Irvin (Detroit); Fifth _ TE
Jerame Tuman (Pittsburgh); Sixth _ OG J.P. Machado (N.Y. Jets);
Seventh _ SS Anthony Poindexter (Baltimore).

 &HT;    Charting course of fun
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Judy Helmey deals in the memory business, both
in recounting the stories about her infamous father and in
providing fishing experiences to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran charter-boat captain with 33 years of know-how on the
sea in and around Wilmington Island, Helmey doesn't have a day on
the water go by without both kinds of memories.
</P>
<P>
   Affectionately and professionally known as Captain Judy, Helmey,
46, is the proprietor of Miss Judy Charters, one of the most
popular charter operations on the north Georgia coast. With first
mate Ali Young, also certified by the U.S. Coast Guard as a charter
captain and a valuable partner for 18 years, Helmey will charm an
adult male client by calling him ``Hon'' and baiting the hook for
him, make a youngster feel like the best angler on the boat and, of
course, entertain all with her inherited wit and charm. Both were
passed down from her colorful late father, Sherman. One of
Savannah's most well-known and fun-loving characters, the elder
Helmey lived such a full life that stories of his dealings with
booze, women and Al Capone still are being told. He passed away in
1994 at the age of 92.
</P>
<P>
   In his lifetime, Captain Sherman was married seven times (``He
really enjoyed the ladies,'' Captain Judy says), enjoyed a large
share of fun and mastered fishing and most things mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mechanical abilities that hooked Sherman Helmey up
with Capone, who one night during Prohibition showed up at Helmey's
auto-repair shop, asking if Helmey could deliver a car to the old
Savannah Hotel. ```What's your name?' my father asked,'' Judy
Helmey said. ```Al Capone,' he answered.'' That was the start of a
business venture that had Sherman Helmey building customized cars
to carry illegal booze for Capone.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Helmey also was a skilled charter-boat captain, who
regaled clients with his stories of Capone and other adventures.
Judy was always with her father _ ``He didn't know what else to do
with me'' _ and learned the trade first-hand. She was tending to
the steering wheel and the baiting hooks at the age of 6 and earned
her captain's license by 18.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, with stints at professional water skiing,
real-estate sales and general contracting, she has made her mark on
the ocean, including the discovery of a lost shipwreck, the
Barnstable, a large wooden freighter that disappeared in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Along with taking clients out, she writes a weekly fishing
report for several state newspapers and is ready to publish her
second book. The first, called ``My Father, the Sea and Me,'' was
published in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, what I'll be remembered for will be my stories
about my father, told through the eyes of a child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A day on the water with Captain Judy provides her clients with
their own story-telling fodder.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent outing with members of a family in its second
generation of hiring her, the No. 1 concern was creating a memory
for an 8-year-old girl. And when Brittany Roy, whose father Jeff,
29, fished with Helmey as a teen-ager, caught her first saltwater
fish, it was time for all to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, I thank the fish god,'' said Helmey, after Brittany
reeled in a two-foot little tunny, a smaller cousin of the
yellowfin tuna, caught while fast trolling a cedar plug along the
surface some 20 miles off shore. ``Now I feel better. ... Y'all
see? I told you Brittany would catch the first fish. Did you like
that, Brittany?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was yucky,'' she replied. ``OK, Dad, it's your turn to
get all messy.''
</P>
<P>
   Messy or not, Brittany had a magical day, and plenty of stories
to tell her classmates back in Bolling Brook, Ill., about her
family's spring break trip to Skidaway Island; she not only caught
the only large fish trolling, she also caught more and bigger black
sea bass bottom fishing on an artificial reef than anyone else and
clicked so well with Young that the two spent much of the travel
time sitting together and goofing around in the back of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without her I don't know if I'd still be doing this,'' Captain
Judy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs a lot of money to come fishing, so it's important to
them,'' Helmey said. ``So, it's got to be important to us, too.

 &HT;    Shores of plenty reel 'em in
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARIEN, Ga. _ There are so many tidal creeks and cuts in the
salt marshes around the Altamaha River Delta that only the locals
know where they are. And many of them aren't talking.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing guide Wendell Harper, who has studied since his boyhood
the intricate waterways that make up one of the most fertile
fishing areas in the state, knows where many of those locals live,
including alligators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one, a 10-footer,'' Harper said while navigating up an
unnamed creek in search of a good spotted sea trout bite on a windy
March day. The big reptile, one of several gators seen on the short
stretch of creek, flicked his tail, sending him sliding down a mud
bank into the water as the boat passed. ``I tell you what, there's
some big boys up in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, 46, one of the Georgia coast's most knowledgeable _ and
consequently one of the most sought after _ fishing guides, knows a
thing or two about the gators. Up until last year he would trap
them for the state, dragging them out of such places as swimming
pools, golf course ponds and tourist-covered beaches. He used to
stay busy enough that ``alligator trapping'' had its own line item
on his income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd give us the alligator,'' he says. ``That was our pay.''
</P>
<P>
   You never know what you'll see on a fishing trip with Harper at
the tail end of the second-largest watershed east of the
Mississippi. There are the gators, frequently a beautiful sunrise,
hundreds of different species of birds, and acres upon acres of
marshland, all part of what Harper, a hometown boy making a living
from his boyhood playground, calls ``God's country.''
</P>
<P>
   The focal point is the fishing, however, and Harper is one of
the best at finding them, whether they are his bread-and-butter sea
trout and red drum, or the big tarpon and sharks that pay a visit
every summer. Within a relatively short drive of Atlanta _ around
four hours to Savannah, six or more hours to St. Mary's _ Georgia
boasts some of the finest saltwater fishing in the Southeast. And
it's still relatively unknown, although people are beginning to
realize that they don't have to go to Florida or Louisiana to catch
trophy-sized saltwater fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started promoting coastal fishing 10 or 12 years ago, and
people who come up to me and say, `I didn't know there were big
trout and redfish fishing in Georgia,' or king mackerel, or shark,
or tarpon. They just didn't know,'' Harper said. ``But people are
just beginning to find out that we have a super fishery year-round.
We have something going on every month.''
</P>
<P>
   And the locations to fish are as varied as the species of fish
and techniques used to catch them. Georgia has nearly 20 offshore
artificial reefs, consisting of anything from scrap vessels to
concrete blocks to old tires sunk onto barren sandy areas, where
the bottom fishing is consistently excellent. ``Live bottoms,''
natural reefs like the Gray's Reef and Savannah and Brunswick
Snapper Banks, also are hangouts for bottom-dwellers. There also
are eight Navy combat aircraft training towers 30 to 40 nautical
miles offshore, where baitfish attract open water giants like tuna,
wahoo and sailfish. The Gulf Stream, the warm-water superhighway
that runs some 80 miles off shore, also contain the big fish of the
blue water.
</P>
<P>
   The publication ``Georgia's Offshore Fishing Guide,'' available
from the state Coastal Resources Division, is a must-have for
saltwater anglers. It covers locations, techniques and popular
species, and has a large map which locates many of the offshore
structures.
</P>
<P>
   While fishing won't replace what has put coastal Georgia on the
map _ beaches, golf, tennis and shopping _ it is finding a niche
and begging for more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brunswick area for a long time was looked at as a golf and
tennis resort, but we're starting to see fishing as a viable
alternative,'' said Mark Noble, a charter captain of more than 20
years who is based at Golden Isle Marina near St. Simons Island.
``The local economy gets a heck of a boost from fishing every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's hard to find statistics that back that up, there's
little question that recreational sport fishing has made an
economic impact along the coast. According to Georgia Department of
Industry, Trade and Tourism statistics, more than $1.9 billion was
generated in 1997 (the latest available stats) by tourism in the
state's Region 9, which includes the coastal counties of Bryan,
Camden, Chatham, Glynn, Liberty and McIntosh. Driving the increase
were Savannah (Chatham) and the Brunswick/Golden Isles (Glynn).
It's safe to say that a significant percentage of that figure comes
from fishing; even the Brunswick and The Golden Isles of Georgia
Visitors Bureau includes it in its promotional literature and
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think enough of it we have it in our footage,'' said Bill
Tipton, executive director of the bureau. ``We want people to know
that fishing is part of the package.''
</P>
<P>
   And more local merchants are making money because of it. Harper
is taking clients out as many as 300 days per year, and he also is
a spokesperson for such big-name sponsors like Quantum, Yamaha,
Lowrance and Costa del Mar. The former mill worker claims to have
been skunked only four times in his life, and has caught limits of
trout (25 per person) in every month of the year, which is
difficult for most anglers to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit a good job to do this,'' said Harper, who also competes
in king mackerel tournaments. ``If they made eight days in a week,
I'd fish eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble, holder of two state fishing records (bull shark, thresher
shark), fishes 230 to 240 days per year. He helped organize the
Golden Isles Association, a network of guides who work out of
Golden Isle Marina, just to deal with his overflowing client list.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't fish, I don't eat,'' said the 37-year-old who grew
up on St. Simons Island. ``By the time I was 13, I knew I was going
to make my living fishing. By the time I was 16, I was working on a
charter boat. With a wife and two kids, I have to fish a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, restaurants and marinas feel the impact, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When business is good, it's about as good as it can be,'' said
Rick Smith, co-owner of Two-Way Fish Camp, located on the South
Altamaha River north of the hustle and bustle of Brunswick.
Two-Way, where Harper is based, sells live bait year-round, one of
the few marinas along the coast that does that. ``It gets pretty
hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Isles Marina will host several tournaments this summer,
including the big Golden Isle Kingfish Classic king mackerel
tournament, which will attract 130 to 150 boats the last weekend of
June. ``It's a zoo that weekend,'' said marina owner Boyce Mann.
``It's chaotic. My property gets overrun with people, boats and
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not usually the case for individual charter outings,
however. The excitement comes from what's pulling at the end of
your line. ``If you want to come down and have a fish abuse you,
come for the shark and tarpon,'' Noble said. ``The tarpon pick up
in the summer. I've seen grown men shake their heads and say there
ain't no way a fish can fight that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly appealing to freshwater bass fishermen may be the
red drum. When they mature and leave the tidal creeks, fish in the
40-pound range can be caught in the late summer to early fall near
the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we call bass,'' Mann says. ``Those little ol'
largemouth are nothing compared to them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   If you plan a fishing trip to Georgia's coast, here are some
things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   Using your own boat
</P>
<P>
   _ Get some instruction. There's nothing better than learning
first-hand. Inexperienced boaters should not go out without a
guide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a good, detailed map of the area, but also ask local
experts about any problem areas. Sandbars shift and new creeks are
sometimes formed after storms. Many maps are years old.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the tide tables. Tides fluctuate seven feet or more from
high to low tide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure your electronics work. Depth finders can help you
avoid trouble, and a working radio is a must in case of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a thorough check of your boat before you go to help
prevent a break-down.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a captain
</P>
<P>
   _ What does price include? Find out if there are any additional
charges, like for bait, gas, food, tackle.
</P>
<P>
   _ What kinds of fish will you catch? Find out if you can keep
your catch, whether you can set your own hook (on big fish), and if
you can have your catch cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can the captain terminate a trip? Find out the policy for
shortening a trip because of bad weather and whether you have a say
in that decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ You are entitled to information about captain's Coast Guard
certification status, insurance coverage and boat inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget
</P>
<P>
   _ The essentials: Sunscreen, camera, rain gear (if needed), and
most important, motion sickness medicine. It's better to be safe
than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   GOT-TO-DO COASTAL FISHING TRIPS
</P>
<P>
   While the fishing is great along the Georgia coast from Tybee
Island to St. Mary's, here are some trips that can turn a
freshwater bass fisherman into Captain Ahab.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tarpon: Monsters over 100 pounds raise heart rates July
through September, peaking in August, on sandbars and shoal areas.
Try Cabretta Inlet on Sapelo Island, Pelican Spit off Sea Island
and the St. Andrews Sound between Cumberland and Jekyll islands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spotted sea trout: The bread-and-butter fish for many guides
can be caught year-round in tidal creeks, but September through
November is peak time. You can't go wrong anywhere, but Wassaw
Sound near Savannah and the Altamaha Sound near the Golden Isles
are among the best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red drum: Also known as redfish and spottails, they are called
``bull reds'' when they reach 20 pounds. Bulls in the 40-pound
range can be caught mid-September to mid-November near beaches,
either surfcasting from the beach or from a boat anchored at the
breakers. Big reds can be found in places like McQueen's Inlet on
St. Catherine's Island, sandbars in the Altmaha River Delta and the
mouth of the Satilla River.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whiting: Family-oriented fishing that doesn't require a big
boat peaks during the spring, and is becoming more popular. Small
(the state record is under three pounds) but tasty, they can be
caught in big numbers off the St. Simon's beaches, especially due
east of the King and Prince Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   _ King mackerel: Often exceeding 30 or 40 pounds, the kings
provide excellent summertime fishing as close as five or six miles
off shore. Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, the Savannah
River Ship Channel or most of the artifical reefs off the Georgia
coast will yield kings trolling and live-lining.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try these on for size: bottom fishing on the Savannah and
Bruswick Snapper Banks (around 40 miles off shore) for a variety of
species, or hire a charter for billfish, tuna and wahoo fishing for
the ``Blue Water'' of the Gulf Stream (80 or more miles).

 &HT;    Red drum numbers black again
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ The red drum has made a remarkable recovery
along Georgia's coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The popular species, also called redfish, was on the verge of a
population emergency less than 20 years ago because of overfishing,
as anglers, not burdened by size or creel limits, filled up their
coolers with immature reds.
</P>
<P>
   And the blackened-redfish craze made popular by New Orleans chef
Paul Prudhomme was in full swing, and many anglers were keeping
what was at one time considered a trash fish by locals.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia began bag and size limits in 1986. ``I believe we
prevented a collapse,'' said Spud Woodward, state Coastal Resources
Division marine biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Because red drum in the South Atlantic Ocean mature at the age
of 5, about 27 to 30 inches, and don't leave the tidal creeks and
estuaries until then, every fish kept before the limitations had an
effect on the population. The fish, which can be caught easily in
the creeks right alongside spotted sea trout, leave for the open
ocean once they mature and can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were virtually no fish surviving to the maturity rate,''
said Woodward, who also is considered one of the redfish angling
experts in Brunswick and the Golden Isles. ``We were facing a
50-year moratorium on red-drum harvesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was worse in the Gulf of Mexico, where commercial
netting and overfishing by recreational anglers caused the
population to plummet. Now, Mississippi is the only Gulf state that
allows commercial harvesting, and it closes the season once the
total catch reaches 35,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of the redfish population is proof that limits
work, Woodward said. Now, with a 14-inch minimum and a bag limit of
five, none over 27 inches, redfish are providing thrills for light-
and medium-tackle anglers and fly anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Limitations are working on the Gulf, too. ``They were few and
far between back in 1990,'' said Mike Brainard, a biological
program coordinator for the Mississippi Department of Marine
Resources, Office of Fisheries. Mississippi has a bag limit of
three redfish and an 18-inch minimum, with only one over 30 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward points out that there are other species in trouble.
Snapper, grouper, tarpon, sharks and triple tails are among the
species in the biggest danger, but anglers should keep in mind that
all fish need to be conserved. If you don't plan to eat a fish, you
shouldn't keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to get people into the mindset that the ocean
is not an unlimited resource,'' he said. ``You can't just take,
take, take. You don't have to measure fishing success by the body
count.

 &HT;    King wants Thrashers' job
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dave King is going to Norway and he is taking all of
the essentials: socks, passport, resume.
</P>
<P>
   King, an assistant coach for the Montreal Canadiens and Canada
in the World Champions, May 1-17, is expected to drop in on a few
Team USA practices. But the reason is less to spy on the
competition than to seek out Thrashers general manager Don Waddell,
who has confirmed King as a candidate for the team's coaching
vacancy. Waddell will be scouting prospective draft picks and also
is assistant GM of the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion franchises are always exciting for coaches because
you get a chance to work with young players,'' King said from
Montreal. ``Obviously, the ability to teach is important, and I
feel I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who first contacted Waddell last summer to express his
interest in the job, had moderate success in his three years as
Calgary's head coach, 1992-95. The Flames had three winning
seasons, including two division titles, and a composite record of
109-76-31 (.576), but they had three straight exits in the first
round of the playoffs. He also has coached Canada's national team
for nine years and the silver-medal Olympic team in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Nolan, another Thrashers candidate, also made preliminary
contact with Los Angeles general manager Dave Taylor after coach
Larry Robinson was fired. Nolan said he has mailed out ``25
resumes.'' But Waddell doesn't feel compelled to move quickly with
his interviews. In fact, he acknowledged for the first time the
outside chance that a coach might not be in place before the
expansion and entry drafts, June 25 and 26, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the possible candidacy of coaches still in the
playoffs, such as Colorado assistant Bryan Trottier and Ottawa
assistant Mike Murphy. Murphy was fired after two losing seasons in
Toronto but is being given some credit for Ottawa's success.
Trottier does not have head-coaching experience. The last potential
date of the Stanley Cup finals is June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said he won't talk to any candidate whose team is in the
playoffs, saying, ``It wouldn't be fair to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Right call
</P>
<P>
   There was no complaint, only praise, when the Colorado Avalanche
followed the lead of the Rockies and Nuggets and postponed their
playoff games after the school shootings outside Denver. Colorado
shifted the first two games of the series to San Jose and Nos. 3,
4, 5 to Denver. Veteran Claude Lemieux said, ``When you see
something like this, everybody is touched. I've got a babysitter
who goes to that school. I went to pick up my car (from a repair
shop), and the service manager, his daughter, was in the school.
Denver is a big city but a small town. The more they were showing
on TV, the more faces I would recognize, whether it was kids who
were coming to hockey games or we'd see at the rinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky's desire to stay involved in the game has spawned
rumors that he might rescue one of the ailing Canadian franchises _
say, Edmonton. ``I would tell you what I'd tell anybody that came
to me with a business venture,'' Gretzky said. ``I'd look at
anything. I'll study anything. To tell you right now I'm going to
own a Canadian team, it's not true. To tell you I won't own a
Canadian team, that's not true. I haven't made a decision yet. My
focus is on my kids in school and living in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the NHL
</P>
<P>
   This is a pivotal offseason for the Chicago Blackhawks, who
ended the season with a six-game winning streak and own four picks
in the first two rounds of the draft. ... St. Louis winger Scott
Young missed an $800,000 shot at an empty net in the final
regular-season game. His 25th goal would have triggered a $300,000
incentive. Pavol Demitra, who passed up a shot for his teammate's
sake, would have collected $500,000 for an assist and his 90th
point. Demitra also had six goals disallowed this year, four
reversed on replay and two voided by the referee. ... Thrashers
assistant GM Les Jackson's name has popped up as a candidate for
expansion Minnesota's top job, but neither he nor the Thrashers
have been contacted. Jackson, who also had pursued Atlanta's GM
position after several years as an assistant in Dallas, cracked,
``I've been on that prospect list for a long time. It's turning
into a suspect list. Having said that, I'd certainly be interested
if they called.

BASEBALL COLUMN: JETER HAS INGREDIENTS TO BE ANOTHER YANKEE GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add phrase ``as a manager'' in the first sentence of the
fourth from last graf)  
(lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter, on several occasions, had the pleasure
of meeting Joe DiMaggio, and the pleasure, at least on the surface,
was usually all his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hello and a handshake,'' Jeter said. ``He pretty much
kept to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The truly great Yankees come in all shapes, sizes and
personalities. When Mickey Mantle died, Willie Randolph fondly
recalled being a rookie infielder, and Mantle, on opening day,
1976, suddenly appearing at his dressing stall with a smile as wide
as Oklahoma. ``That was Mickey,'' said Randolph, the Yankees'
third-base coach. ``He never big-leagued me.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't DiMaggio, old and more aloof than ever by 1996, when
Jeter claimed shortstop at Yankee Stadium for a generation, unless
the demon dollar someday wreaks historical havoc. That was fine
with Jeter, who as a child summered at his grandparents' house in
northern New Jersey. He didn't need DiMaggio to compare batting
stances or recite his Hall of Fame statistics. Only one number
mattered to a 21-year-old who wanted so much to be right where he
was.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was No. 5, then and forever, a single-digit legend. And
Jeter, like a child born into royalty, was No. 2, about to launch
his own reign in pinstripes that could one day take him from
shortstop out to Monument Park, where DiMaggio's new granite
memorial will be unveiled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fitting for Derek to have one of the last single-digit
numbers that remains,'' David Cone said. ``I'm not sure if it was
intentional, but whoever made that decision, it was a pretty good
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   There are great Yankee moments, and there are great Yankees, and
people should not confuse the two. On Friday night, when David
Wells returned with Toronto to pitch against the champions he
helped make, the Yankees replayed the last out of his perfect game
against Minnesota last May 17, just as Wells was taking the mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classy gesture, compared with say, the cheesy half-time
video the Knicks played when Charles Oakley came home in his
Toronto Raptors Barney suit.
</P>
<P>
   This display of appreciation and warmth on a cold, damp night
was long dissipated by the time Chili Davis, appropriately enough,
doubled home two seventh-inning runs, sending Wells off to a 6-4
defeat and the rest of his career. It sure would spice up the
season if he and the young Blue Jays could push the Yankees in the
American League East, but these Yankees won before David Wells, and
they will win after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely made his mark in Yankee history in a short
period of time,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   They were two endearing seasons, one memorable. Wells pitched 10
years in the majors before he set foot in the Yankee clubhouse. The
notion of him as Mr. Yankee is about as far off base as DiMaggio
being remembered as Mr. Coffee. Bucky Dent won a pennant in Boston
with a home run for the Yankees in 1978, which made him the
architect of a great Yankee moment, not a great Yankee. The
standards are higher around these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells may be a Babe Ruth fanatic, a student of Yankee history,
but Jeter is living it. His rocketing career is being nurtured by
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many teams in any sport where there is so
much tradition and where so many players are showing up to remind
you of it,'' Jeter said. ``When I first got here, I had a chance to
play with Mattingly, and that was an honor. In spring training, you
look up and you see Goose Gossage, and then walk around the corner
and you see Reggie Jackson. You come here, and Yogi Berra is
throwing out the first ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, 24 and already a two-time champion, said, ``You get
spoiled around here.''
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Yankees in September 1995 and was handed No.
2, Jeter said he figured it was the smallest jersey, the best fit
for a wiry middle infielder. He was asked if he knew which other
Yankees had worn No. 2, and didn't have to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crosetti and Murcer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the clubhouse said that Wayne Tolleson, a 1970s spare
infielder, also wore No. 2. Maybe there was a grand design to this
assignment, maybe not. All Jeter knows is that he has one of two
remaining single-digit numbers. His manager, Joe Torre, No. 6, has
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Torre already has two rings, one more as a manager than Billy
Martin, retired No. 1. On another day when this most famous of
American sports franchises relishes its past, it is not
unreasonable to wonder if both numbers, 2 and 6, will ever again be
worn by anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being No. 2. It's been mine since I got here,'' Jeter
said. ``But I don't think about the retired-number stuff. I'm just
getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes about his work with an attitude that presumes nothing,
which is why Cone calls him ``the future captain of the Yankees.''
Jeter is filling out now in that No. 2 jersey, driving the ball
with power, hitting around .400.
</P>
<P>
   Three years does not make a great Yankee any more than Wells'
two, but Jeter isn't going anywhere soon. He has a chance to be the
last single-digit hero, another monument to Yankee history, Joe
DiMaggio's neighbor forever. The pleasure in achieving it would be
all his.

 &HT;    Scholarship offers low-income kids choice of schools
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was like winning one of those TV sweepstakes.
Zenovia Andrews, a 31-year-old single mother, and her son Donovan,
a fourth-grader at Mary Lin Elementary School in Atlanta, were
flown to New York City last week to be part of a celebrity-filled,
joyous kickoff for a $170-million giveaway of private school
tuition for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the Children's Scholarship Fund is to give needy
families who are unhappy with their public schools the wherewithal
to escape, or at least up to $1,700 a year for four years at a
private school, provided they pay a fair share of the tuition based
on their income _ on average of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   It is not certain that this scholarship will exert the healthy
pressure on unsatisfactory public schools that backers say it will.
But one thing is becoming clear: Once regarded by civil rights
leaders as a further threat to inner-city schools already reeling
from an earlier form of school choice _ white flight _ the concept
is turning out to be enormously popular with minority and
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to strike a deep chord, as the 1.25 million national
applicants for 40,000 CSF grants indicates. ``The middle class and
upper classes have those choices,'' said former Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young, a stalwart of the civil rights movement now on the
CSF board. ``It's only the poor that can't choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews was one of 380 winners out of 13,798 applicants from the
city of Atlanta _ and the only Atlanta winner to be part of the
media event. It was her first visit to New York and Donovan's first
airplane flight. It was also the first time either had met Martin
Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader and a CSF
advisory board member whose office as Southern Christian Leadership
Conference president is right around the corner from their
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   What Andrews remembers most, in the swirl of events, was
Donovan's smile. He likes his public school, she said, but his
smile turned huge ``when he realized he was going to go somewhere
and make something of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   This concept is not new. In 1992, the Georgia Public Policy
Foundation, a conservative think tank, launched a similar
scholarship program in Atlanta for the five-county metro area, with
$1 million from a local businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Education Foundation selected some 200 low-income
children from about 25 times as many applicants. It pays half their
tuition for up to $3,000 through the eighth grade, according to Jim
Kelly, an Alpharetta lawyer who administers the program and lobbies
for tax-funded tuition vouchers for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   That scholarship never expanded beyond the first crop of
scholars, failing to find enough donors from among Atlanta's
business and foundation leaders, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Although their academic achievement was never studied, those who
have been getting the tuition grants express a deep gratitude for
the help. They have been enrolled at 39 local private schools and
one public school where the parent must pay tuition because the
family lives out of that school's district. Most of the students
attend small church schools and Catholic schools with tuition in
the $2,500 to $4,000 range, but some are at selective schools such
as Trinity School and Woodward Academy, where tuition tops $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Lambert has her daughters Stacy, 11, and Dominique, 10,
enrolled at Pathway Christian School, a K-8 school in East Point
for about 90 children, thanks to the Children's Education
Foundation. Lambert said she could not possibly afford private
school without the help, since she makes only $17,000 a year as a
second-grade teacher at Pathway Christian. (The school waives the
other half of the $3,200-a-year tuition for each daughter as a
fringe benefit for Lambert.)
</P>
<P>
   She knows her daughters are getting an academically superior
education, she said. Stacy has been accepted for next year at
Marist, an academically selective Catholic school. Her daughters
have been in private schools from the beginning. But Lambert said
the public school students that she teaches as a library volunteer
and Sunday school teacher are too often not able to read at write
anywhere close to their grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarship families say they seek private schools because of
smaller classes, a more orderly atmosphere, more respectful
teachers and stronger academics. But they say religion, the one
thing public schools cannot instill, is one of their highest
priorities _ a preference reflected by studies of private school
choice.
</P>
<P>
   People who pay taxes should have a right to educate their
children in their own faith with some of that tax money because it
serves the common good, said Estill Covington, two of whose
children receive the Atlanta foundation scholarships at Southwest
Christian Academy. The principle is the same for all religions, he
said, though he added, ``We're biased _ the more Jesus, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, as a teacher, has become increasingly critical of the
public schools in her neighborhood. She observed a class at Dean
Rusk Elementary, a school where test scores are at or above the
state and national averages despite having 95 percent of its
children qualifying for lunch subsidies. ``What bothered me was the
lack of accountability of the teachers to really give a good
delivery, to teach a good lesson, because of the problems that
exist between kids in the class. For example, I found one kid to be
very disruptive and the teacher was constantly trying to get him
under control and teach at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she doesn't think any privately funded scholarship will
be big enough to force the public schools to be more responsive to
parents. She is now lobbying for a bill in the Georgia Legislature,
called Early HOPE, that would provide state education funds to a
private school for any low-income student who chooses that school
as an alternative to a low-performing public school. Similar bills
have been introduced in Florida, where they are close to passage,
and other states. Milwaukee and Cleveland have been diverting tax
dollars to private schools chosen by families for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia bill is languishing because of strong opposition,
especially from black Democratic representatives. That's why
Lambert said she will vote against her state senator, Vincent Fort,
the next chance she gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should put our money into strengthening the
curriculum, motivating our kids, and holding the schools
accountable,'' Fort said in response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a movement toward that,'' he added, referring
to a commission Gov. Roy Barnes will chair this year to study these
issues for a major school-reform package in the next legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Mayor Young has a suggestion: ``Why doesn't
Roy Barnes take some of that discretionary lottery money and expand
the opportunities for low-income children?''

 &HT;    SERBIAN AMERICANS PROTEST NATO BOMBING
 &HT;    540&AMP;add. With NATO-SUMMIT.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of angry Serbian Americans protested
outside the White House on Saturday, demanding that their country
stop bombing their ancestral homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Hey! USA! How many kids did you kill today?'' they
chanted in condemning America's leadership in the NATO air war
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   After riding buses all night from the heartland, the
demonstrators assembled in Lafayette Park just north of the White
House and marched through a downtown section of the nation's
capital. But they were not allowed within several blocks of the
Andrew Mellon Auditorium and Ronald Reagan Building, where NATO
officials are commemorating the 50th anniversary of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Waving Yugoslavian flags and wearing T-shirts with bull's-eyes
that identified them as ``NATO targets,'' the protesters called
President Clinton a war criminal and charged that the news media
had not told the nation the whole story about the centuries-old
conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 600,000 Serbs expelled from Croatia in 1995,'' said
Alexander Vucelic of Mansfield, Ohio. He wondered why ``CNN and
Clinton'' weren't ``talking about ethnic cleansing and refugees
then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America has lost its soul in this act of bombing Yugoslavia,''
said Vucelic. ``The Nazis burned books to suppress the truth. Now
America is bombing TV stations to suppress the truth,'' he said in
a reference to Friday's destruction of Yugoslavian state television
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the crowd said they opposed the regime of
Yugoslavia's President Slobodan Milosevic, but they said the NATO
bombing is unifying the Serbs and solidifying Milosevic's hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is my refugee _ my mom,'' said Lana Simic of New York
City. ``On the second day of bombing, my mother came over from
Belgrade. ... To kill people in the name of saving people is
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters released black balloons that they said symbolized
the lives of Yugoslavians killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the crowd were straight from middle America.
There were white-haired men with World War II medals pinned to
their sweaters, young couples with toddlers in target T-shirts, and
boisterous boys in Cleveland Indians caps. Older people greeted
each other with three traditional kisses on the cheeks, while
younger ones slapped high fives. A group of teen-aged girls in
bell-bottomed jeans came from St. Stevan's(cq) Serbian Orthodox
Church in Chicago and led chants of ``Long Live Serbia'' and
``NATO, Shame on You.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents came from Kosovo and we all have relatives still
there,'' explained Gordana Ristic, one of the girls, adding that
the anti-war movement ``is a big thing in our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1 million Serbian Americans and they cling to
their heritage, said Tanja Gavrilovic, who drove all night from
Cleveland to attend the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in the United States, but the first language I
spoke was Serbian. I learned English in school,'' she explained.
``What people don't know is that what Jerusalem is to Jews, that is
what Kosovo is to us. The last Serb, down to the women and
children, will fight and die before we give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirjana Vekich, daughter of Serbian immigrants, said she was
born in Chicago but regards herself as both American and Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Serbian culture is very rich,'' she said, describing how
she grew up in a neighborhood where children learned Serbian folk
dances and everyone ate cevape, a Serbian sausage. She has made
several trips to the land of her forebears. But the United States
is now her home, and she feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that Serbs are fighting for our land _
in Kosovo, our holy land,'' she said.
</P>

   The Serbian-American rally was much larger than the
demonstration held at Lafayette Park a day earlier by
Albanian-Americans who supported the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-war demonstrators carried placards denouncing Clinton,
NATO, Secretary of State Madeline Albright, the news media, and
most pointedly, the bombing of Yugoslavia. ``Serbs Have Children,
Too,'' said one sign. ``Collateral Damage _ My Family,'' read
another.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vucelic of Columbus, Ohio, attacked the ``hypocrisy'' of
Clinton telling students in the aftermath of the Colorado school
killings to resolve conflict without violence _ while pushing a
policy of violence against Yugoslavia. ``He should do what he
preaches,'' said Vucelic.

 &HT;    Talladega races make drivers nervous wrecks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ They've bumped and rubbed their way around the
short tracks for the past two weeks, but some of NASCAR's top
drivers are expecting the worst in today's DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many places where I wake up on Sunday morning and
I'm nervous,'' said Winston Cup points leader Jeff Burton. ``I
don't mind telling you, when I wake up at Talladega on Sunday, I'm
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who has held the points lead for more than a month,
starts third today, behind pole-sitter Ken Schrader and Bobby
Labonte, who's fifth in points and 184 behind Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, the only driver with seven top-10 finishes in nine
events this year, says starting up front doesn't assure that he'll
avoid the inevitable big wreck on the 2.66-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about running up front, being safe,'' Burton said.
``Man, all the wrecks I see that are big start in the front, and
they're big because they're in the front and there's nowhere to go.
You can't hide from the wreck here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to Michigan or Rockingham or Charlotte, and if the car
doesn't drive right, you just slow down. But you can't do that
here. It's `Just wait for the wreck, and hope you miss it.' And if
you miss it, you tell everybody how good a job you did. And if you
get in it, you tell 'em you couldn't avoid it. That's the way I do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte won last year's race, giving Pontiac its first victory
ever in a restrictor-plate race. Labonte's average speed last year
was 163.439 mph, more than twice as fast as John Andretti's winning
speed last week at Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who got his first Winston Cup victory here in July
1988, says there are ways to avoid a chain-reaction wreck at
Talladega and Daytona, superspeedways where NASCAR requires
restrictor plates to curb speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything we can do to avoid the wreck?'' Schrader
said. ``Yeah, not run so fast and don't run in such big packs. But
the object of our sport is to go really fast and get there first.''
</P>
<P>
   Schrader has been especially fast in qualifying at Talladega,
where he won the pole for the Winston 500 in October. In that race,
however, he went from first to 21st after only one lap when a train
of cars drafted by his No. 33 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can happen at superspeedways like these. You just
hope it doesn't happen to you every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who is third in points and will start sixth today,
says he's hoping to finish 188 laps unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a big wreck here, and I just know I'm going to
be in it,'' Martin said. ``I've wrecked here a lot, and it hurts
really bad every time. Racing here is like giving drugs to a drug
addict or chocolate to a chocoholic. You can't put us in a position
where we can make a pass if we go four-wide because we're going to
take that chance.

 &HT;    Earnhardt's last lap gets IROC victory
 &HT;    By Al Levine and Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ Dale Earnhardt answered that annoying question
_ can he win again?_ by passing Rusty Wallace on the last lap and
winning Saturday's 38-lap International Race of Champions (IROC) by
.075 seconds at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   He also won at Daytona in this series that matches 12 champions
from different types of racing. He's led only a lap in each
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the only one you need to lead,'' Earnhardt said. ``You
don't need to lead any more laps. Lead one lap, the last lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is struggling to answer the question in Winston Cup,
the series he used to intimidate. He's won only once in his last
100 Cup races and hasn't led a lap since November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give me the best piece you can give me and give me equal
stuff, I can beat anybody,'' Earnhardt said. ``I still feel that
way. (Car owner Richard) Childress and the guys still feel they can
win races and win championships with the team. We've just got to
get the pieces in the right place. And I'm not saying they're not
that far apart. It's just competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the competitiveness is what's keeping him from victory
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes every ounce of everything you can do to win today,''
Earnhardt said. ``The best engines, the best chassis, the best
bodies, the best driver, to stay on top of everything. It's not
just one part of it that's going to carry you and win. The driver
can make the difference if he makes the right decisions or the
wrong decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He took Saturday's victory by getting an aerodynamic push from
third-place finisher Mark Martin, nudging lightly into Wallace's
rear bumper and passing Wallace on the last corner.
</P>
<P>
   Cope(ing) with hardship
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tough year for Winston Cup veteran Derrike Cope.
Cope, who won the 1990 Daytona 500 when Earnhardt cut a tire on the
final lap, was one of five drivers who failed to qualify for
today's race.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cope's fifth DNQ in nine events this year, two more than
his total in 31 races last season. Cope has failed to qualify for
three of the last five events.
</P>
<P>
   Bahari Racing officials have reportedly contacted other drivers,
including former Busch Grand National champion Steve Grissom, about
driving the No. 30 Pontiac. But Cope's contract with Bahari Racing
owner Chuck Rider runs through the 2000 season. Cope is 42nd in
points.
</P>
<P>
   Martin disgusted
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup veteran Mark Martin finished third in Saturday's
IROC race and he'll start sixth today. But Martin said he was
disgusted about speculation that he really didn't try to qualify
for this weekend's Busch race.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is candid about his dislike of superspeedways,
failed to qualify for a Busch race for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty humiliated to not run fast enough to make the
(Busch) race,'' Martin said. ''Some of the people in here (media)
said I didn't try hard enough. I didn't like that too much. We got
beat by people who were more on top of their game than we were.''

 &HT;    No easy explanation for tide of tragedy
 &HT;    Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ A rising river of disturbing currents,
some of them surface riffles that catch the eye only to disappear,
others deceptively deep and swift, snatched away 13 innocent lives
in Littleton last week.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenness and violence by which they were drawn under left
those on the banks searching for the pattern of currents that
somehow combined to subtly draw in Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
then violently swamp an entire high school, leaving 12 students
slain and a popular teacher to die slowly despite the toils of
horrified students to stanch the flow of blood and pull him back to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer horror of it stopped a nation in the middle of a war
and forced it to confront an ugliness within as repellent as the
ugliness outside.
</P>
<P>
   The short explanation for the ugliness comes with long
footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply believe it is the culture and I think we adults have
abdicated a very substantial and important part of our authority in
the oversight of our culture,'' said William Moloney, commissioner
of the Colorado Department of Education and a writer who has
suggested that ``moral education'' is the missing link in modern
educational instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have drained our popular culture and our institutions in
general, education specifically, of any sense of moral judgment,''
said Moloney, who was appointed to his post by a Democratic
governor, Roy Romer, and kept on by a Republican, Bill Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The only virtue that survived the draining was tolerance and it
survived in the ``perverted notion'' that any idea is as good as
another, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``by that calculus, Hitler and Gandhi both qualify as
philosopher kings, albeit with different approaches to
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the nature of the place, though, doesn't
necessarily explain how it was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gallagher, president of Mesa State College, said he was
moved to tears by the experiences of the students who survived the
killings in the hallways and library of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, he said, took him to compare his rebellious
years with those today.
</P>
<P>
   The prime difference was that he expected, he knew, those
rebellious times would end, leaving no lasting ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major difference I see is that today some of the things
are a little more long lasting'' _ from tattoos to thought
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gallagher said, young people are more independent and
free-ranging at a time when they are most susceptible to pernicious
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We communicate with no holds barred, no family supervision.
All kinds of wild and weird things can be talked about'' but with
no influence to force reality back into the picture, Gallagher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Popular attitudes toward violence and gore have changed, as
well. The film ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' horrified and
fascinated, but there was no admiration for the guy wielding the
chainsaw. ``Natural Born Killers,'' though, spawns a cult following
and hero worship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take all these things _ desensitization, the reinforcement
of anger, the lack of supervision and connection of people to
values and what the hell do you expect to see happening? Something
pretty weird,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   What was ``pretty weird'' was also lethal and horrifying, he
said, and something that defied easy explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest explanation _ that two teens so angst-ridden that
they transformed themselves into death-dealing automatons _
shattered quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought these guys were almost like robots,'' Gallagher
said. ``Then I realized they did have human characteristics _ all
the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had emotion, laughing about blowing those people away.''
</P>
<P>
   How the killers got that way is a Gordian knot of false trails.
Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, were good students, so nix the notion
that they were disengaged students who needed only to be reached.
</P>
<P>
   They were so-called Goths _ members of the Trenchcoat Mafia _
who dressed in clothing as dark as their ruminations posted on the
Internet. But Goths offered them no haven, either, rejecting them
as much as others did.
</P>
<P>
   They had criminal records, but both were considered salvageable.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold weren't the obvious threats they seem to be
in hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   Such killers ``could have been wearing white T-shirts as easily
as they could have been wearing black trenchcoats,'' said School
District 51 board member Denise Henning. ``I don't think there's
any one thing that you can ban in the way of apparel that would
have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   So, said Grand Junction Acting Police Chief Marty Currie, it's
perfectly legitimate to conclude from the outburst in Littleton
that Grand Junction, or anywhere, is a no safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rational'' to have such fears, said Currie, whose
department sent officers to schools after the shooting to talk with
students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does raise the level of consciousness with regard to
mortality issues.''
</P>
<P>
   A killing spree ending in suicide and the apparent effort to
destroy Columbine in a fireball explosion raises other issues, as
well, Moloney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize there is such a thing as moral illiteracy,
from parents to presidents,'' said Moloney, who points to the
beginning of the ``permissive climate'' in schools as starting
during the time ``of the mind's true liberation,'' the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of 16-year-old John Tomlin, killed in the spree,
said the schools fail by ignoring important religious and moral
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are disintegrating, partly because prayer has been
removed from them,'' said Doreen Tomlin. Asked whether the school
system had failed, the boy's father, John, said, ``The only system
that has failed is that God is left out of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts aren't new, said Ted Albers, former president of
Mesa State College, who said modern schools have gone overboard in
their willingness to tolerate deviant behavior while also
displaying ``an indifference to spiritual values. They are
important to a strong person and doubly important to a weak one.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, ``What you'll see is the strengthening of
community, law enforcement, the schools, St. Mary's Hospital,
agencies, the religious segment, all the pillars of our society
joining hands as a team to address kids' needs,'' said Marilyn
Connor, executive director of middle school instruction for
District 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribal memory is short,'' though, said Moloney. ``God, I
hope at the end of this we have a little more to show for the
experience than a new brochure _ `10 Warning Signs That You Might
Have A Mad Bomber In Your Midst.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this galvanizes public opinion and elected officials to
tackle the tougher questions. Why is it for instance, that so few
people lack the will or desire to take on Hollywood, but so many
are rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of taking on
Charlton Heston?''
</P>
<P>
   Heston is president of the National Rifle Association. The group
scaled back plans for a Denver gathering in deference to the wounds
of the Columbine catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Hollywood might be challenged. Moloney said
he welcomes the notion of suing filmmakers for putting out works
that inspire violent acts, much as gun manufacturers now face suits
and tobacco companies have been sued with success.
</P>
<P>
   One way to prevent such outbreaks would be to make sure that
young people are aware they have a future, Henning said.
</P>
<P>
   Dark messages about the future _ ranging from predictions of the
failure of Social Security to fears of war _ ``are
disillusioning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids in this culture kind of lose a sense of hope in
their future. They start thinking there's not a future out there
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools, she said, have to connect the value of education with
the prospect of a future.
</P>
<P>
   For the educational system to regain confidence, Albers said, it
must regain the trust of students and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Through all that has changed, he said, the lessons he learned at
his first teaching job in Meeker ring true today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were honest and made it plain you there to protect
their interests, the students really warmed to you. It makes an
impression on young people when you let them know you're there to
protect them. Every parent ought to have the feeling that their
teachers are doing everything they can for their children. If every
school was filled with teachers like that ...''

   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 98-1, a bill that will give
states and school districts greater flexibility in how they spend
federal money. The so-called ``ed-flex'' legislation allows local
education authorities to apply for a waiver from regulations tied
to federal dollars. If a waiver is granted, a shcool district could
take the federal money it receives for one program and use it for
another program they deem more necessary. Supporters said the bill
reduces red tape and empowers local communities to decide what is
best for their schools. Only one senator spoke against the bill,
saying the measure does not require adequate accountability on the
part of the states and could undermine programs intended to provide
aid to disadvantaged students by diverting the money into general
programs. President Clinton said he will sign the legislation. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   TEXAS-SCHOOL-BOMB _ WIMBERLEY, Texas _ Law enforcement
authorities found gun powder, crudely made explosive devices,
computer disks with information on how to make bombs and numerous
documents downlaoded from the Internet with similar information in
the homes of three juveniles arrested for planning an attack at
Danforth Junior High School in Wimberley. Officials say the
juveniles gave statements and from those statements it is clear the

Kurdish government. The U.N. Estimates that more than 200,000 Kurds
have been forced from their homes in Iraq since 1991. In this tent

where many end up, refugees tell of being jailed until they agree

more than 23,000 third, sixth and eighth graders. Teachers, kids,
outside researchers and city officials offer contrasting views of
what has happened since. This massive experiment could be repeated

Clinton's suggestion to ban social promotions in public schools

parents in this program, while they appreciate it, didn't use it to

program is to show that we should have tax-funded vouchers, the
move to religious school raises constitutional problems with mixing

from a public good to a private commodity. (Cumming, Atlanta

SPORTS COLUMN:   STANDARDS ARE HIGH FOR MIA HAMM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ She has not scored in six games. In some
sports that would be a disaster, in others a slump. In soccer, six
games without a goal could be considered a mere statistical blip,
but not for the productive and marketable Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the primitive soccer environment of the United States,
people are beginning to harbor expectations. Americans expected
Steve Sampson and the American men to be better than whining
incompetents in the 1998 World Cup in France. Hip fans expect
Norway-United States in women's soccer to make the arena rumble,
every time.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the expectations of Mia Hamm, she of the burning
eyes, she of the feral rampages. When she does not score, there is
the vague sense of disorientation, like, ``Isn't the weather
supposed to get warm right about now?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm says it is no big deal. She does not make predictions, but
she might very well score one or two Sunday afternoon when the
United States plays China in Giants Stadium in a major tuneup game
for the Women's World Cup in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals will come,'' Hamm said. ``I feel I'm playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   She is indeed playing well. With two vintage runs, Hamm was
directly responsible for both goals in Thursday night's 2-1 victory
over China in Hershey, Pa., with a goal in injury time. She also
clanged the goal post with a shot, and shot wide once, and was
generally the offensive beast of prey that has made her the most
renowned female soccer player on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mia played a great game, one of her best in a long
time,'' said her coach, Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   On a team of veterans, Hamm is the one with 104 career goals in
166 international games, three goals short of the women's world
record, held by Elisabetta Vignotto of Italy. She said it doesn't
matter who scores, but her teammate Michelle Akers respectfully
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I played up front,'' said Akers, who has moved
into the midfield at age 33. ``I was expected to score, and I
expected myself to score. We know Mia scores goals. We want her to
score goals. We need to put people away earlier than we are doing.
But, she's playing well, and she's drawing two defenders, and her
goals will come.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Hamm is becalmed, and people notice, because Hamm
is the one with the silken tresses in the shampoo commercial,
because she is the one on the magazine covers, the golden scorer
who just might persuade businesspeople that a women's league could
draw fans to neat little stadiums like the one in Hershey.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be fair, but goal-scorers have more tangible
expectations than the rest of their teammates. Ask Batistuta. Ask
Ronaldo. Ask Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Or, ask Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is not an individual sport,'' she establishes on Page 5
of her book, ``Go for the Goal,'' soon to be published by
HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't score all the goals, and the ones I do score are
usually the product of a team effort,'' Hamm writes. ``I don't keep
the ball out of the back of the net on the other end of the field.
I don't plan our game tactics. I don't wash our training gear (OK,
sometimes I do), and I don't make our airline reservations. I am a
member of the team, and I rely on the team. I defer to it and
sacrifice for it, because the team, not the individual, is the
ultimate champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite right. This team, however, was constructed with the
general assumption that No. 9 would come roaring down the right
side, find an open spot in the defense and score a goal.
</P>
<P>
   She was on her way in the 20th minute Thursday until a Chinese
defender hauled her down. Hamm was still shaking off the impact as
Akers converted the penalty kick. Then in the 92nd minute, Hamm
caught up with a bold Shannon MacMillan pass, turned the corner and
blasted a shot that the goalkeeper could only deflect. Tisha
Venturini, coming off a 40-yard run, converted for the winning
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia draws two people to her,'' Venturini said. ``She creates
space for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm said she is simply playing her game, but she admitted that
the long haul toward Summer Games and World Cups does wear players
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Hamm said. ``But we're playing with a new
enthusiasm. I've been hard on myself, but I have to remember that
China is one of the best teams. Their defenders are so technical,
so athletic, and they challenge you on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects the Chinese to haunt her, the Norwegians to jostle
her, the defenders to pack around her. For all that, people expect
Mia Hamm not to go six games without a goal. There were no
expectations like this when women's soccer started to take off a
decade ago. It is a sign of success, albeit probably an annoying
one to the scorer herself.

 &HT;    Diary had Trenchcoat Mafia plan
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Columbine High School students Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold spent a full year plotting their deadly melee at
the school, down to the most chilling detail, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A diary recovered at one of the boys' homes, which began in
April 1998, included maps of the campus with notations on the
cafeteria schedule and which rooms would be most crowded at various
times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It even listed a ``rock-and-roll time'' _ the exact moment the
boys planned to enter the school with guns blazing, Jefferson
County Sheriff John Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time line of the planning of this thing,'' Stone said.
``The bottom line is they wanted to do as much damage as they could
possibly do, to burn their school down and go out in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten document is riddled with Nazi ideology and
German phrases, Stone said, and confirms that the boys wanted to
kill their classmates as revenge for the ostracism and taunting
they said they endured from more popular students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the whole thing was hate,'' Stone said. ``It was,
`We want to be strange and different and we don't want the jocks
making fun of us so we're going to punish you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also gave little credence to an e-mail message
received by a Denver newspaper Friday, which left the impression it
was sent by one of the killers and warned of more violence to come
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have little reason to believe either suspect sent it,''
Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. ``We believe it was prepared
and sent after their deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, security at area schools has been beefed up, Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued their search for any links that might lead to
additional suspects. Stone has believed from the start that the two
boys had too many bombs and guns to carry into the school by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Police found more than 30 homemade bombs at the school and in
the boys' homes and cars, some of which were said to have been
strapped to their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The two teen-agers, who killed 12 students and one teacher
before taking their own lives, carried a machine pistol, a
semi-automatic carbine rifle and two sawed-off shotguns into the
school. They both wore black leather trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   Several student witnesses have said they think a third shooter,
dressed in a white T-shirt, also was at the school. But police
think instead that one of the two killers discarded his trench
coat, noting that one of them was found dead wearing a white
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have not named anyone else as a suspect,'' Davis
said. ``But the investigators say they are getting a lot of good
information and that information may implicate others.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had hoped to finish their investigation at Columbine
within a week, but the sheer volume of evidence means it will
probably take several more weeks, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already booked over 2,000 pieces of evidence and we
haven't even scratched the surface,'' he said, noting that every
piece of shrapnel and bullet fragment must be cataloged.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives worked most of the day Saturday, but planned to take
today off. Many will attend a public memorial service near the
school, at which Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to appear.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton addressed the tragedy in his Saturday radio
message, saying he would soon send Congress a request for $12
million to set up emergency teams to help communities in the
aftermath of such incidents. He will also push measures making it
harder for teens to get guns.
</P>
<P>
   As the grisly police work continued Saturday, tearful family and
friends attended a funeral service for 17-year-old Rachel Scott,
praising the vivacious teen who had recently starred in a school
play and hoped for a career on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's small red car has been covered by flowers in the school
parking lot, where sobbing students have gathered for days,
sometimes sitting with heads bowed and their hands gently touching
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine students will resume classes for the remaining three
weeks of the term on Thursday at nearby Chatfield High School,
splitting their schedule with the school's regular students.
</P>
<P>
   Police continued to defend their actions during the rampage,
saying the school's resource officer fired at the suspects within
minutes and that a make-shift SWAT team was in the building within
15 or 20 minutes of the first reports of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Stone said video footage of the incident may have
created a false impression because scenes of SWAT team members
standing around or huddled behind vehicles outside the school did
not show the teams of officers already inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to have one SWAT team shooting at another SWAT
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said investigators are compiling a time line that will
hopefully show all the key incidents, including when the firing
stopped and when the suspects died, if that can be gleaned from
autopsy reports. An accurate time line might address the concerns
of relatives of slain teacher William ``Dave'' Sanders, who have
questioned whether Sanders might have been saved. After herding
students to safety, Sanders was shot in the chest and bled to death
in a classroom over a three-hour period, despite frantic cell-phone
calls to police from students with him.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also revealed that a sawed-off shotgun barrel was found in
the bedroom of one of the shooters, along with bomb-making
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be concerned about my son if I found a sawed-off shotgun
barrel in there,'' he said. ``The parents should've been aware of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents of both shooters have issued public apologies through
attorneys, but have since been in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The diary found at one of the suspects' homes reinforces reports
from students that Harris and Klebold were motivated by rage at
being harassed by more popular students, particularly athletes.
</P>
<P>
   While administrators have said the student body has no more than
the normal amount of tension among various groups, some students
have painted a different picture.
</P>
<P>
   There were athletes at the school who would shove around people
from Klebold and Harris' group, even throwing rocks or sodas at
them, some students have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups ``hated each other,'' said Joe Stair, who
graduated from Columbine last year but hung out with the Trenchcoat
Mafia _ the self-described group of outcasts that included Harris
and Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a lot of persecution from the athletes, so I guess
they just felt pushed too far,'' Stair said. ``These were two very
angry young men.

HOUSE TO DEBATE THE KOSOVO WAR THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, is preparing to move ahead with a full House debate on
the Kosovo war this week, despite reservations in both parties
about votes emphasizing legislators' profound divisions over the
nation's involvement in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a full, fair and open debate on the House floor
next week,'' Pete Jeffries, a spokesman for Hastert, said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders in both houses and both parties had been
trying to head off a floor debate on Kosovo. But Hastert's hand was
forced by Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who has complained that
President Clinton is waging an unconstitutional, undeclared war.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell asserted his rights under the 1973 War Powers
Resolution and filed two measures for a vote _ one declaring war
and a second requiring the withdrawal of American troops from the
Kosovo conflict. The War Powers Act requires that such measures be
brought to the floor quickly for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House is also expected to vote on several competing
measures. One would require that Clinton seek congressional support
before committing ground troops to Kosovo. Another is expected to
support the president's current course.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, John McCain, R-Ariz., has also tried to spark a
debate on Kosovo policy by introducing a measure to give Clinton
the right to use ``all necessary force'' in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Senate majority leader, has
refused to bring McCain's measure to a vote. Aides said Lott wanted
neither to give Clinton a blank check nor to comfort President
Slobodan Milosevic by defeating the resolution.

WITH EACH GAME, THE KNICKS COULD BE IN OR OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By SELENA ROBERTS

<P>
   For all of their bitter history with the Heat, for all of the
bile the mention of their rival brings to the surface, the Knicks
will arrive in Miami far less worried about gloating and far more
concerned with their own survival.
</P>
<P>
   Things are different now. In the past, a late-season meeting
with Miami could determine the division title or the home-court
advantage in the playoffs. Now, the Heat is at the top of the East
and the Knicks are in a fight with the Raptors for the eighth and
final playoff spot with seven games left in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there right now, we're in the playoffs,'' said Latrell
Spewell after the Knicks held on to beat the Charlotte Hornets,
110-105, Friday night. ``But we can fall out just as easily.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone understands how precarious each game is, it's Patrick
Ewing. Almost eight weeks ago, Ewing willed his 36-year-old body to
keep going into overtime against the Heat. Panting and pouring
sweat, Ewing galloped around the paint and let go of a 13-foot
runner over P.J. Brown just before the buzzer. It kissed the rim
and bounded off. That was it. The Knicks went down, 85-84, in
overtime at the Miami Arena on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   So much has happened since. Back then, the Knicks were 9-5 with
little reason for concern. Until Friday night, the Knicks were a
.500 team and out of the playoffs. But something unusual happened.
After their 18-point, third-quarter lead against Charlotte
shriveled to 1 point with 1 minute 2 seconds left, Ewing finally
hit that elusive runner.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing stared down the shot clock as he planted himself outside
the paint with his back against Derrick Coleman and the ball in his
palm. The seconds ticked off and the crowd bubbling inside Madison
Square Garden grew edgy.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts of all of those missed game-winners, of all the botched
free throws in the pinch this year could have been circling his
head like buzzards. But he wasn't pondering failure. Typically
Ewing, he believed he was going to take the shot, make the shot and
be the hero and perhaps be the one to start the salvage effort on
this tumultuous Knicks season.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Ewing's faith was rewarded as he delivered a 6-foot
running jumper with 24.9 seconds remaining. Ewing's shot gave them
just the lift they needed to end their four-game losing streak,
poke their heads back into the playoff standings and halt the
Hornets' nine-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the same shot I was criticized for taking the other
day,'' said Ewing, referring to his awkward miss in the final
seconds of a loss in Philadelphia. ``That's my shot. I've been
shooting that one my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a sure thing, though. When Ewing let go of the shot,
there was a hush in the Garden as the ball bounced around the rim
before going in and giving the Knicks a 106-102 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice, it bounced twice,'' Ewing said with a smile. No, four
times, he was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Ewing said, ``it went in, didn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   It was swallowed by the net right in front of Coleman. That made
it all the sweeter for Ewing. With 2:05 left in the third quarter,
and with the Knicks' lead slipping, Ewing and Coleman had been
trading barbs. After being called for traveling, Coleman turned and
shoved Ewing in frustration. Ewing went back at Coleman. In the
middle stepped Charlie Ward, who was tossed aside by an irate
Ewing. Then, tempers cooled and each remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing couldn't believe Coleman was still on the court. Ewing
said Coleman threw a punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't throw a punch,'' Coleman said. ``I just shoved him.
Part of the game. He was putting on a show for the people. I said,
`Meet me in the tunnel.' He didn't say anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said he didn't hear Coleman, but responded with sarcasm:
``I'm scared. I'm so afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing shakes Ewing's bravado. Not Coleman, not an endless
stream of misses this season. This time, the bounce went Ewing's
way and the Knicks prevailed in a crunch. So often, it hasn't
worked out that way for this team. So often, Ewing has been left as
the tragic figure. On four occasions this year, Ewing has had the
game-turning jumper in his hand, and each time he has been left
slumped in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night Ewing was undeterred. ``It hit the back of the
rim, the front of the rim, the side of the rim,'' Coleman said.
``That's just touch. A lot of people wouldn't have had the courage
to take that shot.''

EVERYTHING BUT THE ANGST: ITEMS FROM WOODY ALLEN FILMS SOLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By COLIN MOYNIHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ The place was a nondescript warehouse in the Long
Island City area of Queens, the time Saturday. But the thousands of
objects crowding the shelves and floor in the cavernous space
potently evoked other places and times: there were radios and
clunky microphones from the 1930s and '40s, a tall wooden phone
booth with folding doors, the kind Superman would use, and a
collection of halberds, pikes and tridents of the sort you might
see in hell.
</P>
<P>
   You did see them in hell, actually, if you saw the Woody Allen
movie ``Deconstructing Harry,'' about a bitter, blocked writer who
spends some time there for his sins.
</P>
<P>
   The demonic implements and other artifacts are props, set
dressings, and wardrobe items from Allen's movies over the last 10
years, removed from storage by his production company and put up
for auction. The goals were to regain much-needed warehouse space
and to raise some money for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 9 a.m., hundreds of people began to file into the
10,000-square-foot basement warehouse to look at the approximately
3,700 items, to be auctioned in 446 lots starting at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   To Allen aficionados, the auction was a rare public opportunity
to own a piece of that quintessentially New York thing, a Woody
Allen movie. Arlene Lederman paid $20 for a replica of a wedding
cake used in ``Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it will encourage my daughter to get married sooner,''
she said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Brown, a bookstore owner, was hoping to add to the
archive of thousands of books, posters, scripts and stills related
to Allen that he has amassed over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Woody Allen might end up as the most significant
figure in 20th century American film,'' Brown said. ``Fifty years
from now, all these things could be important.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction's organizers had a more prosaic view. ``We had to
make a pragmatic decision to dispose of a certain quantity or rent
another warehouse,'' Richard Brick, who has co-produced Allen's
three most recent films, said on Friday ``We decided to dispose of
a quantity. It's like cleaning out your attic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the producers of Woody Allen's last six films,
Sweetheart Productions, have added objects used in those movies to
an existing stock of similar objects, some dating back to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   This cache, stored at another warehouse in Long Island City,
provided Sweetheart Productions with a valuable source of material,
as many of the items were recycled for use in more than one
production.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, after the shooting of Allen's latest film,
which features Sean Penn and Uma Thurman and has the working title
``Woody Allen Fall Project 1998,'' ended, members of the production
company realized they were running out of storage space. They
decided to part with about a third of their inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Brick said he proposed several options for jettisoning the
surplus material to Jean Doumanian, the producer of Allen's last
six films. In February, he said, Ms. Doumanian decided to hold an
auction and donate the proceeds to the National Alliance of Breast
Cancer Organizations, and to two AIDS research organizations, AmFar
and Elton John's AIDS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   During two days in late February, Santo Loquasto, the celebrated
production designer for 19 of Allen's films, went through the
collected objects, and earmarked some for auction. Trucks took
those items to the auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Brick said the objects up for auction had never been appraised,
but Richard Schlesinger, the president of Top Hundred Promotional
Sales, who is to preside over the auction, said the target was
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetheart Productions has never held an auction of our
stock,'' Brick said. ``And I don't think there has ever been a
one-day sale of movie memorabilia from one director on this scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many of those left,' he said as he gazed at the
telephone booth. He went on to point out a group of radios and
microphones that he said had been used in ``Radio Days'' and
``Bullets Over Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   He indicated several facsimiles of skulls that he said had been
used in ``Shadows and Fog,'' then paused next to the archaic
weapons used in the hell scenes in ``Deconstructing Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to them was a likeness of the head of John the Baptist,
molded from polystyrene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was a scene of hell, we weren't supposed to use
material that could catch on fire.'' he said.

<P>
   DOLGEVILLE, N.Y. _ The folks here have nothing against Sammy
Sosa, calling him a fine fellow and a great ballplayer. But for a
year now, there has been no more passionate a group of Mark McGwire
fans than the people of this wooded little village on the southwest
shoulder of the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hails from California and plays his home games in St.
Louis, but his bats are made here, at the Rawlings Adirondack
factory. For generations, the sweet crack of wood on horsehide has
been music to Dolgeville, and never more so than when McGwire is
swinging. Since his assault on baseball's home run record last
summer, sales of Adirondack bats have soared, and so has employment
at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire chased the ghosts of Roger Maris and Babe Ruth,
staying barely ahead of Sosa, the race became one of the biggest
things ever to happen to Dolgeville, population 2,300. At Motor's
Inn diner, where the old-timers gather early in the morning, at the
North Hudson Woodcraft factory, where workers make parts for pianos
and coffins, and in the village's taverns and parks, everyone
became a fan of the St. Louis Cardinals slugger, rooting for him to
beat Sosa, of the Chicago Cubs, to the record.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they both eclipsed Maris' single-season record of 61
homers in 1961, McGwire finishing with 70 and Sosa with 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all anyone could talk about,'' said Nadine Johnson,
owner of Motor's Inn. ``We were all so excited about McGwire, the
race and him using bats from here.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, like many other players, has a promotional deal with
Rawlings, but he favored its bats long before he was paid to do so,
before he became a star.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the attention paid to his feats did to sales of the
Adirondack bat, Rawlings Sporting Goods, based in St. Louis, will
not say. ``It's a trade secret, but I will say it has meant
hundreds of thousands of bats,'' said Tim Socha, the plant manager.
``We've been going nuts since last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In an ordinary year, the factory's base work force is about 25,
climbing to 55 in the busy season of winter and early spring, Socha
said. ``But we've been running around 90,'' he said, ``and we're
hiring to keep three shifts going.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rawlings' most recent corporate report, its wood
baseball bat revenue for the six-month period ended Feb. 28 was
more than $2.3 million above the same period a year earlier, even
as sales of its other sports equipment fell. The report credited
McGwire with the increased bat sales. Rawlings had total revenue of
$170.6 million in the year ended Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Barnes has worked in the Dolgeville factory for years, but
only with the buzz of the last year has she become a true fan. ``I
never paid much attention to baseball, really,'' she said. ``But
you just couldn't help getting excited about it. I mean, these are
our bats.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the best economic news in a long, long time for
Dolgeville, tucked in the hills north of the Mohawk River and 23
miles east of Utica. The century-old clapboard houses and the
flower beds here are well tended, but behind the trim exterior, the
village is fading, its population and job base declining steadily,
like so many places upstate that have lost the manufacturing that
once fed them.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown lost its furniture makers and the Crescent wrench
works, Troy lost the Arrow shirt collar factory, and Schenectady
lost American Locomotive Co. and most of General Electric.
Dolgeville's soon-to-be relic is the Daniel Green shoe factory, a
great stone castle along East Canada Creek that once employed
nearly 1,000 people, but has seen a series of layoffs. Most of the
jobs have moved overseas, and the factory will cease production in
June.
</P>
<P>
   At least one resource has not deserted the region: the northern
white ash, common to upstate New York and Pennsylvania, that is
used in nearly all wooden baseball bats. Some of McGwire's bats
have returned home, after a fashion. They now rest in the Baseball
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, an hour's drive south of here.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack bat was born here in the mid-1940s _ it became a
part of Rawlings in 1975 _ and early on, its fortunes rose with the
long ball. Bobby Thomson of the New York Giants popularized the
brand in 1951 by using one to hit the fabled home run that won the
Giants the National League pennant over the Brooklyn Dodgers in the
pivotal playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Wood bat makers nearly went under when aluminum bats became
popular in the 1970s. Aluminum bats last longer, they are lighter
and, most important, a ball hit by one travels faster and farther.
Though the professional leagues use only wood, aluminum bats
account for the great majority of the $115 million-a-year domestic
bat market.
</P>
<P>
   But a backlash against aluminum bats has begun. After scores
sharply increased and a number of pitchers were injured by line
drives that were too fast to defend against, the NCAA imposed new
rules last year restricting the performance of aluminum bats to
make them more like wood. Officials are considering banning them
entirely. A few collegiate and high school leagues have voluntarily
given up aluminum for wood.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is good news for Rawlings, a distant second in the
wood bat market _ how distant the company will not say _ to the
market leader, Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby of Louisville, Ky., maker of the
Louisville Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings makes about one-third of the bats used by major league
players, who are notoriously particular about their equipment.
Hitters have been known to demand _ and receive _ new bats
delivered overnight, and they have been known to reject bats for
the tiniest flaws, real or imagined. A major leaguer who plays
regularly will go through 100 to 150 bats in a season, Socha said,
at $29 apiece.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The differences between one brand and another are tiny, but as
is often noted, much of hitting is in the mind, and most players,
like McGwire, use the same model every time up, unwilling to
tolerate any unfamiliar element that might distract them. Sosa is
unusual in that he readily switches not only brands but also bat
sizes, and, in fact, has used an Adirondack bat on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   A McGwire bat is 34 1/2 inches long and a relatively light 33
ounces, compared with 36 inches and 36 ounces for his fellow power
hitters Albert Belle and Jose Canseco, who also swing Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Their almost superstitious insistence on sameness, plus
lucrative promotional deals, makes most hitters paragons of brand
loyalty. Exclusive users of Adirondack bats have included Willie
Mays, Mike Schmidt, Reggie Jackson, Willie McCovey and Roberto
Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Like major league teams looking for raw talent, Rawlings sends
scouts into the countryside to hunt for the best trees. The wood is
cut into cylinders, kiln-dried to make it resist cracking, turned
on a lathe, sanded into shape, heat-stamped with the company's logo
and usually dipped in a lacquer finish.
</P>
<P>
   For the bats sold to the general public, which can cost as
little as $10, the lathing and sanding are automated and take
seconds. But in a room to one side of the factory, the major league
bats are made with far greater care, each one taking several
minutes. The room is lined with hundreds of ``pattern bats,'' one
for each major league client, used to guide the lathe when a new
bat is being made. The sanding is done by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it happens,'' said Bill Steele, supervisor of
the major league room, pausing as if even he, after 30 years at the
factory, were still a little awed by it all. ``It was amazing what
McGwire did last year, and it's amazing what's happened to us. I'm
glad to be a part of it.''

   BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y. _ If Cindy Adams were dishing this
particular item, she might give it a new twist on her famous
kicker: Only in the Hamptons, kids, only in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Adams, the gossip columnist for The New York Post, has
kept mum about the rumble on Lumber Lane, where she has a vacation
house that has her neighbors in a snit.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that in the four years she has owned the place, Ms.
Adams has built her property up and out, crowding it with
structures that do not have the proper permits, surrounding herself
with enormous hedges and attracting the kind of crowds that might
make New Yorkers envious, but here in the East End has the
neighbors deploying lawyers and press releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to be tolerant, understanding neighbors, but it
just reached the point where people on the street were concerned
that this was changing the character of the street,'' said Morris
Zand, the owner of a New York City marketing firm and Ms. Adams'
next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of longtime residents who don't want to see a
very quiet, rural residential area turned into a kind of halfway
house for group living,'' said Arthur DiPietro, a lawyer for
another neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   So the neighbors complained, and the complaints attracted the
building inspector, and the inspector issued summonses: The
additions to her little house lacked the right permits, he found,
and not only was the tiny artist's studio in the back too close to
the rear property line but it also appears that people are living
in it, in violation of the street's single-family zoning.
</P>
<P>
   This complaining is not unusual here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoning and land-use issues are probably the dominant local
issues in this town,'' said Vincent Connuscio, the supervisor of
Southampton Township, which includes this hamlet. ``And this is
especially typical in the most affluent areas of town.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the industrialist Ira Rennert, for example, are
suing the Southampton Zoning Board of Appeals because it allowed
him to build a vacation home about twice as big as the White House.
And Harry Macklowe, the builder, is still in a legal tussle with
the design queen Martha Stewart over landscaping Macklowe wanted
for a common border, but to be fair, that's in East Hampton, not
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough tsoris without that one,'' Connuscio said,
using the Yiddish term for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Like those cases, most property fights here on the East End tend
to be among people so rich and so famous that they have long since
discarded any thought that they might one day lose an argument,
Connuscio suggested, and so the hostilities tend to be confined to
the properties ``south of the highway,'' to use the local term for
the high-rent district.
</P>
<P>
   But while it is true that Ms. Adams is high profile enough to
have her own fragrance _ Gossip, by Coty _ her modest compound is
on the north side of Route 27 and hard against the Long Island Rail
Road's single track to Montauk. It does not seem like the kind of
place for a big-name face-off, but it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an emotional level, people are offended by the fact that
there is a kind of heavy-handed arrogance about it,'' DiPietro
said, ``with absolutely none of the kind of communication with the
community where you say, `Hey, this is what we want to do, and
would you mind?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams had been summoned before the Zoning Board of Appeals
but she sent a lawyer instead. She did not answer messages left for
her at The Post, and her lawyer, Deirdre Venables, did not respond
to messages. In the local papers, however, Ms. Venables has been
quoted as saying that Ms. Adams assumed the builders knew what they
were doing, and she has requested variances for her transgressions.
Another hearing is set for next month.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hendrickson, a farmer who has just been told that under
the law, only one of two houses he owns on a piece of land may be
occupied, is in no mood to cut Ms. Adams any slack. He is still
raising spring crops on a two-acre plot adjoining the gossip
columnist's property, but he would like to subdivide the land one
day, and with Ms. Adams' studio so close to his property he thinks
his land is worth less.
</P>
<P>
   A variance for the studio? ``I think she should cut about 10
feet off of it,'' he said.

IS NAME RECOGNITION A BUSH ACHIEVEMENT? 
WANTED BY GOP: MONEY MAN 
DORNAN WON'T QUIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ariz., Ohio, Ind., Tenn., N.H., N.J., Calif.)   (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poll takers often include a caveat when they report the results
of Election 2000 surveys in which Gov. George W. Bush of Texas runs
unusually well, which is most of the time. They warn that at this
early stage, name recognition probably accounts for much of the
strength that Bush is demonstrating in theoretical primary matchups
with the 10 or so other hopefuls in the huge, sometimes confusing
Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   So what's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide survey taken last weekend for the Reuters news
agency, the Zogby polling organization presented 705 likely voters
with a list of 11 possible contenders for the Republican nomination
and asked, ``If the primary were held today, which candidate would
you vote for?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won with 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was the order of finish for the rest of the field:
Elizabeth Dole, the former president of the American Red Cross, 17
percent; Sen. John McCain of Arizona, 9 percent; Rep. John Kasich
of Ohio and Patrick Buchanan, the commentator, 4 percent each;
former Vice President Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes, the publisher, 3
percent each; former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. Robert
Smith of New Hampshire, the conservative activist Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes, the commentator, 1 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Then the poll takers read the 705 likely voters brief
biographies of possible Republican candidates, but identified them
only as `Candidate A' or `Candidate B' and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush _ Candidate D _ came in first once again. But this time he
won with only 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer finished second with 15 percent, followed by McCain with
14 percent and Mrs. Dole with 12 percent. No other candidate
finished with more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, where the primary field is limited to
just two contenders, Vice President Al Gore beat former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey by 65 percent to 22 percent when identified
by name and by 61 percent to 27 percent when identified only by a
brief biography.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby calculated its polling to have a margin of sampling error
of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, of course, voters know exactly who George W. Bush is,
and not just because of his famous name. Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   When the Scripps Howard news organization polled Lone Star
voters a couple of weeks ago, asking them to cite Bush's No. 1
accomplishment in office, 45 percent said they could name nothing
specific.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, told The Dallas
Morning News, noting that the governor nevertheless had a job
approval rating of close to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they know he has been an accomplished
governor,'' Ms. Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   In Fund-Raising Race, Democrats Set Pace
</P>
<P>
   The race is on to see which party can raise the most campaign
cash for next year's contest for control of the House of
Representatives. Given that Republicans now control the 435-seat
body by only about a dozen seats, only the presidential race is
likely to see more money-grubbing over the next 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
boasted that it had raised $6.8 million in the first quarter of
1999, more than twice as much as it had ever raised in the first
quarter of a nonelection year. ``And the biggest stuff is yet to
come,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., the chairman of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that the Democrats smell blood, Republican fund-raisers
are running scared _ or acting that way.
</P>
<P>
   With their best money man, former Speaker Newt Gingrich, out of
office, they have no one who can remotely compete with the top
Democratic fund-raiser, President Clinton. Furthermore, the
National Republican Congressional Committee started out the 2000
campaign more than $3.5 million in the red from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's executive director, Scott Hatch, insists that
his group is coming on strong and will be ahead of the Democrats in
fund-raising by the time it files its next campaign cash report, in
late June. But in the meantime, the committee's treasurer, Donna
Anderson, is warning the faithful to fork over, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are faced with an emergency situation,'' she
writes darkly in her latest fund-raising letter. ``Last month we
fell $267,500 short of the money needed to fund our incumbent
support programs. Add this $267,500 to the $538,700 we need to get
through April and you'll understand why I'm so upset. Either we
raise $806,200 by April 30 or we immediately begin slashing our
candidate recruitment efforts, delaying our candidate training
schools and curtailing our staff. In fact, if we fail to raise at
least $315,800 in the next 10 days, our entire effort to stop Bill
Clinton and the ultra-liberal Democrats from recapturing control of
the House could be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe It's the District, Not the Politician
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dornan has been accused of a lot of things. But nobody
has ever called the hard-right Southern California Republican a
quitter.
</P>
<P>
   After Loretta Sanchez, a liberal Democrat, snatched away his
Orange County congressional seat in 1996, he first charged voter
fraud and, when that went nowhere, came bellowing back in 1998,
only to be defeated a second time by Ms. Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   His old congressional district, the 46th, was once one of the
most reliably Republican and conservative in the country. But
California is ever changing, and in recent years the 46th has
steadily become more Democratic and more liberal as more and more
Hispanics have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan could not, or would not, change as his district changed.
Then he compounded his political troubles by engaging in several
yelling episodes in the House chamber that left his congressional
colleagues appalled and his constituents back home thoroughly
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, twice repudiated, Dornan is looking to move out _ out of
the 46th but not out of politics. He says he has bought a vacant
house lot in the 48th District and also has his eye on a couple of
houses in the 45th. Both are nearby and have a political makeup
more like the old 46th than the new 46th.
</P>
<P>
   Whether voters in either would be more forgiving than those in
the 46th is but a guess. But Dornan told The Orange County Register
last week that he would move to the 48th tomorrow should the
current congressman there, Ron Packard, also a Republican
conservative, retire _ something Packard is not known to be
contemplating. And he said he was considering moving to the 45th
because the congressman there, Dana Rohrabacher, another Republican
conservative, did not help him in his contests with Ms. Sanchez,
even though, he insisted, he earlier helped Rohrabacher win an
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggest political mistake of my life,'' Dornan said, some of
the old bombast and anger again on display. ``I still haven't
forgiven him.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: CANSECO'S REVIVAL GOES SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jose Canseco is not at Yankee Stadium this weekend with the
Toronto Blue Jays; he is in Florida with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
But he is with the Blue Jays in spirit, and therein lies the tale
of the man who is contributing to the early-season success of
perhaps the two most surprising teams in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Before losing to the Yankees on Friday night, the Blue Jays were
on an eight-game winning streak, and they still lead the AL East.
Before Saturday's game, the Devil Rays have won six consecutive
games and six out of seven overall from Boston and Baltimore.
Canseco was instrumental in both streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Separated seven years ago from his brother in bashing, Mark
McGwire, Canseco has enjoyed a revival in his specialty. He clubbed
a career-high 46 home runs for the Blue Jays last season and leads
the major leagues with eight this season. The Blue Jays wanted to
re-sign him as a free agent, but he opted to move south.
Nevertheless, he left a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing he did for us last year was he talked to the other
guys,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager, said. ``I think they
needed to hear from someone other than the group they had been with
for five or six years that they were good players. The motivation
they had from him and the success we had late in the year enabled
them to turn the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash cited the improvement of the Blue Jays' younger players,
including Carlos Delgado, Shawn Green, Shannon Stewart and Alex
Gonzalez, as examples of Canseco's good work. Delgado and Green had
their best seasons last year and have made strong starts this
season, as have Stewart and Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa Bay, meanwhile, Canseco has applied his personal touch.
Besides the example he provides with a bat in his hands, the
34-year-old designated hitter has spread his word as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings the attitude that he's just going to take his swings
and whatever happens happens,'' Larry Rothschild, the Devil Rays'
manager, said. ``I like that attitude: I'm going to take my best
shot. If it doesn't work this time, it will work next time. That's
had an effect on our players.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the communication Canseco has had with the younger
players, Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll spend time with them, talk to them,'' Rothschild said.
``A lot of pressure is taken off them with him here. He's been a
lightning rod for the media. The other players are left alone to do
their thing. Everything Jose has done here has been positive in
every aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his swagger, Rothschild added. That, too, has been a factor
because it adds to the positive attitude Canseco exudes.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie team last year, the Devil Rays hit 111 home runs,
the lowest American League total since 1992. Entering Saturday's
games, the sophomore Devil Rays had hit 21 home runs in 18 games,
the third-highest total in the league and one more than the Yankees
had hit.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the No. 2 team in home runs was the Blue Jays,
who had hit 24 despite Canseco's departure. Green led with five
home runs and Delgado had four. Furthermore, the Blue Jays through
Friday had the second-highest batting average in the league and
were tied with Cleveland for the most runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   And they have mustered this lusty offense with little production
from the DH spot that Canseco abandoned. Not that the Blue Jays
didn't try to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted $28 million for four years,'' Ash said. Canseco
earned $2.25 million last year, and the Blue Jays, Ash said,
initially offered $1.5 million guaranteed with the chance to match
that amount in bonuses, then raised those figures to $3 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he and Roger were extremely close,'' the general manager
said, referring to Roger Clemens, who asked to be traded. ``Once
Roger made it known he wasn't coming back, Jose wasn't going to
come back. He did a good job here and we would have liked to have
him back, but at that point we weren't where we are ownerwise and
budgetwise. By the time we got that straightened out, he was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, not surprisingly, wanted a hitter with power.
Their designated hitters last season hit 16 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   They gave Canseco a guaranteed $2 million for this year with a
chance to earn an additional $2.9 million if he has 650 plate
appearances. He had 658 last season. They also have options for an
additional two years at salaries of $3 million and $4 million (plus
bonuses) that can automatically vest if he has 500 plate
appearances this season and 600 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays have a similar record to the one they had at this
early stage of their first season, but they look like a better
team. They have played well defensively, and Canseco has powered an
offense that opponents must now take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos on the Orioles  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles are ahead of the pace that resulted in
their finishing 35 games from first last season. A year ago the
Orioles won 10 of their first 12 games and after 15 games were tied
for first. After 16 this season, through Friday, they were seven
and a half games behind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ray Miller, the manager, does not seem to be in the trouble
many people think he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm asked am I going to fire him,'' Peter Angelos, the
Orioles' owner, said. ``My answer is no, he's the manager. What's
happening cannot be attributed to his lack of managerial
competence. There are moves that could be argued with. But the
breaks are not coming the Orioles' way or Miller's way. We'll have
to fight through a difficult period in a united sense. It's a
pretty good team. I think it will get itself together and have a
good season.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox Power Outage
</P>
<P>
   Whoever said the Boston Red Sox could survive the loss of Mo
Vaughn better check the team's statistics. Entering Saturday's
games, the Red Sox had the fewest home runs in the league by far,
not having even reached double digits. Their pitchers have saved
them, but they will be hard pressed to continue bailing out the
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Coors Field Blues
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting the mile-high pitching problem Don Baylor endured for
six seasons, Jim Leyland was determined to take a positive approach
as the new manager of the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coors Field thing is blown way out of proportion,''
Leyland said just before the season started. ``Everybody acts like
the Rockies are the only team that pitches there. There are two
pitchers that pitch in Coors Field. All you have to do is outpitch
the other guy, because I came in as a visitor and they're not too
happy either, especially with that lineup in that ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland, who is being paid $2 million a year to fix the problem,
said the approach, while positive, also has to be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't duck the fact that your earned run average probably
is going to be a point higher,'' he said. ``So what? The idea is to
win. You have to pitch better than the other pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyland spoke to the pitchers about the matter. ``It's not any
trick or any kind of psychology,'' he said. ``There are two
pitchers. Pitch better than the other pitcher. Maybe you give up
four runs instead of three or two that you would've given up
somewhere else, but we can score four runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first homestand as the Rockies' manager, Leyland watched
his team score more than four runs in each of five games. He also
saw his pitchers give up four runs twice and more than four three
times. In consecutive games, they gave up 20 runs and 10 runs,
severely testing the new manager's positive outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's Championship Jinx
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle has pitched in post-season games in four different
years with two teams, once with Pittsburgh, three times with
Atlanta, but has yet to play on a World Series winner. He will not
be surprised if the Braves win this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my luck,'' said Neagle, who last week made an
injury-delayed start to his season for Cincinnati. ``When I leave
something, things get better. In high school, I was a senior and we
ranked third in the nation. We were 22-0 going into the playoffs
and we lost to some rinky-dink 65 mile-an-hour pitcher. The next
year we lost eight seniors and they said they might be fifth in the
county and they won the state championship. That's happened to me
everywhere I go, every time I leave. I guess I'm a jinx.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle joined the Braves in 1996, the year after they won the
World Series. They did not win in the next three years, the length
of the left-hander's tenure with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was my fault, I'd be the first to say it,'' Neagle said.
``It was my fault and it was everybody else's fault also. The most
frustrating year for me was '96 when we were leading New York, two
games to nothing. We should've won that. But we got outplayed,
outmanaged, everything. They beat us in every facet of the game in
the last four games.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Braves have won only one World Series despite seven
successive post-season appearances, Neagle feels the team and the
town have become jaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became like a second habit for people in Atlanta _ the
organization, the fans, everyone else,'' he said. ``They kind of
lost that electricity around the ballpark. We went to San Diego for
the league championship series last year and it was incredible. It
was something new to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle said he hoped he could find that feeling with the Reds.
``If we can get into the post-season,'' he said, ``the organization
and the city will be electrified.'' &QL;

SAN ANTONIO HAS AN EDGE IN WESTERN CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had scored San Antonio's last 10 points, including the
game-winning 3-pointer with one-tenth of a second left to beat
Houston. Mario Elie, fresh from shooting down his old team, then
blew kisses to the crowd and cursed at his former Rockets
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been carrying them for five years in H-town, so I think a
50-game season here should be easy,'' Elie said this past week.
``This is what I bring to the team. This is what they wanted from
me. And I'm going to go out there and express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   This is referred to as ``having edge'' in the NBA. And more than
leapers or deadeye shooters, players with Elie's attitude can
usually be found on teams that play long into the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that his emotional outbursts would not fit in on a
team dominated by Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the laid-back twin
towers. But then, there is not a lot about the Spurs this season
that resembles the passive team of past playoff failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team, more than any other team I've been on, hates
losing,'' Robinson said. ``We almost hate each other when we
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have been in a good mood since March 2, when they
began the league's most impressive string of consistent play: 24
victories in 28 games going into Saturday night's game against the
Lakers, a feat that erased a disastrous 6-8 start and thrust San
Antonio into Western Conference title contention with Utah and
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   In what could have been a preview of the conference final, the
Spurs snapped Utah's 11-game winning streak last week, 83-69, at
the Delta Center. In the second round of the playoffs last season,
San Antonio lost to the Jazz, four games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Few critics are calling Robinson soft anymore. Or asking point
guard Avery Johnson to stop denting the rim with his jump shot. An
infusion of veteran role players who have been to the finals _ Elie
(with the Rockets), Steve Kerr (with Chicago) and Jerome Kersey
(with Portland) _ have blended nicely with the holdovers Robinson,
Johnson and Sean Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Rose, a third-year forward Charlotte gave up on, is
playing key minutes off the bench along with Antonio Daniels. And
Duncan has been awesome, averaging 22.9 points, 11 rebounds, nearly
three blocked shots and more than two assists a game over the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   By design, Robinson's minutes are down to 31 a game and his
other numbers are down as well (15.1 points and 9.7 rebounds). But
with a strong supporting cast, he may be a better bet to retire
with a championship than either Charles Barkley or Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say he's been soft or didn't want it enough,''
said Gregg Popovich, the Spurs' coach. ``The truth is, David hasn't
been surrounded with a championship team. You can argue whether
Patrick or Charles has been, but I know David has not. Since he's
been there the longest, everyone wants to lay it on him. But other
than Hakeem Olajuwon, who's the last center to carry their team to
a title? It's hard in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Popovich is also not buying the theory that his team has
suddenly developed heart and an ornery streak on defense. After
all, he said, the Spurs led the league in opponents' field goal
percentage last season at 41.4 percent. They only gave up 88.5
points per game. (Their numbers this season are even stingier: they
allow 40.3 percent shooting and hold teams to 84.8 points.)
</P>
<P>
   But he does acknowledge how much a player like Elie can ignite a
team on a rare lethargic night; how role players can change the
chemistry of a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides confidence and mental toughness, when we lose a game,
Mario Elie hates every one of us,'' he said. ``He walks around
like, `When you want to hate losing as much I do, come back and
talk to me.' That makes our guys feel it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest story, I think, is not about our toughness,''
Popovich added. ``It's that ownership, the players and coaches were
all patient when everyone was down on us. When we were 6-8, it was
time to cut my head off and get rid of me. But we kept going to
work every day. Consequently, we got smarter and better and started
winning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Divac Has Worldly Concerns
</P>
<P>
   While his homeland is being bombed, the Serbian center Vlade
Divac is trying to concentrate on helping the Sacramento Kings
secure what would be only their second playoff appearance in 14
years. Frequent phone calls to make sure his family is safe have
helped. But then reality intruded on Divac's basketball life again
last Tuesday, when his 28-year-old brother, Ivan, was drafted into
the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   Divac's parents live in Prijepolje, a small province north of
Kosovo. His brother and niece live in the Serbian capital of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Divac and his Serbian teammate Predrag (Peja) Stojavokic have
worn black armbands during games since the airstrikes against
Yugoslavia began, and they have been accused of waging a silent
protest against NATO forces. But the center and the shooting guard
for the Kings say they are not choosing sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signifies my sympathy for all the innocent people who have
died in my homeland, including people of all nationalities,'' Divac
said. ``Since I'm not able to be there, I'm able to show that I'm
thinking about everyone back there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Webber's Numbers Stand Out
</P>
<P>
   On the two teams he played on before the Sacramento Kings, Chris
Webber took his share of criticism for being part of the problem
instead of part of the solution. And it wasn't clear if he had
learned his lesson this February, when he implied that he was
trying to make the best of a bad situation with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But with a week left in the regular season, Webber's numbers and
his play have been phenomenal. If he were to finish the season with
his current averages of 20.2 points and 13.0 rebounds a game, he
would be the first non-center to post numbers at that level since
Charles Barkley during the 1986-87 season. Shaquille O'Neal is the
last player to average more than 20 points and 13 rebounds a game,
doing it in 1993-94 for Orlando. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malone vs. Mourning
</P>
<P>
   In a straw poll of national basketball writers being taken by
The Deseret News in Utah, Karl Malone of the Jazz and Alonzo
Mourning of the Miami Heat appear to be the clear favorites for
most valuable player. It will be interesting to see how much
genuine consideration Mourning is given in the actual vote since
Malone's relationship with the media has always been much more
chummy than that of the often-glowering Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   If Mourning does not win the award, he should receive defensive
player of the year honors. No one is more relentless or alters more
shots. For the first time in his career, it is possible to argue
that Mourning has bypassed Patrick Ewing, his one-time mentor, in
the unofficial ranking of elite centers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riley Takes High Road
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley should have a better take than most people on the
Knicks' reassignment of Ernie Grunfeld, given that Riley, the
Heat's president and coach, worked closely with Grunfeld in New
York and wanted the job of team president before his power struggle
with Dave Checketts and subsequent departure in 1995. But Riley,
quizzed often on the subject last week, preferred to take the high
road. ``It will be construed as negative if I talk about it, so I'm
not going to,'' he said. &QL;

UPSCALE HOUSING IN A DOWNSCALE AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN ECKBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When David Imboden bought his first waterfront
house in the unfashionable East End neighborhood in 1987 he was
struck by the stunning views of the Ohio River and the emerald
hills of Kentucky. And, not incidentally, by the development
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he bought more than 200 pieces of property in this
neighborhood about two miles east of downtown, before clearing part
of it for the city's first high-end single-family housing on the
river's edge in a century. Because of his vision, 21 two-story
red-brick town houses _ 11 sold for $300,000 to $375,000 and 10
renting for $2,500 to $3,500 a month, with leases up to three years
_ now line the shore.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million complex, called Riverfront East Condominiums, was
built in 1995 and occupied in a year. It fulfills the expectation
of city officials that the best way to revitalize this
long-neglected stretch of waterfront is with houses for affluent
tenants and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   A tax abatement worth $1 million gives property owners a 10-year
reprieve on real estate taxes. In addition, the city gave the
project a $1 million grant for a retaining wall, brick sidewalks
and water, sewer and gas mains.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of Imboden's plan, the $4.5 million Riverfront
Terrace, is now under way, with 15 two- and three-story detached
houses under construction on the north side of Eastern Avenue
across from Riverfront East. Plans call for an additional four
dozen houses if the market warrants construction.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that river views could help reinvent this rundown
neighborhood came to Imboden after a boat ride on the Ohio River in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I looked up over the water and said, `You
know, I wouldn't mind buying one of those shacks,''' he said. He
quickly found a ``For Sale'' sign and for $32,000 had a new home
and a toe in the water of urban life. For nearly a decade, he said,
he bought every property he could find, relying at times on his
credit card for purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``People called at all hours,'' he recalled. ``Somebody might be
going bankrupt and I'd say name your price. They'd say $30,000.
Boom, I'd buy. At the time, there were shacks up and down the
street. It didn't matter. I knew that housing here would one day
take off.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a hard and fast rule: He would not buy and evict
and he would not jack up rents. ``I waited for people to move and
then I boarded the place up,'' said Imboden, who had previously
renovated about 25 houses throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, now 42, settled into the East End by living in
the house he bought after that boat ride. Not long before, he had
quit his job as an inner-city football coach at Taft High School.
He and a partner, Mark Meade, founded Alumni Builders and learned
the housing business by constructing single-family houses for
middle-income buyers in the suburban subdivisions between
Cincinnati and Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Housing experts in Cincinnati say the riverside project will
help reverse the steady trend of wealthy residents fleeing the city
for the suburbs. For the city to thrive, said Dan Brady, president
of Tri-State Mortgage Co., it needs suburban-style housing, and
this bend of riverfront on the edge of downtown offers an
opportunity for it to increase its home ownership rate.
</P>
<P>
   With national home ownership rates at about 65 percent,
Cincinnati at 38 percent has a long way to go to catch up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is they have to find places to bring that number
up.'' said Brady, a member from 1995 to 1998 of a Federal Reserve
Board committee formed to study home ownership here. ``The
riverfront has some contiguous sites for development, whereas the
rest of the city has spot lots that are not as appealing to
builders and developers.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials intend to encourage projects like Riverfront
Terrace, said Andi Udris, director of the city's Department of
Economic Development. ``There's no question one of the issues for
cities like Cincinnati is the ability to retain its residents,'' he
said. ``The goal is to identify specific markets within the city
for the large segment of people who want to be near downtown: the
newcomers to the city who want to be close in but don't want
high-maintenance units.''
</P>
<P>
   Riverfront East town houses have 3,000 square feet of living
space, with three bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a master suite
with Jacuzzi, an eat-in kitchen, decks for river views and two-car
attached garages. Houses under construction across the street,
ranging from 3,400 to 3,600 square feet, will have three or four
bedrooms and up to three-and-a-half baths and sell for $329,000 to
$400,000, said Denise Guiducci, a broker for Sibcy Cline Realtors.

</P>
<P>
   Other housing projects _ Edgecliff Towers and Kingston House _
have been built on the hillside above the river, but they were
high-rise towers targeted for upper-income residents and near East
Walnut Hills, an established upscale neighborhood. Until Alumni
Builders found its toehold along the river, no developer would risk
investing and building in the East End.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Victorian nature of the neighborhood, houses
in Riverfront Terrace have widow's walks, decks and large windows.
Brick is mixed with faux sandstone and limestone detailing on the
exterior and the houses have high-tech intercoms, central vacuuming
systems and rooms prewired for computers. Wet bars and amenities
like hot tubs abound.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Warner, 56, a semiretired entrepreneur and Wall Street
investor, was among the first to move into Riverfront East in 1995.
Besides the view, he said, he moved to the neighborhood because of
its tranquillity and proximity to restaurants and night life. While
he keeps an 8,500-square-foot home in the Indiana hills near
Batesville, about an hour's drive away, Warner said he finds that
he is spending most of his time in the East End.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the city but it's as quiet as if you're out in the
woods,'' he said. ``There are 21 units here but you'd never know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's town house, typical of others in Riverfront East, has
crown molding throughout and there is a fireplace upstairs in the
master suite, as well as a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. Below the
ground floor are a family room and a two-car garage. Between his
unit and the river is a garden of shrubbery and accent stones that
winds the length of the complex. Two gazebos and flower beds are
focal points.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said his residence was large enough to accommodate family
gatherings, which is one reason he bought the condominium _ to be
closer to his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, the mortgage broker, said that before the new
neighborhood can work, there must be a critical mass of affluent
residents. Then the restaurants, groceries and dry cleaners will
follow, he said. ``I don't want to live on the riverfront and have
a beautiful place and have to drive across town to get groceries,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood has deep Appalachian roots and a working-class
feel remains. A local tavern is called the Du Drop Inn. One nearby
property owner is a bell manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Udris, the city's economic-development director, projected that
as many as 1,200 units could one day stretch from Riverfront
Terrace about two miles west to Adams Landing, an upscale
condominium complex a block or so off the river.
</P>
<P>
   Imboden can watch the construction of Riverfront Terrace from a
window in an upstairs workout room in his Riverfront East
condominium and sometimes he will quit exercising to do just that.
``This has been a ride, but it has not just been about money,'' he
said the other day as masons laid brick, surveyors took readings
and hammering resounded. ``It's been a passion.''

DAVIS' HOME RUN PACES YANKS OVER BLUE JAYS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were no standing ovations or rabid cheers
coming from the right-field bleachers for a Blue Jay Saturday as
there had been Friday night. David Wells was in the dugout for
Saturday's game, so the focus was only on baseball, and the Yankee
Stadium fans cheered only their own, especially Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   After a sometimes sluggish and sloppy afternoon, Davis earned
the sort of rousing ovation that Wells secured on Friday. He
crushed a three-run homer off Dan Plesac in the bottom of the
eighth inning, a majestic shot that hit off the facade of the upper
deck in left field, to catapult the Yankees to a 7-4 victory over
the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams started the rally with a double into the
left-field corner before Tino Martinez walked on a 3-2 pitch.
Davis, who had been 0 for 6 off the left-handed Plesac in his
career, had already struck out twice and grounded out in three
at-bats. But after Plesac jumped ahead in the count, 0-2, the
designated hitter drilled a fastball to deep left to break a 4-4
tie with his fifth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza relieved Andy Pettitte in the eighth and recorded
the victory as the Yankees (11-5) won their fourth straight game
and continued to throttle a team that had been sharper than any in
baseball. The Blue Jays (12-6), who are now percentage points
behind the first-place Yankees in the American League East, rolled
into the Bronx with an eight-game winning streak. But Toronto has
lost the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the bottom of the fourth inning, and the
Yankees trailing, 2-0, it had become obvious why Roy Halladay had
not permitted an earned run through his first 19 innings this
season. Tall and lanky, with an overhand motion and an explosive
fastball, Halladay is imposing on the mound. This was only his
seventh major league appearance, and he will not turn 22 for three
weeks, but Halladay has incredible poise and presence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he walked Ricky Ledee and that gave the Yankees an
opening. Halladay probably thought the inning was over when Luis
Sojo rapped a grounder to shortstop, but Alex Gonzalez threw wide
to Pat Kelly at second base, and the ball rolled away, enabling
Ledee to scoot to third. After Joe Girardi walked to fill the
bases, Chuck Knoblauch squirted a single to right that evened the
score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Now Halladay was sweating a little with Derek Jeter batting.
Jeter had struck out in the first inning and singled in the third.
If Halladay could retire Jeter, he could save Gonzalez from having
to dwell on his error as well as keep the game tied. But Jeter
smacked a single to almost the same spot as Knoblauch had, just
past a diving Kelly and into right field, and two more runs scored
to put the Yankees in front, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Halladay left after four innings, still not having given up an
earned run this season.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, who was making his first start in eight days, tried to
protect the lead, but the Yankees were also guilty of sloppy
execution. After Carlos Delgado walked and Tony Fernandez doubled
in the sixth, Geronimo Berroa rolled a ball to the right of the
mound. Pettitte saw Delgado charging home and started a rundown
play that ended with Delgado being tagged out near third. Fernandez
had already reached third, but Sojo thought he had a chance to nab
Berroa, who was going to second, and he fired the ball to
Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   As Knoblauch tried to tag Berroa, the ball came loose and
Fernandez rushed home with the Blue Jays' third run. Berroa went to
third on Gonzalez's soft single to right-center between Bernie
Williams and Paul O'Neill and scored on Mike Matheny's grounder to
make the score 4-4. Pettitte allowed three earned runs and seven
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays had jumped to a 2-0 lead in the first, the runs driven
in by Shawn Green's groundout and Delgado's single.

LONDON BOMB INJURES AT LEAST SEVEN, A WEEK AFTER BOMB HURT 39
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ At least seven people were injured Saturday when an
explosion tore through a street market in an area of east London
that has a large Bangladeshi population, one week to the day after
a home-made nail-bomb went off in a crowded market in another
racially mixed area.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's blast shattered windows and started fires in
buildings at Brick Lane, casting a pall of black smoke over the
area. ``It looked like a scene from a war zone,'' said Raja Miah, a
resident who saw the aftermath of the explosion. ``I saw a car
ablaze with pieces of shrapnel and debris all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said they saw a man place a sports bag in the trunk of
a car shortly before the blast, but a police officer,
Superintendent David Finnimore, said he believed the man had been
trying to drive the bag to a nearby police station after finding it
in the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press said one of its photographers, who lives in
the area, reported that the explosion blew off the car's roof and
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials and the police said the injuries from the
explosion seemed light.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, at a busy street market in racially mixed
Brixton, in south London, a man left a homemade nail-bomb near
market stalls. That explosion injured 39 people. After several
extreme right-wing groups claimed responsibility, the police said
they were treating the incident as a racial attack.
</P>
<P>
   One claim of responsibility was made from a public telephone
near the spot in south London where a black teen-ager, Stephen
Lawrence, was killed in a case that has become a national
touchstone of tensions between black Britons and the police.
British newspapers have openly accused a group of young, white
Britons of killing Lawrence, but none of them has ever been
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Oona King, a local legislator, said Saturday she believed the
bombings were ``obviously part of a backlash'' against inquiries
into police mishandling of investigations into the Lawrence murder.
The police said anti-terrorism officers were trying to establish
whether the bomb explosions were linked, as many residents Sunday
seemed to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Brick Lane market draws hundreds of shoppers and is also
packed with people because of its well-patronized curry
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Dunstan Gunashinga, another resident, said there had been fears
of a bomb attack in Brick Lane after a series of anonymous
telephone threats this week to storekeepers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Brick Lane was well-known to Britons two decades ago for a
campaign by anti-racism activists demanding the closure of an
office run by the far-right National Front. One of the activist
leaders, a 33-year-old schoolteacher called Blair Peach, was killed
20 years ago Saturday when the police tried to break up protests in
another part of London.

NO ASYLUM FOR WOMAN THREATENED WITH GENITAL CUTTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., added reefer on NYT P1)  
(lb) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than two years, Adelaide Abankwah's waking
hours have felt like living nightmares. Slumber, she said, is her
only refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream that I am stepping out of a dark, dirty room into a
light, beautiful room, where everyone is eating a lot of food,''
she said, closing her brown eyes as if trying to keep the vision
from getting away. ``When I sleep, that is when I feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah, a 29-year-old native of Ghana, has been held in a
detention center in Queens since March 1997, shortly after she
arrived at Kennedy International Airport with a false passport,
wracked with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing and speaking in broken English, she told U.S. officials
that she had fled her homeland because the elders of her village
were going to cut her genitals. She had lost her virginity to a man
who was not an approved mate for her, which violated her tribe's
customs.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens of hearings, an immigration judge and the Board of
Immigration Appeals denied Ms. Abankwah's petitions. The officials
found that while Ms. Abankwah's fear of returning home was genuine,
she had not proved that she would be subjected to genital cutting
if she returned.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah's plight sounded a distress signal familiar to
advocates for refugees across the country. Three years ago, after
advocates waged a highly publicized campaign, the practice of
female genital cutting was outlawed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
recognized the practice _ performed on millions of women in about
26 African nations _ as a form of persecution that those seeking
asylum could claim. The decision became part of guidelines on
sex-based oppression that were issued to immigration judges.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for refugees and some members of Congress say Ms.
Abankwah's case shows that the guidelines are little more than
empty words, because they are not binding. Immigration judges are
not required to rule that persecution based on an applicant's sex
constitutes a valid claim for asylum, and they rarely do so without
public pressure, the advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the advocates said, the judges often ask for
unreasonable forms of evidence to support women's reports of
genital cutting.
</P>
<P>
   And they worry about the effect that long periods in detention
will have on women like Ms. Abankwah. While she is free to return
to Ghana, Ms. Abankwah remains in detention because she has decided
to press her case. The INS generally detains people whose cases are
similar to Ms. Abankwah's, because they are deemed likely to flee
to avoid deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term detention of asylum seekers raises questions
about the humanitarian aspects of the law,'' said Karen Musalo, an
expert on refugees at the University of California at San
Francisco's Hastings College of the Law. ``Is it wise to imprison
individuals whose only crime is to flee persecution?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah is to make her final plea on May 3 before the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. If her appeal is
rejected, she will probably be deported.
</P>
<P>
   When she goes into court this time, however, Ms. Abankwah will
not be alone. Her ordeal has attracted mounting support from
feminists, advocates for refugees and members of Congress who have
posted her picture on the Internet and circulated petitions and
letters of support.
</P>
<P>
   She is being represented by a lawyer from a prestigious law firm
and has been visited by New York celebrities and politicians,
including Gloria Steinem, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, and Rep.
Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just a matter of too much bureaucracy,'' said
Schumer, a Democrat, referring to Ms. Abankwah's case. ``The INS
isn't used to claims like this. It's not the traditional kind of
persecution, but it's just as bad. And they need to get with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Ms. Maloney, also a Democrat, are scheduled to hold
a news conference Sunday at Federal Plaza in Manhattan to release a
letter they have written to Attorney General Janet Reno supporting
Ms. Abankwah's request for asylum, and asking that she be freed for
humanitarian reasons while she awaits a final judgment.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said they would not comment on Ms. Abankwah
because they did not discuss pending cases. And although they
report that more than 35,000 people applied for asylum in the
fiscal year that ended in September, they could not say how many of
those asylum seekers were being detained or how many were claiming
persecution based on sex. Advocates also had no firm statistics;
however, they said Ms. Abankwah's case is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Abankwah entered Wackenhut, the Queens detention
center, her petite, athletic figure has turned bony and fragile.
She weighs less than 100 pounds, down about 20 pounds from her
previous weight, she said. And medical records indicate that she
has developed ovarian cysts and ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rauchway, a lawyer with the firm of Orrick, Herrington
&AMP; Sutcliffe in New York City who is representing Ms. Abankwah, said
two petitions had been filed to have her paroled to the custody of
a Pentecostal minister in the Bronx who has befriended her, but
those had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at Wackenhut arranged by Rauchway, Ms.
Abankwah looked tired and weak. ``If you talk to the INS,'' she
begged a reporter, ``please tell them I am not a criminal. I just
want to be free.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the interview and in testimony before the immigration courts,
she described her flight for freedom. She said she was born into
the Nkumssa, a tribe of about 600 people who live in an isolated
region in central Ghana. Ms. Abankwah said her mother was
designated the tribe's ``queen mother,'' leading most religious
rituals and setting rules for the other women.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, Ms. Abankwah said, her mother died and the
tribal elders decided that she would succeed her mother. Ms.
Abankwah protested, refusing to accept an arranged marriage and to
take part in rituals intended to determine whether she was a
virgin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a boyfriend,'' she said. ``I did not want the elders to
marry for me. I wanted to marry for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abankwah said she revealed the relationship to her
grandmother, who warned her that the elders would cut or kill her
if they discovered the truth. ``If the elders find out I am not a
virgin, they will never forgive me and they will cut my clitoris,''
she said, recalling the fears that made her flee. ``And they would
look for the boy, and they would not forgive him. So I had to run
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had ever seen the elders kill someone, she said:
``You don't see it. You just see a person one day. And the next day
you do not see that person.''
</P>
<P>
   She fled to the Ghanaian capital, Accra, she said, where she
worked for people who took pity on her and eventually helped her
get a false passport and an airplane ticket to New York. She had no
relatives here. But her friends in Ghana gave her the phone number
of a Ghanaian minister in the Bronx. The minister, her friends told
her, would take her in and help her start a new life.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Abankwah did not make it past immigration officials at
the airport. ``I was thinking that they thought I took something,''
she said. ``Then one of them said, `This passport is not for you.'
And they put a chain on my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gilhooly, director of public affairs for the Eastern
region of the INS, said asylum is granted to people who can show a
``well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion,
nationality, political beliefs or membership in a social group.''
And, he said, applicants bear the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions by immigration judges and the brief filed by INS
lawyers with the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals indicate that
officials believed that Ms. Abankwah had a genuine fear of
returning home, a fear one judge described as ``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the courts did not believe Ms. Abankwah's claims of
persecution. On July 30, the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled:
``We find the applicant's claim that she will be killed because she
fled from her village to avoid becoming the queen mother is
unbelievable. The applicant has offered no evidence that the
punishment for not becoming queen mother is death.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts also found that while State Department reports
indicate that 15 percent to 30 percent of women in Ghana are
subjected to genital cutting, the ritual has not been practiced as
widely in recent years because the Ghanaian government criminalized
it in 1994 and has prosecuted at least one person under the new
law.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the police would protect Ms. Abankwah may seem
plausible to a board of administrative judges in the United States,
her lawyer said. But in Ghana, he said, it is little more than
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place where she lives is not the suburbs,'' Rauchway said.
``It's rural, isolated Africa. The elders govern the tribe. The
police and the government don't have any control.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauchway and other advocates said Ms. Abankwah's case
demonstrated how difficult it was for asylum seekers to meet the
evidence requirements of immigration courts.

GAY MAN CHARGED IN A KILLING CAN USE A `BATTERED WIFE' DEFENSE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Stagno was a controlling and jealous boyfriend
who threatened his live-in partner with a knife and a bottle, and
kept the only key to their Crown Heights apartment, according to
papers filed by a lawyer in Brooklyn Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   So when Stagno, 32, brandished a bottle in December 1997 and his
partner fought back, stabbing him to death, it seemed like a
classic case of ``battered-wife syndrome,'' the partner's lawyer
has argued. Except that the partner, John Pickett, 33, is a man.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in a ruling that lawyers say is unprecedented, a
Brooklyn justice, John M. Leventhal, said Pickett could use the
battered-wife argument to bolster his claim that he killed Stagno
in self-defense. Prosecutors, who have charged him with
second-degree murder, had opposed the battered-wife claim.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, the battered-wife argument was used in a
Florida case involving two lesbians, Pickett's lawyer, Arthur
Aidala, said. But he said he knew of no case involving two men in
which the defense had been used.
</P>
<P>
   Aidala said that, despite Pickett's sex, he suffered from low
self-esteem and emotional dependency, classic elements of
battered-wife syndrome. ``He was trying to muster up the strength
and energy to leave,'' Aidala said. ``But where does a gay, black,
HIV-positive man turn for help?''
</P>
<P>
   When Pickett first moved in with Stagno in early 1997, Aidala
said, his client had a job at K-Mart. But he said that Stagno, who
was unemployed, controlled the couple's finances and gave Pickett a
daily allowance of 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   After Stagno, in a jealous rage, attacked a male K-Mart employee
with whom Pickett spoke, Pickett was fired. As his dependency and
isolation deepened, apparently the abuse escalated. In August of
1997, Stagno slashed Pickett's hand with a knife during a fight.
Though Pickett called the police, officers played down the incident
and arrested both men, said Aidala.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to end the relationship, Pickett approached the Gay
and Lesbian Anti-Violence project and met with a counselor there,
Aidala said. But on Dec. 5, after Pickett announced that he was
leaving, Stagno threatened him with a bottle and a knife, Aidala
said. Pickett then stabbed Stagno twice in the chest, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett is being held at the Rikers Island Detention Center.
Jury selection is expected to begin on Monday.

 LITTLETON: that simple.''

<P>
   Kevin Koeniger, a 17-year-old junior on the Columbine Rebels
football team, acknowledged that some athletes teased the trench
coat mafia, but said the group often seemed to be asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're different, why wouldn't we look at them as weird?''
he asked, recalling a student last year who wore tight jeans, had
long hair and seemed to never shower.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many groups before them, the trench coat mafia
embraced what started as a kind of epithet and made it their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it up; we were like, oh, look at them, the trench coat
mafia,'' recalled Ashly Beeson, 18, who left Columbine a couple of
months ago to escape the cliques and finish her senior year at an
alternative school. ``It's nothing they gave themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the people in town appear at makeshift memorials
of flowers and banners, sobbing on television about the events that
have overtaken the community, members of the trench coat mafia and
their friends have spent much of the past week talking to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that the arsenal of bombs and other
weapons was more than two boys could carry even under their large
trench coats. If they had help, most people suspect it came from
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles, a large woman in a housecoat, would not let a
reporter talk to her son, who quit school a few months ago and was,
she said, sleeping upstairs in the small house near noon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just kids,'' she said, pointing out that her son plays
the cello, while his friend, Morris, plays the violin. ``All of
them are in shock. They're all destroyed; I don't know, they're
never going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the little ones, even this one's affected, he senses our
moods,'' she said, bouncing her 5-month-old grandson Seth, whose
mother also attended Columbine, on her lap. ``His mom sat here with
us the other day. She said, `We're going to teach our kids
better.'''

BERNARD NEWMAN, 91, FEDERAL JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judge Bernard Newman of the U.S. Court of
International Trade, who as a former chairman of the New York
County Republican Party was the counterpart and rival of Tammany
Hall's Carmine De Sapio, died Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital. A
Manhattan resident, he was 91 and was still serving as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was born into Republican politics. His father, Isidore, a
grocer on the Lower East Side, was known as ``the mayor of East
Sixth Street'' and was an aide to Samuel Koenig, the county leader
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Newman was born at 718 East Sixth St., the same tenement
in which Louis Lefkowitz, a Republican who would serve many terms
as state attorney general, was born three years earlier. As Newman
recalled, he and Louis would hand out leaflets together, he in
short pants, and his friend and mentor already in long ones.
</P>
<P>
   Newman graduated from New York University and its law school,
and was admitted to the bar in 1930. He married a law school
classmate, Kathryn Bereano, with whom he formed a law partnership,
Newman &AMP; Newman. From 1942 to 1948 he served as law secretary to
Justice Samuel Hofstadter of state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   During this time he met a young man named Carmine De Sapio, who
had the same position with another judge. De Sapio had dropped out
of law school because of an eye disease that forced him to wear the
tinted glasses that would later enhance his image as a political
boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to urge him to return to law school,'' Newman said, and
recalled once telling his friend, ``You won't get far in politics
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman had continued his association with Lefkowitz and the
Republican Party organization, and was chosen to take over the New
York County Republicans in 1958, when De Sapio was the powerful
leader of Tammany Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In those years Republican prospects in Manhattan were far from
rosy, but for the next three years, Newman rallied support for
Republican candidates as best he could, often swapping charges with
Mayor Robert Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Newman complained during the 1960 presidential race
when the mayor welcomed John F. Kennedy at City Hall, but would not
extend the same courtesy to Richard Nixon. Wagner responded by
calling Newman a ``peanut politician.``
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the Republican Party in Manhattan was restructured, and
ultimate responsibility went to an executive committee. The next
year, Wagner, despite his earlier dismissive comments, named Newman
to the Family Court. This was quickly followed by Newman's
appointment to the state Supreme Court by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Newman to the U.S.
Customs Court, which was later renamed the U.S. Court of
International Trade. Since 1983, Newman has been a senior judge,
serving periodically in various federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died in 1991. Newman is survived by two daughters,
Phyllis Cechini and Helene Bernstein, both of Manhattan, five
grandsons and eight great-grandchildren.

A SMALL BUSINESS HUNTS FOR A HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donna Torrance did not think it would be all that
hard to find a few thousand square feet of office space to
establish a New York studio for VIA, a design and marketing firm
based in Portland, Maine. After all, there are more than 400
million square feet of office space in Manhattan. Surely something
could be found.
</P>
<P>
   Not easily, as it turned out. Hampered by a tight budget and
specific requirements, and competing with other office space users
in a hot market, it took Ms. Torrance nine months to sign a lease
for an office, on the eighth, or top, floor of a building at Canal
and Varick Streets overlooking the entrance to the Holland Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the Manhattan real estate market was a new
experience for Ms. Torrance, whose background is in art direction
and marketing and whose biography notes that she has ``made time to
get a master's degree in publishing and marketing from Harvard,
learn to cook and do Eskimo rolls in a kayak.''
</P>
<P>
   She had to look for space, with and without brokers, hire people
and do work for clients simultaneously. She started out in her
apartment in the Flatiron District, moved into sublet space on the
second floor of the building at 417 Canal St., occupied part of the
eighth floor while workers hammered and sawed around her and
finally was able to expand into the fully built out space in
January.
</P>
<P>
   She says she is pleased with the outcome, but appears still a
little bewildered by the time and effort needed to make it all
happen. Part of the problem was that she had a combination of needs
that were hard to satisfy at any one affordable place.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the requirements was that the location had to be
safe,'' said Ms. Torrance, whose title is strategic principal in
the firm. ``This is a service business, where you have to put in
long hours at times. It had to be a place where it is safe to leave
at 3 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Another, related, requirement was that the building had to be
close to mass transit. At 3 a.m., a long walk to a subway or bus
stop can be distinctly uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Since the firm does design work, abundant natural light was
necessary, eliminating many parts of town where closely packed
buildings get little outside light.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Torrance wanted running water in the space so a kitchen
could be installed to help feed employees working long hours.
Air-conditioning was needed as well.
</P>
<P>
   And because the company is in the image-building business, the
studio had to be in a part of town that was considered cool by
others in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Situated to the west of SoHo and north of TriBeCa, the
neighborhood does not have a specific name, but it is close enough
to the better-known areas to be considered cool by association, she
argues.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine-based partners originally thought of SoHo, so Ms.
Torrance looked there early on. Not only was it too expensive at an
annual rent of $25 to $28 a square foot, but, she said, most of the
space being offered was on lower floors with no view and little
natural light. The Flatiron District was eliminated for similar
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was midtown an option, even on the far west side. ``I
quickly realized that was not an option,'' she said, adding that
areas once considered on the fringe of the central business
district were commanding annual rents over $35 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The search became so discouraging that she split the task with
her office manager, Stephanie Lewis. ``I looked for sublet space
while Stephanie looked for real-time space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When they found the building at 417 Canal St. after responding
to a newspaper advertisement, a lot was right about it. It is
across from a stop on the 1-9 subway line. The top floor of the
1911 building, which is owned by Trinity Church, received plenty of
light from 26 large windows and a skylight in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skylight leaked, but it was there,'' Ms. Torrance said.
Because of the Holland Tunnel entrance there are no tall buildings
to block the light from the south, and a small park opens up the
space's eastern exposure as well.
</P>
<P>
   There was water available on the floor, although the existing
sink was old and leaked as well. And there was an air conditioner
on the roof, which Trinity Church promised to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The price was also right, at $15 a square foot early in 1998,
rising in subsequent years. It is currently $18 a square foot.
Three months of free rent were part of the deal, plus a little over
$12 a square foot for interior work.
</P>
<P>
   But the space available was 3,000 square feet, one-third more
than the 2,000 square feet Ms. Torrance was seeking. ``I figured
about 100 square feet per person, and we were planning an 18-person
office,'' she said. ``But a 2,000-square-foot space was impossible
to find.'' The extra space allowed for larger offices and a
substantial conference room.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback was the condition of the space. There was asbestos
in the flooring, and previous tenants had ripped out most of the
wiring. And it was raw space that would have to be designed and
built before there could be proper offices and meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The space was a mess, and I didn't want to have to hire an
architect and build out the space,'' Ms. Torrance said. ``I didn't
want to have to deal with contractors. That's not the business I'm
in.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is what she did, hiring Edward Mills Architects to
design the space, which is divided by a diagonal spine into
administrative and design areas. A new floor was put down and the
paint on the radiators hanging from the outside walls was treated
with wire brushes to create a distressed look.
</P>
<P>
   A big concern was wiring, both for electric power and for the
high capacity telecommunications links essential to a
computer-based company. ``I had to put two T-1 lines into the
building because I could not find space with T-1s already
installed,'' Ms. Torrance said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's real estate managers have apparently got the message
that high-capacity telecommunications are a big tenant draw and are
installing the lines at a nearby building formerly known as 75
Varick St. that it is renovating and remarketing as 1 Hudson
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring was the biggest part of the job, and consumed $36,000 of
Ms. Torrance's $100,000 renovation budget.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wiring cost, the rest of the space was furnished
in a fashion that appears to combine a 1950s motel look with high
tech. All the wiring is carried overhead in racks originally
designed for the French dairy industry. Some desks are old
stainless steel food-preparation tables from restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The spine that divides the space consists of fiberboard boxes
secured by sheets of semitransparent sand-blasted acrylic. ``Almost
all this stuff is recycled,'' said Johan Vipper, the design
principal of the New York studio, who contributed ideas to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   And it is in turn recyclable. ``This place is like a movie set _
if we leave we take it with us,'' Ms. Torrance said. ``We will lose
the wiring, though.''
</P>
<P>
   She rolls her eyes when describing dealing with contractors,
whose crews she said made life difficult for the studio by cutting
off power at critical times. ``They cut the wiring,'' she said,
``and without wiring we can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, she said, they cut power to the alarm system that
helps ensure that the top-of-the-line computers VIA's people work
on are still there when they return to work in the morning. ``That
would be hot merchandise a little farther down Canal Street,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the alarm was disabled, Ms. Torrance had to hire a guard to
stay overnight to protect the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she said, she was concerned that the noise on Canal
Street from the Holland Tunnel traffic would be a nuisance. And the
noise level is near deafening at street level, with visitors to the
building forced to shout into the intercom to make themselves
understood.
</P>
<P>
   But eight stories up, it is not a problem. ``We leave our
windows open in nice weather,'' she said, ``and it is quite
pleasant.''

INSURANCE CAN COME IN HANDY FOR APARTMENT OWNERS, RENTERS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Marilyn Scarano returned home from work on March
18, she saw smoke billowing from the roof of her 96-unit co-op
building in Long Beach, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Watching firefighters pour water into the building, Ms. Scarano
said, her only consolation was that she and her husband, Bob, had
insurance coverage for the furniture, fixtures and personal
belongings in their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, however, for Mrs. Scarano to discover that
their insurance would cover only a fraction of what would be needed
to restore their life to what it was before the fire. But the
Scaranos' plight paled when compared with the problems facing some
of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after the fire they let us back into the building to
get whatever personal belongings we could find,'' she said. ``A
couple on the sixth floor who were subleasing their apartment were
rummaging through their things looking for something they could
take with them. You could see the sky through their ceiling.
Everything in the apartment was wet and covered with soot. And
these people didn't have a dime in insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire in Long Beach _ occurring just one week after another
fire that drove residents from their homes in the Manhasset, a
134-unit co-op on Broadway at 108th Street in Manhattan _ has
focused renewed attention on why it is critical for apartment
owners and renters to have their own insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has to understand the importance of having
insurance,'' said Deborah Beck, vice president of the Real Estate
Board of New York. ``And our residential management council is now
making a strong recommendation that renters and apartment owners
should be made aware of the need for such coverage and should be
encouraged to seek it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beck explained that a common misunderstanding among rental
tenants, co-op shareholders and condominium unit owners _ is that
the building's hazard insurance policy covers their belongings in
the event of a fire or other catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize that the building's policy will not
cover them,'' Ms. Beck said. ``And any prudent tenant would be
remiss if they didn't explore the possibility of buying their own
insurance coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Kirschenbaum, senior managing director and general counsel
for Insignia Residential Group, a property management company in
Manhattan that is a subsidiary of Insignia/ESG, said that rental
tenants frequently fail to obtain insurance because they believe
that losses they incur that are not the result of their own actions
will be covered by someone else's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the landlord is usually liable to a tenant only when the
landlord was negligent or engaged in willful misconduct,''
Kirschenbaum said. In most cases, he added, things like fires and
burst pipes are not the fault of the property owner.
</P>
<P>
   And even if a tenant has legal grounds to sue the responsible
party, Kirschenbaum said, that is little consolation to a displaced
tenant who needs clothes, lodging and furniture immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants who have their own insurance, on the other hand, he
said, will have those immediate needs met while the insurance
company handles the business of finding out who is ultimately
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Strauss, senior vice president of The Owens Group, an
independent insurance agent based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said
that while having insurance coverage is important for renters, it
is critical for apartment owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is because improvements and permanent alterations in an
apartment are usually the unit owner's responsibility,'' she said,
explaining that things like kitchen cabinets, built-in storage
units, carpets, wallpaper and even refinished wood floors are
generally the responsibility of the unit owner. In fact, Ms.
Strauss said, since most ``improvements'' in a typical apartment
are already in the apartment when a new owner moves it, it is easy
to forget that they are nonetheless the current owner's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, it is easy to underestimate what it would
cost to restore a fire-or water-damaged apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that for a couple with two children in an
apartment in a luxury building the coverage needed for personal
property and improvements should be at least $100,000 for each,''
Ms. Strauss said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert E. Mackoul, president of Mackoul &AMP; Associates, an
insurance agent in Lynbrook, N.Y., said that apartment residents
should also make sure they have liability coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protects you and your family against lawsuits resulting
from injuries to other people or damage to their property,''
Mackoul said, adding that personal liability coverage also provides
protection for things that occur off the insured premises.
</P>
<P>
   Another valuable coverage for apartment owners, Mackoul said, is
loss assessment coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your building doesn't have adequate insurance coverage to
pay for property damage or a liability lawsuit,'' Mackoul said,
``this will cover your share of any assessment passed along to unit
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackoul said that an apartment owner's policy with $100,000
coverage for personal property, $100,000 for improvements and
alterations, $300,000 in personal liability coverage and $10,000 in
loss assessment coverage would cost about $600 a year with a $500
deductible. A renter's policy would be about $350 because loss
assessment and improvements and alteration coverages are not
required.
</P>
<P>
   Mackoul pointed out that those who want ``guaranteed replacement
cost'' insurance can expect to pay up to 20 percent more in annual
premiums. Such coverage is often worth the extra cost, he said,
because standard coverage provides payments based on the
depreciated value of an item or improvement while replacement cost
coverage provides the amount needed to replace each covered item at
today's prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it takes is one bad experience to find out how important
it is to insure everything properly,'' Mackoul said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Scarano, who lost nearly everything in the fire at her
Ocean Terrace co-op, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat down and figured out how much we lost, and
compared that to how much we were covered for, it was utterly
ridiculous,'' she said. ``People think that something like this
will never happen to them. That's what I thought. And all I can
tell you now is that I'll never put myself in the same position
again.''

HOPE FOR WATERGATE TAPE LEFT COLLECTORS CREDULOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy. Marilyn Monroe. The Chicago mobster
Sam Giancana. Sure. But the missing Watergate tapes?
</P>
<P>
   History took another tortured turn last week in the trial of
Lawrence Cusack III, the former paralegal accused of forging papers
in Kennedy's handwriting and selling them for millions of dollars
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   As Cusack has told it, he found the documents linking the former
president to the actress and the mobster in the files of his late
father, a prominent lawyer in New York. He contended that his
father, Lawrence Cusack Jr., who had represented the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of New York before his death in 1985, had been a
confidant of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But as government prosecutors contended in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan last week, Cusack told even taller tales to his
partners in the effort to market the so-called Kennedy papers. He
boasted to two of them that he had found the papers of other major
political figures in his father's files, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack said that these included the papers of former Presidents
Nixon and Carter, and those of W. Averell Harriman, witnesses
testified. There was also a reel-to-reel tape that Cusack said
Nixon had given to his father, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not say that Cusack had actually sold fake
Nixon or Carter papers, but the prosecutors did suggest, through
testimony, that Cusack had at least contemplated such a scheme.
They also implied that it would have been highly implausible for
the elder Cusack to have been a confidant of Kennedy and then later
enjoy the confidences of his political rival Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, rather than set off alarms in the minds of his business
partners, Cusack's extraordinary claims only further whetted their
appetites, according to their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   One partner, Thomas Cloud, a collectibles dealer from Atlanta,
told the jury that Cusack said the tape was given to his father by
Nixon's wife, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud asked Cusack whether he could hear the tape. Cusack
replied that he had wanted to have it transcribed, but had never
done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned,'' Cloud testified, ``about the fragility of
it, for one thing, and the confidentiality of it, for another.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said he told Cusack, ``It would be nice if it was the
missing minutes,'' as he put it, ``the missing minutes of
Watergate. ''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack ``kind of smiled,'' Cloud said. ``He didn't really say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   John Reznikoff, an autograph dealer in Connecticut who was
acting as Cusack's agent in the sale of the Kennedy papers, said
that Cusack had a similar conversation with him.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he had been told by Cusack that Nixon had
approached his father because he ``had some tax issues that related
to Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack also said Nixon had visited their home and given his
father ``some things for safekeeping,'' including a reel-to-reel
tape, Reznikoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Reznikoff said he had once visited Cusack at home and was shown
a small mail bag that contained a tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that came from Nixon,'' Reznikoff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you at any point ask him to play the tape?'' asked the
prosecutor, Paul Engelmayer, an assistant U.S attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time,'' Reznikoff said. ``I'm thinking to myself,
maybe this is like the 18 minutes that are missing.'' He added
wistfully, ``Half dreaming, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack never did play the tape for him, Reznikoff told the jury.
He said Cusack had told him, ```First let's handle the JFK archive
and then maybe later we will handle this.' It was a carrot for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, 48, has sat quietly by his lawyer's side throughout the
trial, smiling occasionally, appearing confident and relaxed. He is
dressed conservatively, as if to counteract the prosecutor's
portrayal of him at the beginning of the case: In his opening
statement, Engelmayer said Cusack had embarked upon ``a life of
ferocious, unrelenting consumption: Luxury stores, luxury cars,
luxury clothes. It was built entirely upon the documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's lawyer, Robert Katzberg, also raised the issue of his
lifestyle early on. In his opening statement, he said Cusack's
spending habits were not the issue. If at the end of the case, he
told the jurors, ``you love this man'' but the evidence shows that
he is guilty, the jury should convict Cusack, Katzberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the jurors did not like his client, he added, that should
not be a factor if they otherwise felt the government had not
proved its case.
</P>
<P>
   The jury may get to decide the issue soon. The trial, once
expected to last more than a month, may conclude within a week, the
lawyers told Judge Denise Cote on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the trial has not bogged down has been the judge
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Politely but firmly, she has kept a tight reign on both sides.
Every minute seems to count.
</P>
<P>
   When Katzberg asked for ``an extra 15 minutes of lunch'' one day
last week so that he and a prosecutor could speak with an upcoming
government witness in an attempt to narrow the scope of the
testimony, he had no luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, counsel,'' Cote said. ``It will have to come out of
your sandwich time. We are not going to take an extra-long lunch
break.''

US PLANS ROUND-THE-CLOCK BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO deepened its month-old military campaign in
Yugoslavia on Saturday, announcing plans for an around-the-clock
air war, hinting that US attack helicopters would soon see combat,
and planning to beef up its Adriatic fleet to choke off oil
shipments to the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as President Clinton and leaders of 18
other nations drafted a bold ``strategic concept'' for the
50-year-old NATO alliance that will formalize the intervention in
Yugoslavia and open the door to similar action in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that our strategic concept specifically endorses
the actions such as those we are undertaking in Kosovo,'' Clinton
said at a news conference, adding that for the air war against
Yugoslavia to succeed ``we need two things. One: vigorous
execution. And two: patience.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, said the alliance had
``created the elements of a new NATO'' in which protection of human
rights and democratic values would become as important as
collective security.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's defense ministers, meanwhile, promised
General Wesley K. Clark, its supreme commander, ``all the
operational assets that he requires . . . to prosecute the air
campaign with maximum effect,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie P. Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also will have new ``flexibility'' to launch air attacks,
said Shea. He will get more tanker and reconnaissance aircraft to
help with continuous raids, and freedom to send the 24 AH64A Apache
attack helicopters in Albania into low-altitude combat in
Yugoslavia as soon as they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NATO will plan an interdiction program for oil
shipments bound for Montenegro, the port for its sister republic,
Serbia. The eight-ship NATO task force patrolling the Adriatic Sea
``may need to be augmented'' to carry this out, said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we doing this?'' Shea asked. ``Essentially because
without oil, the Yugoslav military machine will come to a halt and
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, on a visit to Egypt, said
his country will ignore any NATO attempt to impose an oil embargo.
``According to international law, sanctions cannot be imposed
unless they are approved by the Security Council,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the European Union last week moved to impose the oil
embargo. But stopping ships on the high seas is especially
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France has expressed concern that
such action is traditionally considered an act of war. Clinton said
NATO is working on a plan that ``we don't expect . . . to lead to
violence.'' With Chirac's concerns in mind, NATO has gingerly
termed interdiction ``visit and search,'' not stop and search.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO will begin an updated round of contingency planning
for a possible ground war and has been increasing the troop
strength of its Task Force Hawk in Albania, Shea said, it is still
satisfied that the 33-day-old bombing strategy is working and is
not ready to consider a land war.
</P>
<P>
   In related developments Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO jets pounded oil facilities and military targets
throughout Serbia proper and the province of Kosovo. The strikes
reportedly included a refinery in the northern city of Novi Sad, as
well as on areas southeast and southwest of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thousands of Serb civilians marched by candlelight to a
church in Belgrade to express their anger at the bombing Friday of
the Serb TV headquarters, according to the state Tanjug news
agency. Authorities said the attack killed 15 civilians and wounded
30.
</P>
<P>
   -- Russian's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said
in Moscow that he had no diplomatic initiatives planned beyond
those he has already taken. But he said he had received requests
from the leaders of several NATO countries to meet with them about
his efforts to end the crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Serb-run Media Center in Kosovo said five ethnic Albanian
children died and six were hurt when they accidentally set off a
NATO cluster bomb in a field where it had fallen without
detonating. There was no independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Lafayette Park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House, more than 4,000 pro-Serb activists, most of them
Serbian-Americans, protested the NATO bombing campaign against
Kosovo. They also held a Serbian-Orthodox religious service and
released hundreds of black balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators compared NATO to Nazi Germany and shouted that
Kosovo is part of Serbia. Their shouts, while louder than those of
a smaller group of Albanians who rallied the day before, were
barely audible at the site of the summit in the Ronald Reagan
Building. Between the demonstrators and the NATO leaders were
blocks of a no-access zone in the Federal Triangle area, as well as
layer upon layer of security _ from Secret Service agents to SWAT
teams to gun-toting bicycle policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The political leaders of NATO devised their new alliance
strategy while meeting inside the gilded Mellon Auditoriam, where
their predecessors vowed to defend one another against the Soviet
Union half a century ago. NATO's revised mission, they said, will
allow aggressive action to protect human rights, placing them above
an individual nation's right to sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has pledged, said Solana, to become an ``upholder of
democratic values both within and beyond our borders.'' When asked
if NATO would act only under authorization by the UN Security
Council, he said, ``No.'' Solana indicated that Euro-American
security issues could include protection of Persian Gulf oil
supplies. During the 1991 Gulf War, NATO forces operated against
Iraq, but not under the NATO banner.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this summit, Kosovo and similar conflicts have been
high on the agenda as presidents and prime ministers discussed
turning their Cold War military alliance into a 21st-century tool
for stamping out the kind of ethnic persecution that has raged in
the Balkans for most of the 1990s and that killed tens of millions
in Europe between 1914 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis in Kosovo has underscored the importance of NATO
and the imperative of modernizing our lives for 21st-century
challenges,'' Clinton told leaders of NATO nations, plus
delegations from 25 other nations in Europe and central Asia that
are part of a looser NATO partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's closest NATO ally, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
last week foreshadowed the change in NATO's strategy when he called
for ``a new doctrine of international community.'' Rather than
refraining from military intervention in the affairs of a sovereign
nation _ a position Western leaders have taken since the end of
World War II _ Blair's notion is to justify intervention to protect
Western values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts of genocide can never be a purely internal matter,'' said
Blair, outlining a five-step decision-making process that Western
nations would use before sending forces.
</P>
<P>
   These steps include being sure of the case for intervention,
exhausting all diplomatic efforts, studying the military
feasibility of intervention, ensuring that nations involved can
deal with a long-term commitment, and resolving any issues of
national interest among member nations.
</P>
<P>
   Non-NATO nations are sure to oppose the new intervention policy,
arguing that it could herald an era in which big powers again
impose their wills on little ones.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the Blair doctrine is UN
authorization, which was not explicitly obtained before Operation
Allied Force began but was considered crucial in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Solana and other NATO officials say earlier UN resolutions on
Kosovo provided justification to act, but they have also drafted a
resolution that will mirror NATO's conditions for stopping the
bombing.

NATO EMBARGO PLAN PRODUCES RIFT WITH FRANCE, ANGER FROM RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exposing a rift in their own ranks and risking a
potential head-on collision with Russia, NATO leaders began
planning Saturday to stop and search ships suspected of carrying
oil to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal in the decision, which they reached Friday night, was
to choke off fuel used by military forces arrayed against ethic
Albanians in Kosovo, the rebellious southernmost province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As French President Jacques Chirac voiced misgivings about
stopping ships and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said his
country would ignore any NATO decision to do so, alliance leaders
defended the plan, which could sharply escalate the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said at a news conference Saturday that it
made no military sense to allow new oil shipments to arrive in
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's junior republic that has a port on the
Adriatic Sea, while NATO pilots bomb refineries throughout Serbia,
the nation's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we justify risking the lives of the pilots to go up
and destroy the refinery and the supply capacity of Serbia and then
say, `But it's okay with us if people want to continue to supply
this nation and its outlaw actions in Kosovo in another way,'?''
Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana vowed
to do ``whatever is in our means and our capabilities'' to shut
down the shipments, including the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called the proposed interdiction a
``visit-and-search regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we doing this? Essentially because without oil, the
Yugoslav military machine will come to a halt and very quickly,''
Shea said. ``It is very important for us to continue ... to tighten
the taps, switch off the oil tap completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top
commander of the 19-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will
put together a blueprint for the interdiction mission, which would
expand the military campaign against Yugoslavia that began March 24
with aerial assaults.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's embargo, which followed a similar action taken Friday by
the 15-member European Union, covers the supply of oil and refined
products to Yugoslavia but specifically excludes supplies for
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   France's Chirac, while expressing support for the oil embargo,
told reporters Saturday that searching a ship on the high seas,
which directly challenges a nation's sovereignty, is a``very
sensitive'' matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To search is fine if the ship that you want to search allows
itself to be searched,'' Chirac said. ``But let's assume that the
ship doesn't allow itself to be searched and that you have to board
it forcibly ... That's an act of war,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Friday of NATO leaders, France was the only NATO
ally to express reservations about the proposal, Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Ivanov, explaining Russia's intention to ignore the
embargo, said, ``According to international law, sanctions cannot
be imposed unless they are approved by the (United Nations)
Security Council. We abide by the international law and not NATO
decisions,'' Ivanov said Saturday in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue delivering oil in keeping with our
international commitments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has veto power in the Security Council, has had a
prickly relationship with NATO. It has opposed the alliance's
recent expansion to include Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
But it has also sought to broker a peace settlement between its
longtime ally, Yugoslavia, and the western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned that
the world ``may slip toward a third world war, the final war'' as a
result of NATO's bombing. Chernomyrdin said he had received
invitations from NATO countries to discuss his recent mediation
efforts with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, seeking to encourage Russia's efforts despite the
escalating tension over the embargo, said he appreciates ``very,
very much what the Russian authorities are doing, what Chernomyrdin
is doing, and I wish that he succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana added that NATO's diplomatic contacts with Russia ``will
be intensified'' because of the interdiction proposal. ``And I hope
very much that we'll get a common position with the Russians on the
issue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not expect sea searches to lead to violence
but added that ``we have to be firm about it'' and ``take every
reasonable means'' to ensure the success of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a questioner who asked if NATO is drifting into an
unending war, the president called once more for patience among the
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that this air campaign has been going on for a
particularly long time,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Persian Gulf there were 44 days of bombing before there
was any kind of land action. And the land was flatter, the targets
were clearer, the weather was better,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO leaders approved a new ``strategic concept''
Saturday that authorizes the alliance to confront crises beyond its
borders. The document lays out a framework for addressing growing
risks to European stability such as terrorism, rogue states with
weapons of mass destruction, and ethnic and regional conflicts like
that in Kosovo.

DIARY TOLD OF PLOT TO KILL CLASSMATES, DESTROY SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN AND LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The two students who opened fire at Columbine
High School detailed plans to kill their classmates and destroy
their school in a hand-written diary that included a schedule timed
to coincide with Adolf Hitler's birth date, investigators said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing suspicion that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had
help carrying assault weapons into the school and planting
explosives throughout the building, Jefferson County investigators
described a diary filled with reverence for Hitler and his message
of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Now investigators appear poised to go after others who may have
been involved in ``going for the big kill,'' as Sheriff John Stone
called Tuesday's attack. The pair set a strict schedule, which they
followed for as long as possible, intending to slay many more than
the 12 students and one teacher who died. Then, also according to
plan, the pair took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this thing was that they wanted to do as
much damage as possible,'' Stone said. ``They wanted to blow the
place up, and take everyone with them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rachel Stone, a 17-year-old junior, was buried Saturday after
a memorial service filled with sobbing students, investigators
combed the sprawling high school for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after horror erupted in the hallways, ballistic
evidence continues to point to only two gunmen. Stone said bullet
casings recovered so far match only those weapons used by the
presumed killers.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators Saturday went further toward suggesting that
the pair had accomplices, though no potential suspects have been
named. Police have recovered more than 30 homemade explosives from
the school, as well as two sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic
rifle, and a semiautomatic handgun, leading them to believe that
others had to have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt that from day one,'' Stone said. ``It's kind of
hard to go into a school building, guns blazing, when you have more
guns than you can carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Deputy Steve Davis: ``We have to be extremely careful with
the information we release. We don't want to tip our hand to any
potential suspect or suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, Columbine students have said they spotted
a third gunman wielding a weapon and running through the hallways.
While stressing that witnesses could have been confused by the
chaos that followed the first shots and explosions, investigators
said they are not ruling out those accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the school, the presumed killers' own homes yielded
abundant evidence, investigators disclosed Saturday. Although they
would not say whether the thick journal came from the home of
Harris and Klebold, they noted that it was found in plain sight,
along with pipe bombs and hate literature.
</P>
<P>
   The diary covered exactly one year, marking April 20, Hitler's
birth date, as the day the conspirators would ``rock 'n roll,''
Stone said. Also in the pages were diagrams of the school
identifying exits and alarms and noting times when the greatest
number of students would be in one place.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said a trail of electronic evidence, including
communications between members of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' is
being reviewed. Harris and Klebold belonged to the group of
outcasts, known for their antisocial behavior and fascination with
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be one, two, or six more involved, we don't know,''
Stone said. ``But we will bring them to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting truth from rumor, evidence from false leads, has been
complicated by Internet high jinks. People from around the country
have posted messages on line claiming they have information about
the killings or were even involved themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One anonymous Internet posting forwarded to investigators,
purportedly written by Harris, was deemed a likely fake Saturday.
But federal agents could not determine its origin, or rule out the
possibility that the note calling for other deaths was sent by an
accomplice of the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Because the note also predicted that Monday would not pass
without more deaths, county officials have stepped up security at
schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they defended the actions of local deputies
and SWAT teams who were unable to reach some victims until three
hours after they were gunned down. A deputy sheriff assigned to the
school did fire at one of the student gunmen soon after the
shooting began, but did not pursue him through the buildiing.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that SWAT teams, aware of the deadly exposives placed
around the school, had to move carefully, unable to predict how
many shooters there were or what might trigger one of the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators said they expect to be documenting the damage
inside Columbine High School for weeks, prayer vigils and burials
continued.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 mourners turned out for a Friday night memorial
service for three of the victims _ Kelly Fleming, Daniel Mauser,
and Matthew Ketcher _ and filled the church with photographs and
mementos such as spelling bee awards, football jerseys, and stuffed
animals. Linda Mauser led the congregation in tribute to her only
son, who surprised her recently with a gold crucifix he had bought
during a school club's trip to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what this cross has meant to me the last few
days,'' said Mauser, speaking as photos of her 15-year-old son were
displayed behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands turned out again Saturday for the funeral service of
Rachel Scott, 17, a committed Evangelical Christian whose charm
drew hundreds of friends and strangers to cover her car in the
school parking lot with flowers and loving notes.
</P>
<P>
   At her funeral, the first for any of the 13 victims, friends
arrived early to sign her coffin as they might have signed her
yearbook under other cirumstances. If anything underscored the
tender age of most of the victims of the Columbine shooting, it was
the hearts and flowers and promises ``never to forget you'' doodled
on the casket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a warrior,'' said the pastor, Bruce Porter. ``But she
didn't fight with implements of destruction. Rachel fought with the
implements of love and compassion and caring and mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the senselessness of the shooting, he said: ``We have
to ask ourselves some hard questions. What has happened to us as a
people that this should happen to us? How did we get here?''

 &HT;    `Country boy:' Shellman turns out nation's best in Harvey
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELLMAN, Ga. _ There he was, the most decorated high school
basketball player in Georgia history, the Naismith, USA Today and
Parade Magazine national player of the year, Mr. Georgia
Basketball, sweeping his mama's front porch on the hottest day of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   That scene tells you all you need to know about Donnell Harvey.
The 6-foot-8, 230-pound power forward who signed with Florida last
week is the most famous athlete to come out of Randolph County
since Rosie Greer and Larry Holmes left here 30 years ago. Yet he
remains so down to Earth that he doesn't mind sweeping a little of
it off the porch every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I'm just a country boy,'' Harvey says in
his low, slow drawl. And he's not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   You can't get much more country than Shellman. This Southwest
Georgia town of a few hundred pops up out of nowhere among the
soybean fields and railroad lines along Highway 82. Outside of
farming and pulpwood, there's not much industry to speak of here.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Harvey's mother, Laura Powell, has to commute 54
miles a day to her assembly-line job at a lighting manufacturing
plant in Eufala, Ala. It's an exhausting ritual that leaves her
tired much of the time and forced her to miss nearly all of
Harvey's high school basketball games. But she does it so Donnell
and his brothers Deidrick Harvey and Travious Powell can ``have
everything they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't much. The tiny dwelling that houses Harvey, his mom
and one of his brothers consists of a couple of small bedrooms, a
bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room so cramped with a sofa,
loveseat, stereo system, television and coffee table that the rangy
Harvey can't even stretch his legs when he sits down. Instead, when
he sinks back into the soft-cushioned couch, his knees remain just
below chest level.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered throughout the neatly-kept but cluttered room is the
multitude of hardware that has been heaped upon Harvey for his
tremendous basketball ability. A Naismith Trophy over here, a
McDonald's All-America plaque over there, there are literally
dozens of them and there is no rhyme or reason to their
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't find anywhere else to put them,'' explains
Harvey's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey has a car, or at least he used to before the 1984 Mazda
626 quit cranking several weeks ago. It's been down the street at
the shop ever since, but Harvey hasn't had the money to let the
mechanics figure out what's wrong. So it just sits there. Which is
OK because Harvey always knew basketball was going to get him out
of Randolph County.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as Harvey's house is to find, though, head coaches from
every major Division I school in the South did manage to track it
down. They tend to find you when you're the No. 1-rated prospect in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dennis Rodman without tattoos'' is the now-infamous
description assistant coach Winfred Williams gave Harvey. Only
that's not entirely accurate. Harvey in fact has two tattoos, both
on his left shoulder. The one on top says ``Big D'' and one below
is a clown face. ``Because I like to clown around,'' Harvey
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey averaged 23 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots
for the Red Devils. It's amazing how grown men fawn over you when
you're 6-feet-8 with a self-professed affinity for defense and
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mitchell-Baker game, all the heavy hitters were there:
Billy Donovan from Florida, Tubby Smith from Kentucky, Cliff Ellis
from Auburn, Ron Jirsa from Georgia, Bobby Cremins from Georgia
Tech, Clyde Drexler from Houston. There were some others but those
are the ones everybody seems to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sight to behold,'' recalls Williams, who as
eighth-grade coach first discovered Harvey, ``all those big-time
coaches sitting in the bleachers to see Donnell.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing in front of college coaches was the easy part.
Harvey did that all last summer as a member of Wallace Prather's
Atlanta Celtics AAU team. The hard part was when he was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone never stopped ringing,'' Harvey says. ``Every five
minutes, somebody would call. If it wasn't a coach, then it was a
sportswriter wanting to know if I'd made up my mind yet. Sometimes
I just wouldn't answer it or I'd leave the house and go somewhere
with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida won the Donnell Harvey Sweepstakes,
edging out Auburn, Georgia and Clemson. Harvey made the
announcement at a well-attended news conference at his school
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey says he chose the Gators because they promised he'd start
immediately and he felt they offered the quickest route to the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went to the Sweet Sixteen last year,'' he says. ``They'll
make it farther than that with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey didn't choose Auburn because ``Chris (Porter) plays the
same position as me'' and eliminated Clemson mainly because it was
too far away.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia would appear to be the biggest loser in all this because
Harvey says he grew up always believing he would ``wear the red and
black and play for the Bulldogs.'' But Jirsa's firing in March
coupled with Jumaine Jones' decision to test the NBA draft repelled
Harvey from Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Though Harvey looks forward to his days in Gainesville, Fla., he
plans to remain there only as long as necessary. Harvey makes it
clear that playing in the NBA is his ultimate goal and he'll remain
in college only as long as it takes to achieve that objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to get somewhere with basketball,'' he says.
``Hopefully I can make (the NBA) so I can move my parents and
grandparents from here.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't mean move them from the country, mind you, just from
the small house on Buford Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like living in the country, being from a small
town,'' Harvey says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? To this point, it certainly has served him well.

CLINTON SEEKS FUNDS TO CURB SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday he will ask
Congress for more money to help defuse school violence and keep
guns out of the hands of violent juveniles, saying government has a
responsibility to ``counter the culture of violence'' that led to
the Colorado high school tragedy last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do more to prevent violence in our schools,'' Clinton
said in his weekly radio address, which he devoted to last week's
shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would send a request next week to Capitol Hill for
$12 million to fund emergency teams to help communities respond
``when tragedy strikes.'' His legislation also would finance more
counselors and mentors, conflict-resolution programs and metal
detectors in schools.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the funding requests would be
contained in the federal reauthorization of the Elementary and
Secondary Schools Act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would also propose a crime bill designed to
crack down on gun shows and illegal gun trafficking, ban violent
juveniles from ever being able to buy a gun, and close loopholes
that allow juveniles to own assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Four weapons, including a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, a 9mm
semiautomatic rifle, and two sawed-off shotguns were used in the
Littleton shooting, authorities said. They said the pistol was
bought at a store in the Denver area, but not by either of the two
students presumed to be the killers, who both died of
self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We marvel at the bravery of the fatally wounded teacher who
led 40 students to safety,'' Clinton said. ``We look with
admiration at the medics and the police officers who rushed to the
scene to save lives; the clergy, the counselors, the local leaders
who immediately began the painful process of helping people to
heal; and the parents and students who in the face of hatred
refused to return it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``At a moment of such terrible, terrible
violence, these people didn't turn away, and we can't either.
Instead every one of us must take responsibility to counter the
culture of violence. The government must take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Americans must replace a ``culture of violence'' with a
``culture of values'' and also urged parents to ``refuse to buy
products that glorify violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican response to Clinton's radio address, Colorado
Governor Bill Owens said the events in Littleton ``warn us there is
a virus loose within our culture,'' adding: ``too may of our young
people are susceptible to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also urged parents to pay more attention to what their
children may be watching on television, what video games they play,
what World Wide Web sites they log on to. ``Do you know if your
child has a home page?'' Owens asked.

IT`S BACK TO BASICS FOR MALIGNED DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The defense for UCLA's football team is taking the
first step to rebuilding its riddled reputation. And it's a step
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Under new defensive coordinator Bob Field, the Bruins are back
to the basics this month at spring practice: tackling drills,
alignment drills, assignment drills. They've spent time shedding
blocks and finding the ball in flight. Yes, Field is installing a
new system, but at a rate the players can handle and with one eye
fixed on the fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to take the approach, `Let's not put in a lot, but
what we do, let's do well,' '' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a welcomed change for the Bruins, whose circuitry was often
overloaded last season. To absorb Nick Aliotti's complicated system
_ to learn all the names and concepts and assignments _ they
bypassed the basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Field is really teaching us the game in a way that's
easy to understand,'' cornerback Marques Anderson said. ``We're
tackling every day. We're doing ball drills and backpedaling drills
_ the simple stuff we got away from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, bad, out: Although nine starters return, the defense isn't
at full strength because of myriad injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tackles Anthony Fletcher (hamstring) and Ken Kocher (knee) are
out, linebacker Robert Thomas (back) has practiced sparingly and
cornerback Jason Bell (heel) hasn't played a down.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have given several reserves a chance to show their
stuff, including outside linebacker Ali Abdul-Azziz, cornerback Joe
Hunter and defensive end Rusty Williams.
</P>
<P>
   One nagging problem is the safety spot opposite Jason Stephens.
Neither Eric Whitfield nor Audie Attar have tempered coach Bob
Toledo's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really pleased with their performances right now,''
Toledo said. ``We've got to get better. They've missed a lot of
tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Another safety candidate is redshirt freshman Lovell Houston. A
heralded recruit last year _ he chose UCLA over Washington and
Florida State _ Houston is recovering from surgery on both
shoulders and cannot participate in contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in as a cornerback, but they've moved me to safety,''
Houston said. ``Coach Toledo said it was an executive decision, and
it's fine with me. I'm picking up the defense real well, and I'll
be ready to go in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaching changes: The offensive staff has returned intact, but
there are new faces and responsibilities defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Field will coach the secondary in addition to his coordinator
duties. Marc Dove has the linebackers, both inside and outside. The
newcomers, Jethro Franklin and John Pearce, will coach the line.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, who coached with Toledo at Texas A&AMP;M, has the defensive
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, the former Fresno State player and assistant _ he
sacked Troy Aikman four times in the 1987 game _ is coaching the
tackles. He replaces Terry Tumey, who became an assistant with the
Denver Broncos, and will fill Tumey's spot in recruiting the city.
</P>
<P>
   No shows: Cornerback Ryan Roques, receiver Freddie Mitchell and
tight end Gabe Crecion have shunned baseball to concentrate on
football. As usual, receiver Danny Farmer has skipped spring
practice to continue playing for the volleyball team, and
linebacker Ed Stansbury is with track and field.

EARLY SUSPICION OF BIG MISTAKE IN MURDER CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete photo note)  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (rk) 
 By   DAVID M. HALBFINGER WITH ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE, N.J. _ By late in the morning of April 10, several hours
after heavily armed, masked state troopers broke down the door of a
house near here and arrested Terrance Everett in the murder of an
Orange police officer, seasoned investigators in the office of the
Essex County prosecutor were certain that Everett was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   According to a high-ranking law enforcement official, they told
the office's second-in-command, First Assistant Prosecutor Patrick
Toscano, that Everett had just given a convincing account of his
whereabouts on the night of the murder _ from the two bacon
cheeseburgers with no tomatoes that he had eaten at a fast-food
restaurant to the bank machine where he had withdrawn cash _ and
had even passed two polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced, Toscano urged his boss, Prosecutor Patricia A. Hurt,
to let Everett go free.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hurt overruled Toscano and others who made the same
recommendation, at one point even pounding a table with her fists,
according to a county official with knowledge of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   After all, four eyewitnesses had independently identified
Everett from an array of police mug shots. And that night, she
announced Everett's arrest in time for the news to make the Sunday
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was not released for six days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two weeks after the April 8 death of Officer
Joyce Anne Carnegie, Ms. Hurt maintains that the real killer is
safely behind bars and that she and her subordinates handled the
case well. ``Overall, I think that this office did a good job,''
she said at a news conference last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet details of their joint investigation, gleaned from
interviews with police officers, prosecutors, witnesses and others
_ most of whom were under strict orders not to discuss the case and
who insisted that their names not be published _ suggest that it
was the antithesis of a textbook case.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring lapse, according to those interviewed, seems to
be the failure to interview a key alibi witness for Everett.
Although Everett told investigators that he was eating at a nearby
Wendy's when Carnegie was killed, detectives did not interview the
restaurant manager until after his account appeared in a newspaper
_ six days later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the man now accused of killing Carnegie, Condell B.
Woodson, was not arrested until April 17, two days after detectives
flew to Georgia. The detectives found the person from whom Woodson
is believed to have bought the 9-millimeter pistol, which
prosecutors contend is the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   But as early as the night of April 9, even before Everett was
arrested, federal agents told Orange and Essex County investigators
that they had traced the gun to Georgia. Neither Ms. Hurt nor the
Orange police director, Richard Conte, has explained why it took
nearly a week to make the trip south.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, two other men were arrested in the
investigation into Carnegie's murder. One, Earl Faison, died in
custody an hour after being pulled out of a taxicab. His family
claims he was beaten by officers.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has put the Essex prosecutor's office and the
Orange police on the defensive. The state attorney general and the
U.S. attorney in Newark have opened inquiries into the death of
Faison and the treatment of Everett, who says the police beat him
during his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, FBI agents removed documents from the Orange police
station under a subpoena. Everett's and Faison's families are
considering civil rights lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's image within law enforcement circles was damaged even
further when it became known that Toscano, her second-in-command,
had resigned in protest within hours after pushing her to release
Everett. Toscano has repeatedly declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most harmful result of the problems with the murder
investigation could materialize later, when the case against
Woodson winds up in court. Law enforcement officials here and in
surrounding jurisdictions are already speculating privately that a
skilled defense lawyer could make much of the three arrests
preceding Woodson's.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodson indeed confessed to the killing, as has been
reported, ``it saves them,'' said one veteran investigator,
referring to the Essex prosecutor's office. ``But even then, he
could argue that he was scared he'd die, like Faison.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt has refused repeated requests for an interview since
Monday, when she defended her handling of the investigation at a
news conference after Woodson's arraignment. At the time, she
denied there had been deep divisions among her staff on how to
proceed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, her spokesman, Ray Weiss, reiterated that Ms. Hurt
``believes it would be inappropriate for her to make any comments
while this is still an ongoing homicide investigation.'' He called
back later to add that Ms. Hurt ``cannot comment about the Everett
case, because the attorney general's office is in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Conte, the Orange police director, conceded in an interview this
week that ``mistakes were made.'' But he declined to say what the
mistakes had been and refused to answer many questions about the
case.

</P>
<P>
   The Investigation  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The call came over the police radio around 8:15 p.m.: two armed
robberies on the south side of town. Be on the lookout for a bald
black man with a stocky build wearing a leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mile north of the robbery scene, three Orange police
officers were taking a break, chatting alongside their squad cars
in a parking lot. Hearing the radio call, they headed for the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie made the first right turn onto Day Street, heading
south. Almost immediately, she spotted someone and called in to
double-check the description of the robbery suspect. She never
asked for backup, and no one heard from her again.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 minutes later, Carlos Gonzalez, a former Orange
police officer driving home from work in Brooklyn, saw Carnegie's
patrol car stopped on the sidewalk, partly blocking northbound
traffic on Day Street, its lights flashing, the driver's door open.
Gonzalez, now an agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, pulled over and found Carnegie lying face up near the
door.
</P>
<P>
   She was mortally wounded, shot in the abdomen and the back of
the head. Her weapon had never left its holster.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez flagged a passing ambulance, which took Carnegie to the
trauma center at University Hospital in Newark. But doctors could
not save her.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:40 p.m., the Orange police dispatcher reported an officer
down at Day Street and Freeway Drive West. Conte, the police
director, was called at home and told that, for the first time in
more than 30 years, a member of the department had been gunned
down. As friends and relatives of Carnegie headed for the hospital,
the search began for her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers immediately began searching the area around the
crime scene. Someone reported seeing a black man running down the
railroad tracks, and an officer gave chase but could not catch up
to the man, Orange police officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the next day, scores of police officers on foot and
in squad cars pressed a chaotic manhunt. The normal weekday calm
was shattered every few minutes by the sounds of blaring sirens and
screeching tires.
</P>
<P>
   At one point near the scene of the shooting, an unmarked cruiser
burst airborne from a parking lot, spun wildly on the rain-slicked
asphalt and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investigators from the Orange force and from the Essex
prosecutor's office, which handles most homicide cases in the
county outside Newark, had plenty to go on.
</P>
<P>
   They had the accounts of three witnesses to the robberies, which
investigators believe were committed by the killer of Carnegie. And
they soon found a witness to the shooting itself.
</P>
<P>
   That person told officers that the gunman had run along a
service road to Interstate 280, toward a public housing complex on
the other side of the interstate, according to a homicide
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the investigator said, the police had canvassed
the grounds of the complex and found a 9-millimeter handgun in a
patch of grass. The gun was handed over to agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for examination.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Green, a spokesman for the bureau, said that by the next
evening, agents had traced the weapon to the Barrow Gun Shop in
Butler, Ga. A licensed gun dealer there had sold it in 1993 to a
Butler resident, Green said. The bureau immediately gave that
information to the Essex County prosecutors, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of the store said that she received a few calls from
officers identifying themselves as agents of the bureau over the
next several days. But no one visited the shop until New Jersey
investigators and federal agents arrived on April 15, a week after
the shooting, she said. They removed records about the 1993 gun
sale and left, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that bureau agents spent the days in between trying
to locate the buyer, whose name has never been released. The buyer
was interviewed by two federal agents and New Jersey investigators
on April 15, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer, investigators say, provided the name of Condell
Woodson, an Orange native who had lived in Georgia. He was arrested
in Newark two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The Arrest  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, April 9, the day after Joyce Carnegie was
killed, Terrance Everett, a warehouse clerk for a computer repair
company, was eating breakfast with his wife, son and mother in
their home in East Orange. The television news carried the report
of the Thursday night murder in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Everett said in an interview this week, he
shook his head. ``Whenever they find him,'' he said to his family,
``they're going to whup him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn the next day, Everett was asleep in the third-floor
bedroom he shared with his wife, Ebony, who is 6{ months pregnant.
Sometime after 5 a.m., Mrs. Everett was startled awake by a loud
bang. ``I thought the boiler was exploding,'' she sid.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mrs. Everett opened the door to the hallway, she met
eyes with a masked man holding an automatic rifle. Other armed men
downstairs, later identified as members of the entry team of the
New Jersey State Police, were yelling, ``Where is Terrance
Everett?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Everett, wearing only a nightshirt, was led down to the
second floor of the house and pushed to the floor, she said. Her
hands were strapped together behind her back.
</P>
<P>
   Everett followed his wife into the hallway and was ordered to
freeze. He said he was thrown to the floor, cuffed, then pulled
down to the second floor and thrown to the floor again, face down.
One officer stood on Everett's back; others kicked, spit on and
cursed him, he said. Another blew his nose on him.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned down, he peered past the officers who crowded into the
room and saw his son, Terrance Jr., 5, staring back. ``He was
sitting there on his bed, with his mouth hanging open,'' Everett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett said he asked what he was being arrested for, but no one
answered him. ``They took me downstairs and flung me into the
kitchen,'' he said. ``I fell into the table. One cop picked me up,
then another threw the table out of the way and threw me into the
stove. I bumped into a cabinet, and he tore the door off the
cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   To walk Everett outside to a van, officers needed the key to
unlock the fence that surrounds the front yard. Everett said he
asked if he could turn around to show the officer the right key. He
said another officer hit him in the face with his gun, saying,
``Nobody told you to turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing only the T-shirt and boxer shorts, Everett was taken
outside into the cold light of morning. ``There was a sea of
officers,'' he said, ``clapping and applauding.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Only after the police van arrived at the Essex County
prosecutor's office in Newark a few minutes later, Everett said,
did he learn that he had been arrested as a suspect in the killing
of the Orange police officer.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, he said, different interrogators came and
went, leaving him alone for long stretches in an interview room.
Over and over, he described where he had been on the night of April
8. He was read his rights, he said. ``But every time I asked for a
lawyer, they'd say, `If you're innocent, you don't need one,' get
up, and walk out of the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators asked Everett to take a polygraph test. He agreed,
and by 10 a.m., he had taken the test twice, answering the same
questions. He was not told how he had done until about 3 p.m., he
said. ``They told me I'd failed the polygraph.'' In fact, he had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Everett had an easy enough time recalling the details of
Thursday night. He got off work at 6 p.m. and picked up his wife an
hour later at home. The two, who live in Everett's mother's home,
drove off to look at an apartment in Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they drove to the Wendy's on Main Street for dinner.
Everett ordered two junior bacon cheeseburgers with no tomatoes.
His wife ordered two junior bacon cheeseburgers with mayo and
onions only. They had fries and a Frosty, too. Everett noticed an
East Orange police officer enter the restaurant and order a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9 p.m., the couple left for a park in West Orange. They
walked around outside for a while. From there, he said, they
stopped at a cash machine, then headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the interrogation room, investigators resumed questioning
Everett about 3 p.m., he said. By then, the Essex County
prosecutor's office had been torn apart by an explosive debate
about his guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest had been a good one, investigators said. He was a
bald black man who fit the general description of the robber and
shooter. Witnesses identified his photograph the day after the
shooting. And he was a paroled felon who had served three years in
prison for a robbery conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But several investigators felt that his alibi was too thorough,
too calmly delivered, too easily verifiable, law enforcement
officials said. And he had passed the polygraphs. Experienced
investigators grudgingly concluded that they had the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Toscano and others argued to free him, officials said. But Ms.
Hurt refused. About 2 p.m., Toscano resigned, a decision not made
public for four days. Later that night, Ms. Hurt announced that
Everett had been charged with murder, criminal possession of a
weapon and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   A Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt would later say that the investigation of Carnegie's
murder had by that time become ``two-pronged'' _ with officers
examining Everett's alibi while continuing to follow other leads
and evidence from the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, a Sunday, that two-pronged approach produced
the odd scene of officers' scouring the streets of this
working-class town, carrying the composite sketch of a killer who
their superiors were saying was already in jail on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that night, the police arrested two more suspects.
James Coker, an unemployed man with a record of at least two
convictions on drug charges, was at his aunt's apartment in Newark
when police officers broke through her front door around 6 p.m. The
police say that officers saw him try to swallow a bit of crack
cocaine as they burst in.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they tracked down Coker, who also fits the
general description of Carnegie's killer, after he bragged to
others that he had killed a police officer and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the Essex County Jail on Thursday, Coker, 30,
said he had no part in the shooting. He said he volunteered to take
a polygraph test, but none was given to him. He remains in custody
on charges of drug possession, attempting to destroy evidence and
other outstanding charges, his lawyer, Albert Kapin, said.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, sometime after 10 p.m., a police officer
ordered Earl Faison to get out of a green taxicab across the street
from his girlfriend's apartment on the south side of Interstate
280, two blocks from the scene of Carnegie's murder.
</P>
<P>
   But because officials have provided so little information about
the case, it is still unclear why the cab was stopped. But at her
news conference on Monday, Ms. Hurt said that Faison, an aspiring
rap performer who happened to be bald, was picked up because he,
too, fit the killer's description.
</P>
<P>
   When approached by the police, he ran, the authorities said. He
was caught after a chase, carrying a gun, and was arrested after a
struggle. According to an account in The Star-Ledger of Newark, he
was subdued with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Essex County prosecutor's office, Faison
collapsed and died at the Orange police station. One law
enforcement official said that Faison, who was carrying an inhaler
at the time, had suffered an asthma attack, which can be fatal if
untreated. While a preliminary autopsy report ruled out blunt
force, the cause of his death is still undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Faison's father, Earl Williams, believes the police killed his
son and has retained a private pathologist for an independent
autopsy. He said he went to view the body at the county morgue on
April 12 but was shown a picture of the corpse instead. There were
many cuts and bruises on his son's face, which was swollen,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alibi
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fajimolu, the assistant manager on duty at Wendy's the
night of the murder, clearly remembers Terrance and Mrs. Everett
from the night of Carnegie's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   They came in around 8:30 p.m. and sat at a table against the
windows for at least a half hour, he said. In an interview this
week he recalled the special orders they placed, as well as other
details.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple ate, an East Orange officer, a regular customer,
came in for a sandwich and told Fajimolu that an Orange officer had
just been gunned down six blocks away. ``He told me to call if I
saw anyone matching the description,'' Fajimolu said.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, April 10, a detective came by asking to see
the restaurant's security tape. Fajimolu played it back for him.
But images from the night of April 8 had already been erased, he
said. The detective left without asking Fajimolu any other
questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that detectives returned on April 12 and 13 bearing
subpoenas, and another assistant manager printed out receipts.
Investigators say the receipts showed that someone had ordered the
cheeseburgers and soft drinks that Everett said he had ordered, at
the time he said he had.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators did not question Fajimolu. On April 15, he
told his story to reporters for The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Fajimolu was picked up at home and brought to the
Essex County prosecutor's office. He repeated his story for
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   That night, as word surfaced that Woodson was the new suspect in
the slaying, Ms. Hurt hastily called a news conference at her
office to announce that Everett had been exonerated. Around the
corner, Everett walked out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   In her office, Ms. Hurt abruptly ended her news conference by
bundling her papers and rising. A reporter shouted a last question.
Would she apologize to Everett and his family?
</P>
<P>
   Saying nothing, the prosecutor walked out of the room.

NORMAN WILLIAMS, 85, WRITER ON PHILATELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By BARTH HEALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Williams, a British lawyer best known as a prolific
writer about stamps and stamp collecting, died on April 9 in
London. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was best known to American collectors as the co-author
with his brother Maurice of ``Fundamentals of Philately,'' an
exhaustive study of the printing methods used to make stamps _ from
the monochrome engraved stamps of the 19th century through the
stamp issues of multicolor offset presses in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Until his death Williams also wrote a column for the weekly
Linn's Stamp News, which announced his death in its issue last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams brothers wrote more than 30 books and thousands of
articles. They also edited journals and lectured widely. Norman
Williams specialized in stamps known as Cinderellas _ stamps used
not to pay postage but for tax receipts, publicity, propaganda and
the like, or stamps used to pay for delivering mail from remote
places without routine postal service, like some small islands in
British waters.
</P>
<P>
   His final work was the Encyclopaedia of Rare and Famous Stamps,
published in two volumes in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also spent 64 years as a court reporter for the Inc.
Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales. In this role, from
which he retired less than two years ago, he was responsible for
setting out the facts of cases in such detail that judges and
lawyers could decide what precedents may have been set.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Williams died in 1976. Norman Williams is survived by
his wife, Denise, whom he married in 1943 when on leave from his
duties as an artillery officer in West Africa; two sons, Marcus and
Robin, and five grandchildren.

ANDERSON KEEPS UP INTENSITY FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It was last August when Garret Anderson
failed to run out a grounder back to the pitcher in Baltimore,
prompting Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins to yank him from the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins says Anderson's ``whole approach since the start of
spring training is completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Anderson's new approach had to do with the fact that the
Angels started the spring with four outfielders and he would have
to fight for playing time. But even though Jim Edmonds is out with
an injury, Anderson continues to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I need to do for myself to make myself a
more complete player,'' Anderson said. ``I'm not really worried
about how other people perceive me as a player. But I worry about
what I think about myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to erase in anybody's mind what other people
think of me. I'm doing in my mind what I think I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Two ends of the spectrum: When the Angels win, they win big. In
their seven victories, they've won by an average margin of 5.7
runs.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Angels lose, it's usually a tight, tough loss. Of
their 11 losses, six have come by one run, including Saturday's 4-3
loss to the Royals. Overall, they are 1-6 in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown we can play different parts of the game,'' Angels
right fielder Tim Salmon said. ``It's just a matter of putting it
together and picking each other up. It's just one of those weird
things that happens. You get good hitting, you have no pitching.
You get good pitching, you have no hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen the road trip. It couldn't get any worse, or
harder, or hurt more. But we'll figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down: After getting two hits in the Angels' victory over
the Mariners on April 16, shortstop Andy Sheets was hitting .350.
Since then, Sheets is 1 for 21, his average falling to .246.
</P>
<P>
   He's also been struggling defensively _ his error Saturday was
his sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week's been terrible, Sheets said. ``I'm making
errors, striking out, not driving in runs when I've had
opportunities. Maybe I'm trying to do too much at times.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, acquired in a trade with the Padres for Phil Nevin on
March 29, will be the Angels' regular shortstop until Gary
DiSarcina returns from a broken bone in his left forearm in July.

   (NYT15) WASHINGTON -- April 24, 1999 -- NATO-24-HOURS, 4-24 --
As NATO leaders meet at the Pentagon Saturday morning, their
anniversary pageant is playing on two stages, as political theater
and in the theater of war, and its powerful rhetoric clashes with
the forces of battle in Belgrade and the Balkans. By 3 p.m., the
leaders had finished speaking, and the exiles from Malisevo, a
village of 800 homes outside Gnjilane in Kosovo, were bedding down
on blankets laid over newly spread crushed stone in a cleared

FIRST LADY'S OUTSIDER STATUS LOOMS LARGE IN POSSIBLE SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a peek at how Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might run a
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton for Senate next year, go no
farther than the Giuliani Web site devoted to a daily electronic
thrashing of the first lady. ``Born in Illinois and carried to
power in Arkansas, with no connection of any kind to New York,
Hillary has set her sights on the New York Senate seat,'' the site,
HillaryNo.com, tells visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the unsettled atmosphere that envelops this
still-hypothetical race, one thing has become clear in the last few
days: Mrs. Clinton's residency, or her lack thereof in New York, is
looming as a major factor in the prospective race, and even, her
friends say, in the first lady's decision whether to run at all.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers say that the mayor, after initially saying
he would not make an issue of Mrs. Clinton's years of growing up in
Illinois and living in Arkansas, is now prepared to turn her
non-New York pedigree into one of his main attacks against her.
Giuliani has taken to describing Mrs. Clinton as a carpetbagger,
while pointedly joking to audiences upstate _ where his advisers
believe that resentment of Mrs. Clinton's lack of New York
residency is particular deep _ that perhaps he should move to
Arkansas and run for Senate there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People across the state have expressed their concern about the
issue,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of Giuliani's Senate
exploratory committee, which set up the HillaryNo site. ``Many
people have told us there's a lack of confidence with someone who
knows nothing about the state and who has never lived in the state,
and whether a person like that has an understanding of the needs of
the people of the state of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton's advisers, who have noted public polls showing
that support for the first lady has slipped, say they are reviewing
ways to counter what they say appears to be a potent line of
attack. The first lady's three days in New York last week, combined
with a last-minute decision to return this Thursday to address the
state Democratic Party, along with the new authority she is
displaying in talking about New York culture and history, marked
the start of an effort to transform her from a Washington celebrity
into a more familiar figure in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly appears that Giuliani thinks it is an issue,''
said Harold Ickes, the former senior White House aide who is
overseeing Mrs. Clinton's exploration of a Senate race. ``And it
may well be an issue. Mrs. Clinton is going to have to spend some
time assuring voters that she indeed wants to represent New York,
which she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a legitimate question that voters may raise,'' Ickes
said. ``I don't know how deeply it cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the calculation going on in both camps, however, the
actual political significance of the fact that Mrs. Clinton has
never lived in New York remains one of the larger mysteries of this
prospective matchup. While Giuliani's decision to attack her on the
issue could persuade Mrs. Clinton not to run _ and that could very
well be Giuliani's real motivation _ there is much debate in
political circles about how problematic it would be for Mrs.
Clinton to move to New York, declare her candidacy and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is, don't do it,'' said Charles Cook Jr., author of a
Washington-based political report that follows congressional races.
``But if there was going to be an exception, this would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose retirement in
2000 has created the opening that Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani are now
examining, argued in an interview that the state is so diverse, and
has such a history of embracing outsiders in all kinds of
professions, that never having been a resident would pose only a
minor difficulty to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being someone from another place is a fact of life for huge
numbers of our citizens,'' Moynihan said. ``The Constitution says
you have to be a citizen of the state at the time that you are
elected. We have in the Constitution a presumption that you're not
necessarily born there or raised there.''
</P>
<P>
   In some episodes in political history, being a carpetbagger
proved a liability, notably when Pete Dawkins, a Republican, moved
to New Jersey to run for Senate against Frank Lautenberg in 1988.
He lost.
</P>
<P>
   But there are as many examples where it did not matter. Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., defused the charge overnight by observing
that the longest he had ever lived in one place was the five and a
half years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are reasons to believe that Mrs. Clinton can surmount the
issue in New York. Early public polls suggest that voters are
evenly divided over whether they would consider Mrs. Clinton's
residency in deciding how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, the director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said his
polling found that half the respondents had concerns about Mrs.
Clinton's being from out of state, but he said the figure was far
lower than he would expect to find in other states. ``In most other
states, it would be 95 percent,'' Carroll said. ``But in New York,
it seems to be less of a problem. We are a national place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men who have held Moynihan's seat moved in from out
of state: Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and
James Buckley, a Conservative from Connecticut. Each was helped to
victory by other factors _ Kennedy benefited from Lyndon Johnson's
landslide victory of 1964 and the aura of the Kennedy name, while
Buckley slipped through in a three-way race in 1970 _but their
successes have been cited by Mrs. Clinton's supporters as evidence
that one does not have to have lived in New York to run here.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, several consultants said, might not be the ideal
person to make this particular charge against the first lady.
Upstate, his attempts to portray her as an interloper might be
undercut by the equally foreign image of a New York City mayor
campaigning through the mountains and farmland north of Peekskill.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton might turn out to have a particular immunity to
this line of attack because she represents a new kind of public
figure in America: someone who has no clear geographical
identification whatsoever. She grew up in the suburbs of Chicago,
and moved with President Clinton to Arkansas, before coming to
Washington. She has no particular accent or visible cultural
markers. Her political philosophy is more New York than Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who respect her _ as well as those who dislike her
_ don't consider that she came from Chicago,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., who has promoted her candidacy. ``They consider her
as a national figure, and God knows, that's what we need in a
national state.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But even Dick Morris, the political consultant, was
unable to offer any advice about how to defuse an issue he
considers politically lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly think she is not going to run because of this,''
Morris said. ``She will carefully and calmly assess the polling and
make a reasoned decision not to do it.''

 &HT;    CLINTON CALLS FOR 'PATIENCE' TO LET WAR STRATEGY WORK
 &HT;    700&AMP;add. With NATO-CITY.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Saturday that NATO must be
prepared ``to pay the price of time'' in order to prevail in its
air war against Yugoslavia, as an alliance plan to choke off
Belgrade's oil imports ran into snags.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the buildup of NATO troops and tanks in Albania and
Macedonia does not signal that the alliance is creeping toward a
ground war in the neighboring Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not drifting. We are moving forward with a strategy that
I believe strongly will succeed,'' Clinton said at a news
conference on the second day of a summit marking the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced we will prevail if we have the patience,'' he
said. ``We have to be prepared not only to execute with
determination, but to pay the price of time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, NATO continued to to pound away at targets
across Yugoslavia's dominant republic of Serbia, striking a pair of
radio and television towers, three airfields, a railroad bridge and
Serb forces, tanks and artillery deployed across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly 20,000 U.S. and allied troops rimming Kosovo from
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, and another 10,000 scheduled to
arrive over the coming week, speculation has centered on the
possibility of NATO ground operations inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana repeated that there is no
intention of deploying ground forces, though the alliance is
actively assessing the requirements for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's position from the start of the air campaign has been that
it would send ground troops into Kosovo as a peace-keeping force
once hostilities have ceased, but would not attempt to fight their
way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo's borders in
the face of Serb attacks on civilians and towns across the tiny
province of Kosovo. Roughly an equal number are believed to have
fled their homes and to have gone into hiding in the rugged
mountains inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As leaders from the 19-nation alliance reaffirmed their
commitment to the air strikes on Yugoslavia, a campaign now
beginning its second month, snags began appearing in NATO's plan
for an international oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia, a major oil exporter,
would ignore the embargo, which he called illegal unless approved
by the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   And President Jacques Chirac of France balked at the prospect of
NATO sailors using force to board and inspect ships bound for
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To search is fine if the ship that you want to search allows
itself to be searched,'' Chirac said at a news conference, but
forcible boardings constitute war. ``We need to be very, very
careful and study all the aspects before we make a final
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. and allied pilots attacking Yugoslavia's oil supplies,
Clinton said, it makes no sense to permit NATO's foe from
resupplying itself through imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we justify risking the lives of the pilots to go up
and destroy the refinery and the supply capacity of Serbia,''
Clinton asked, ``and then say, 'But it's okay with us if people
want to continue to supply this nation and its outlaw actions in
Kosovo in another way?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not want the oil embargo to lead to fighting
on the high seas, ``but we have to be firm about it'' and willing
to use ``every reasonable means'' to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is the subject of a U.N. weapons embargo. The Clinton
administration maintains that oil meets the definition of
restricted items under that embargo, because Serb forces use oil to
power the tanks, trucks and aircraft used to wage repression
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NATO ordered its military commander, U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark, to put together a plan for enforcing an oil embargo
against Yugoslavia by searching tankers at sea and diverting any
that were found to be ferrying oil toward Yugoslav ports in the
state of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Any plan Clark prepares would have to go before NATO's political
wing, the North Atlantic Council, and would require unanimous
consent of all 19 member states before it could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   After 32 days of air strikes, NATO is grinding away at Serb
forces across Kosovo, but has been unable to drive them out of the
province.
</P>
<P>
   As it has become increasingly apparent that the campaign will
not end quickly, as NATO leaders had hoped, the alliance has come
to view oil as the Achilles heel of its opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without oil, the Yugoslav military machine will come to a
halt, and
</P>
<P>
   very quickly,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes have repeatedly bombed Yugoslavia's two oil
refineries, in Novi Sad and Pancevo, and now believe both are out
of business. Daily strikes on fuel storage and distribution areas,
as well as the roads and bridges needed to deliver fuel to forces
in the field, have stripped Yugoslavia's army of perhaps 70 percent
of its available fuel, said Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said Serb forces have been reduced to siphoning gasoline
from automobiles left inside Kosovo by fleeing ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are that desperate now to find fuel wherever they can,''
said Shea. ``They are critically dependent on trying to get oil
from outside sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders are scheduled to meet Sunday with delegates
from the states neighboring Yugoslavia for discussions centered on
how to help those countries with the political, economic and
military threats the conflict poses for them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is also working on a comprehensive plan to help bring
long-term stability to a region torn by a decade of ethnic
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a powerful set of magnets pulling the people
together,'' said Clinton, ``and those have to be economic, as well
as political, and security.''

SALMON'S TWO HOMERS DON'T ERASE MISTAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Try as he might, Tim Salmon couldn't carry
the Anaheim Angels on his back.
</P>
<P>
   His two home runs couldn't make up for the day shortstop Andy
Sheets had.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, filling in until the injured Gary DiSarcina returns
around the All-Star break, made a fourth-inning error that led to
two unearned runs and another miscue in the eighth that gave the
Kansas City Royals a 4-3 victory Saturday afternoon before 15,664
at Kauffman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, the Royals had the bases loaded
with one out in a 3-3 game when Mike Sweeney hit a sharp grounder
to the left of Sheets. Sheets fielded the ball cleanly, stepped on
second and threw to first.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of completing the inning-ending double play, the
ball was in the dirt and first baseman Darin Erstad couldn't come
up with it.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the play is not ruled an error because a double play
cannot be assumed. But the result was just as damaging. Rey Sanchez
scored from third to break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just (messed) it up, there's nothing else you can say,''
Sheets said. ``It just can't happen. Those plays have got to be
made.... You've got to put it behind you and go out and play
tomorrow. It helps to know you've got a chance to redeem
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins and a number of players consoled Sheets
after the game, including Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy in the clubhouse feels for him,'' Salmon said.
``We've all been there at some point. If you haven't made a mistake
like that you haven't been playing very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the last guy in the world you want to see that happen to.
He's a great fit _ his temperament, his personality, the way he
plays the game. He's about as good as you can get to fill in for
DiSarcina. He's a good guy, you hate to see things like that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets' official error came in the fourth inning when Sweeney
hit a line drive at him. But the ball whizzed over his head into
left field. The Royals turned it into two unearned runs against
Angels starter Steve Sparks (52/3 innings, two unearned runs, five
hits).
</P>
<P>
   What made the play difficult was that Sparks' pitch was a
knuckleball, and it remained a knuckleball after it was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came in a knuckleball and went out a knuckleball,'' Angels
catcher Matt Walbeck said. ``Right before it went into his glove _
boom, it took off. The last time I saw that was Justin Baughman.
Remember that?''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman was hit in the mouth and suffered a slight concussion
and laceration that required 60 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played very well,'' Collins said of Sheets. ``He just had
a bad inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started promisingly for the Angels. Sparks' knuckleball
was dancing according to Walbeck and Salmon continued to smoke the
ball in day games.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit a two-run homer off Royals starter Jeff Suppan in the
fourth inning for a 2-0 lead. In the sixth, his solo homer (No. 6)
broke a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   In three day games this season, Salmon is hitting .692 (9 for
13) with four homers and 14 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the ball really well today,'' Salmon said. ``That's when
the game is supposed to be played _ during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Sparks left with two out in the sixth, the Angels
bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine gave up a double to Sweeney in the seventh, and he
eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by Scott Leius to tie the
game. Two walks in the inning _ one allowed by Levine and the other
by Mike Holtz _ helped fuel the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hurt ourselves with the bases on balls,'' Collins said.
``We didn't let them swing the bat, and that's what hurt us. You
continue to open up opportunities, sooner or later they're going to
get a hit.''

<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 98-1, a bill that will give
states and school districts greater flexibility in how they spend
federal money. The so-called ``ed-flex'' legislation allows local
education authorities to apply for a waiver from regulations tied
to federal dollars. If a waiver is granted, a shcool district could
take the federal money it receives for one program and use it for
another program they deem more necessary. Supporters said the bill
reduces red tape and empowers local communities to decide what is
best for their schools. Only one senator spoke against the bill,
saying the measure does not require adequate accountability on the
part of the states and could undermine programs intended to provide
aid to disadvantaged students by diverting the money into general
programs. President Clinton said he will sign the legislation. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

KOSOVO NOW BELLWETHER AS WELL AS BATTLEFIELD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leaders of NATO tried to turn away from the war
in Kosovo and devote the second day of their summit meeting to the
lofty subjects for which they had gathered. But they could not
escape the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   As they approved a new strategic concept to redefine NATO's
role, which has been under study for several years, and debated
whether the U.N. Security Council should have a say in its actions,
Kosovo kept coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many allies _ probably just about every ally _ mentioned
Kosovo as kind of a metaphor for what the new NATO is supposed to
be all about,'' said a senior Clinton administration official,
briefing reporters during a break in the debate over the fine print
of the final communique.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said the official, the new NATO that would emerge in the
communique outlining its future missions was already being put to
the test in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But as a measure of the behind-the-scenes differences on whether
Kosovo is a test case for NATO's new phase, one of NATO's most
senior soldiers, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, said: ``Kosovo is
not a precedent for the strategic concept. NATO is not going to
become an alliance for intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day _ with the exception of lunch, where officials
said the conversation reverted to Kosovo _ was spent hammering out
language on an expansive role for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The new concept allows NATO to enter crises outside the
territory of the member states but still confines its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of communism has forced NATO to search for a new
role beyond that of a mutual defense pact. NATO essentially chose
the role of being a regional policeman on the watch against ethnic
wars, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, sought to dampen
criticism, saying: ``NATO is not a universal organization; NATO is
a territorial limited organization: its aim, commitment, engagement
is to what we call the Euro-Atlantic issue, the Euro-Atlantic
area.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there may be ``challenges that may arise from
outside the Euro-Atlantic area that may have an effect in the
Euro-Atlantic area,'' but that the main concern was the stability
of the region itself.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the communique and strategic concept documents
was delayed by objections by Turkey over alleged favoritism to
European Union countries within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, which would like to join the European Union, protested
that the European members would be allowed to carry out military
operations using NATO assets.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also tried to deal with NATO's relationship with the
United Nations. The documents noted the ``authority of the Security
Council and its primordial responsibility'' for peace and security
in the world. There was instant disagreement over what this meant.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France, a firm believer in the
mandate of the U.N. Security Council, told reporters that NATO
peacekeeping operations would require the Council's authorization.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO cannot and will not be able to act without the
authorization of this international organization,'' Chirac said.
The French have pushed for Security Council backing for any
military presence as part of a settlement with Yugoslavia over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate news conference, Solana, asked whether NATO would
need a Security Council resolution to intervene outside members'
territory, said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The war in Kosovo does not have a U.N. mandate on the ground,
diplomats have argued, that the intervention was taken to prevent a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have always expressed
reluctance about requiring a U.N.mandate, saying that China and
Russia should not be given a veto over NATO's work.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was pleased the new strategic concept
endorsed ``the actions such as those we are undertaking in
Kosovo,'' where there is no U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   If the summit meeting was not the gala that was originally
planned, convened as it was under the shadow of the Balkan
conflict, it was a celebration for the nations _ the Czech
Republic, Poland and Hungary _ who formally joined last month.
</P>
<P>
   They offered countries aspiring to join action plans under which
the alliance would measure progress on how countries _ like
Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia _ were advancing in meeting
requirements.

 &HT;    Community looks within for answers
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They are tucked among rolling slopes and
divided by small streams that trickle down from the Rocky Mountain
foothills _ thousands of homes built on wide, curving streets.
</P>
<P>
   Rising in clustered neighborhoods with names like Coventry and
Marina Pointe, wood-shingled homes have sprung up in place of horse
ranches that just 25 years ago dappled both sides of Wadsworth
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   It is the suburban result of Denver's growth _ massive bedroom
communities built behind miles of eight-foot fences that insulate
residents from the noise of high-speed six-lane roads.
</P>
<P>
   It is where some came to escape the crime of the big city, which
may be why Tuesday's slaughter at Columbine High School was so
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the middle of New York City, it's the middle of
suburban Jefferson County,'' said Amy Ericson, a 1986 graduate of
Columbine and mother of four.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities investigating the shooting rampage at
Columbine High School, the neighborhood is home to two young
killers _ trenchcoat-clad outcasts who plotted and hated for a year
before carrying out their plan. And while investigators piece
together the events that led to the tragedy, searching for an
answer that will soothe anguished residents, a community is
learning hard lessons about itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for people to feel a real sense of
community here in south JeffCo,'' said Don Marxhausen, a minister
at St. Phillip's Lutheran Church in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Problems like alcoholism and divorce didn't skip Denver's
suburbs, Marxhausen said. Residents need to recognize the pain in
their children, and the community must take responsibility for
finding a solution, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine shootings should jolt the community _ as well as
the nation _ into action, said a visibly shaken Dave Thomas,
Jefferson County's district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Influences on young people _ from video games to music to the
Internet _ must be examined for clues to what went wrong, he said.
Court probation programs _ like the one that both suspects
successfully completed under the supervision of Thomas' office _
must be re-examined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of this has to do with how we treat each other
and our respect for human life and human property,'' said Thomas,
whose two grown children graduated from Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Young people who live in the area must share responsibility for
fixing what went wrong at Columbine, several area students said.
Although the countless rows of tan and gray houses may look the
same, the children of south Jefferson County don't always match.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were tormented for years,'' said Andrew Mitchell, a
17-year-old Lakewood High School student visiting a makeshift
memorial near Columbine, of suspects Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
``After a while, it builds up and you explode _ this is how they
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell, dressed in black and sporting dyed black hair and
heavy boots, said only good can now come from the shootings, which
shined a spotlight on a subculture of students who dress in dark
clothes and call themselves ``Goths.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who had never paid attention to him before approached
and smiled and talked with Mitchell the day after the shootings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually proud of my high school for once in my life,''
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Other students said everyone was welcome at Columbine, and that
teasing is part of any high school experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets criticized at our school, it's just part of
life, you've got to deal with it,'' said Lindsey Mean, a
17-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   For Randy Lapp, whose son Justin escaped the library where most
of the dead were found, the shootings could mark a parental
failure.
</P>
<P>
   If Harris and Klebold had had more discipline at home, the
tragedy may have never happened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Lord put a little meat on their rear end for a
reason,'' Lapp said.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing candy and smoking pot was about as far afield from the
law as Columbine students ever got, said Daniel Ruiz, 17, a former
student.
</P>
<P>
   But psychological problems exist despite the affluence of many
students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous parents in this neighborhood, they're completely
oblivious of what we do,'' Ruiz said. ``They think they know but
they don't.''

   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 98-1, a bill that will give
states and school districts greater flexibility in how they spend
federal money. The so-called ``ed-flex'' legislation allows local
education authorities to apply for a waiver from regulations tied
to federal dollars. If a waiver is granted, a shcool district could
take the federal money it receives for one program and use it for
another program they deem more necessary. Supporters said the bill
reduces red tape and empowers local communities to decide what is
best for their schools. Only one senator spoke against the bill,
saying the measure does not require adequate accountability on the
part of the states and could undermine programs intended to provide
aid to disadvantaged students by diverting the money into general
programs. President Clinton said he will sign the legislation. A

ANALYSIS: YESTERDAY'S LEADERS NOW STAND IN THE SHADOWS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ History bestows its favors with an uneven hand. No
politician thinks otherwise. Yet it was poignant to see some of the
commanding figures in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
great triumph in the Cold War languishing in the shadows this
weekend as the alliance commemorated its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, the implacable foe of the ``evil empire,'' as he
called the Soviet Union, remained in seclusion on the other side of
the continent, his public career ended by Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl, who more than anyone else brought about the
reunification of Germany, came to Washington for the NATO summit,
and President Clinton on Thursday bestowed upon him the nation's
highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom. Kohl ranked among the
greatest leaders of the 20th century, the president said, along
with Churchill, Roosevelt and de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the official ceremonies got under way, it was of
course not the former chancellor who represented Germany but his
successor, Gerhard Schroeder, the man who denied Kohl another term
in a hard-fought election campaign last year. At the time, Kohl
said one of the worst things about his defeat was that it meant he
would not be in office for the NATO anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had my troubles in my time in office,'' he said
wistfully in his response to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lech Walesa, the shipyard organizer in Gdansk who helped to set
off the revolts against Soviet domination all across Eastern
Europe, came to Washington, too, as ``a guest of honor'' of the
Polish delegation.
</P>
<P>
   But he is a former president now. He was invited to meet with
the editorial staff of The Washington Times, where he said NATO's
policy toward Yugoslavia was ``too soft.'' The alliance, he said,
should use ``force serious enough to paralyze them.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographers sought him out, fascinated as ever by his
distinctive mustache, which is now almost white. One caught him
sitting almost alone, in a sea of empty chairs near the back of the
Mellon Auditorium, reading and waiting for Friday's commemorative
events to begin.
</P>
<P>
   And when they did begin, it was not the familiar Walesa who
spoke for Poland. Instead, it was the nation's current president,
Aleksander Kwasniewski, who spoke eloquently of membership in NATO
as ``a symbol of the definite end'' of three centuries of national
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign minister of the Soviet Union, Eduard Shevardnadze
applied perestroika to foreign policy, easing tensions between East
and West _ a major step toward NATO's bloodless victory in the Cold
War. But now he is the president of Georgia, a much smaller country
that is one of the NATO wannabee's, and not even near the head of
that list. So he came on a B-ticket and sat in a back row.
</P>
<P>
   He met with the Texans he had dealt with in the heady days a
decade ago _ former President George Bush and former Secretary of
State James Baker. But this time Baker and Shevardnadze talked
about Caspian Sea oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgian had his say on the Balkan crisis at a dinner on
Friday night at the Nixon Center, a foreign policy think tank,
strongly endorsing the NATO bombing against Yugoslavia. Otherwise,
he said, ``we would have encountered a catastrophe with ten times
the casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, making crystal-clear his differences with Moscow:
``There is no other way but to use force. This is the only way to
stop the ethnic cleansing and extreme separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Only President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic was on the
stage at the Mellon Auditorium and at the White House dinner to
represent the national leaders who played pivotal roles in the
unraveling of the Soviet Empire in the 1980s. And only he _ with
the obvious exceptions of Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France _ was at all
familiar to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So it remained for Havel, the playwright-politician who led the
``velvet revolution,'' to hark back to the Cold War. He told his
colleagues that the admission to NATO of nations that once belonged
to the Warsaw Pact, including his own, ``signifies the real and
definitive end of the imposed division of Europe and the world, the
real and definitive fall of the Iron Curtain, and the real and
definitive demise of the so-called Yalta agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But events, and NATO, have moved on to Kosovo, robbing the
summit meeting of much of its historical dimension. Weary of
yesterday, focused on today, CNN even cut away from Havel's speech
for a war report before he had finished.

 &HT;    Texans in poll back concealed handguns
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Just before last week's deadly school shooting
in Colorado, Texans surveyed for a new Texas Poll clearly affirmed
their support for the state's concealed-carry handgun law and
flatly rejected the idea of holding gun makers primarily
responsible for gun-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released today, showed that 53 percent of 1,003 Texans
questioned own some type of gun and 46 percent had taken some type
of gun training. Among gun owners, 64 percent had taken some
shooting instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey, conducted from March 31 to April 17, has a
margin of error of 3 percentage points and a slightly higher margin
of error for the subgroup of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners were more likely to support the state's 1995
concealed-carry handgun law; 73 percent of them said they support
allowing private citizens to carry concealed handguns with a
permit. Of all the people asked, 62 percent said they support such
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Senate recently approved a bill to prevent cities,
counties and other smaller government entities from suing gun
makers without lawmakers' permission for costs associated with
gun-related violence, including law enforcement expenses and
emergency care. The cities of Atlanta and New Orleans have filed
such lawsuits, modeled after successful litigation against tobacco
companies by numerous states, including Texas, seeking compensation
for smoking-related health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if cities and counties should be allowed to seek money
from gun makers because of costs associated with gun-related
violence, 23 percent of the 1,003 Texans said yes, 68 percent said
no and 9 percent weren't sure or declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Among gun owners, 13 percent said cities and counties should be
allowed to file such lawsuits, 79 percent said no and 8 percent
weren't sure or refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who they believe is most responsible for gun-related
violence, 94 percent of the full group said the criminal and 3
percent the gun manufacturer. Of gun owners, 98 percent said
criminals are most responsible for gun-related crimes and 1 percent
said gun manufacturers are most responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, of Texans Against Gun Violence, called those numbers
terrible. She added, though, that while the clear majority of
people wouldn't hold gun makers most responsible, there are valid
arguments that gun manufacturers have some responsibility for the
country's gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of anti-lawyer sentiment,'' she said,
adding that if some of the pending gun-related lawsuits are
successful, the number of people who would support lawsuits against
gun makers would increase.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Suzanna Gratia Hupp (R-Lampasas), said people are
simply smart enough to see the danger in allowing such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly believe in holding the criminal responsible for his
crime and not the maker of the tool he used,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hupp is the House sponsor of the bill to keep cities and local
government agencies from suing gun makers without lawmakers'
approval. She said lawsuits against gun makers for gun-related
violence would open the door for auto makers to be sued for
drunken-driving deaths and knife makers for stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are wise enough to see the incredibly
dangerous precedent it sets,'' Hupp said. The gun-lawsuit bill,
Senate Bill 717, has cleared the Senate and is awaiting action by
the full House.

SCHOOL SHOOTING (Phoenix) _ `The sleep of reason produces
monsters,'' observed the Spanish painter Francisco de Goya. The
monsters who slaughtered more than a dozen classmates and teachers
in Littleton, Colo., were the products of a culture in which reason
has been comatose for a very long time. The killers were raised in
a society in which rules and standards are in such constant flux as
to be non-existent. Morals are a matter of spin, values a matter of
choice, and violence is glorified in movies and music. Yet we read
things such as this in a news story: ``Authorities may never know
what sent two young men on a shooting spree at Columbine High
School.'' Maybe authorities will never know. But you do. By KENNETH
LAFAVE. Story will move in the ``K'' category. &QL;

RUSSIA, THE NATION THAT ISN'T THERE, LOOMS LARGER FOR ALLIES AT THE
SUMMIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton demonstrated on Saturday just how
delicate American and Russian relations are: He encouraged Russia
to act as a mediator in the Kosovo conflict, even as he backed
NATO's determination to choke off oil supplies to Yugoslavia _ a
move that could stoke a confrontation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been absent from the NATO summit meeting here,
boycotting the gathering because it profoundly objects to the NATO
bombing of its Slavic cousins in Serbia. But the allies are turning
to Russia to help broker a peace with the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, and would welcome the contribution of Russian
troops to any international security force that might move in to
protect Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at a news conference Saturday that while Russia's
first attempt this past week to negotiate a peace fell short,
``nevertheless we welcome Russia's efforts and hope they will
continue and ultimately result in Serb agreement to our
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO is keeping its lines of communication with Russia open.
Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign minister, plans to travel to
Moscow on Monday or Tuesday as a go-between between the allies and
Russia. ``Obviously we want Russia to be part of the solution,''
Art Eggleton, the Canadian defense minister, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also said NATO was bent on blocking shipments of
oil, which comes primarily from Russia, from reaching Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want this campaign to succeed with economic and
political pressure and with the air action, then we have to take
every reasonable means to give it a chance to succeed,'' the
president said. ``And that's what we intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration spent the last month encouraging
Russia to come to the summit meeting, but officials said privately
Saturday that perhaps it was just as well that Russia refused.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk Friday that President Boris Yeltsin's
special envoy to Belgrade, former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, might show up here after his nine hours of talks with
Milosevic in Belgrade. But with Milosevic failing to agree to NATO
demands, there was no move for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, NATO officials did not want Chernomyrdin to come,
fearing that a hint of compromise by Milosevic could undermine
NATO's resolve, reiterated here Saturday, to continue the bombing.
``The next time he gets in touch,'' Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman,
said of Chernomyrdin, ``it must be a much more substantial offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Moscow described relations between Russia
and the alliance as ``frozen,'' a term deliberately chosen for its
evocation of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has said Russia has no intention of being drawn into the
Kosovo conflict, but it has not condemned Milosevic's campaign of
ejecting Kosovo Albanians. Russia was the only nation to vote in
Geneva on Friday against a U.N. resolution condemning ``horrendous
and ongoing war crimes'' against Albanians by Serbian forces in
Kosovo. Negotiations between the United States and Russia over the
reduction in long-range nuclear missiles have long been stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take some time to unfreeze what has been frozen,'' an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``The institutional relationship and the political
relationship that Russia has developed with NATO since the end of
the cold war is in the interest of both parties, and we believe it
should be nourished and continued. Hopefully this is a temporary
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians can hardly forget, though, that the alliance was built
to protect the West from their Soviet-era armed forces. And the
recent expansion of the alliance _ to include three former Soviet
allies _ has infuriated Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Sonnenfeldt, an analyst at the Brookings Institution,
said of the Russians, ``They are angry, and all their grievances
and their sense of humiliation are being acted out in this rather
vituperative public rhetoric and military threats.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration halted an effort at
negotiation by a Republican congressman with longstanding ties to
Russia. The congressman, Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, was contacted
two weeks ago by Vladimir Ryzhkov, deputy speaker of the Russian
Parliament, and the two were laying the groundwork for a joint
mission to Belgrade to meet with Milosevic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Weldon said he dropped the idea after meeting for 90 minutes
Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who Weldon
said expressed concern that Milosevic would seek to manipulate
their visit for propaganda value. ``This was a good faith effort on
the part of Russia, and this administration blew it,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official acknowledged that the White House
opposed any diplomatic efforts by members of Congress during the
air war, especially now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the nature of the summit this weekend, this was not the
right time for this type of mission,'' he said. ``We prefer to
continue to intensify the air campaign.''

GUNMAN KEPT DIARY OUTLINING PLANS TO DESTROY SCHOOL, SHERIFF SAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ One of the gunmen in the Columbine High
School massacre kept a diary outlining in meticulous detail his
plans to destroy the school and kill as many students as he could,
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first entry in the diary was made April 19, 1998, and the
last notation was entered Tuesday, the day of the attack. Stone
said the diary contained frequent neo-Nazi and German references
and specified the attack would be carried out on the April 20
anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were after a big kill. They were going for a big kill,''
Stone said. ``It also talked about how they wanted to burn the
school down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to do as much damage as they could, destroy the
school and destroy as many students as they could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The diary also offered a prophetic declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expected to die,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, dressed in black trench
coats and ski masks, entered Columbine High at 11:15 a.m. Tuesday
with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, shotguns and handmade
bombs. They killed 12 students and a teacher before taking their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 explosive devices were found inside the school and
in or underneath cars in the school parking lot. The bombs ranged
in size from small carbon dioxide canisters wrapped with BBs to a
20-pound propane tank bomb found in the cafeteria kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 10 students were found in the library. Two were
found outside the school. The teacher, Dave Sanders, died in a
classroom where he was taken by students after he was wounded. He
died as SWAT officers worked to secure the school.
</P>
<P>
   According to autopsy reports, all 12 students and Sanders died
from gunshot wounds and the two gunmen died from self-inflicted
gunshot wounds. Another 23 students were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the diary stated how the two were different from
their peers and described their hatred for ``jocks, because they're
always putting us down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were targeting these people because they felt they were
different,'' the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the diary outlined their plan in detail, including
notations on how to build the bombs, how many would be needed and
how they would get the guns needed to execute their massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Other details included hand signals they would give each other
during the attack, where the lighting was bad in the school, places
to hide and how many students would be in the cafeteria. He said
the two had a map of the campus with notations on how they would
carry out the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been on their mind. They've been planning this thing
for a considerable amount of time,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   The two had planned the attack for 11:15 a.m., because they
believed the cafeteria would be full. The diary stated it would be
the time for them to ``rock and roll,'' Stone said. About 900 of
the 1,900 students attending the school were in the cafeteria when
the attackers burst in.
</P>
<P>
   Stone declined to say who kept the diary or from which
teen-ager's home it was seized. Authorities searched the homes of
both. Stone said, however, that he was amazed that Harris' parents
were supposedly oblivious to their son's activities. He said a
sawed-off shotgun seized from Harris' bedroom was found on a
dresser and Nazi propaganda was displayed openly in his room.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to say if the diary mentioned the names of
others involved in the planning or listed members of their social
group, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' He said the diary listed e-mail
addresses that were being checked.
</P>
<P>
   Though no other suspects have been arrested in connection with
the attack, Stone said he firmly believes others were involved,
either in the planning or its execution, primarily because of the
size of the arsenal the two had in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the 30 bombs, the two had a semi-automatic carbine, a
TEC-9 semi-automatic pistol, a pump shotgun, a double-barreled
shotgun and a large amount of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to go into a room blazing, carrying all
these devices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a tape released Friday of two 911 calls from the school on
the day of the shooting has a caller referring to a suspect wearing
a white T-shirt, giving credence to the possibility of a third
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Davis, Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman, said one
of the dead gunmen was found without his trench coat, clad in a
white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the students did say there were three people,'' Davis
said. ``We've been looking for three people but so far we've only
been able to find two.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 investigators have collected more than 2,000
pieces of evidence and interviewed more than 500 people in the
investigation, which is expected to take weeks to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be totally reconstructing this,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police discounted an anonymous e-mail sent to the
sheriff's office Friday that blamed the shooting on parents,
teachers and the students who tormented the two shooters. The
e-mail also threatened a second attack on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   The note, as reprinted by the Rocky Mountain News, read, ``By
now, it's over. If you are reading this, my mission is complete. I
have finished revolutionizing the neoeuphoric infliction of my
internal terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children who have ridiculed me, who have chosen not to
accept me, who have treated me like I am not worth their time are
dead. THEY ARE (expletive) DEAD.''
</P>
<P>
   The note ends with, ``You may think the horror ends with the
bullet in my head, but you wouldn't be so lucky. All that I can
leave you with to decipher what more extensive death is to come is
`12Skizto.' You have until April 26th. Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the coded message referred to a song titled 12, by
the band Insane Clown Posse. He said it is doubtful the note was
written by Harris or Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we have little reason to believe that either one
of our suspects sent that note or authored it,'' Davis said.

 &HT;    `Please comfort this town'
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Lynda Pasma and Kerry Herurlin stopped
halfway down Mt. Columbine on Saturday morning to pray.
</P>
<P>
   The women, both mothers of two young children, bowed their
heads, closed their eyes and whispered, ``Oh, God please bless the
families who lost children,'' and they began to cry. ``Please
comfort them and be with them,
</P>
<P>
   and comfort the people of this town. Please comfort this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton needs comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning 12 Columbine High School students and a teacher
were murdered when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, also Columbine
students, opened fire with at least four guns and dozens of bombs.
The gunmen died in the massacre as well, apparently from
self-inflicted gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton needs comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Many looked for it Saturday morning on top of Mt. Columbine, a
hill in Clement Park that borders the high school's baseball
fields. The first few visitors climbed over slushy snow that melted
quickly as the sun finally made an appearance after three days of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, the snow became thick mud and as many as
100 visitors at a time came to the top of the hill to look at the
rough wood cross that had been staked into the ground there. They
bent to leave flowers, poems, balloons and other mementos of grief
at the base of the cross, then stood to gaze at the familiar town
that seemed to look different after such a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Littleton is visible from the top of Mt. Columbine _ the
rows of roofs, the sidewalks, the strip malls and trash cans, the
basketball backstops above garage doors. Physically, it's the same
town it was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 of its own are gone, and the loss resonates deeply and
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Many wonder what to do now. How do people experiencing grief and
anger and confusion and intense sadness navigate the unfamiliar
paths to peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Debbie Ellwanger, a 10-year Littleton
resident. ``Nobody knows where to go from here. I think we have to
learn from this and not let those kids die in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Larry, trekked through the dirty snow up
Mt. Columbine on Saturday, fingers laced together as they cried for
the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't have died,'' Larry Ellwanger said. His wife
nodded: No, they shouldn't have died.
</P>
<P>
   So they came to the wood cross on top of Mt. Columbine to try
making sense of something that never will. Below the hill, in the
middle of the baseball field, someone had built 13 small snowmen in
an even circle. Some cannot forgive Klebold and Harris, and
possibly never will.
</P>
<P>
   On top of Mt. Columbine, though, people thought more about
healing and pulling together and getting through.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is come together,'' said Carrie Goertz, 16.
``It's just something that all the barriers have been broken and
people have to accept and take care of each other. There's always
going to be differences between
</P>
<P>
   people, but we've got to look past that, the exterior stuff, and
just be together, be unified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've got to take advantage of our time with our family
and friends,'' Aimee Jensen, 18, added quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy at Columbine has brought unity that for now is
unbreakable _ it has reached around the world and drawn in the
thoughts and prayers of people far removed from suburban Colorado.
The memorials in Clement Park testify to the depth of grief that
those who didn't lose loved ones in the massacre feel.
</P>
<P>
   They bring cards and flowers, donate food and building
materials, thinking about how impossibly sad it is when people _
particularly children _ die without reason, about what they would
have done if it had happened to someone they love, about the people
suffering most.
</P>
<P>
   One card written by a boy named Mark hung on a larger memorial
sign and said: ``Dear Columbine, I hope you feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy has forced huge issues to an overburdened spotlight:
guns, youth violence, school safety, cliques and disaffected youth,
community togetherness, peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully they are issues that will not be forgotten when time
passes. But for now, for the next several weeks, people seem able
only to get through the worst of it, to handle the realization that
some people are not coming
</P>
<P>
   back and that yes, things like this do happen here.
</P>
<P>
   And that somehow, life keeps moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the strange things,'' said Aaron Burningham, 27,
looking out across Littleton from the top of Mt. Columbine. ``It
seems like life should stop, but it doesn't.''

REFUGEES SAY KILLINGS AND RAPES BY PARAMILITARY UNITS ARE FUELING
THE EXODUS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Serbian paramilitaries reportedly rampaged
through two ethnic Albanian villages in central Kosovo last Sunday,
killing as many as 40 people, including four or five young women
who were raped and then executed, refugees arriving here said on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said their accounts were based on talks with
survivors. One man, Sali, said he ventured into one of the villages
a day after the killings from his neighboring settlement, heard
that some of his relatives had perished and was taken to a swath of
freshly dug earth measuring about 10 feet by 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the grave after they buried them,'' he said, refusing to
give his last name as he sobbed. ``Four of my uncles are in that
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Sali and other refugees said they had been told that
paramilitaries had forced local Gypsies to collect the bodies of
those shot by Serbs and to bury them in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   None of the accounts of the refugees could be independently
confirmed. But three men gave independent and similar accounts of
the reported attacks on Sunday in the two villages west of Lipljan,
which they called Ribar i Vogel and Rufc i Ri. Officials from the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said four to five refugees also
described the attack to them.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving here have consistently reported that
paramilitary units have been responsible for some of the most
vicious attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving Saturday said that the attack on Sunday was
part of an offensive that began on April 14. They said that 14
Albanian villages were fully or partly burned in just a day around
the town of Lipljan.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees from other parts of Kosovo have flooded
into the area, they added.
</P>
<P>
   A pediatrician who was among the 2,200 ethnic Albanians who
arrived here Saturday said that pneumonia, diarrhea, bronchitis and
other infectious diseases are spreading. He and other refugees
urgently called for food to be air dropped to people trapped in the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   Fatmir Tixhaj, 23, said Serb border guards blocked him from
leaving Kosovo during five previous attempts to flee. He also said
fights often erupt among panicked people trying to board the one
train out of southeastern Kosovo to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks like the one last Sunday are fueling the exodus,
refugees said. Sali and another villager who would not give his
name said the Serbian police chief from Lipljan visited Ribar i
Vogel the night before the reported attack took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the villagers, `There are paramilitaries coming here
tomorrow,''' Sali recounted. ```They are not under our control.
They will rob you and take your cars. Give them what they want
because they won't kill you.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 the following morning, the refugees said, two dozen
heavily armed paramilitaries wearing black ski masks reportedly
entered the village in vehicles without license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors told the refugees who were interviewed Saturday that
the armed men moved from house to house, forcing the village's
occupants to gather on its main street. There, they were divided
into three groups _ women and the elderly, men of fighting age, and
Gypsies, the refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 men were taken to a nearby field, according to the
refugees. One of them, the brother of a prominent local businessman
reportedly killed by Serbs on the day NATO air strikes began,
turned over $5,000 in cash seconds before the paramilitaries opened
fire, killing 16 men, the refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said local villagers told them that paramilitaries
had also killed two elderly adults in their homes, then raped and
murdered four or five local women. They then burned Ribar i Vogel,
and moved on to the nearby village of Rufc i Ri. The refugees said
they had heard from residents of that village that some two dozen
villagers were killed there.
</P>
<P>
   Sali and the two other local men gave slightly different figures
for the total number killed in the villages. But all gave detailed
accounts of a group execution in the first village, four to five
women being raped and murdered, and a later attack on the second
village.

TWO GUNMEN CALLED `EXCELLENT EMPLOYEES' BY PIZZA SHOP MANAGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   By LISA TEACHEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Despite the revelation Saturday that two
teen-age gunmen plotted for at least a year to massacre students at
their high school, a pizza place co-worker described a very
different public side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good kids as far as we knew,'' said a manager of a
local pizza delivery restaurant where Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, worked part time as cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew these kids as people, not the monsters that everybody
is calling them,'' said the co-manager of Blackjack Pizza, who
would only identify himself as Jason.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold worked after school about five days a week at
one of the pizza chain's stores just a few blocks from suburban
Columbine High School, southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve students and a teacher were killed and 23 others wounded
Tuesday when Harris and Klebold stormed the school with guns and
homemade bombs. The teens committed suicide inside the school after
their deadly rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County authorities on Saturday said they had found a
diary belonging to one of the boys. Entries in the diary suggest
the pair developed their plot for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The teens belonged to a clique called the ``Trenchcoat Mafia''
after the style of long black coats the members wore.
</P>
<P>
   The pizza manager said Harris and Klebold sometimes wore their
coats to work but their fashion statement was never taken as a
symbol of violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had mentioned they were part of a group that wore the
coats,'' Jason said. ``It just sounded like a regular group of kids
to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff on the news about them being loners, that's not
true,'' Jason said. ``They had other friends. They were fairly
outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a former member of the group recently told a national
television audience that Harris' life was ``pretty much in
shambles'' in part because he recently lost his job, Jason said
both boys worked the Friday before the shooting but had been given
the weekend off to attend the school's prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way would we fire them. They weren't even close to being
reprimanded,'' Jason said. ``They were excellent employees. Two of
our best workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason said they were always on time, never called in sick and
always wore their uniforms. Each was usually scheduled to work five
days a week after school but at least one day a week one was off
while the other worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were here more than they were not, except when they had
to be at school,'' Jason said. ``They were good at their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In their private lives, Harris was apparently fascinated with
Adolf Hitler. It also has been reported the pair would salute like
Nazis and shout ``Heil Hitler'' after a good score during bowling
classes. But friends have said Klebold, whose grandfather built a
Jewish community center in Ohio, was less racist than Harris.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the teens ever made racist comments at work, Jason
said, ``I would rather not comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris maintained a Web site on the Internet with
detailed instructions for making bombs from easily obtained items,
Jason said he could not recall the teens talking at work about guns
or bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no signs this was going to happen,'' Jason said.
``He (Harris) just seemed like an intelligent boy. He had his
moments of being quiet and moments of being hyper just like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pizza restaurant's part-time workers are students at
Columbine High School and knew the gunmen and their victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been kind of short-staffed around here since this
happened, but our corporation has been very good to us about it,''
Jason said. ``We feel for all the families and kids. It's just
major grief here.''

2,500 ATTEND FUNERAL OF TEEN EULOGIZED AS WRITER, CHURCHGOER

LITTLETON, Colo. _ They prayed for divine intervention to ``take
out of us our hatred ... our anger.''
</P>
<P>
   They held hands and sang Amazing Grace.
</P>
<P>
   With sobs and impassioned words, they remembered a young friend
and relative and then laid her to rest in a white wood casket
signed with messages of love.
</P>
<P>
   This was the weekend that Littleton began to bury its dead. At
Trinity Christian Center on Saturday, nearly 2,500 mourners said
goodbye to 17-year-old Rachel Scott. They and the ministers who
officiated searched, as they have all week, for a meaning and a
redemption in Tuesday's massacre at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was one of 13 people _ 12 students and a teacher _ killed
when two Columbine students, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,
17, terrorized the school for four hours with guns and bombs. The
two then killed themselves in the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tragedy has shaken every one of us to the very core of
our being,'' said the Rev. Bruce Porter. ``We are all in a state of
shock. But, it's vitally important that we ask ourselves some hard
questions. What has happened to us as a people that this would
happen to us? What has happened to us? How did we get here?''
</P>
<P>
   After consoling the gathering with scriptures, Porter offered
his thoughts on what has gone awry in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the 10 commandments from our schools and wreaked
murder and violence and hatred,'' he said.

<P>
   Rachel Scott was eulogized Saturday partly as an aspiring writer
and thespian, but mostly as a devout churchgoer who ``accepted
everyone'' and spread her own gospel through her circle of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She taught me the value of life,'' one friend said. ``She
taught me to love every second you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made me feel like the most important person in the
world,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was like one big amusement park to Rachel,'' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made people laugh. She wrote poetry and she cared so much
about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her classmates stood in the aisles and tearfully
embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the closed coffin, Porter told the high school
students in the gathering: ``Don't despair of life. Don't despair
of what has happened to you. The torch has fallen from Rachel's
hand. Who will pick it up again?''
</P>
<P>
   Adults had failed them, he told the students. Politicians had
failed them and the police had failed them. But, he said, they
could succeed where other had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pick up the torch. You have the power, young people.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the theme of memorial services held in Littleton
in the past few days, a resolve to give meaning to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As the town has emerged from its initial shock, it has searched,
sometimes awkwardly, always painfully, for its next step.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the day Scott's classmate, John Tomlin, was
memorialized before his body was transported to Wisconsin for
burial, District Attorney Dave Thomas appeared before reporters and
asked for their help in finding that next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some meaning in this,'' he said, frustrated by
the absence of answers. ``These deaths cannot be in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   During Scott's funeral, a friend, Mike Tatu, sang a song he
wrote for her after her death. ``Why did you have to leave?'' it
asked.
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that will be at the forefront of Littleton's
thoughts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The town still has 13 more funerals to face.

KOSOVO CONFLICT FORCES NATO TO DELAY, DILUTE KEY DISCUSSIONS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO leaders' focus on Kosovo has been both a
reason and an excuse for diluted attention to key issues in the
alliance's future, including further expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on the fight in the Balkans, however, also has
given unexpected emphasis to the growing importance the West
attaches to human rights _ even at the expense of national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we are moving into a system of international
relations in which human rights ... are much more important, and
more important even than sovereignty rights,'' NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Solana and other NATO leaders, including President Clinton, are
finding that the public in Western Europe and North America are
responding more positively to the fight against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic when it is expressed in terms of his campaign
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo rather than in more traditional
terms of national or regional interests.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit ends today after meetings intended to
illustrate NATO's outreach to central and Eastern European nations.
Leaders of the 19 NATO member nations will meet with
representatives of all but one of the 24 additional nations in the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Russia is boycotting the summit
because it opposes NATO's air attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO leaders also will hold a special session with seven of
Yugoslavia's neighbors, looking ahead to programs that will help
the region rebuild after the fighting in Kosovo has ended, Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will develop the initiative mainly in three areas _
security, economics and democracy-building _ that will be no doubt
crucial to the integration'' of the southeastern Europe, Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders Saturday adopted the alliance's first new
``strategic concept'' policy since 1991, when the Soviet Union was
collapsing. The Balkan conflict has dampened enthusiasm of some
NATO nations for making the new plan any more robust or covering
any more territory than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said the latest outline emphasizes ``new challenges such
as regional conflicts, weapons of mass destruction, nuclear
proliferation and transnational threats such as terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general called the new plan ``a road map to help
us navigate through the challenges that await us in the next
half-century. It also marks the transition from an alliance that
was concerned mainly with collective defense to one that will be a
guarantee of security in Europe and upholder of democratic values
both within and beyond our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing the need to respond to ``out of area''
conflicts such as in Kosovo, the plan does not take in the
unlimited horizon that the Clinton administration was proposing.
The most immediate effect is likely to be that NATO will not have a
direct, automatic role in conflicts in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the geographical extent,'' Solana said, ``as you
know, NATO is not a universal organization. NATO is a territorially
limited organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its aim, its commitment, its engagement is to what we call the
Euro-Atlantic area. And we are prepared to cooperate to the
security and the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area,'' Solana
said.
</P>
<P>
   As at almost any international meeting, there was jockeying to
get in diplomatic verbiage which can mean different things to
different people _ or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new NATO points stresses the ``primary
responsibility'' of the U.N. Security Council for world peace,
without giving that often-contentious body power to block NATO
action.
</P>
<P>
   Solana rejected the suggestion that the wording, reportedly
advanced by France, meant that the Security Council _ where Russia
and China are among the five nations with veto power _ would have
to approve any future NATO military operation.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustration of the varying interpretations, French
President Jacques Chirac said NATO ``cannot and will not act
without the acquiescence'' of the United Nations, while Dutch Prime
Minister Wim Kok said NATO action will be ``based on the general
principles of the U.N. charter.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Solana stressed that NATO wanted to
``strengthen our partnership'' with the absent Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders did not address substantively the NATO issue that
most upsets Russia, further expansion into former Soviet-bloc
territory. No timetable was adopted for a second round of
admissions from the old Eastern Bloc _ home to all nine candidate
nations: Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   For some current NATO nations not yet ready for another
expansion round, the attention the summit had to give to the
Yugoslav conflict was a plausible excuse for delaying the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is committed to keeping its door open,'' Solana insisted.
The recent addition of Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to NATO
``will not be the last. I'd like to emphasize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said NATO is working with applicant nations ``day by day,
with a very specific plan ..., so the moment when they are prepared
to be NATO members will not be a dramatic moment, it will be a
natural moment.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders also moved toward approving a plan under which
alliance forces could be split off and operate for a time wholly as
a European Union entity, on the assumption that there could be
small dust-ups on the continent that the United States would not be
interested in policing.
</P>
<P>
   Final agreement on the section was held up by objections from
Turkey which, over its continuing objections, is not a member of
the EU.

SUNS-MAVS RIVALRY NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT, BUT GREAT TO LISTEN TO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not the Lakers-Celtics, or even Bulls-Knicks,
but what was once one of the most cordial relationships in the West
has turned into a petty, sniping rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It all started April 16, when Dallas coach Don Nelson became
upset that Phoenix coach Danny Ainge did not provide his starting
lineup until seconds before pregame introductions at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   When the two coaches met to shake hands before Tuesday's game in
Dallas, ``He told me he'd never give me his lineup again,'' Ainge
said. ``He had a few choice words for me. I told him I never asked
for his lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Nellie wasn't any happier after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the second time he's done that to me, and it's
unprofessional,'' Nelson said. ``He's the only guy in the league
that has ever done that to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home team is supposed to submit their lineup first, and
it's dishonest to do it the way he's been doing it. It's an
unwritten code that all coaches go by, but he doesn't believe in
it, evidently.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's tirade is surprising because his son, Donn, was an
Ainge assistant in Phoenix before becoming an assistant at Dallas.
Ainge has never announced any changes in his starting lineup until
right before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's Gregg Popovich told Ainge last season he didn't
like the tactic. Ainge argues the rules do not require a lineup
notification in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Don is trying to use it as a way to motivate his team
and to divert attention to other Mavs-Suns stories that keep coming
up,'' said Ainge, referring to the first-round draft pick Dallas
traded to the Suns last season.
</P>
<P>
   That pick may end up being a lottery choice, and all the Suns
gave up was the disappointing Steve Nash. Plus, the trade in 1996
that brought Jason Kidd to Phoenix remains a slap in the face to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good tactic, actually,'' Ainge said. ``I'd be
embarrassed to admit somebody else's starting lineup bothered me.
I'll put my ethics up against Don Nelson's ethics any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Call them Knickerbonkers: Eight games to go, the trade deadline
long past and the Knicks are barely a .500 team this late in the
season for the first time since they finished 39-43 in 1990-91. So
the Knicks fire GM Ernie Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   He was going to go anyhow, but the guy who's temporarily
replacing him, Madison Square Garden president and CEO David
Checketts, said there was too much disagreement in the
organization, everyone wasn't on the same page, and the team needed
to make a playoff push.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Ernie and head coach Jeff Van Gundy weren't getting
along.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts never said so in so many words, Van Gundy denied it,
and Grunfeld is in Germany this weekend scouting the European final
four in his new job as a ``special consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's quite clear that was a big reason for this change.
Here's Checketts on that subject:
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization was not on the same page in a lot of
categories and I felt if we were going to make the playoffs, we all
need to be on the same page. I'm not making the guy a scapegoat for
the mistakes I have made. But I was not going to accept any more
division, people having different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I will say that the organization has not functioned well
together. Everybody is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether this saves Van Gundy's job, Checketts said,
``This is not a show of confidence in anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad week: The Bulls score 49 points in a game, and Michael
Jordan does not call Ron Harper. Harper gets cut above his eye,
requiring six stitches, and no call. But then Harper got his nose
broken by Shawn Kemp and Harper hears not only from Jordan but from
Scottie Pippen as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie said, `You got pounded,''' said Harper. ``And M.J.
said `You got cut above the eye, you got your nose torn up, you
score 49 points, you are getting some rough treatment.' He killed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie camp: The Nike Desert Classic in Phoenix raised the stock
of some players. Pepperdine guard Jelani Gardner could actually be
drafted with his performance, and Cal center Francisco Elson is
projected to go near the bottom of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Two small forwards _ James Posey of Xavier and Quincy Lewis of
Minnesota _ also could be mid-first-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers reunion: One of the surprise visitors in Phoenix was
former Lakers coach Del Harris, who found his way over to Lakers
executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak. The trio shook hands and
talked without apparent strained feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Euroball: Remember Kinder Bologna, the team Clippers center
Michael Olowokandi played for earlier this year? Well, they
advanced to the EuroLeague finals this weekend, losing in the
championship to Zalgiris Kaunas of Lithuania. They could have
clinched a berth in the 1999 McDonald's Championship in Munich,
Germany, a tournament that will feature this year's NBA champion.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's players didn't exactly miss a chance to run into
Olowokandi in Munich.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO began its second month of bombing against
Yugoslavia Saturday with new strikes against military targets that
disrupted civilian electrical and water supplies, as the alliance's
leaders took steps to expand the war effort, including an agreement
to use air bases in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting here to commemorate the alliance's 50th anniversary,
NATO's leaders vowed to sharpen pressure on Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to end his campaign against Albanians in
Kosovo. The prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, disclosed
Saturday that his country had agreed to allow NATO war planes to
operate from all three of its military airfields.
</P>
<P>
   With the supreme commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark,
requesting 400 more aircraft for intensified strikes, the assent by
Hungary gives the alliance the ability to attack with more
firepower from more approaches nearby. Hungary, one of the
alliance's three new members, is the only NATO country to share a
border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening its war effort on another level, NATO leaders agreed
on Friday to impose an oil embargo enforced by NATO warships plying
the Adriatic Sea. Although details of that blockade must still be
worked out, the Pentagon said Saturday that allied warships would
search tankers and divert those found to be carrying oil to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said the allied ships would fire on any
vessels that defied the blockade, first as a warning and then to
disable, if not sink, violators. While NATO already has a
considerable armada in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, it could take
a week to organize a blockade.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, appearing at the summit conference after a
second day of meetings with leaders of NATO's 18 other members,
defended the gambit, even though some allies, including France, had
expressed reservations about its legality. ``If we want this
campaign to succeed with economic and political pressure and with
the air action, then we have to take every reasonable means to give
it the chance to succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's latest step brought a new denunciation from Russia, which
has strongly opposed the raids on Yugoslavia. Russian officials
vowed to continue shipping oil to Yugoslavia's ports on the
Adriatic coast, raising the prospect of confrontations at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blockade is bad,'' Russia's special envoy to Yugoslavia,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, said Saturday in Moscow. ``The problem in
Kosovo can be solved neither by bombing nor by a blockade.''
</P>
<P>
   The second day of NATO's summit meeting shifted to a discussion
of the alliance's long-range strategies, including how NATO can use
its collective resources to slow the spread of nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons. But the air war in the Balkans loomed over
the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In opening remarks Saturday morning, Clinton urged his
colleagues to remember the three American soldiers who have been
held as prisoners of war in Yugoslavia since they were captured
along the Macedonian border on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross announced Saturday
that its director, Cornelio Sommaruga, would meet with Milosevic in
Belgrade on Monday to discuss the fate of the three Americans and
the plight of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton derided Yugoslavia's refusal to allow
the Red Cross to visit the prisoners, as explicitly required by the
Geneva Convention of 1949, despite Milosevic's pledge in a
television interview this past week. The Red Cross's spokeswoman in
Geneva, Amanda Williamson, said, ``We will be reminding the
Yugoslav authorities of their responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   After cloudy weather limited NATO's air strikes overnight on
Friday, allied missiles and aircraft carried out attacks Saturday
night in Novi Sad and Nis, Yugoslavia's second and third-largest
cities after Belgrade. The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported an
intense barrage of 26 missiles during a half hour in Nis. The
agency said the railway, water mains, an office building and an
industrial complex had all been hit.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said the strikes in Nis had focused
on the airfield and the barracks of the Third Army, the force
leading the offensive against Albanians in Kosovo. They reported
attacks on the oil refinery in Novi Sad, which has been hit before,
as well as an oil storage installation, two other airfields, still
more radar sites and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   As the bombings continue, they are starting to take a toll on
Yugoslavia's civilian society. Strikes on electrical grids have
caused outages. Water pressure has become erratic in some cities.
In many cases, water mains are carried on the bridges that NATO has
been knocking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, of course, also an aspect of civilian
inconvenience,'' NATO's spokesman, Jamie Shea, said Saturday. ``I
acknowledge that, but it's not our intention _ I want to make this
clear _ to in any way render the life of Serbs even more difficult
than it already is. Our intention is simply to target the military
power apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's state television network, whose studios in Belgrade
were struck early on Friday, went off the air again early Saturday
and did not resume for five hours. There was no immediate
explanation for the disruption, but NATO struck radio and
television relay towers at Kragujevac and Novi Sad overnight. Shea
openly threatened to hit state television again and again until it
was knocked off the air.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Sunday morning, air strikes cut state television's
satellite transmissions and seriously affected reception in
Belgrade, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The network is among a new category of targets that Clark has
received permission to strike, but the strikes have caused deep
misgivings among some allies.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, said Saturday that he
had not known about the attack in advance and did not support it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton distanced himself somewhat from the military
decision to strike at the television studio headquarters, saying
NATO's commanders considered the television network ``an essential
instrument of Mr. Milosevic's command and control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in a conventional sense therefore a media outlet,''
he said. ``That was a decision they made, and I did not reverse
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite misgivings, NATO's allies appeared unified at the summit
meeting, which was marked by the alliance's determination to
intensify the campaign, now in its 32nd day. Clinton appealed again
for patience, noting that the United States and its allies bombed
Iraq's forces for 44 days in the prelude to the Persian Gulf war in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that this air campaign has been going on for a
particularly long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the campaign expanding to around-the-clock bombings and
hundreds of aircraft overcrowding Italy's skies, Hungary's
willingness to open its airfields became critical.
</P>
<P>
   For Hungary, the conflict with Yugoslavia has proved
particularly troubling. Its leaders have expressed fear that a more
active role could put at risk some 300,000 ethnic Hungarians living
in Vojvodina, another Serbian province whose autonomy was stripped
along with Kosovo's in 1989. ``It's extremely complicated for
Hungary,'' Orban said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While sympathetic, NATO officials told Hungary that as a NATO
ally it now had an obligation to open up the bases, according to a
senior NATO official. Many of the 300 additional American warplanes
are expected eventually to end up in Hungary, where NATO officers
are already assessing bases in Taszar, Kecskemet and Papa.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic, another new member, also has offered its
bases, according to a spokesman for President Vaclav Havel, but
they are less crucial to NATO's plans. NATO also received
permission from Bulgaria and Romania, to the east of Yugoslavia, to
make use of their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the intensification of the air war, NATO has been forced
to consider the blockade to stop the flow of oil to Yugoslavia's
military. Although air raids have damaged the country's two
principal refineries and scores of depots, Yugoslavia is still
receiving shipments through its ports. Some NATO commanders have
argued for the destruction of the oil sites at the ports, but NATO
political leaders worry about significant strikes in the Yugoslav
federation's smaller republic, Montenegro, whose government is seen
as less hostile to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yugoslav forces are still able to wage war, NATO
officials say they have detected what they interpret to be signs of
strain in Milosevic's control. A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain, Alastair Campbell, said a number of Yugoslav
generals and retired generals had been arrested.

ON OPENING DAY OF TROUT SEASON, BIGGER IS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Size matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only caught two and I let 'em go,'' said Alan Hurni of
Canoga Park. He cast a juicy gob of Power Bait and a night crawler
in hopes a trophy trout would find the bait an irresistible cherry
atop a sundae. ``I'm only after the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment expressed Saturday morning at Lower Twin Lake
outside of Bridgeport prevailed among experienced anglers on
opening day of trout season in the Eastern Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it was the first chance in six months to catch fish here,
but it was also the first chance to catch big fish, so why settle
for the little ones? The smiles aren't nearly as wide in snapshots
of guys holding stringers of 1-pound foot-long trout stocked
earlier in the week as the fellows hoisting 5-plus-pound bruisers
wider than the space between their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Illusions of grandeur only become grander as the angler's beard
grows longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my fish big, over 2 pounds, at least. I've got a lot of
neighbors to feed,'' said Billy Ray Ellis, 64, of Frazier Park, who
began fishing the Eastern Sierra in 1959. A splash of Sierra Gold
processed bait dressed his hook before daybreak at the north end of
Grant Lake in the June Lake Loop. A pair of loons sang their
distinctive call as snow-capped San Joaquin Mountain rose in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed if I drive all the way up here, spend all
that money and catch only 6-inchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis comes to the less-visited side of Grant for the opener
because it has consistently produced lunkers for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've landed more than 10 4-pounders right here, where I'm
standing,'' said the white-haired West Virginia native. Around the
corner, just to the south, he has taken 7\- and 7}-pounders.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity plays a major role for those who race after
whoppers; it breeds confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Vic McCarty keeps chasing the memory of an 8-pounder he caught
as a teen-ager fishing Grant Lake in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still see the dorsal fin and the tail fin cutting the
water,'' said McCarty of Oak Hills, north of San Bernardino, who
fishes Grant 10 times a season. ``That's why I fish this lake;
there are some big fish here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't catch a 4-, 5-, 6-pound trout very often. Every fish
I catch is fun, don't get me wrong, but when you catch a big fish,
it's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you got something (worthy). You're backing off the
drag, jumping up to see what you got and the next thing you know
your jeans are knee deep in the water. You don't get that with
little fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's Bob Groover is less enthusiastic about the ``every
fish.'' ``I'm going for size,'' he explained after displaying a
6-pound, 9-ounce rainbow hooked at dawn on yellow Power Bait
shore-fishing at Lower Twin Lake. He released a dozen smaller
specimens before keeping the one trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago I fished to fish, and now I'm targeting bigger
fish,'' Groover said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident, no small coincidence he landed one of the
day's largest fish. In 1996 he claims to have caught 110 Eastern
Sierra trout that tilted the scales at more than 5 pounds; he
releases everything smaller. His largest is a 10\ trout that won
the annual fishing derby at Convict Lake.
</P>
<P>
   One of the niceties of living in the area, huh? He's a grocery
clerk, but I have to wonder if the guy ever really works.
</P>
<P>
   Is a 6-pound, 9-ounce fish still exciting?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Groover affirmed. ``I thought I was going to
lose it because a boat ran right over the line and the fish jumped.
I thought it was going to get caught up in the propeller.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows where the big fish swim; he hedged his bets by
casting lines at Bridgeport's Twin Lakes, which have produced the
largest trout for the last four opening days.
</P>
<P>
   For some fishermen, they may be destined to catch ``the big
one''; it's in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of Sacramento's Paul Aguirre. His older
brother, Jason, took last year's opening-day big-fish honors with a
7-pound, 10-ounce brown out of Upper Twin Lake. His father, Sid,
performed the same feat in an opener earlier this decade, snatching
a 13-pounder at Lower Twin Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, that guy, jerk, he's a king around here,'' Aguirre
joshed about his father while fishing the East Walker River as it
spills out of Bridgeport Reservoir. ``He's consistently in the
4-pound range.''
</P>
<P>
   The family enjoys a friendly competition each year, but Paul is
on the short end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm due,'' he said. ``I'm just waiting for my trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fish for small fish. In fact, it's gotten to the point
where I throw back pretty decent fish _ 2 pounds or better. I have
to catch up with my dad and my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for most anglers, any fish will do, and, for some,
believe it or not, the smaller the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I like 'em perfect pan size,'' said Daniel Westbrook
of Phelan, northeast of Wrightwood. ``They don't taste as good any
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an eater, not a trophy guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, size matters.

   LITTLETON, Colo: was immediately forgotten. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JANA FILLMORE WASN'T AT SCHOOL that day, but not by choice.
</P>
<P>
   A bout of what seemed like flu at Christmas had been diagnosed
by early January as a rare neurological disorder that could lead to
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment, including several hospitalizations and spinal taps,
made the 17-year-old too weary to sit through classes. Since early
January, she'd had to continue her studies at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jana's condition had been improving, and she and her family had
begun mulling her return to Columbine. A gregarious girl who sang
soprano in the choir and had been picked to play a lead role in the
school production of Oklahoma!, Jana was eager to return.
</P>
<P>
   But a setback, a severe headache a week ago Saturday, put an end
to that discussion. And so it was that Jana sat in her den Tuesday,
watching cartoons and getting ready to eat lunch when the phone
rang. Her mother had run to the store. On the line was one of her
mother's friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you watching Channel 9?'' she asked. The woman hung up
before Jana could answer.
</P>
<P>
   Driving home from the market, LeAnn Fillmore heard the first
sketchy report on her minivan's radio: someone with a gun was
inside Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Praying as she drove, Fillmore rushed to the house, hoping that
she could shield her daughter from the news and the stress that she
feared could worsen the girl's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Fillmore ran inside to find the TV on and Jana transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother by her side, Jana looked desperately for friends in
the scenes of students running out of the building, jumping over
bodies as they went. She wanted to know who was dead on the
sidewalk, but couldn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   Her father came home from work, and the family of devout Mormons
knelt before the television and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   UP AT LAKE DILLON, 70 miles west of Denver, Tina's boyfriend
hadn't had a bite in 21/2 hours of fishing. His dad, Ken White Sr.,
had caught just one, a rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sr. went to the truck for a can of chew or a cigarette and
flipped on the radio. He heard the news and hollered.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving their lone catch and tackle behind, father and son sped
off, Ken Jr. at the wheel of his 1998 GMC truck. Both men had cell
phones they both made calls. Ken Jr. called Tina's but found no one
home. Ken Sr. reached his wife, but she knew nothing more than what
they'd heard on the radio: eight confirmed dead, one girl shot nine
times in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jr. raced down I-70 at 85 to 95 miles per hour. Ken Sr.
barked at him as they flew. ``Can't this truck go any faster?''
</P>
<P>
   LESLIE CROFT, THE RECEPTIONIST, made her way to Leawood
Elementary School, along with hundreds of other frantic parents.
</P>
<P>
   She spotted some of her daughter's friends. ``Have you seen
Carly?'' she asked. None had.
</P>
<P>
   A man announced from the stage that parents could check a list
of names, collected as students arrived and signed in. Croft pored
frantically over the six pages laid out on a table, looking for her
daughter's endearingly loopy penmanship. It wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Then came another announcement. Anyone needing help should look
for people wearing badges.
</P>
<P>
   Still wearing her work ID on her lapel, Croft suddenly had a
distraught woman collapse in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thank you for being here,'' the stranger cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry,'' Croft replied. ``I can't help you. I'm looking
for my own child.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon Croft was helping many others, directing them to the
constantly updated list of names where Carly's wasn't showing up.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE CRAMPED choir office where Tina hid, someone finally
got through to police, who said the shooters were students and
still on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kids in there better shut up because we don't have the
boys,'' an officer warned. ``Keep as quiet as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Students struggled to muffle their agony. A few freshmen girls
had the most trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't breathe,'' one moaned. ``Oh my God, we're gonna die.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the older students tried to quiet them with stern
warnings. They directed students not to make any more phone calls,
fearing that the noise could cost them their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Brock, who often comforts fellow students as a peer
counselor, couldn't help this time. The 18-year-old senior had
fainted. Craig Nason, who plays the lead in all the school
musicals, pumped her hand until she came to.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of guys went to work trying to let more air into the
stifling space, removing ceiling tiles. They heard more shooting,
punctuated every now and then with whoops of joy, apparently from
the gunmen. Then everything fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE CONFUSION of the Leawood cafeteria, another stranger
greeted Leslie Croft with a hug, this one so tight it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Croft fought the urge to pull back from the woman and returned
the embrace. A priest approached and the woman turned to him.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Croft found herself wrapped in another pair of arms,
these thrown around her from behind. She recognized the baby-soft
skin at once.
</P>
<P>
   As countless others still milled frantically about, the ordeal
for one mother and child ended with a familiar embrace.
</P>
<P>
   BACK ON I-70, Tina's boyfriend was still flying. He needn't have
rushed. When Ken Jr. and Sr. finally made it to the Leawood
gymnasium, they found Tina's parents but not her.
</P>
<P>
   They checked the lists again and again. No Tina.
</P>
<P>
   Time dragged on just as slowly for her, crouched in the choir
office, daring not to whisper. Four or more hours passed. Suddenly,
loud bangs broke the silence.
</P>
<P>
   More shooting, they feared. More bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Tina heard voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go look under there,'' one said. ``Check over there.''
</P>
<P>
   The words would have heightened her terror, except the voices
were deep. These were men, not students. They were there to help,
banging down doors along the way.
</P>
<P>
   A pounding came directly on the choir room door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open up,'' a man said. ``Denver police.''
</P>
<P>
   STUDENTS HAD TO take down their barricade before they could get
out of the choir room door. Opening it at last, they saw a dozen or
more men with guns and riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Tina's eyes filled with tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' an officer said. ``It's over now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers told the group to follow a particular path out of the
building, single file, because the school was booby trapped with
explosives. And don't look around, they added.
</P>
<P>
   The last direction proved impossible to follow. As the students
jogged through the hallway, they saw destruction and death all
around. Bullet holes and glass littered the corridors, and a foot
of water was in the cafeteria, where the sprinklers had gone off.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the school, Alison, the girl who'd fainted, ran up
stairs and had to jump over a dead student. Nearby she saw another
body. It was her best friend, Rachel Scott, struck down as she'd
tried to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Alison froze. This couldn't be. She and Rachel had plans. Both
aspiring actresses, they'd talked of striking out for Hollywood
together. They even had a backup plan. If Rachel alone made the
big-time, Alison would be her hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who hours before had pumped the woozy Alison's hand until
it hurt, pulled her away. They had to keep moving, toward the bus
that would take them, the last group of children to make it out, to
the gymnasium where their loved ones waited.
</P>
<P>
   There was no time to linger over lost friends and dreams. One
more treasure of everyday life was reluctantly left behind.

INSPECTION FEE UP FOR DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The great Los Angeles brush-clearance war flares
anew.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's attempt to collect a $13 inspection fee, along with
its effort to reduce fire danger by requiring brush to be cleared
and trees and grass to be trimmed from anywhere near hillside
homes, sparked widespread outrage and was blamed by many for the
defeat of the public safety bond issue April 13.
</P>
<P>
   A City Council committee plans to ask Fire Department officials
why a bureaucratically written notice with intimidating language
was sent out to 180,000 homeowners, including many residents of
housing tracts on the San Fernando Valley floor who questioned the
need to clear flat land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite questions about the legality of the fee, Mayor Richard
Riordan has proposed continuing it in his new budget, and only one
council member, Hal Bernson, has publicly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Where else in the $4.2billion budget, officials ask, could the
city come up the $3million for the inspection program that used to
be free to residents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reaction (of) those of us living in the flat lands
was that this was crazy,'' said Polly Ward, a Studio City community
activist who lives near Ventura Boulevard and away from the
hillside fire areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the $13, although I didn't pay it. It just doesn't
make any sense. Do they want us to strip all our trees that provide
greenery and shade? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A verbal wildfire exploded after the notices arrived in the week
before the Proposition 1 vote. Thousands of angry residents
complained to City Hall, and the City Council suspended the fee
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan included the flat-land inspections in his budget for the
coming year as a means of paying for them. The proposed budget
already was being printed when the council suspended the fee,
Deputy Mayor Jennifer Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was upset with the way this was handled by the Fire
Department, but he does support the concept of homeowners' covering
the cost of inspections,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   A council committee is scheduled discuss the fee Monday and to
review how the Los Angeles Fire Department handled the
notification.
</P>
<P>
   The council last year voted to impose the fee during the peak of
fear about fire danger posed by brush that grew thick during El
Nino rains and threatened to fuel wildfires when it dried out. Many
residents reportedly had failed to meet the new city requirement of
clearing brush 200 feet from homes and other buildings. Fire
officials said they needed eight additional inspectors, whose
salaries and fringe benefits would be covered by the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Bernson, who represents the north Valley, is the only
council member who has come out in favor of stopping the fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was stupid, and it was misrepresented to us,'' Bernson
said. ``I told people during the election not to pay it. My
understanding was that this program was to be financed by higher
fees on those who failed to meet the Fire Department
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernson questioned the legality of the fee, which he said might
effectively be a new tax that should have been submitted to voters
for approval to comply with Proposition 218.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is considering a legal
challenge of the fee if the council reimposes it without voter
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials have said they might not refund checks already
received for fees. The money is being held in the city Treasurer's
Office until a decision is made on whether the department should
keep all or part of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Joel Wachs is leaning against the $13 fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received over 400 complaints from people,'' his deputy
Arlene de Sanctis said. ``The councilman is very concerned about
how this was applied _ the lack of notice and if there is an appeal
process. He wants a lot more information before he will vote for
this to take effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer wants to get more information from the
Fire Department, said spokesman Daniel Hinderfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes the department should have done a much better job,
and he is sympathetic to the people who are calling in angry and
confused,'' Hinderfield said. ``People are very, very angry about
that and, the councilman feels, rightly so.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Councilwoman Laura Chick said she holds similar views.

LOS ANGELES: holds similar views 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Fire Department officials are reviewing the fee and
coming up with a new recommendation. Fire officials said they would
re-evaluate the boundaries for the mountain fire district and
buffer zones, but indicated the boundaries are based on state and
local law and on records of where large, dangerous fires occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the department is still requiring those who
received the notices to mow brush within 200 feet of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Battalion Chief Al Hernandez said the department wants all
hazardous brush removed to prevent fire danger, and he is also
asking homeowners to trim back trees such as cypress, firs and
eucalyptus to reduce the risk they will spread fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles regulations require that grass, weeds and native
brush be mowed down to a height of 3 inches within 200 feet of
homes, garages and other buildings, including those on adjacent
property.
</P>
<P>
   Grass, weeds and native brush also must be cut down to the
3-inch height within 10 feet of streets, alleys, driveways and
combustible fences.
</P>
<P>
   All dead trees must be removed. Living trees must have limbs
trimmed to a height of 8 feet from the ground, and they must be
cleared of dead branches, twigs and foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Ornamental shrubbery is allowed, but some varieties must have
low branches and leaves trimmed from the ground to about one-third
of the total height.
</P>
<P>
   Tree branches must be trimmed to come no closer than five feet
to the roof of any structure. Foliage must be at least 10 feet from
any chimney or stovepipe outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Roof surfaces must be clear of leaves, twigs, needles or other
combustible material.
</P>
<P>
   The city's clearance distances are more stringent than in many
other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the unincorporated area of the county, flammable
grass and brush must be cut down to a stubble height only within 30
feet of buildings, although county fire advise keeping a 100-foot
firebreak around buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale requires 100-foot in high areas.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank also requires 100-foot clearance for buildings in the
hillside area, where there is high risk of fire. The Burbank Fire
Department is studying the possibility of increasing the clearance
requirement to 200 feet and is expected to make a recommendation
soon to the Burbank City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank spends about $60,000 on its brush-clearance program.
There is no assessment fee to cover inspections. Firefighters do
the inspections near about 1,300 buildings.

A DAY OF LOST LIVES, LOST INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Carly Croft's first concern, as she ran for
her life, was a cream puff, freshly baked in home economics class.
Her mother, a receptionist for an orthodontist, took care to switch
the office phones to the answering service before rushing off to
learn whether her child was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   At choir practice, Tina Becerra paused to consider picking up
sheet music that fell off her lap when she first heard gunshots.
The Lord's Prayer and other songs lay scattered on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As gunfire and explosions tore through a typical Tuesday at
Columbine High School, it took some time for residents of this
quiet suburb snuggled up to the Rocky Mountain foothills to put
aside the niceties and responsibilities of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school, two teen-age misfits violated the most basic
of human standards _ laughing as they took the lives of 12 students
and a teacher, before killing themselves. As bloody survivors began
to stream out of Columbine High, the horror of a school day gone
terribly wrong began to sink in:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell my parents I love them?'' ``Will I ever see my
child again?''
</P>
<P>
   Achingly long hours passed before answers arrived. In the end,
even the lucky ones _ those who made it out alive or were not in
school that day _ had lost friends and innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, April 20, began badly for Tina. The 16-year-old had
quarreled with her longtime steady, who lives in the basement of
her parents' house. Ken White had stayed out late the night before,
and Tina was miffed.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, she was late for school. When she finally
arrived, she muttered that it was looking like a lousy day.
</P>
<P>
   If Ken was upset, he also was determined to make the most of the
spring weather. A 19-year-old car salesman and drag racer, he took
off for Lake Dillon for a day of fishing with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   In the choir room, Tina was preparing to shake off the lovers'
quarrel. An alto, she and the rest of the choir were warming up
with scales, getting ready to practice music for several concerts
and graduation, less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Brandon Reisbeck strode in, yelled, ``There's people
shooting!'' and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at the height of senior prank season, from a student
known as a bit of a jokester, the warning was shrugged off. But
seconds later, the sounds of stampeding, shrieking students
convinced the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Tina stood up, spilling the sheet music onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I pick it up?'' she stood wondering. ``Should I grab my
purse?'' Inside the handbag were keys to her white 1999 Chevy
Cavalier, a graduation gift.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly snapped out of her indecision, abandoning music,
purse and keys for the safety of a nearby office. She was one of 60
people, all students, who crammed into a space meant for two desks
and not much more. Someone shut the door and switched off the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark, they moved a filing cabinet and two wooden desks in
front of the door. The barricade couldn't block out the sounds of
shooting and screaming coming from the library across the hall. Ten
people, including the gunmen, would die there.
</P>
<P>
   Someone tried to dial 911 on the office phone but couldn't get
through. A girl with a cell phone reached her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, call 911. There's someone with a gun in our school,'' she
said. ``I have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about making noise that might betray their hiding place,
the girl was anxious to hang up. But not before adding, ``Mom, I
love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wasn't already crying started.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE OTHER END of the building, Carly and her classmates had
finished setting the tables in home economics class and were about
to delve into the cream puffs they'd just filled with ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The fire alarm sounded, a drill the class thought, and the teens
groaned that their treats would get soggy before they'd get back.
</P>
<P>
   A few students stuck their pastries in the freezer. Carly took
hers, plate and all, at the suggestion of a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Carly nibbled as she left building, enjoying the sensation of
walking on her right foot. Broken in a car accident in early March,
it had come out of a cast just in time for last weekend's prom.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside the building, Carly noticed some students running
and thought they were trying to catch up with friends. Ahead she
saw some kids jumping over a fence. Among them was a heavyset
friend not known for scaling chain link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get over,'' the girl wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Why are you trying to, Carly wanted to know. And why are you
crying?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Carly threw down her plate and half-eaten dessert and tried to
climb over. She couldn't get a toehold. Her feet wouldn't fit into
the chain link. She removed her sandals and climbed over barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   She glanced back at a cream-colored piece of glass with blue
flowers, sitting incongruously in the grass. Thoughts of the plate
and her home economics teacher tugged at Carly as she started a
limping run across a park to the public library and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Miss Inman doesn't get mad at me.''
</P>
<P>
   A FEW MILES AWAY, Carly's mother was answering phones at the
orthodontist's office. Leslie Croft recognized the voice of the
doctor's wife, but she couldn't fathom what she was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you've heard,'' the woman said, ``but there's
been a shooting at the school.''
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely 11:58. Croft noted the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she thought. ``It's lunch hour. I can switch these
phones to the answering service.''
</P>
<P>
   She stood up, intending to drive to her house, which backs up to
the school. Then she remembered she had no car.
</P>
<P>
   Croft had carpooled that day for the first time in her life. An
office assistant volunteered to take her home. Surely, Croft
thought, Carly will be there.
</P>
<P>
   The only people at Croft's house were police. A SWAT team
swarmed the back yard and stood atop of the roof for a bird's-eye
view of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding streets were sealed tight, and a Columbine coach
drafted to help direct traffic waved Croft away.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing where to go, the co-worker headed back for the
office, then decided to stop to pick up lunch at Subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need something to eat,'' she told Croft.
</P>
<P>
   Croft stood dazed while her companion ordered herself a
sandwich. Then the young man behind the counter asked if he could
help Croft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a daughter at that school, and I can't eat,'' she
replied, suddenly bursting into tears.
</P>
<P>
   As if compelled to give the clerk a more appropriate response,
Croft went on to order a 6-inch seafood on wheat. She stuffed it in
her purse, where it was immediately forgotten. MORE &QL;

Tragedy strikes a familiar chord in us all
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Gary Morris was on his way to lunch Tuesday
morning, walking near the front entrance of Columbine High School
when he stopped to get a drink of water.
</P>
<P>
   He said hello to a friend who plays for the girls soccer team,
which had lost just one game all year, is ranked No. 10 in the
nation and was supposed to play undefeated Green Mountain for the
league championship Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You goin' to the game?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Morris said. ``I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing his favorite baseball cap, a worn white cap with
the bill bent just the way he liked and the words ``Texas Tech
Football'' inscribed on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I want to go to college,'' Morris, 16, said.
``I've never been there, but I know Tech has a good architecture
program and that's what I want to study. Do you know if they have a
wrestling team down there?''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is, in high school parlance, a jock.
</P>
<P>
   He is about 5-9, stoutly built, with strawberry blond hair, a
few freckles and bright, hazel eyes. He once played football for
the Columbine Rebels but then turned to wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   As he leaned over the water fountain in the main hallway of
Columbine High, a resounding blast jolted him and he clicked his
teeth against the water fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought, `Fireworks,''' Morris said. ``You know,
it's senior-prank time around here.''
</P>
<P>
   But then there were more pops, then crashes, then screams. There
were students running in every direction and teachers slamming
classroom doors and telling kids to run. He saw ``Mr. Sanders'' _
Dave Sanders, the popular girls basketball and softball coach, who
gave his life to save 100 or more students.
</P>
<P>
   Morris saw other students running through the halls in a frenzy.
Up ahead, he saw one figure fall to the floor. Then, there was
another blast that blew the windows out of a nearby office and sent
glass clattering across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there,'' Morris said, ``I started running.''
</P>
<P>
   The front entrance was close to where Morris was standing, but
``for some reason I ran in the other direction to a door that was
farther down the hall. That's where I got out. I don't know why I
did that, but I wouldn't be standing here if I had gone to the
front door. They came through that (front) door and started
shooting. I know they would have killed me. They knew me. And with
this hat on, they would have killed me. They hated jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   They were Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Few people knew them
before Tuesday afternoon. Yet we all did.
</P>
<P>
   They were the quiet, dark outcasts that rebelled against the
mainstream. They dressed differently, lived differently and felt
disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   They were ignored or picked on by those who proudly wore the
school colors, those who went to the pep rallies, wore the spirit
ribbons and corsages, painted football banners, decorated the
commons for prom night, put in extra hours in the weight room and
were part of something that most students considered important at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   That's how somehow this dreadful massacre at Columbine High has
become intertwined with the sports world. We all knew, or know,
high school students who go their own way and are quietly and
mysteriously different from the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was when I was in high school. That's how it is
now, perhaps at every high school in America. That's probably how
it will be forever.
</P>
<P>
   If kids sometimes can be cruel, like the saying goes, then high
school kids sometimes can be cruel, cliquish and unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   And usually, the differences between cliques are most defined
and most intense in the relationship between the in-crowd athletes
and the dark group that considers athletes the epitome of what they
do not want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Choose your nickname. I remember the ``cons.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979. We would walk to the field house after football
practice and hear heckles from the cons, who usually sat under a
tree in the parking lot of Edison High School in San Antonio. Once,
one of the cons shot a few rounds from a BB gun at us and a
full-fledged brawl broke out, rocks thrown, bottles breaking, until
the coaches gained control. We would exchange glares in the
hallways every day thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a proud memory, but a vivid one.
</P>
<P>
   Time changes only the nicknames given to these groups. At
different schools and in different eras, they might be called the
``heads'' or ``stoners'' or ``gothics'' or ``freaks'' or ``nerds''
or ``rednecks'' or ``boyz'' or ``geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Different. Dark. At war with the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   They often are not bad, only different. Often, they grow up to
make more of their lives than the captain of the football team or
the head cheerleader. Bill Gates is said to have been an outcast in
high school _ nerdy, quiet and different. Now he runs Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But when a kid is in high school and he lives in a world that
can be cruel, cliquish and unrelenting, the differences between the
in crowd and the outcasts are potentially explosive and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric and Dylan loved to be hated,'' said Tyler Jackman, 17,
who is not involved in sports at Columbine but knew Harris and
Klebold from a video class they took together. ``People say the
jocks picked on them, but it's like they wanted people to talk
about them and notice them. I used to think, `You guys want
everyone to hate you.' Especially the jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackman saw a video confiscated this week by law enforcement
authorities investigating Tuesday's massacre. The video Harris and
Klebold made was the final exam for the video class last year.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Jackman said there is one scene in which a student
wearing a Columbine basketball jersey is being beaten and kicked by
Klebold and Harris. There is another scene in which an athlete is
walking down the hall of the school flexing his muscles, only to be
jumped and beaten by actors wearing trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the school knew the jocks and the Trenchcoat
Mafia didn't like each other,'' Jackman said. ``They fought all the
time. They'd pass each other in the hall and (stuff) would happen.
You just never thought it would go this far.''
</P>
<P>
   A boys varsity soccer player, who asked to remain anonymous,
said: ``They wanted to get the jocks. When this happened (Tuesday),
I was running and turned the corner and looked right at one of
them. I just sort of froze. He told me, `I've got a problem with
jocks, but I don't have a problem with you.' That's all he said.
And he kept going. I ran out of the building and kept hearing
shots. I was thinking to myself, People are dying in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The alleged attackers killed 12 students and Sanders, before
apparently killing themselves. Nearly two dozen others were
injured. Not all the victims were athletes, but amid the chaos
several athletes were systematically sought out.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Shoels, a former football player and bodybuilder, was
killed execution-style. Mattew Kechter, a football player, was
killed. Steven Curnow, a soccer player, was killed. Another soccer
player was injured. Corey DePooter, a wrestler, was killed. Another
wrestler was injured. Lauren Townsend, the popular captain of the
volleyball team and in line to be class valedictorian, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had a hit list,'' said Noah Smeltzer, a two-sport
athlete at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Several students reported one of the gunmen announcing in the
library during the rampage: ``All jocks stand up. We're going to
kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Harris marked next to pictures of classmates in his
yearbook ``dead,'' ``dying'' or ``save.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was like two different kinds of people getting
attention,'' Morris said. ``The athletes were out there trying to
do something positive, something that people wanted to go see. The
Trenchcoat Mafia wanted those people to notice them because they
were different. They wanted to be the exact opposite. They would do
things just to off the jocks and then they'd start calling each
other names or fight. Dylan and Eric liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   They wanted people to notice them. Sadly, the entire world has.
</P>
<P>
   There was no big game Friday evening. Instead, there was a
memorial service, the first of what will be a terribly sad,
seemingly endless stream of services for the victims of Tuesday's
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no league championship. No baseball season. No
more school this year at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, girls soccer coach Peter Horvath went to one
of his player's homes, where the team met and tried to come to
grips with the devastation. They talked about what Klebold and
Harris did. They talked about the hatred they must have had, the
inexplicable defiance.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer team voted to try to complete the season, probably
late next week. Thursday, they gathered as a team for the first
time since Tuesday. They went on a long run not far from the
makeshift memorial at Clement Park near the school, where streams
of ribbons, banners, balloons and jerseys from virtually every high
school in the area decorated the park, as Columbine students wept.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball coach Robin Ortiz attended a meeting of district
coaches Wednesday, where it was decided the remainder of the season
would be canceled. Instead, a tournament will be played late next
week, where playoff seeds will be determined and all proceeds will
go to a fund established for the victims of Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't seem to like other people,'' Noelle Porter, 17,
said. ``They always wanted to prove something about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They did and the school never will be the same. The vivid high
school memories these kids will carry with them for the rest of
their lives will not be about big games, dances, proms and pep
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to become a place with no jocks, no preps, no
druggies, nothing like that at all,'' Dustin Gordon, 18, said. ``We
have to tear down all the walls and just be Columbine, like any
other school.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's just it. It was like any other school until Tuesday.
It was like a school all of us have attended.
</P>
<P>
   That's what should send a shock up all our spines and jolt us
into helping our kids understand that no matter if you are an
athlete, a cheerleader, a geek or an outcast, it's high school.
</P>
<P>
   It can give us beautiful memories that we carry with us forever.
It can be cruel, cliquish and unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine Rebels should be our cause.

ATTACK AT SCHOOL PLANNED A YEAR, AUTHORITIES SAY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete rewrite, and to expand to 2 takes)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The two young men who shot and bombed their
way through their high school here planned the assault a year in
advance, monitored cafeteria crowds to determine the busiest times
and scheduled their suicide attack for Hitler's birthday, the
authorities said Saturday, citing a handwritten diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `Day 1, we do this, Day 2, do this,' down to 11:15 and
it's rock-and-roll time,'' said John Stone, Jefferson County
sheriff, referring to the precise moment on Tuesday that Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold attacked Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the diary began in April 1998, and was seized by
the police at one of the boys' homes after the shooting. He did not
say which young man kept the diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going for a big kill,'' Stone said. The two young
men had been building bombs and acquiring weapons ``for a
considerable time,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The diary details how the writer mapped out the school, noting
lights and hiding places, and established a system of hand signals
to use during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of this thing is that they wanted to do as
much damage as they could possibly do, and destroy the school and
destroy as many children as they could, and go out in flames,''
Stone said. Fifteen people died in the attack, including the two
young men, who killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the reasoning was: ``We want to be different, we want
to be strange and we don't want jocks or other people putting (us)
down. ... We're going to punish you,'' The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the arsenal that the young men had in the school _
four guns and about 30 explosive devices, including a propane tank
bomb, had led investigators to believe they must have had help.
</P>
<P>
   Stone did not reveal any evidence of such assistance, but said:
``I don't think it was just two guys acting alone. If there was a
third, fourth or fifth person involved, we are going to find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said investigators were examining the two young
men's phone and Internet records.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Steve Davis, the sheriff's spokesman,
stressed: ``We still haven't named anyone else as a suspect. There
have not been any arrests or charges filed against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppered with German phrases, the diary has ``this German, Nazi
theme to it,'' the sheriff said. Asked why they picked April 20, he
said, ``They said it was Hitler's birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   This obsession with Nazism clashes with the roots of one of the
suspects, Klebold, whose mother, Susan, is Jewish. Klebold's
great-grandfather, the late Leo Yassenoff, a wealthy commercial
real estate developer in Columbus, Ohio, was a prominent
philanthropist who donated so much money to the Jewish Community
Center of Columbus that it was named after him.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff also had the harshest official words yet for the
parents of the diary writer.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that detectives had found a shotgun barrel on one of the
teen-agers' bedroom dressers and bomb-making materials and weapons
in the houses, he said: ``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible,
and the parents should have known. I think parents are accountable
for their kid's actions.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sheriff briefed reporters, mourners flocked to the
second of more than a dozen services expected in the coming days,
the funeral of Rachel Joy Scott, who was killed in the school
library.
</P>
<P>
   Before the service at Trinity Christian Center in Littleton,
friends and family of Miss Scott, a 17-year-old junior, were
encouraged to sign the white wood coffin, much like signing a
yearbook. ``Honey, you are everything a mother could ever ask the
Lord for in a daughter. I love you so much!!! Mom,'' was one
inscription. Most of the notes in black marker simply said, ``I
love you,'' with a heart for the word love. And most ended with
``See you in Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, friends remembered that Rachel loved drama,
writing poetry, wearing floppy or silly hats and church activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Bruce Porter waved a ``diploma'' and said, ``You have
graduated early from this life to a far better one, where there is
no sorrow, violence or death,'' he said. ``Today I believe all of
heaven is standing in tribute to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of Klebold, meanwhile, released a statement through
lawyers, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we had a private service for our son Dylan Klebold, who
we loved as much as we knew how to love a child. Our sadness and
grief over his death and this tragedy are indescribable. We again
apologize to all those who have also suffered a loss of their loved
one, and we continue to pray for the recovery of those who were
injured. We would also like to extend our gratitude to those who
have offered their support and sympathy during this grieving
period,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the shooting, four wounded girls and seven
wounded boys remained in hospitals, less than half of the total of
23 who were hospitalized last Tuesday. Of those hospitalized, one
was listed Saturday as in critical condition, five were in serious,
and five in fair.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff also said that his department was assembling a
detailed timeline of the police response to the attack on the high
school. Responding to criticism that the police reaction may have
been slow, he said that within 2 minutes of the first 911 calls, a
deputy sheriff assigned to the school was trading gunfire with the
attackers. Fifteen minutes later, he said, the first SWAT team
entered the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early intervention of that first SWAT unit, I think saved one
heck of a lot of kids' lives, by pinning these guys down, by
putting them on the defensive, instead of the offensive, and
subsequently probably led to their suicide,'' the sheriff said.
Asking why television viewers saw SWAT teams standing outside the
school for over an hour, he said, ``We didn't want to have one SWAT
team shooting another SWAT team.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continues, a picture emerges of a suburban
world where adults had only superficial understandings of the lives
of the two teen-age suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, the two graduated with flying colors from a
yearlong court-ordered juvenile diversion program, administered by
the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. After completing the
program and anger management classes, they had their records wiped
clean. They had pleaded guilty to breaking into a car last year and
stealing electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   To participate in this probation program, the boys had signed
contracts stipulating that they would not acquire firearms.
However, according to the diary, they had started secretly amassing
weapons, ammunition, and bomb-making materials last year, Stone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeAngelis, the principal of the 1,800-student high school,
said on Friday that no teacher had alerted him to behavior problems
in the suspects, both seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard of the trench coat mafia until Tuesday,''
the principal said, although the group had a small photo in the
1998 yearbook. In his first public comments since the massacre,
DeAngelis said that school records indicated the young men had
never been ``suspended or expelled or in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Two parents of Columbine High School students have complained in
recent days that members of the trench coat mafia had threatened to
kill their sons. The family of a black student killed Tuesday,
Isaiah Shoels, said that their son had been threatened by the
all-white gang, which affected Nazi trappings.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Brown, whose son, Brooks, was not injured on Tuesday,
has said that Harris broke the windshield of his son's car last
year and then posted this message on his Web site: ``If anyone
wants to kill someone, why not Brooks Brown?'' Brown, a neighbor of
the Harris family, said that he had complained to the Jefferson
County Sheriff's Department that Eric was assembling and exploding
bombs in the neighborhood and had threatened his son. Brown said
that his complaints did not seem to produce any action.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, dozens of students around the nation have been
suspended and arrested for threatening to carry out copycat
attacks. In big cities, small towns and suburbs like this one,
schools have been evacuated. In Denver and other cities around the
country, school superintendents have banned the wearing of black
trench coats to school.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious case, five junior high school students in
the central Texas town of Wimberley were arrested Friday and
charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit
arson, and conspiracy to manufacture explosives.

<P>
   &UR; HUXLEY: FROM DEVIL'S DISCIPLE TO EVOLUTION'S HIGH PRIEST &LR;  By
Adrian Desmond. Helix/Perseus, $22.50. The contentious scientist
Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95) helped usher in the modern age by
fighting ferociously to shape Darwinism into a social engine to
overthrow the structures of Victorian society. This ``luscious and
smart biography,'' selected by the editors of The New York Times
Book Review as one of the best books of 1997, features ``writing on
science as lucid and engaging as one is likely to find,'' James R.
Kincaid wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARADISE &LR;  By Toni Morrison. Plume, $13.95. Ruby, Okla.,
population 360, is an imaginary utopia settled by black freedmen
where the inhabitants live in safety and peace but in complete
isolation. Starting in the 1970s, the grimly righteous Ruby begins
to rot from within, and the townspeople point fingers at a group of
women living in an abandoned convent just outside the town, paving
the way for a violent confrontation. ```Paradise' ... is an
ambitious, troubling and complicated piece of work, proof that Toni
Morrison continues to change and mature in surprising new
directions,'' Brooke Allen wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAUL MARCHAND, F.M.C. &LR;  By Charles W. Chesnutt. Princeton
University, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This novel by an African-American whose fiction was widely
praised in the early years of this century focuses on the inner
struggle of a Louisiana man who is raised to think of himself as of
mixed race but who discovers as an adult that he is white. In 1998
the reviewer Arnold Rampersad praised the book's ``vibrant
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEN FRIGATES: PASSION AND PERIL, NINETEENTH-CENTURY WOMEN AT
SEA &LR;  By Joan Druett. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14. The title of
this unusual nautical history refers to ships with captains' wives
on board. These hardy women reared children, coped with domineering
husbands and even performed crucial navigational duties in a pinch.
Last year the reviewer Holly Morris admired ``the author's
knowledge and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SCIENTIFIC ROMANCE &LR;  By Ronald Wright. Picador USA, $13. The
hero of this first novel stumbles onto H.G. Wells' time machine in
modern-day London and zooms off to A.D. 2500, where he finds the
Thames flowing through steaming everglades and a city in ruins.
``The result is a fresh take on an old formula _ the dystopian
postapocalypse novel,'' John Vernon wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KEYS TO THE CITY: TALES OF A NEW YORK CITY LOCKSMITH &LR;  By Joel
Kostman. Penguin, $10.95. As an emergency locksmith, the author is
well placed to peek into other lives and the mysteries of human
nature. ``Kostman's keyhole perspective ... is incongruously
funny,'' Eric P. Nash wrote in 1997. ``His stories are a
celebration of commonplace strangeness.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOME LIE AND SOME DIE &LR;  By Ruth Rendell. Vintage Crime/Black
Lizard, $11.
</P>
<P>
   In this Inspector Wexford mystery, a body is discovered at a pop
music festival in Britain and all signs point to a monstrously
arrogant rock star. ``Rendell, in her quiet way, can shake
mountains,'' Newgate Callendar wrote in the New York Times Book
Review in 1973. ``She has a keen insight into character.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued several early Wexford novels,
including  &UR; NO MORE DYING THEN &LR;  ($11), which, characteristically, is
part police procedural, part character study, this time involving
the kidnapping of a child in a small town. ``She writes like a
dream, and she never lets the tension down,'' Callendar wrote in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RED LOBSTER, WHITE TRASH AND THE BLUE LAGOON: JOE QUEENAN'S
AMERICA &LR;  Hyperion, $12.95. The author sentenced himself to one year
of forced exposure to the hacks, hangouts and heroes of American
pop culture. Though the targets are depressingly easy and the
litany is occasionally tiresome, ``Queenan's razor-sharp rebukes
can be appreciated by anyone who has done time in an elevator,
supermarket aisle or dentist's office,'' Lance Gould wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOING OUT: THE RISE AND FALL OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS &LR;  By David
Nasaw. Harvard University, $16.95. This is a scholarly analysis
that tracks the shift from urban-oriented public amusements in
America to suburban venues. ``Nasaw ... unearths fascinating
details about everything from the early history of the movies to
pre-World War I dance crazes; and he raises fundamental questions
about the web of connections joining commercial play, public space
and cultural cohesion,'' Jackson Lears wrote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SINGING INTO THE PIANO &LR;  By Ted Mooney. Vintage Contemporaries,
$14.
</P>
<P>
   In this racy, cinematic novel about Mexican-American relations
in the NAFTA era, of all things, sex is presented as the ultimate
transaction. ``Mooney is an amazingly fluid writer, in total
command of his witty if somewhat arch style,'' Sarah Kerr wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BITING THE DUST: THE JOYS OF HOUSEWORK &LR;  By Margaret Horsfield.
Picador USA, $13. Just in time for spring-cleaning season comes
this memoir-history-sociology lesson by a Canadian journalist.
```Biting the Dust' is no how-to; much better, it is a how-it-is
and how-it-was,'' Andrea Higbie wrote in 1998. ``A spiffy book.''

OPPOSING fans heckle him, kids love him and everybody wants a piece
of him. For Josh Beckett, he wouldn't want it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why this likable Spring High School senior, who
has been blessed with a cannon for a right arm, is billed as the
next can't-miss pitching prospect from a state that has produced
more than a few.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how good Beckett is, just ask one of the
handful of radar gun-toting scouts who are at each game he pitches,
charting every sizzling 95 mph fastball and every knee-buckling
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want a better idea of what ignites Kid Heat's fire,
just ask the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the best, buddy,'' he said. ``That's why I'm so relaxed
out there. You've got to have some arrogant bones in your body,
especially to be a pitcher in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Beckett, the major leagues might not be too far away.
</P>
<P>
   He's expected to be the No. 1 overall selection in June's
major-league baseball amateur draft, a pick that belongs to Tampa
Bay. Devil Rays scout Doug Gassaway, a Texas scout for more than 30
years, has called Beckett one of the best he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett, 8-0 with a 0.24 ERA this year for the Lions (21-5), has
struck out 119 and allowed only 18 hits, five runs (two earned) and
23 walks in 59 innings pitched. His next start will come Tuesday at
home against Cypress Falls as Spring tries to clinch the District
16-5A title.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's star began rising among scouts last year when talk
surfaced that he would be a coveted draft pick. Beckett mania soon
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In Beckett's last start Tuesday against Cypress Creek, a group
of Little Leaguers clamored around his 6-5 frame after the game,
handed him baseballs and caps to sign and asked questions usually
reserved for veteran professionals.
</P>
<P>
   One week earlier at Cy-Fair, more than 40 kids and adults had to
be ushered off the bullpen mound so Beckett and catcher Stephen
Ghutzman, also a preseason All-American, could get in their
pre-game workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually getting worse,'' Lions coach Kenny Humphreys
said. ``But it's not a case where it's a bad deal. Young kids are
looking for role models, heroes and things like that, and they've
just attached themselves to him. His name is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys first heard Beckett's name when Beckett played against
Humphreys' son Kyle as an 11-year-old in the Spring Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time you could tell he had a good, live arm,''
Humphreys said. ``He had a good fastball and good breaking stuff,
but you didn't know where it was going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, if he didn't strike you out, he was upset. By no
means was he the dominant player he is now, but he knew by spending
time and effort he could be something.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Beckett enrolled at Spring, Humphreys was head
baseball coach and had the pitcher on the junior varsity as a
freshman. Beckett's stuff was good, but something magical happened
to his right arm between his freshman and sophomore seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I first got noticed by scouts and my summer-league
coach, Clay Hill,'' Beckett said. ``I went that whole freshman year
on the JV and had some trouble in the classroom. It was tough
because I wasn't throwing that hard, 86 (mph) tops. That summer I
was throwing 92 or 93. I guess it was puberty, I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett went 9-3 as a sophomore with a 1.25 ERA and 150
strikeouts, and followed that up by going 13-2 last year (both
losses were 2-1) with a 0.39 ERA and 179 strikeouts. Each year,
Dobie's Nathan Mitchell eliminated Spring and Beckett from the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season, Beckett was tabbed the top high school
prospect in the nation and was featured in several well-known
publications, including Sports Illustrated, USA Today and Texas
Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Beckett found himself recognized by people he didn't
know and he even received a marriage proposal from a fan at a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's been the weirdest thing to happen so far,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before things got too wild, Beckett and his family sought advice
from Rick George, who's son, Chris, was a first-round pick by
Kansas City in last year's draft after leading Klein to the state
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick just said we really need to look at things in a logical
progression,'' said Beckett's father, John. ``First, you need to
get an adviser and then you deal with the scouts and you set up
some sort of visitation things with those guys. Basically, you set
limits and you know what the limits are and then you expect them to
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's laid-back off-the-field mentality has enabled him to
handle all the attention with ease. But on the field, Beckett is an
intense competitor. He no longer gets angry when he doesn't strike
everybody out, but he remains an intense and intimidating
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get too many guys out there that are soft and don't have
the mentality,'' he said. ``They just want to go out there and be
all composed. One game I tried to do that and coach Humphreys came
out there and told me not to be so passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I build on my arrogance and whenever I throw a fastball by
them I might shake my head or something. That helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has opened him up to criticism from those who don't like
his mound antics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get heckled worse than anybody,'' he said. ``I get it bad. I
get called all kinds of stuff that's unreal. Whenever you give up a
hit, that's even worse because it gets blown completely out of
proportion. I'm not unhittable. I'd hit myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The taunting is tough for his father, a mechanical engineer who
stands near the Spring dugout each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how hard that is for me to stand there and
listen to people,'' he said. ``It really kind of disgusts me. It's
been going on for a year or so but the first couple of times it
happened this year my senses were really kind of acute to it. You
would think that people would be happy for someone being able to
fulfill a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphreys said Beckett, 18, usually silences the hecklers with
his play on the mound and at the plate. Beckett is among area
leaders in batting average (.536) and has a school-record 10
homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been times he's come back at them but it's been in the
manner of his aggressiveness with a `here, take that' kind of
deal,'' he said. ``He's a very draftable player as a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Houston-area fireballers Nolan
Ryan and Roger Clemens. But it's Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood,
last year's National League Rookie of the Year, to whom he's most
often compared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of similarities between the two,'' said The
Woodlands coach Mike McGilvray, who coached Wood at Grand Prairie
High School and faced Beckett this year. ``The thing that Kerry
would do is just compete, and I see that in (Josh). Both of them
throw very effortlessly. Josh doesn't have any wasted motion and is
mechanically sound. Kerry was the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy that's very similar to Kerry and a lot of people
are saying he's a little bit better than Kerry at this point. That
might be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's fastball was clocked as high as 99 mph this past
summer and 97 during this high school season. He's consistently
around 94.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has great command of his pitches, including a
curveball that's referred to as ``a 12-6 curve.'' The numbers refer
to a clock face and his curve drops straight down from 12 to 6.
Beckett knows he'll need more than a fastball to reach the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have your other stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his professional aspirations, Beckett has maintained
his focus on winning a state championship, and Spring might have
the team to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real big,'' he said. ``My team deserves it because we've
been playing together since we were little, and coach Humphreys
deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft falls before the state tournament in Austin and by
that time Beckett could be staring millions of dollars in the face.
University of Miami third baseman Pat Burrell, the top pick in last
year's draft, received a $3.15 million signing bonus as part of a
five-year $8 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Detroit, Arizona and Minnesota own the next four picks
after Tampa Bay and any of those would be fine with Beckett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really banking on any team,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of good stuff happening. But I think I can work up (to the majors)
as fast as Kerry Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckett has signed with Blinn College in case he doesn't sign
professionally, but he'll likely be drafted no lower than third and
offered money he can't pass up.
</P>
<P>
   It might then be only a matter of time before Beckett's name is
mentioned with Ryan, Clemens and Wood. He wouldn't want it any
other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the men, they stood above the rest,'' he said. ``Any
strikeout record worth having is in a Texas pitcher's pocket right
now. I might come join them one day.''

Reds' call to bullpen offers relief to Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ It's not often the Astros want to see the opposing
manager replace a soft-tossing lefthander with a hard-throwing
righty.
</P>
<P>
   But when it happened Saturday, you could see the life return to
the dugout _ not to mention the bats _ as the Astros snatched
victory from the clutches of defeat in a spirit-lifting game at
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon called off Steve Avery just in
time for the Astros to nab a come-from-behind, 4-3 victory at the
expense of Danny Graves, who stifled the Astros for two innings on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Astros were lucky to win Saturday's game would take
away from their resilient effort. But good luck finding an Astro
who thought the team had much chance of mounting a rally against
Avery, who had the Astros under his command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avery had us frustrated,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``We didn't have many chances against him. He was changing speeds
and painting the corners and we couldn't hit him. And then they
bring in a guy who's throwing in the 90s, and we start hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just goes to show you that a well-placed 85 mile per hour
pitch is better than a 93 mile per hour pitch thrown right down the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had a 3-1 lead when Graves (1-3) entered the game. The
Astros promptly loaded the bases against him with two singles and a
walk, and Ken Caminiti's 1,500th career hit _ a single to right _
drove in two runs to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell scored the winning run on a fielder's-choice
grounder by Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon put himself in position to be second-guessed by using
Graves after the righthander had pitched two innings and thrown 26
pitches in Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Graves) obviously didn't have the kind of stuff he had
last night,'' Caminiti said. ``I don't know if he was tired from
the back-to-back games or what, but his stuff wasn't as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Graves' collapse, Reds relievers had allowed only one
earned run in their previous 15 innings. The Astros have two
relievers who can top that. Scott Elarton pitched two innings
Saturday and Billy Wagner worked the ninth for his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
   As a tandem, Elarton (2-0) and Wagner have pitched 17 scoreless
innings, allowing seven hits and eight walks. They have combined
for 29 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   And while Wagner is 5-for-5 in save opportunities, he hasn't
mastered the art of easy conversions. As is often the case, this
one took some effort.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner struck out Brian Johnson to open the ninth inning, but
Johnson reached on Tony Eusebio's passed ball. The next batter,
Chris Stynes, put down a sacrifice, which Wagner fielded. He had an
opportunity to throw out pinch runner Aaron Boone at second but
sailed his throw into center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a perfect double-play ball,'' Wagner said. ``I didn't
have a good grip on the ball and I was thinking to myself that I
should just hold onto it. But my arm wouldn't listen. That inning
could have been disastrous, but we didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get an easy save, but as long as we win it
doesn't matter how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and none out, Wagner induced a
pop-out bunt from Pokey Reese, then struck out Jeffrey Hammonds and
Mike Cameron to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving them five outs in the ninth inning was not the way we
wanted to do it,'' Dierker said. ``We had just enough left in us to
still win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery had robbed them of just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Astros for the first time since 1996, when he pitched
for Atlanta, Avery exhibited the type of mastery that has helped
him compile a 2.55 ERA in 17 career appearances against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   He retired 20 of the 27 batters he faced Saturday and didn't
allow a hit until Bagwell's infield single in the fourth. Carl
Everett singled home the Astros' run against Avery in the seventh
inning. That one was unearned thanks to Cameron's error in center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avery wasn't throwing hard, but he had a good changeup and
nobody could hit it,'' Eusebio said. ``When he threw his changeup,
it was swing and miss. He has better command than when he played
for the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   One pitch marred an otherwise solid outing by Astros starter
Mike Hampton. The Reds, who were out-hit 6-5 by the Astros, got
their runs on Barry Larkin's three-run homer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larkin's not on top of his game right now,'' Hampton said of
the Reds shortstop, who is hitting .164. ``But if you make a
mistake to him, he's going to make you pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Avery was pitching, I knew it was going to be a
low-scoring game. I'm just glad we were able to stay close enough
to come back and win it in the end.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Tad Boles' mother bought him an Australian
duster for Christmas in 1996 because the coats were on sale at
Miller Stockman, a western wear outlet, for $99.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, Tad's closest friend, Chris Morris, donned
the same sort of long black coat. Soon, all of their buddies were
wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two little hipster sophomores going down the hallway
_ people started calling them the trench coat mafia,'' Mrs. Boles
recalled of Tad and Chris, speaking Friday on the condition that
her first name not be printed. ``I personally thought they looked
kind of goofy, but they're kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The more popular students at Columbine High School poked fun at
the coats, as they had poked fun at almost everything about the
ragtag group of outcasts for years. So, like many tormented groups
before them, they embraced the epithet as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid was messing around with Chris one afternoon, and Chris
said, `You better watch out, we'll get the trench coat mafia after
you,''' recalled Kristin Thiebault, 16, one of about five girls who
hung out with the group of 10 duster-wearing boys.
</P>
<P>
   It felt good. That spring, the girls bought a business-card size
ad in the Columbine High yearbook, right there with all the jocks
and preps, showing a photograph of their friends under the label
``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the name sounds menacing, now that it is linked
to the two young men behind one of the deadliest school massacres
in American history: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Since the
shooting and bombings that left one teacher and 14 students _
including Harris and Klebold _ dead at Columbine High, the group
has been described as devoted to dark, Gothic music and culture,
computer video games with names like Doom, and all things German,
including Hitler, whose birthday coincided with Tuesday's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the group, their parents and other students at
the school say it was never much more than the gibes that gave it
its name, just a tiny clique of boys long seen as losers, finally
finding a place. In the yearbook, Harris and Klebold are not even
in the picture (and those who do appear are not wearing trench
coats).
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids that did this, they're disturbed,'' Mrs. Boles said
of Klebold and Harris, whom she knew only slightly as Tad's
friends. ``The things that they did had nothing to do with what the
group was about.'' The group, she added, ``wasn't about anything
else but hanging out with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son Tad, a blond wearing dark sunglasses, a black
long-sleeved shirt with a gold design, and black dress pants that
hung off his skinny hips, said Saturday that a lawyer had advised
him not to discuss his friends in detail. But the picture painted
so far by the authorities and the news media ``is not at all
accurate,'' he said, dragging on a cigarette, a bright turquoise
beeper sticking out of his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Thiebault, who described Klebold as having been her ``best
friend,'' said members of the group often stayed up late at one
another's homes, watching movies or playing Goldeneye, a video game
on Nintendo 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all get on our four controllers and shoot each other up
as many times as we could,'' she said, standing on the front stoop
of the Harris home Saturday after dropping off a bunch of
fire-orange roses and a card for his parents. ``Eric and Dylan
always lost,'' she said, recalling that they would be particularly
upset when they were beaten by girls. ``It was just this constant
battle of who kills who.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, her friends sometimes fantasized about bombing Columbine _
along with all of its cliques. ``I don't know any high school
student who doesn't joke about blowing up the school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group were computer enthusiasts; a Web site
attributed to Harris mentioned the trench coat mafia and featured
drawings of gun-toting monsters and directions for making pipe
bombs. Recently, Mrs. Boles said, the group focused more on making
videos, like the one by Klebold and Harris that is said to show
them pretending to kill athletes in a school hallway.
</P>
<P>
   The group used to hang out at Amazing Fantasy Comics in
Littleton, but the store manager, Shawn Carey, said members had
stopped coming about a year ago as they grew more interested in
paintball and girls. Friends said they were heavily into
role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons. They liked to drink
shots of After Shock, a brand of cinnamon or peppermint schnapps.
</P>
<P>
   Some connected to the group wore the black lipstick and black
fingernail polish associated with Gothic teen culture. But Klebold
and Harris did not, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the two were not central to the trench coat group, just
friends of a core member.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles, a mother of five, insisted that the trench coat
owners were just like any other young men, interested in bamboo
sword fights, ``Star Wars'' and computer games, but also the prom
and that great American teen-age tradition: working on their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a whole bunch of friends who didn't fit into any
other type of groups,'' explained Miss Thiebault, who wore round
wire glasses, her long hair pulled back in a ponytail. ``We were
just all these people who routinely got made fun of, all through
elementary school and junior high.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stair, 18, a 1998 Columbine High graduate who was among
the group's original members, acknowledged that he and his friends
had learned how to make pipe bombs, but shrugged off the
significance. ``You see things on TV, they talked about how easy it
is,'' he said. ``So we decided to see if it was. There was never
any intention to build them or use them.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine students said the trench coat group, including Harris,
often spoke in German and wore clothes decorated with swastikas.
Klebold was said to have had a German flag sewn onto his coat.
</P>
<P>
   But both Miss Thiebault and Stair said there was no Hitler
connection to the group. ``We're not a homosexual group, or
Satanists, or neo-Nazis,'' Stair said as he took a break Saturday
from his job as assistant manager of a local Arby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were actually prejudiced,'' he said, then added,
``yeah, we hated jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Denee Taylor, 17, who has six rings in her ear and a stud in her
tongue, has socialized with the group since she came to Columbine a
year ago from Newark Valley, N.Y. The group was ``a little weird,''
she acknowledged, ``but what's wrong with being different?''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Nelson, 18, a Columbine senior who describes himself as ``an
outcast by choice,'' said he had played Doom with Klebold and
Harris over the Internet and, yes, ``they always seemed a little
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The preps and jocks who rule the school taunted the group in the
hallways with sarcastic gibes of ``nice coat.'' They were pushed
against lockers and had rocks and even lunchroom mashed potatoes
thrown in their face, members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got picked on on a routine basis,'' said Miss
Thiebault. ``I think they were jealous'' of the tight-knit group,
Miss Thiebault said of the athletes. ``I broke up a lot of fights
between the jocks and the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, members of the group were outraged when a group
of freshmen football players surrounded Morris in the cafeteria,
yelling taunts and backing him up against a wall. ``This was
something we would not forget,'' Stair said. Things escalated last
year, Miss Thiebault said, and the trench coaters actually
scheduled a sort of rumble with some jocks _ but the athletes never
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   When an athlete arrested for burglary ended up with a
misdemeanor conviction and a sentence of community service, the
mafia members seethed. ``If Dylan and Eric did something like
that,'' Miss Thiebault said, ``they'd be sitting in jail right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Koeniger, a 17-year-old junior on the Columbine Rebels
football team, acknowledged that some athletes had teased the
trench coat mafia. But, he said, the group often seemed to be
asking for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're different, why wouldn't we look at them as weird?''
he asked, recalling a student last year who seemed never to shower.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the people in town tried to console each other
last week with makeshift memorials of flowers and banners, sobbing
on television about the events that had taken place in their
community, members of the trench coat mafia and their friends spent
much of the time talking to the police. The authorities have
suggested that the two gunmen may have had help in getting their
weapons and bombs into the school.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Thiebault said that Morris, who was questioned by the
police the afternoon of the shootings and then released, had not
been brought in as a suspect, but had instead been asked to help
negotiate with the two killers, before the authorities realized
that they had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   She herself was not at school that morning, and another girl
affiliated with the group, Pauline Colby, was home sick, Miss
Thiebault said. Tad Boles and another member of the trench coat
mafia had quit Columbine a few months back, and Morris, she said,
takes only morning classes and so was long gone from campus when
the attack began during 5th period.
</P>
<P>
   But four of their friends were in the cafeteria, where the
shooting started, Miss Thiebault said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Harris and Klebold had never hinted at their plans. ``I
would have tried to stop them, and I might not be standing here
right now,'' she said, imagining what might have happened if she
had been in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might have motivated the attack, Miss Thiebault said:
``They just snapped. If the majority of people were as open-minded
as my friends Dylan and Eric, this probably would never have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boles sees no choice but to separate the killers from the
rest of the trench coat group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just kids,'' she said, pointing out that her son plays
the cello, and that his friend, Morris, plays the violin. ``All of
them are in shock. They're all destroyed. I don't know _ they're
never going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the little ones, even this one's affected, he senses our
moods,'' she said, bouncing her 5-month-old grandson, Seth, on her
lap. ``His mom sat here with us the other day. She said, `We're
going to teach our kids better.'''

EX-HIGH SCHOOL TEAMMATES, COACHES RELISHED ELWAY'S CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They knew it was coming for a couple of years now,
the announcement from John Elway that he was retiring from
football.
</P>
<P>
   But Elway's former high school teammates and coaches, who saw a
Hall of Fame career in the making at Granada Hills in the late
1970s, were still surprised by the news that Elway is going to step
away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping John would give it one more go, but that's my
selfishness,'' said Scott Marshall, a wide receiver at Granada
Hills when Elway was the star quarterback. ``I just love watching
him play.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of Elway's 16-year career in the NFL _ all with the
Denver Broncos _ is expected to be made official Monday, according
to several news sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about (Elway's retirement) for a long
time,'' said Granada Hills co-football coach Darryl Stroh, an
assistant with the Highlanders when Elway was there. ``I'm sorry to
see it come. It's been a great ride. I don't know what I'm going to
do on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway had become more than a former teammate for men like
Marshall and Chris Sutton, who caught the winning pass in Granada
Hills' legendary 40-35 win over San Fernando in 1977, which
established Elway as a premier quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   For them and other teammates like Larry Palmer, an offensive
lineman, and Paul Scheper, a fullback, Elway has been their link to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him playing is like me being out there,'' said Marshall, the
dean of discipline and assistant football coach at Alemany High.
``This kind of finalizes it for me. Now it's a new generation. It's
going to be a whole new feeling now that John's not playing
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said Sutton talked to Elway after this year's Super
Bowl, and Elway indicated the physical punishment he's taken from
playing football for almost 25 years had taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``John said his body was tired,'' Marshall said. ``I know how I
feel getting out of bed in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills renamed its football field after Elway last June,
almost five months after Elway helped lead the Broncos to their
first Super Bowl victory. Elway and the Broncos won the Super Bowl
again this past season, and Stroh thought it was appropriate
Elway's final game was a victory on sport's grandest stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a good time, to quit on top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Elway's drive to succeed, his extreme competitiveness,
that made those who knew him believe his decision to retire would
be difficult. Elway's distaste for losing _ and not being able to
play _ has become one of his personality traits known by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves (football) so much,'' said Jack Neumeier, Elway's
head coach at Granada Hills. ``He's going to miss it.''

EDITORIAL: THE SCOURGE OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, April 25:
</P>
<P>
   There is of course no certain antidote to the kind of violence
that claimed 15 lives at Columbine High School last week, no simple
way to predict its occurrence, no magic cure for the pathologies
that make it possible in the first place. President Clinton himself
confessed to a feeling of mystification when he visited a Virginia
high school last Thursday to share his grief.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he promised to search for answers, as we all must. The
Columbine massacre followed a half-dozen incidents of deadly school
violence since late 1997, and while it would distort reality to say
that the country is in the grip of an epidemic, people are clearly
on edge, especially since violence has a way of copying violence.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there is no perfect solution cannot be used as a
cover for doing nothing. The country is far from powerless. There
are useful steps that can be taken by governments, school
officials, teachers, parents and even the students themselves. Here
are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; School Security. &LR;  Americans rightly resist regimentation. But
schools must be weapon-free zones, and if that requires extra
security, so be it. In the 1996-97 school year, more than 6,000
students were expelled for bringing guns to school. About 5 percent
of the nation's schools, including some in New York City, use
walk-through metal detectors, and an additional 10 percent use
hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials should look hard at the experience
at these schools. If the considerable investment in equipment and
the personnel to run it seems to be paying off, a dramatic
expansion in the use of metal detectors, beyond the relatively
modest growth envisioned by the Clinton administration, would be in
order. In addition, Clinton said Friday that a federal program
begun last year would underwrite 2,000 new police officers in
schools that ask for them. Congress should weigh an expansion of
that program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Early Intervention.  &LR; What little is known of the twisted
motives of the two troubled, suicidal killers raises profound
cultural and psychological questions, the answers to which lie not
in Washington or the state legislatures, but in the schools and
among parents, students and community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after a similar shooting at a high school in
Springfield, Ore., Clinton directed the Departments of Education
and Justice to develop an ``early warning guide'' to help adults
reach out to troubled children quickly and effectively. The guide,
written in intimidating bureaucratese and probably gathering dust
on many school shelves, nevertheless provides a useful checklist of
common behavioral characteristics of troubled students and a range
of strategies _ including anonymous hotlines, ``anger management''
programs and other forms of counseling _ to engage students and
parents without violating privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these strategies could have prevented the Columbine
tragedy is unknowable. But news reports suggest that the two
killers had exhibited threatening behavior and left plenty of other
warning signs scattered about, including apocalyptic messages on
the Internet. Possibly because of a failure in communication
between students, parents, teachers and other officials, these
clues were never assembled in a way that might have prevented the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gun Control.  &LR; There are more than 200 million weapons floating
around this country, and a few common-sense gun-control measures
that would make it a lot harder for confused Hitler worshipers in
black trench coats to amass a huge amount of lethal firepower.
Clinton had already announced his intention to resubmit legislation
aimed at getting guns out of the hands of young people. It would
hold adults criminally liable when juveniles obtain weapons of
theirs and use them in crimes. It would also require safety locks
on guns.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine shooting may finally persuade House Speaker Dennis
Hastert and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, to allow a
prompt recorded vote on these and other long-buried gun-control
measures. It is the least that Congress can do in this moment of
national grief.

THE REAL REASON FOR DECOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you read this, you very likely will be sitting at your
breakfast table _ warm, dry and nibbling at some light
refreshment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I already will have been a full week in the place where this
time of the year always finds me _ in the springtime woods,
pretending to hunt turkeys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it is raining, I will be wet to the skin. But wet or dry, I
will be asleep against my tree. After a week of getting up at 4
o'clock every morning, you find you can sleep anywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is how Indian fakirs do it. They hunt turkeys for several
weeks, then they are perfectly willing to walk barefoot on glowing
coals to get to their bed, even if it is a bed of nails. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fortnight ago, I had to go to the country on another matter. I
pulled in the cabin drive, and started down to the pond to see if
by chance the dogwoods were in bloom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two turkeys _ a mature gobbler and one that might have been a
yearling _ were standing by my lane. They held their ground,
seeming rather indignant at the intrusion. Then, stately and
unhurried, they strode off into the woods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the season on them opened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now _ long before now, actually _ those two will have
gathered all their kin and acquaintances and vanished into some
other dimension of space and time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year it's the same. In March and early April, wild turkeys
are everywhere. I get letters from folks who complain that turkeys
are tramping down the petunias in their flower gardens and making
messes on the porch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mention that the time for the hunt is nearing and people snicker
at the notion that it might be considered sport. They tell of
seeing flocks _ no, herds _ of turkeys grazing beside the road.
Fifty of them. Or maybe it was 100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You hunt them with a gun?'' they say incredulously. ``Why, I
could have killed one with a stick.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By opening day, however, the turkeys killable with sticks no
longer are available. Which is why, in recent years, I have come to
depend more and more on decoys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Decoys used to be bulky, hard-bodied objects that were awkward
to carry and clattered against brush as you walked, alerting every
living creature in the woods that Nimrod was on the prowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the technology has greatly advanced. Now they are made of a
kind of flexible foam rubber, and several of them easily can be
wadded into the pockets of a hunting coat. When removed, they
return to their original shape and may be strategically positioned
around the tree against which you are sleeping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their coloring is quite realistic. And because of their light
weight, the slightest breath of a breeze causes them to shift and
nod on their stakes. The similarity in appearance to an actual
turkey is remarkable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hunters believe that decoys attract a gobbler, or at least
distract him as he comes unsuspecting to his doom. I have no
experience with that, but I will take their word for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I like decoys for another reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Say you have been in the woods since 5 in the morning and it is
now a little after 6, with the dawn just coming. You have been
napping against your tree for 30 minutes or so when a good-size bug
crawls up your pant leg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In that intermediate state between sleep and waking, you wonder
idly if it is an ant, a beetle, or possibly a scorpion. Your eyes
open. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what you see, in the blue first light of morning, is a
turkey standing directly out in front of you. Your pulse rate goes
to 200. The moment is electric _ what every turkey hunter dreams
of. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it's your decoy out there. Go ahead and shoot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is as good as it's likely to get. &QL;
</P>

PRESIDENTIAL RACES ARE CHANGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny how the winds of change blow through presidential
politics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the race to watch was on the GOP side, where a
whole boatload of candidates were lining up. But now George W. Bush
looks all but invincible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic side was supposed to be boring because the race
appeared so utterly predictable. Al Gore, with his vice
presidential trappings, was the man; Bill Bradley the
afterthought. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But now the Democrats may be the party with the donnybrook.
Wooden Al, the self-proclaimed Internet inventor, is bleeding
polling points by the gallon. Bradley is looking as if he might
have a chance, which is more than he could have hoped for at this
point against a sitting vice president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mid-April survey in New Hampshire, site of the first
presidential primary, had Gore at 52 percent and Bradley at 35.
Said pollster John Zogby: ``Gore is perilously close to 50 percent,
and Bradley has gained dramatically in the last month. With numbers
like these, Bradley could win in New Hampshire.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bradley already is in an enviable position for a long
shot: If Gore slips, Bradley is there to grab the baton because no
other Democrat is in the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former NBA star, helped his cause by raising $4.3
million this year, a total that surpassed expectations. Gore took
in $8.9 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley is drawing attention for his ``big ideas,'' such as
combating racism, which contrasts nicely with the bite-size
proposals that Gore espouses, such as fighting traffic congestion.
To be sure, Bradley has yet to detail how he would accomplish his
goals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In prosperous times, when issues fade in importance, Bradley's
biggest selling point may be the fresh start he offers the nation.
He is, perhaps more than anything else, not Bill Clinton. Where the
president is slick, Bradley is plodding. Where Clinton's
extracurricular activities are legend, Bradley comes off as
terribly old-fashioned _ in a soothing way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore's also a Dudley Do-right. The difference is Gore has been
so fiercely loyal to the president, as he must, that he and Clinton
appear linked forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore can't criticize Clinton. He must support him in the wake of
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He must back the president's policies
in Bosnia. Bradley, meantime, can express the doubts he shares with
many Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fresh starts, after times of turmoil, are enormously appealing
prospects in American politics. That's why one Kansas Democrat told
me Friday that, sure, people are still talking about Gore. But
they're also saying, ``Don't rule out Bill Bradley.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why a leading Colorado Democrat told the Rocky Mountain
News last week that ``We're afraid Gore might be painted with some
of the Clinton stuff.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the recent Kansas City, Mo., mayor's race, George Blackwood
was in Gore's position, the second-in-command who focused like a
laser beam on the city's good times. Blackwood refused to admit
that change was needed, a stand that turned off many voters already
uneasy about the corruption that rocked City Hall in recent years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Blackwood ran as an insider because he did not
want to criticize Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, whose support he
desperately sought. Gore faces something of the same issue. He must
distance himself from Clinton, but not in a way that appears
disloyal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore remains an enormously tough opponent. The Democrat
establishment is squarely on his side. Bradley has yet to pick up
the backing of a single member of Congress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, beware. You've got a race. &QL;

PARENTS NEED TO EXAMINE THEIR ROLE IN WAKE OF COLORADO TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD AND LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where were the parents? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did the mothers and fathers of teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold make crucial mistakes? How could they not have seen
what was coming? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the horror at Columbine High School in suburban
Denver, these are questions every parent must be asking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just do the math on the time that went into preparations. The
killers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Made pipe bombs and had at least one propane tank with
explosives attached, weighing 25 pounds, and put together an
enormous ammunition supply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Developed Web sites filled with hate and instructions on how to
make bombs, painted their faces, and learned and practiced German
expressions and Nazi salutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Collected swastikas and black clothing, and apparently,
memorized their hyperviolent video games _ enough so their rampage
inside the school echoed the games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if Harris and Klebold were amazingly efficient at their
abhorrent activities, it's work that had to take weeks, if not
months, to finish. Were the children so skilled at concealing what
was going on? Could their parents have been oblivious to all this? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday in Colorado, Sheriff John Stone of Jefferson County,
site of the massacre, placed some of the blame on the killers'
parents. Stone said investigators found a shotgun barrel on a
dresser and bomb-making materials in one of the youths' homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible, and the parents
should have known,'' Stone told reporters. ``I think parents should
be accountable for their kids' actions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that the parents of Harris and Klebold, none of
whom have commented on the shootings beyond statements expressing
sympathy that were released by their attorneys, might not be
especially different from many parents in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably isn't the result of exceptionally bad parenting,
unfortunately,'' said Kansas City, Mo., area child psychologist
Jerry Wyckoff. ``Instead, it's more likely the result of average
parenting, just like most of what goes on out in Littleton, or in
our community.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there are hundreds of thousands of kids about
to explode in American neighborhoods. Nobody knows, or ever will
know, just why these two kids turned into killers. Was it the real
presence of true evil on Earth? Insanity? The violent, irrational
dynamics that can develop in a group? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wyckoff says that, in his experience, the intense boredom,
disaffection and alienation that can contribute to such horrors as
the massacre at Columbine are more prevalent in middle- and
upper-middle-class suburbs, where kids typically have lots of money
and lots of free time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Generally, in those circumstances, Wyckoff said: ``What we have
are parents who are providing their kids with everything they could
ever need, except supervision. So the kids fill time by getting
lost in violent games and music and television. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, the parents are sitting upstairs hoping
everything downstairs is OK. Most of the time it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Heide has evaluated 90 kids who have killed. She is a
University of South Florida-Tampa psychologist and criminologist
and author of two books on the subject. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most consistent link among young killers she has studied? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They all talk about the lack of limits they lived under,'' she
said. ``Parents have to be the ones who set the limits. We have to
understand that kids who keep getting away with greater and greater
wrongs may well continue to push out. We all know where that can
lead.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She points out that setting limits does not make for a popular
parent, in the short term. But in time, children not only respect
limits but crave them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debora Bell-Dolan, a University of Missouri child psychologist,
says setting limits begins with talking and listening, and getting
involved in a child's life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can almost hear the conversation these boys had with their
parents,'' she said. ``They'd ask their sons where they were going
and they would say something like `working on a project in the
garage.' And the parents would think, `Oh, that's great. Just like
Boy Scouts.' Too few parents would take a great enough interest to
actually go out and take a look at what that project might be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that involvement, including a willingness to sneak
a peek through a child's room every now and then, is exactly what
is needed. If a child is playing violent games, it might not be
necessary to ban the game from the house. But the parent should
play the game with the child enough to know exactly what is going
on, and should talk about the game and the difference between
fantasy and reality. If there is a problem, the parent has to be
willing to then ban the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for violent music and movies. It also goes for
everyday life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts also agreed that any parent not using the
Columbine tragedy as a way to start talking about typical teen-age
problems was making a sad mistake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you start this dialogue when your children are young
and continue it through adulthood,'' Bell-Dolan said. ``But if that
relationship hasn't existed during the first 15 years of your
child's life, start it now _ today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This message isn't only for the more affluent. Experts agree the
violence that springs from poorer, inner-city neighborhoods has
similar roots, a lack of parental supervision and involvement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Martasin, a parent of suburban kids and the public
relations director for the Hickman Mills School District in Jackson
County, Mo., said he insisted on knowing where his son is at all
times. ``My son has a beeper,'' he said. ``I look at it as an
electronic leash. When that goes off, if it's me, he has five
minutes to call me back, or he's grounded.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or, for instance, this weekend, 13-year-old Pamela Todd of Blue
Springs, Mo., wanted to attend the Korn heavy-metal rock concert at
Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Mo. As she stood in line waiting to
enter, her sparkled eyes and pale, eerie lipstick fit right into
the crowd around her. However, Jim and Sydney Todd, her dad and
mom, seemed out of place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She really wanted to go, and there was no way I was going to
let her go alone,'' Jim Todd said. ``So we compromised.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pamela's thoughts on her parents' attendance: ``They're cool.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Todd pointed out he wasn't in any way looking forward to the
music, and Sydney Todd brought earplugs. But he did see the concert
as a chance to spend extra time with his daughter, and despite the
noise awaiting inside, the trip appeared worthwhile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bottom line, as parents, is we've got to help our
children build a good moral foundation,'' he said. ``But I also
think, after they start growing up, too often we allow everything
else going on in our lives to cut down the time with our children.
I mean, I'm obviously only here for my daughter tonight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am here for her.'' &QL;

MIX OF ABORTION, SOCIAL SECURITY JUST TOO CONTROVERSIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a columnist gets extra credit for stimulating reader
reaction, last week's effort playing off U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback's
remarks about abortion and Social Security was a bell ringer.
</P>
<P>
   The column agreed with the Kansas Republican's contention that
abortions undermined Social Security's long-term funding. The
response was both humongous and overwhelmingly critical. Of more
than 50 e-mails, StarTouch responses and phone calls, only three
readers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Sam Brownback was a moron, but you, from whom I
expect more logic and reason, apparently are worse than he is,''
was the reaction from a StarTouch respondent whose comments were
typical.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics were as caustic as they were disinclined to
acknowledge the narrow economic context of my column. Brownback
said abortions reduced the potential pool of taxpayers needed to
support the long-range funding needs of Social Security. This is
inarguable, and goes beyond mere opinion. As support for the
argument, credible estimates of the potential financial effects
were offered from respectable, albeit biased, sources.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, all who disagreed with the premise failed to
confront the ineluctable fact that Social Security's demographic
problem is a shrinking pool of taxpaying contributors and an
expanding pool of beneficiaries. Here's a sample of some dissenting
e-mail observations and my view of why the comments miss the mark:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe any responsible person would advocate
increasing the population more than it already is...our planet can
hold just so many people.'' (OK, how many people would that be?
Sorry, but Malthus is still wrong. Try to think of human beings not
as burdens, but as resources, because that is what most of them
become.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You stated the math is simple, citing 16 workers for one
Social Security beneficiary a half-century ago compared to (three
workers) today...you are not comparing `apples to apples.' Fifty
years ago there were fewer eligible beneficiaries than there are
today.'' (My point exactly. Thank you for helping me make it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``A potential flaw with this argument is that it seems very
unlikely the average aborted pregnancy would have resulted in a
person who would have been the same as the average not-aborted
pregnancy....Therefore, it is not at all clear that aborted people
would contribute as much to society as you are suggesting.'' (We
cannot be certain on this point. What we do know with certainty,
though, is that Social Security's viability depends on adequate
numbers of taxpayers to finance the system. Period.)
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you reconcile (this view) with the fact that since the
beginning of the century birth rates of every successive generation
(have) been declining.'' (No reconciliation is needed. Your
observation is correct. Declining birth rates due to other factors
are indeed another demographic problem for Social Security. It
could even be argued that they exacerbate abortion's impact.)
</P>
<P>
   ``/{The Kansas City Star/} would be a better newspaper if you
resigned to get a job for which you are qualified.'' (You are not
alone in that opinion. By the way, what job might that be?)
</P>
<P>
   Thank you all for your feedback. It wasn't fun, but it was
instructive.

ROCKETS STILL MISFIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The post-game atmosphere in the visitor's dressing room at the
Sports Arena usually seems as foreboding as a bachelor party.
</P>
<P>
   But something peculiar happened there on Friday night. After a
hotshot team was outscored by the Clippers, the place turned into
Jerry Springer's green room.
</P>
<P>
   For our top-ranked rant, we take you to the space occupied by
Antoine Carr:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to play for no sorry-assed quittin' team,''
said Carr, a veteran of two Utah Jazz NBA Finals losses who now
plays for the Houston Rockets. Carr probably is upset because the
Rockets are supposed to win the NBA championship every time Michael
Jordan retires. ``I don't need this; I could play for Timbuktu.''
</P>
<P>
   We doubt that Timbuktu has cap room, Antoine.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, someone else is clearing his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't panic after one loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of Charles Barkley, a notepad-stuffin'
Rocket who made the above statement about three hours before Carr
started up. Barkley was whipping through the preamble to his
nightly chat with the sporting press, and his panic postponement
referred to Wednesday's defeat at the hands of the astonishingly
mortal Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who wants an NBA championship ring badly enough to have
signed for the million-dollar exception, insists everything is fine
on Planet Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's got a better life than me,'' he said, ``I really
want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the basketball side of Barkley's life was made
miserable by a young Clipper named Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Seated a 10-foot bank shot away from Barkley was first-year
Rocket Scottie Pippen, who has more rings than the Olympic logo.
After Wednesday's loss to Dallas, Pippen allegedly drove his jalopy
through a red traffic light. He was pulled over by cops who quickly
suspected Jordan's ex-faithful sidekick of having a blood-alcohol
number that eclipsed his field-goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Pip spun away from any legal chitchat, but did manage
to put the Clippers' final days at the Sports Arena into grim
perspective:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they're leaving the Boston Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Woof.
</P>
<P>
   Seated across the aisle from Pippen was Hakeem Olajuwon, the
Hall of Fame-bound center and last surviving member of the Rockets'
two championship crews. Teamed with Barkley and Pippen, he
represents more star power than Mike Ovitz. But when the Clips were
finished with 'em, the Rockets were a mediocre 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Pippen still looks uncomfortable pushing buttons in the
Rocket offense, which usually winds up going low postal, anyway.
Houston starts a pair of extremely gifted rookie guards who can do
everything except pass muster as card-carrying assist guys. Othella
Harrington, who excelled as a low-post reserve, has been lost to
foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But they still expect to maintain adequate savvy for a playoff
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat any team in the league,'' Barkley said, ``but we
have to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter with a straight face asks if that beating includes
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Lakers make the playoffs, we'll be there,'' Barkley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they rallied to drag the Clippers into overtime,
that was the Rockets' best shot of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Tap City for draft?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Draft, which is expected to be thinner than a
sportswriter's wallet, could receive a boost if Lamar Odom decides
to become part of it. If Rhode Island's 6-foot-9 point forward has
made his decision, he's keeping it a secret.
</P>
<P>
   If he goes for the loot, Odom who is projected as a top-three
pick must break the news to the NBA by midnight on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't come out,'' said one NBA talent jockey, ``I'll
be shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Corey Maggette, the precocious acrobat from Duke,
said he has yet to decide if he'll return to school for his
sophomore season or enter the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Blake, the NBA's pit bull of player evaluation, had a
typically frosty opinion when asked of Maggette's immediate pro
impact. ``He's had one good game,'' said Blake of the 6-5 swingman
who was unable to crack Duke's starting lineup as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Attention, draft wizards ... last week's pre-draft Desert
Classic in Tempe didn't exactly inspire rhapsodies from NBA
personnel hounds.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if any of the participants were swell players, one
judge said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Posey, an active and intense small forward from
Xavier, was the favorite of many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Posey can't play in this league,'' one longtime scout said,
``the NBA is in much better shape than most people think.''
</P>
<P>
   The lottery (sometimes referred to as ``The Clipper Variety
Hour'') will be held May 22.
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Another title for Edney
</P>
<P>
   Former Long Beach Poly High and UCLA star Tyus Edney was voted
the Most Valuable Player in Thursday's Euro League championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   Edney, who saved UCLA's championship bacon in 1995 before taking
a brief NBA spin, scored 14 points, grabbed six rebounds and handed
out six assists for Lithuanian powerhouse Zaligiris Kaunus in an
82-74 upset of Kinder Bologna. You get bonus points if you remember
that Michael Olowokandi spent a few weeks playing for Kinder.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the final, Kinder had to go through Bologna's
TeamSystem, and former Long Beach State standout Andrew Betts.
</P>
<P>
   (sub) Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors don't have Charles Oakley under contract for
next season, but they do have the first-round draft pick of the
miserable Denver Nuggets, who coughed up that baby to get Chauncey
Billups out of Toronto. ... He's a rap star, an agent, a failed
player and now in cahoots with Converse. He's Percy Miller, also
known as Master P, and his ``No Limit'' empire has made an
agreement with Converse to produce a sneaker called ``The Smooth.''
You may have seen Cleveland's Brevin Knight selling the shoe in a
commercial. According to rumor, Miller's next gig is ``Master P
Theatre.'' ... This just in: Michael Jordan thinks Vancouver's Mike
Bibby is the NBA's best rookie! Here's a stunner: like Mike, Bibby
is represented by David Falk. ... According to at least one of
their Pistons' teammates, Christian Laettner (an ex-Duke star) and
Jerry Stackhouse (North Carolina) scrapped over a card-game dispute
on the team plane. Gee, if Nike decides to do another March Madness
blood-doping commercial, we've just discovered the perfect rats.
