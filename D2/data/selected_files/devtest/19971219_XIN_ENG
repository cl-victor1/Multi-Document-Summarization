<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday announced that U.S. troops will remain there as part of a
multi-national peacekeeping force beyond his earlier deadline of
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that Clinton delays a deadline for
withdrawal. Clinton set no deadline for the extended U.S. military
presence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The progress (in Bosnia) is unmistakable, but it is not yet
irreversible," Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to fly to Bosnia Sunday night to
spread some holiday cheer in the battered former Yugoslav republic
and to buck up the troops. He said some members of Congress had
agreed to go with him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the size and duration of the new commitment would
be determined by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
But he added that whatever it decides "must have substantial
support from Congress and the American people," Clinton said.

agreement signed here today.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement is made in accordance with option B of the
Paris Club agreement.
</P>
<P>
The debt will now be repaid over a period of 33 years with

insured by the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreement, Japanese charge d'affairs Takayuki
Miyashita said by rescheduling Zambia's debt, Japan will help it
to divert its resources to economic growth and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Japan will continue to assist the country as long as the aid
given is used to implement the right projects, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza
urged the Japanese government to adopt option A of the Paris Club
agreement so that Zambia can receive more debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's per capita debt stands at 800 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: U.S. Foreign Policy: Adjustments and Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- 1997 has been a year when
the U.S. foreign policy has undergone significant adjustments,
defining Europe and the Asia-Pacific as two focal regions in its
global diplomacy in seeking to establish U.S. leadership in world
affairs. Much the same, it has also been a year when the
U.S. foreign policy has met with stern challenges.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright emphasized at her first
press conference in January after taking office that Europe and
the Asia-Pacific would top President Bill Clinton's foreign
affairs agenda during his second-term.
</P>
<P>
The intention, as some analysts noted, was to set up two
U.S.-led communities on both the Atlantic and Pacific rims in the
next century and establish a uni-polar world order by "engagement
and enlargement."
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the U.S. wish, the world has been moving further
toward a multi-polar pattern in the year, posing a grim challenge
to the U.S. global ambition.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, the U.S. has spared no efforts to push NATO's
eastward expansion to bring the former Soviet allies in central
and eastern Europe under its wings. Its aim was to fill the
security vacuum left over by the collapse of the former Soviet
Union and to strategically cripple Russia so that no power in the
region can pose any real threat to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
Despite the jump-start of its expansion at the July Madrid
summit, NATO's cohesion has become somewhat weakened rather than
strengthened. And on trade and security matters, trans-Atlantic
disputes have intensified.
</P>
<P>
First the U.S. and its European allies could not see eye to eye
over which east and central European countries should be the first
group to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Then, NATO's European members hoped to gradually establish,
through NATO's enlargement, a European defense system with less
U.S. control. France, for example, challenged the U.S. control
over the NATO's Southern European Command. It criticized the
U.S. at the Madrid summit for arrogating all powers and decided to
delay its return to the NATO's military integration mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) had a quarrel with the U.S. in
September over the merger of two giant American aircraft makers,
the Boeing Co. and the McDonnell Douglas Corp., bringing the two
sides again to the brink of a trade war.
</P>
<P>
And the EU still refuses to budge in its challenge to the
D'amato Bill and Helms-Burton Law, which were designed to tighten
sanctions against Libya, Iran and Cuba but badly hurt the
interests of the EU countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Charges Clinton With Intimidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, strongly criticized the United States
Thursday charging it with intimidating the Duma over ratification
of the second stage of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START-II).
</P>
<P>
Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznyov told the press that if U.S.
President Bill Clinton put pressure on the Duma, the START-II
would never be ratified.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters Wednesday that he would visit Russia
only after the START-II was ratified.
</P>
<P>
Describing Clinton's remarks as "challenging and outrageous",
Seleznyov said Clinton "is imposing his terms on us".
</P>
<P>
"Dealing this way with the world does not give anyone credit.
I don't think anyone would cry in Russia if president Clinton did
not come."
</P>
<P>
The Duma Speaker noted that the date for considering the
ratification the START-II had yet to be fixed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the former Soviet Union signed, in July 1991, the
START-I which required both sides to reduce by 30 percent their
strategic offensive nuclear arms within seven years of it going
into force.
</P>
<P>
The START-II, signed by the two powers in January 1993,
required the two to reduce by two-thirds their nuclear missiles
before 2003.
</P>
<P>
However, the START-II could not enter into force without
ratification by the two countries' governments.
</P>
<P>
During the U.S.-Russia summit held in Helsinki, Finland, in
March 1997, Clinton said the U.S. congress would follow the Russia
Duma in ratifying the START-II.
</P>
<P>
So far, neither the date of Clinton's visit to Russia, nor the
date of START-II's ratification by the Duma has been fixed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Most importantly, the U.S. diplomacy in Europe faces
resistance from Russia, which favors a multi-polar world in which
it can have a rightful place for itself. Throughout the year,
Russia has been opposing NATO's eastward expansion for security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. initiated a redefining of future NATO-Russia
relations to allow Moscow's voice on security matters, expanded
G-7 summit to include Russia and promised Russia's accession to
the Paris Club and World Trade Organization, these efforts failed
to silence Russia's opposition to NATO's enlargement. Instead,
U.S.-Russian relations have clearly cooled down as compared with
the initial stage of the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific which has become another focal region in
its global diplomacy, the U.S. has not only accepted the region's
growing importance in world affairs but also acknowledged its own
great economic and security stakes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after she became secretary of state, Albright put
China, Japan and South Korea on her visiting agenda. In September,
the U.S. and Japan signed a revised Defense Guidelines for
Military Cooperation to strengthen their alliance. In October when
Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to the U.S., the
two sides agreed to establish a constructive strategic
partnership. Together with China, the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea and South Korea, the U.S. launched the four-party talks
on the Korean Peninsula issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the adjusted U.S. foreign policy in the region also
faces great challenges.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, a
product of the Cold War, has made the Asian-Pacific countries more
vigilant and worried. Analysts noted that by strengthening its
alliance with Japan, the U.S. wanted to play a dominant role in
the Asian-Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
Its relations with China have considerably improved in the past
year. But the U.S. still must carefully and properly handle its
disputes with China over the issues of human rights, trade and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Aside from these two focal regions, the U.S. has also made
adjustments in its policy toward Latin America, Africa, Central
Asia and the Middle East. However, these adjustments have not been
as forceful as those toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon report has said that the U.S. would continue to
attach great importance to its relations with countries in Europe
and the Asia-Pacific for quite a long time in the future, because
it is unlikely that a power capable of challenging the
U.S. leadership in international affairs would emerge from other
parts of the world.

LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy will reschedule Zambia's
debt totaling 12.3 million U.S. dollars under an agreement signed
here today.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling of the debt is in accordance with a Paris
Club Minute.
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreement, Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza
said that the debt now will be repaid over a 33-year period and
that the interest applicable will be reduced to obtain a
reduction in net present value of 67 percent on original loans.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's external debt is a constraint to its economic
development as the country is left with little resources to
channel into the productive sector after debt service, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Italian Ambassador to Zambia Margher
Costa said the heavy debt burden is a constraint to economic
development in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
She pledged Italy's continued assistance to Zambia in
enhancing economic growth and social development.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's per capita foreign debt stands at 800 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Trade Surplus Down in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's imports grew faster
than exports in October, and trade surplus fell to its lowest
level since December 1993, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
In October, exports dipped by 0.6 percent to 25.07 billion
Canadian dollars (17.5 billion U.S. dollars) while imports grew by
2.7 percent to 24.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's trade surplus dropped to 581 million
dollars, the lowest level since December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The surplus for the first 10 months of this year stands at
19.37 billion dollars, compared with 35.46 billion dollars for the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
There are three factors that have contributed to the decline of
Canada's trade surplus this year, the federal statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
First, machinery and equipment imports have been climbing
sharply since May 1996 in response to major investments by
Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
Second, increased imports of aircraft from European Union in
1997 has resulted in a growing trade deficit with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Third, while Canada's exports to the United States have shown
strong growth this year, its exports to Japan have been slipping
since last December.

WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Initial claims for state
unemployment insurance in the United States during the week ended
December 13 increased by 5,000, the Labor Department said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the small growth in weekly applications for
unemployment benefits could be interpreted into a seasonally

</P>
<P>
The department noted this was the first week the moving average
declined in seven weeks since the week ended on October 25.
</P>
<P>
The small increase was in line with expectations and left
jobless claims at a level showing that the job market still
remains tight. The U.S. unemployment is currently at a 24-year low
of 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Launching Campaign to End Violence Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Three United Nations
agencies are launching a campaign to end violence against women in
Latin America and the Caribbean, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) announced today.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign involving media and public education drives, UNDP,
and its United Nations Fund for the development of Women (UNIFEM),
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations
Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) are joining forces to
raise awareness about the scourge of violence against women and
girls in the region.
</P>
<P>
The one year campaign, which is being launched ahead of the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
is aimed at finding ways to stop the violence together.
</P>
<P>
According to UNDP, gender based violence is not only a
loathsome human rights abuse, but a major obstacle to social and
economic development of women.
</P>
<P>
About sixty percent of women in Latin America and the Caribbean
are believed to have suffered from physical or psychological abuse
by their intimate partners, says UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Although the Organization of American States has the
Inter-American Convention to prevent, punish and eradicate
violence against women, incidences of abuse in the region
continued to rise, UNDP added.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Africa Trying to Solve Its Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Although it is still like
wirewalking between violence and peace throughout 1997, Africa
has begun moving with its own forces and achieved gratifying
successes in settling its own problems that threaten stability on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Among the driving forces of the trend are the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD) grouping seven
nations in the east African region and the Horn of Africa and the
16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
It is widely recognized that it was through IGAD's vigorous
mediation that the re-start of face-to-face peace talks between
the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) had become a reality in late October after a
three-year stalemate.
</P>
<P>
A major breakthrough emerged at the July IGAD summit when
Khartoum unexpectedly gave ground by accepting negotiation
principles the IGAD drafted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The principles which favor a secular state and more autonomy
in southern Sudan, cleared the way for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides now are set to open the second round of
talks next April with a shared understanding that diplomacy was
the only key to a settlement to Sudan's 14-year civil war which
has ended in economic devastation of the country.
</P>
<P>
In west Africa, after Sierra Leone's democratically elected
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was toppled by a
military coup in May this year, the Nigeria-led ECOWAS moved on
swiftly to the restoration of democracy, peace and security in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the high pressures imposed by ECOWAS through shuttle
diplomacy, tight economic embargos together with shell raids, the
Sierra Leonean mutineers were forced to agree in late October to
return the power to Kabbah's government next April.
</P>
<P>
"There is a consensus by the whole of Africa" that a
government freely elected by its people can only be changed by
its people, Salim Ahmed Salim, chief of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), noted when acclaiming the ECOWAS bid.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, fruitful efforts by African states on
their own will to ease or remove regional tension were observed
in 1997 across the whole continent stretching from Somalia in the
east to Rwanda and Burundi in the center; from Liberia in the
west to Lesotho and Swaziland in the south.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of the African community have helped Chad to
regain stability after decades of fighting and the government of
elected President Ange-Felix Patasse in the Central African
Republic to survive from an army mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Unrest inside both Lesotho and Swaziland has been scaled down
and the successful general election in Liberia in June this year
has given more hope to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Territorial disputes between Chad and Libya, between Nigeria
and Cameroon, between Eritrea and Yemen, as well as between
Namibia and Botswana have also been settled as a result of the
common effort by the parties involved around the region.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by Egypt and Ethiopia, the warring sections in
Somalia are to attend an official peace negotiation in Addis
Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia, this month, igniting new hope
for ending the country's seven-year-long anarchy.
</P>
<P>
It was the concept that African problems should be solved by
Africans themselves that dominated September's U.N.-hosted
meeting of African foreign ministers in New York.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 actually saw "a surprising new determination by
many African countries to take command of their own regional
affairs," a veteran western analyst exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The new trend in solving African problems by African forces
comes with a firm consensus among African countries that the
development and security of one country cannot be isolated from
what is happening in its surrounding countries, and if the crisis
in one country is not checked, it could spill over into the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged war in southern Sudan directly led to the
severance of Sudan's diplomatic ties with Uganda and Eritrea. For
years, Sudan has traded with the two neighbors charges of hosting
rebels fighting to overthrow their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
In the Great Lakes region, the influx of refugees has become a
big problem as a result of one million or so of Hutus fleeing
Rwanda in 1994 for fear of reprisals over the genocide in which
more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsi people, were killed.
</P>
<P>
"No country in Central Africa will have lasting peace as long
as tension exists in other countries of the sub-region." said
Gabonese Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba when he was mediating
the bloody clash in Congo mid this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TRC Threatens Botha Again With Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The stage has been set
for another round of test of will between South African former
state president P W Botha and Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC) Chairman Desmond Tutu, as the date of Botha's supposed
testimony before the TRC is around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Tutu would immediately lay charges against Botha should the
former president fail to turn up at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday
for a TRC hearing, South African Press Association quoted TRC
spokesperson Christelle Terreblanche as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing at the TRC Cape Town headquarters is still
about the activities of the former State Security Council (SSC),
a powerful "inner cabinet" that Botha chaired at the height of
apartheid conflict.
</P>
<P>
Several of Botha's cabinet ministers had appeared at the
hearings, but Botha himself had stubbornly defied two TRC
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a defection of the second subpoena, Tutu failed to
lay criminal charges against Botha at the beginning of the month
when Botha refused to appear at the second round of SSC hearing.
</P>
<P>
The TRC issued a third subpoena on the same day to order Botha
to testify this Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Botha will comply with the subpoena

</P>
<P>
Botha, 81, has repeatedly said that he would rather be
prosecuted than appear before the TRC, which he described as a
"circus."
</P>
<P>
The TRC was set up after the all-race elections in 1994 to
investigate human rights violations during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
Under the founding legislation of the TRC, Botha could face up
to two years in jail if he persisted in his own way.
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was state president between 1984 and 1989, refused
to apologize for the role of his government, which vehemently
implemented apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
A furious Tutu has repeatedly threatened Botha with legal
action.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela last week also
threatened to bring Botha to justice if he refuses to abide by
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"If all persuasion fails, the law must take its course,"
Mandela warned. "No one is above the law," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Computer Companies To Restrict Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. 14 largest computer
data companies have reached an agreement over blocking public
access to certain types of personal data.
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreement are Lexis-Nexis and the nation's
three main credit reporting bureaus, which represent 90 percent
of the database market.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the 14 companies will not release
to the general public certain types of non-public information,
including Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit history
and a mother's maiden name. The companies also agree not to
release unlisted telephone numbers obtained from non-public
records and unlisted addresses from telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
However the restrictions would not apply to sensitive
information that is derived from public records, such as birth
certificates or state motor vehicle information. Qualified
subscribers, such as law enforcement agencies and private
investigators, would still have access to all data.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important first step toward ensuring the privacy
of users, while keeping government intrusion at a minimum,"said
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House
Telecommunications,Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> German Student Demonstrations Turn Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- About 30,000 German university
students took to the streets today in Bonn to protest against the
country's declining education spendings and the deteriorating
conditions of their universities.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations turned violent briefly this afternoon after
about a group of about 500 extreme leftists among the protesting
students started to hurl stones, paint bottles and eggs at the
police.
</P>
<P>
Riot police armed with clubs had managed to drive back the
violent demonstrators when they tried to storm buildings in the
government district.
</P>
<P>
Several people had been injured on both sides, police said.
</P>
<P>
The student protest in Bonn today followed smaller
demonstrations held in a number of German universities over the
past two months and a major demonstration participated by some
50,000 students in Bonn three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
What triggered the protest was a combination of education
spending cuts, crowded classes, poor university facilities, as
well as a government plan to impose tuition fees on students.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 139 Ethiopian
refugees were today repatriated from Sudan to Gondar Town in
northern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
An Ethiopian News Agency report from Gondar Town said these
returnees will leave for their places of origin after a two-day
stay in makeshift shelters built for them in Gondar Town.
</P>
<P>
At the shelters, the repatriated refugees will be provided
each with 970 Birr (about 140 U.S. dollars), 150 kg of ration,
plastic sheetings and various utensils.
</P>
<P>
These refugees fled their home towns due to the then ravaging
war and drought and took refuge in Sudan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The local government has plans to allot plots of farming lands
to those returnees who opt to be engaged in agricultural
activities and rent payments to those who choose to live in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has a plan to repatriate close to
20,000 Ethiopian refugees from Sudan up until May, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Shows Toughest U.S. Child Labor Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Farmers and factory owners
in the United States who illegally hire underage children
generally get away with it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor, charged with enforcing the
nation's child labor laws, fails to find the most vulnerable
victims of child labor, to bring criminal cases against offenders,
does not seize goods that are the product of illegal child labor,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman did not dispute them. "It's
not acceptable for employers to think they can skirt the law, that
the Department of Labor is not serious about enforcing the law,"
Ms.Herman was quoted by the AP as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, at least 290,200 minors worked illegally in the
United States, according to an AP analysis that used the
government's own statistics. Labor Department investigators found
6,735 child labor violations at 1,546 establishments.
</P>
<P>
The children the department does not find are the most
vulnerable ones -- the very young, the illegal immigrants, the
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
The AP said it found many such children working illegally in
dozens of fields and factories from coast to coast. Yet Labor
Department officials around the country say those children are
nearly impossible to find.
</P>
<P>
The last major federal campaign against child labor came in
1990, when Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole led Operation Child
Watch.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Herman said, Operation Salad Bowl will be launched next
Spring in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture. The
initiative, she said, will involve 50 farm inspections around the
country.
</P>
<P>
But even when the Labor Department does find violations, it
usually doesn't do much about it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, employers who hire children illegally are
at the very least supposed to be fined. In 1990, Congress decided
the fines weren't high enough and raised the maximum penalty from
1,000 dollars per violation to 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The average fine assessed by the department increased from 212
dollars in 1990 to 887 dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Penalties include up to six months' imprisonment for a second
conviction.
</P>
<P>
But no one has gone to jail for federal child labor violations
in seven years.

<HEADLINE> Citibank to Buy AT&AMP;T Card Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Citicorp, the second-largest
bank in the U.S., has agreed to buy AT&AMP;T's Universal Card unit for
3.5 billion U.S. dollars in cash plus 500 million U.S. dollars for
the right to use the AT&AMP;T name and phone calling card privileges
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to newspaper reports here today, the deal will
solidify Citibank's No.1 position in the credit card business.
</P>
<P>
The transaction was approved by AT&AMP;T's board here Wednesday,
after a six-week bidding contest. Bank America was last to drop
out Monday, following GE Capital and Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Universal Card boosts Citibank's outstanding card balances by
14.7 billion U.S. dollars, to 62 billion U.S. dollars, giving it
a 20 billion U.S. dollar edge over MBNA, its nearest rival,
according to researchers.
</P>
<P>
But the price is higher than most analysts expected. Universal
Card has been plagued by hefty loan losses and a high percentage
of customers who don't generate interest income because they pay
their bills in full each month.
</P>
<P>
However, Citibank now will be able to market its products to
Universal Card's 19 million card holders. And a partnership with
the telecommunications giant could give it an advantage as smart
cards -- plastic cards embedded with computer chips -- begin to
take off, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The companies could market one smart card that would be a
calling card, credit card and stored-value card, which would
replace cash for small purchases. And AT&AMP;T can continue to use
the card to sell its products and services.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Market Forecast to Hit Record Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The FTSE 100 index on the
London stock market is forecast to keep on rising next year to hit
record levels, according to the annual forecasts by Merrill Lynch,
the U.S. broking and banking group.
</P>
<P>
In its annual forecasts, which are watched closely by fund
managers, the group said that the banking sector will lead the way
as further consolidation in the industry took place. Then follow
the aerospace sector and bus and train companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the group, which trades one in every four shares on
the London stock market, warned that the pharmaceuticals sector
should be avoided by investors because it believed it was
overvalued.
</P>
<P>
It expected the FTSE 100 index to end this year at least at a
high of 5,400 points and to go on hitting new records as early as
next month.
</P>
<P>
The group said that the main reason for its optimism is the
fact that UK firms are buying shares in their companies at levels
not seen since just after Black Wednesday in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the London market will also be boosted by the
extremely strong levels of institutional cash and by the fact that
cash are being returned to investors through takeovers and share
buy-backs as well as by the confidence in the Labor government's
ability to deliver low inflation.

<HEADLINE> Ohio to Enforce Gun Control law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
said Thursday Ohio has agreed to start enforcing the Brady Act,
which requires a background check before a handgun is sold,
leaving the state of Arkansas as the only non-Brady state.
</P>
<P>
The Brady Law is named after former press secretary James
Brady, who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on
former President Ronald Reagan. It was passed in 1993 after bitter
congressional battles.
</P>
<P>
After the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the
federal government could not require the states to do background
checks, only Ohio and Arkansas refused to do so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. said Thursday that in
addition to Arkansas, about 100 "very small" communities around
the nation do not enforce the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
Holder said the Ohio agreement means 98 percent of the U.S.
population will be covered by Brady background checks.

<HEADLINE> Pak Government's Presidential Nominee Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Election
Commissioner Mukhtar Junejo Thursday rejected the nomination
papers of the ruling party's presidential candidate, Rafiq Tarar,
due to his alleged remarks against the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a major setback for the government led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif who has just survived a nerve-wracking
constitutional crisis which culminated in the resignation of
President Farooq Leghari.
</P>
<P>
After detailed scrutiny held before the candidates this
afternoon, the commissioner also rejected the nomination papers of
22 other candidates, leaving only six candidates in the run.
</P>
<P>
According to an order issued by the Election Commission, those
who remain in the contest for the presidential slot are Haleem
Siddiqui, the covering candidate of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (PML-N), Aftab Shahban Mirani from Pakistan People's Party,
Moulana Muhammad Khan Shirani from Jamiat-e-Ulema, Khawaja
Kutubuddin from PML and independents Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali
and Raja Saeeduz Zaman.
</P>
<P>
Giving the reasons for the rejection of two nomination papers
filed by Senator Rafiq, who was announced Monday as the
presidential candidate of the PML-N by Prime Minister Sharif, the
commissioner said it was done under the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq is disqualified from being a member of the parliament
because he allegedly defamed the judiciary when giving interviews
to the local media in June 1996 and December 1997 respectively,
said the Election Commission's order, adding that hence he can not
be elected as the president.
</P>
<P>
The order quoted in detail such objections raised by several
opponents of Rafiq's candidature.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari resigned on December 2 when the country's
worst-ever constitutional crisis reached its climax and after he
refused to sign a reference against Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah
as required by the Sharif government.
</P>
<P>
Under the Pakistan Constitution, a new president has to be
elected in 30 days starting from the day president-in-power's
resignation is accepted by the speaker of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif's announcement of Rafiq as his party's
presidential nominee has drawn strong criticism from various
circles because the 68-year former Supreme Court judge is also
from the country's largest province of Punjab like most of the top
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the People's Party and former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto accused Sharif of "making the country a one-party
state."
</P>
<P>
She said that if the president is elected from a greater
province, a sense of deprivation would develop in smaller
provinces and this would have an adverse effect on the federation.
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts also said Rafiq's nomination as a
presidential candidate will directly undermine the independence of
the judiciary as Rafiq was a member of the Supreme Court bench
which restored the first Sharif government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
There has been no formal reaction from the government side to
the Election Commission's rejection of its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sharif government will probably file a petition at
the Supreme Court against the Election Commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
A source from the prime minister's office told Xinhua Thursday
evening that although it has not been confirmed, filing a petition
seems to be the "only option" for the government.

DAR ES SALAAM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian
Vice-President Omar Juma today underlined the importance of
cooperation by African countries in tackling environment and
poverty problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with Donton Mkandawire, a special envoy of President
Bakili Muluzi of Malawi, at the State House in Dar es Salaam,
Juma said environmental degradation problem in Africa can be
solved if all countries cooperate to fight its menace.

<P>
The vice president called upon leaders of African countries to
give top priority to research on environment especially in rural
areas where poverty prevails.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the State House, Omar
further suggested African leaders should equip small scale
producers with modern technologies so as to improve their
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs unity as a strategy for development like the case
with developed countries such as Japan and the United States, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Juma's opinion is shared by Tanzania's former president Julius
Nyerere, who said on Monday at an international conference here

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says U.S. Military Presence in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced that U.S. troops will remain in Bosnia as part of a
multi-national peacekeeping force beyond his earlier deadline of
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Clinton delays a deadline for
withdrawal. Clinton set no deadline for the extended U.S. military
involvement.
</P>
<P>
"The progress (in Bosnia) is unmistakable, but it is not yet
irreversible," Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"It remains poised on a tightrope, moving toward a better
future, but not at the point yet of a self-sustaining peace,"
said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to fly to Bosnia on Sunday night to
spread some holiday cheer in the battered former Yugoslav republic
and to buck up the troops. He said some members of Congress had
agreed to go with him.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the size and duration of the new commitment would
be determined by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
But he added that whatever it decides "must have substantial
support from Congress and the American people."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. agreement to participate further peacekeeping in
Bosnia will "become a commitment only when I have approved the
action plan NATO's military authorities will develop and
present, early next year, after careful study of all the
options," Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
He set a series of key criteria NATO's plan must meet for him
to approve the U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
"First, the mission must be achievable and tied to concrete
benchmarks, not a deadline," he affirmed. "We should have clear
objectives that when set -- when met, will create a
self-sustaining secure environment and all us to remove our
troops."
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, Clinton postponed U.S. participation in the
peace-keeping in Bosnia and the number of troops has been reduced
to current 8,500 from 27,000, who were sent there in 1995 to
implement the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the American troops be out of Bosnia by
the end of his administration, Clinton replied that there will
not be "a permanent presence" in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe this is like Germany after World War II,
or in the Cold War or Korea, after the Korean War," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many in Congress feared that the U.S. troops will have more
chances to get caught up in any flare-up of the conflict in Bosnia
if they stay there longer. They called for a total pull-out of
U.S. troops.

<HEADLINE> Identification Process for Referendum on Western </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 63,000 people
have been identified for participation in the referendum on
Western Sahara, a United Nations spokesman announced today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said since the identification resumed in December
3, a total of 7,492 people have been convoked and 3, 327 have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
The identification process is being conducted by the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum on Western Sahara (MINURSO) to
let the people of Western Sahara choose between independence and
incorporation into Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the territory on the north-west coast of Africa
started in 1976 when Spain, the former colonial power,
relinquished international responsibility for the territory. It
was claimed by Morocco and Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
The Population Front for the Liberation of Safuia El-Hamara and
Rio de Oro (POLISARIO Front) opposed the two countries's' claim to
the territory and waged a struggle for self-determination. Algeria
supported the POLISARIO Front.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania subsequently renounced all its claims to Western
Sahara and the dispute remains between Morocco and the POLISARIO
Front.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council of the United
Nations established MINURSO in 1991 to help in the identification
of Western Saharans eligible to participate in the referendum.
Implementation stalled as Morocco and the POLISARIO Front differed
on the identification of certain groups of people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said with the resumption of the identification
process, there are now hopes to hold the referendum in 1998.

<P>
BONN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the much-publicized
Smart car produced by a joint venture of the German Daimler Benz
AG and the Swiss watchmaker SMH AG has to be delayed for six
months due to safety problems, the carmaker announced today.
</P>
<P>
The Micro Compact Car AG (MCC), which is building the
two-seater small car in France, said today that the introduction
of the Smart car would be delayed until October next year due to
recent findings of the car's stability problems.
</P>
<P>
The delay of Smart car represents image setback to Daimler Benz
which already announced in October to suspend sales of its A-class
sub-compact cars after several of them turned over on tight turns
during a routine safety test.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Atomic Energy Development Program Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A program on development of the
atomic power industry in 1998-2005 was approved today by the
Russian government, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a government's meeting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
said that it needs to "ensure tough safety precautions and to
poperly guard these most important facilities," and Russia could
not do without the further development of the atomic power
industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister for atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov said that it
enhanced dependability and safety of the used atomic power plants
and measures to increase their service life.
</P>
<P>
The total capacity of the atomic power plants will be increased
by the year 2000 to 24.24 gigawatts compared to 21.2 gigawatts in
1997, by the year 2005 -- to 26.88 gigawatts, and by the year 2010
-- to 27.56-29.2 gigawatts, according to Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
He said the output of electric power at atomic power plants
will reach 130 billion kilowatt hour by the year 2000, and 170
billion kilowatts -- by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In opinion of the minister, the implementation of this program
will improve the structure of Russia's power balance, especially
in its European part, will make the consumers use the electricity
more thriftily, will help resolve several strategic tasks,
including Russia's power security and expansion of the export of
nuclear power technology, based on new-generation reactors.
</P>
<P>
The Russian atomic power plants are steadily supplying
electricity to consumers in thirty-five subjects of the Russian
Federation, the report said.

PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The French Minister of Culture
and Communication Catherine Trautmann today presented the major
lines of a draft law on audio-video control, which suggests a
control of the influence of some big private industrial groups on
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
Trautmann presented the outline of the future audio-video law
at a meeting on audio-video problems organized by a Socialist
deputy at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
She said that the sector of communication in France is
suffering from "two dysfunction" -- the lack of competition and
domination by some great industrial groups whose purpose is not to
communicate but depends on the need of the market.
</P>
<P>
"It is the influence of some great private industrial groups
that one should control," she said. "The draft law will carry the
measures leading the enterprises of communication to adopt a
structure restricting the risks of too strong a dependence on the
economic interests which are strange to their audience."

UNITED NATIONS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Butler's report on
Iraqi arms inspection was inaccurate and did not reflect Iraq's
willingness to cooperate with UN weapons inspection teams, Nazar
Hamdoon, Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon made the remarks after Richard Butler, head of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, briefed the
Security Council on his recent four-day visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Butler did not reflect Iraq's willingness to work on the
technical issues. Iraq did not decline doing that as Butler
reported," said Hamdoon.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said the meetings between Butler and Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in Baghdad were recorded so
the alleged inaccuracies could be checked.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Butler said Iraq
offered no new information on the biological agents or other
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler also said Iraq ruled out inspections or overflights
at presidential and sovereign sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) - The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) today published two consultation papers on Consumer
Complaints and Consumer Compensation.
</P>
<P>
The papers set out proposals for future complaints handling and
compensation arrangements in financial services.
</P>
<P>
Both papers reflect the Government decisions as to how the
existing diverse arrangements should be rationalized.
</P>
<P>
They contain proposals for simplification, with the aim of
creating, in both areas, systems which are easier for consumers to
understand, more consistent and more accessible.
</P>
<P>
On complaints handling, the Government has decided that there
will be a single Financial Services Ombudsman, to which all firms
authorised by the FSA must belong.
</P>
<P>
In the light of these decisions, the FSA's papers set out
proposals and invite views on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
They include which activities should be covered by the
Ombudsman scheme; how the scheme should be organized, the powers
the Ombudsman will need, and the procedures he or she might
employ.
</P>
<P>
On compensation, the Consultation Paper sets out the
Government's proposals for a single scheme, run by a single board,
to replace the existing system.
</P>
<P>
Launching the papers, Howard Davies, Chairman of the FSA, said
that the rationalization of current arrangements is in line with
the aim to manage the regulatory system efficiently.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Calls for Lifting Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh today called for the lifting of sanctions against Iraq and
an end to the severe sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Saleh made the appeal while meeting with visiting Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Mohammed Hamza Al Zobeidi, who is also a member of
the Revolution Command Council.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saleh stressed the solidarity of the Yemeni
people with the Iraqi people, who are suffering from
seven-year-old economic embargo, Yemeni news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Zobeidi presented Saleh a letter from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on the recent developments in Iraq, the activities of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, the attitude of the U.N. Security
Council, and the sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by the
sanctions imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the continuing sanctions are no longer
justified, and made clear Iraq's stance towards UNSCOM's demand to
inspect presidential sites, which the Iraqis considered as symbols
of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been refusing U.N. arms inspectors' access to those
sites. But UNSCOM stood firm in demanding "restricted access" to all
sensitive sites, which can trigger another standoff between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Saleh and Zobeidi also reviewed a number of issues concerning
the two countries and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Zobeidi arrived in Sanaa Wednesday on a visit to brief Saleh on
the latest developments and serious endeavors of Iraq and some
other countries for the removal of U.N. sanctions against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Says Trade Conflict  with EU May Occur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A serious trade conflict may
occur between Russia and the European Union, First Deputy Minister
of Foreign Trade Anatoly Ogurtsov predicted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Council of sectoral manufacturers and
exporters under the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Ogurtsov said the
EU accounts for 35 percent of Russia's foreign trade and its share
will rise further.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the EU has made even firmer its openly
discriminating approach to conducing trade with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, therefore, will make every effort to obtain the
EU's recognition of Russia as a country with a market economy in
order to decrease the losses incurred through various limitations,
including anti-dumping regulations, Ogurtsov said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Russia loses at least 500 million
U.S. dollars per year as a result of restrictions imposed on its
goods.
</P>
<P>
Russia will "take important steps to protect the domestic
market" in the near future. The country's entering the World Trade
Organization, the Economic Cooperation and Development
Organization and its membership in the Paris and London Clubs will
enhance reaching this aim, the first deputy minister said.

<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the arrest
of two Croatian war crime suspects by NATO Stabilization Force
(SFOR) for trial by the International Tribunal hearing war crimes
in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"France rejoiced at this operation which answers a common will
of the member countries of the (NATO) alliance to see to it that
all people charged with war crimes in Bosnia be brought before the
tribunal in the Hague," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France and the general prosecutor of the International
Tribunal, Louise Arbour, recently publicly disputed over the
problem of war criminals hanging on in the French-controlled
section of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Arbour charged that most war crime suspects of Bosnia are
staying in the French section, while France holds that only fewer
than a dozen of the suspects are living in the section under the
control of French troops, against 10 and 25 in the sections under
American and British control.
</P>
<P>
The operation to arrest the two Croats was conducted Wednesday
night by Dutch troops serving in the SFOR with the support of
American troops.

at the party's 50th national conference in Mafikeng, North-West
Province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela joked that he would like to think about the matter in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He stepped down from the post of ANC president at the
conference to allow his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, to step into his
shoes.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted ANC officials as saying that Mandela wanted to
take a back seat so as not to overshadow Mbeki's new reign.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has been left to run the day-to-day work of the
government, is the de facto president of the country.
</P>
<P>
Today, 132 candidates were nominated to contest the 60 seats
of the all-powerful policy-making NEC.
</P>
<P>
Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) President John
Gomomo declined nomination, but COSATU General Secretary Sam
Shilowa accepted it. Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa, who backed
out of the race for deputy presidency of the ANC after being
requested to do so by the leadership, also declined nomination.
</P>
<P>
As expected, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whose efforts to vie
for the deputy presidency was foiled Wednesday, was among the
list of nominations for the NEC.
</P>
<P>
She declined to accept the nomination from the floor for the
deputy presidency under the circumstances that she would not be
able to get enough support for a successful endorsement.
</P>
<P>
At this conference, the ANC raised the approval rate required
for floor nominations to 25 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
NEC voting was scheduled to begin tonight and the results
would be announced Saturday morning.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Not Ready to Receive Netanyahu: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said that Cairo is not ready to receive Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because he has nothing new to offer,
the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If we talk over issues that were previously discussed and
promises that were not kept, we will be only repeating ourselves
and doing more harm than good," he said in an interview in the
London-based Saudi Arabian daily Al-Hayat today.
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that we will not deal with the head of the
Israeli government - there is nothing to prevent his visit to
Egypt - but the target of his visit has to be the reactivation of
the peace process," he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister said that Egypt has nothing
against talking to Netanyahu if he has a new policy line. But if
this trend is totally non-existent, there is nothing to discuss,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is fully aware of Israeli plans, but we cannot accept
anything short of a balanced peace. And we will not help Netanyahu
swallow up Palestine," said Moussa, who is currently on a European
tour including Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat is to
visit Cairo Friday to brief his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
on the outcome of his talks today with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in London.
</P>
<P>
Albright, launching a third round of separate meetings with
Netanyahu and Arafat, seemed unlikely to persuade the two sides to
reach an agreement on reactivating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since March
over the Israeli settlement building in East Jerusalem and delay
in further troop pullout from the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Cairo had mediated between Palestinian and Israeli leaders
several times in the past few months but to no avail.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The environment in Taopu, one
of the most seriously polluted area in Shanghai, has been greatly
improved after 10 years of effort by the municipal government and
residents.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, the city has been emphasizing the
prevention and control of local pollution, especially in the three
most-seriously polluted areas: Hetian, Xinhualu and Taopu.
</P>
<P>
A number of polluting plants and factories have been closed,
merged, or transformed into other businesses. As a result, the
Hetian and Xinhualu areas have already been removed from the list
of the city's leading polluted areas.
</P>
<P>
As a chemical industry area, Taopu has invested 726 million
yuan during the past 10 years on a number of projects to improve
its environment. Among them is an industrial sewage treatment
plant, which can dispose of 60,000 tons of sewage a day and is the
largest of its kind in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-year period, Taopu also has added more than 40
hectares of forest. Nearly 26 percent of lands in Taopu are now
covered with trees and grass.
</P>

CANBERRA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The average age of
Australians is still rising, with the average age being 34.3 years
old compared to an average age of 28.6 in 1977, representing an
increase of 5.7 years in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The number of women over 85 increased by seven percent in just
12 months - five times the growth rate for the entire population.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
showed declining mortality and an increase in life expectancy were
continuing to have a major impact on Australia's older age groups.
</P>
<P>
There are now 216,100 people aged 85 years and over in
Australia, compared to just 87,900 two decades ago - an increase
of 146 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are twice as many women as men in this age group, 150,800
compared with 65,300.
</P>
<P>
The ABS study showed the number of people aged over 65 had
increased by 1.9 percent in that 12-month period, with the
Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory, Western
Australia and Queensland having the biggest rise.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, this age group had increased by 74
percent, the ABS said.

South Australia has the highest median age, 35.9 years,
followed by Tasmania (35.1), New South Wales (34.7), Victoria
(34.6), Queensland (33.6), Western Australia (33.4), the ACT
(31.6) and the Northern Territory (28.0).
</P>
<P>
While the country is ageing, there has been a very slow growth,
just four percent, in the number of children aged less than 15
years in the past 20 years, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
The number of people aged 15 to 64 has increased by 35 percent,

<P>
JINAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wang received a ballot ticket
from a voting supervisor, stepped aside to make marks on it, and
then dropped it into a red ballot box.
</P>
<P>
The voting procedure was the same as others to elect a deputy
to the local people's congress. But this voting on Thursday was
unique in China: It took place in a prison.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old prisoner, who only agreed to be called by his
family name of Wang, had been vice-president of a large company.
In 1995, Wang was sentenced to five years in prison for taking
bribes.
</P>
<P>
"I used to participate in such elections for a deputy to the
local people's congress many times, but I don't feel quite the
same this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the Shandong No. 1 Prison, all inmates with a right to
voting stood in orderly queues, wearing cotton-padded clothes and
cotton-padded hats, and awaited their turn to vote.
</P>
<P>
"To take part in the election as a special group of people, all
of us valued the chance to exercise our democratic right," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The prison is a place to detain felons. According to Chinese
law, prisoners who have not been deprived of political rights have
the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
The prison is in the 67th election area in the Lixia District
of Jinan City, capital of east China's Shandong Province. Two
deputies to the district people's congress were being elected.
</P>
<P>
Following abundant consultations and discussions among voters
of the election area, three candidates were selected. One of whom
is an administrative officer in the prison.
</P>
<P>
Before the unified voting day, workers in the prison had
introduced the three candidates to the voting inmates.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here Friday that his government is out to make
its vision of a 21st century Pakistan "into a living reality."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister made the remarks in Peshawar, capital of
North West Frontier Province, at the earth-breaking ceremony of
the Islamabad-Peshawar section of Motorway.
</P>
<P>
"For my government, the motorway project is not construction of
just another highway but it has a special meaning since it seeks
to translate my government's vision of a 21st century's Pakistan
into a living reality," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said the motorway would herald into a revolution in
infrastructure, which was long overdue "as it opens up new vistas
of development and progress for the people of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the motorway would
serve as the Pakistan's gateway into Central Asia and Central
Asia's outlet to the sea, the region's shortest access to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Islamabad-Peshawar section of motorway
was formally inaugurated Friday. The project has been awarded to a
Turkish construction company. Nawaz Sharif and the visiting
Turkish President, Suleyman Demirel, jointly performed the ground
breaking ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion Demirel expressed his appreciation
over the initiatives undertaken by the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
"I am impressed by the giant strides taken by the people and
government of Pakistan to move steadily on as a leading nation
towards the 21st century and the motorway project is one of the
many that will help realize this goal," the Turkish president
said.

PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Deborah Compagnoni
rallied from fourth after the first run to win her eighth straight
giant slalom race in Val d'Isere, France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It gives Compagnoni her 15th career World Cup victory, and also
put an end to Katja Seizinger's six-race streak.
</P>
<P>
Seizinger had the lead after the first run despite hurting her
hand, but she hooked a gate and went off balance and went off the
course shortly after the midway point of the second.
</P>
<P>

"The voting is of great significance to the prisoners, who have
a deep feeling that the state is governing the prison according to
the law," said Zhang Houfang, an officer in the prison who took
charge of the election.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we entirely safeguard the democratic right
of prisoners, allowing them to elect the deputy to their
satisfaction," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Voting supervisors and ballot counters were chosen from
well-behaved prisoners. A mobile ballot box was also used to
collect tickets from those who could not go to the voting site in
person.
</P>
<P>
Another prisoner with the family name of Qin excitedly crammed
his ballot into the mobile box. The 26-year-old prisoner had
suffered infantile paralysis.
</P>
<P>
"I value the chance of voting very much," said Qin, who
was sentenced to 13 years in 1992 for theft.
</P>
<P>
In the prison, he studies diligently and is engrossed in
writing. Over the past five years, he has published more than 140
articles in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Due to his good behavior, his prison term has been reduced by
1.5 years.
</P>
<P>
Shandong No. 1 is one of the first batch of model prisons
commended by the Ministry of Justice. Administrative officers in
the prison made extensive preparations to organize the voting.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Airlifts Food for Flooded Refugee Camps in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today started airlifting
emergency food supplies to flooded refugee camps in northeastern
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today said that the airlifting
using a Hawker-Siddley 748 began with a delivery of five tons of
high protein biscuits from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft to be based in Garissa, capital of the
Northeastern Province, will be ferrying food, shelter items,
medicines and other necessities to the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted UNHCR representative to Kenya Yvette
Stevens as saying that "food shortages in the camps are looming
due to the lack of overland access."
</P>
<P>
More than 123,000 refugees in Ifo, Dagahaley and Hagadere
camps have been cut off since late November when torrential rains
cut roads into the region and food supplies in U.N. warehouses
have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Herds of goats around the refugee camps are dying at a rate of
60 animals a day and other livestock also died because of a
rain-induced pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The whole stretches of roads in the semi-arid desert region
were washed away due to heavy rains in the past one month and
road repair has to wait until the water-laden sands can support
the weight of heavy earth-moving equipment.
</P>
<P>
If the rain halts immediately, it will take up until February
to reopen overland routes serving the region, according to the
release.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red
Crescent Societies have launched a two-month emergency operation
to save the lives of about 300,000 Kenyan flood victims in
northeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
During the emergency operation, the two bodies are scheduled
to provide clean water and other emergency items for the
residents in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa of Northeastern Province
and the Tana River District of Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Sayid Amin, parliamentary candidate for Mandera West for the
ruling Kenya African National Union, appealed Thursday to the
government to provide humanitarian assistance to more than 40,000
people in his constituency.
</P>
<P>
He said local people are marooned as a result of heavy rains,
adding that people were feeding on camel meat only.

SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's water plants will
have access to quality water from the upper reaches of the Huangpu
River as a huge diversion project was completed today.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Leading Macao Businessman Confident of Smooth Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A leading businessman in Macao
said here Friday that he is confident of a smooth handover of
power in 1999 with joint efforts by China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, told
Xinhua in an interview on the two year countdown of the handover
that he believes Macao will have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
"I feel excited at the moment that Macao will return to China
in two years time," Ma said. "I am confident that a smooth
handover will take place and that Macao will have a bright
future."
</P>
<P>
The smooth handover of Hong Kong has set an example for Macao,
he noted, adding the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) indicated that China is stable, and a strong and
stable motherland is the most reliable factor for the handover.
</P>
<P>
A smooth handover and a stable social order and economic growth
in Macao are in the common interests of both China and Portugal,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Many issues concerning the handover of power have been or are
being resolved with joint efforts from China and Portugal," he
said. "Just as China's leaders put it, 'all efforts concerning the
smooth handover are being made in good order.'"
</P>
<P>
However, he said, further efforts are needed as time is running
out. Both China and Portugal and the Macao Government should make
great efforts to accelerate the resolution of the three leading
issues of transition -- the localization of civil service, the
localization of law and the use of Chinese as an official
language.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government should also assume its administrative
responsibility to maintain a good security order and speed up
Macao's economic growth, the businessman said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao has its advantages in its economic growth," he said. "It
is a lower-tax free port, adjacent to Hong Kong, and has the
support of China's inland. It also has close links with the
European Union nations. I think the Macao Government should
improve its administrative efficiency to attract more investment."
</P>
<P>
As an international tourist destination, Macao could further
develop its tourism and gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Macao's economy has a great growth potential so
long as Macao businessmen make earnest efforts by themselves," he
stressed. "Macao will have a beautiful future."

SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC)
signed an agreement with the Pudong New Area today to provide 300
million U.S. dollars for building infrastructures in the largest
development zone in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The huge loans will help ease the shortage of funds for Pudong
which is undertaking a new round of development, said Vice-Mayor
Zhao Qizheng, who is also head of the Administrative Committee of
Pudong.
</P>
<P>
As local and foreign financial institutions and markets are

said.
</P>
<P>
BOC President Wang Xuebing said that his bank has paid much
attention to the development of Pudong. He disclosed that during
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-96), BOC loans made up more
than 40 percent of total bank loans used to develop local
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The new BOK loans signed today will be borrowed and paid back
by the Shanghai Urban Construction Investment and Development
Corp., which is an experimental entity aimed at improving the
utilization and management of loans in the city.

China's medical security system has been restructured since the

expenditures under control by having the government pay all
medical charges.

Since 1992, the reform set social security funds for medical
expenditures with individuals paying part of their medical

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail Sales Index in
Singapore declined by 6.7 percent compared to a year ago, while

declined by 5.7 percent in October over September 1997. Excluding
motor vehicles, the index fell by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the overall index was largely attributed to the
substantial fall of 19.8 percent in motor vehicles sales. Besides,
lower turnover was also reported by dealers of textiles, wearing
apparel and personal effects and, furniture and other household
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The DOS said that general provision and sundry shops and

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazilean international
striker moves back to Flamengo, according to the news from
Brazil's club on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Footballer of the Year in 1994 leaves Spanish first
division club Valencia to join Flamengo in January, announced an
agreement reached by the two clubs.
</P>
<P>
No financial details of the two-year-long contract were

</P>
<P>
The Brazil's star went to Flamengo on loan for a year soon
after he signed with Valencia at the start of 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
Romario was sidelined for his night-clubbing lifestyle which
annoyed the Italian coach Claudio Ranieri after he moved to
Valencia, which is 13th in the standings with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
Romario, who will play for Brazil in next year's World Cup

<HEADLINE> China: UN Resolution Key to Solve South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China today called for the
implementation of the United Nations resolution 425 to solve the
issue of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. Security Council resolution is carried out, the
conflict between Lebanon and Israel will end and the two countries
will be able to make progress in peace process, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told reporters after
a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution demands unconditional withdrawal of Israeli
troops from the 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" Israel set
up in 1985 to protect its northern territories from cross-border
guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On the stalemate in the Middle East peace process, Qian said
"the international community and main powers of the world, such as
France, Russia, the United States and China, are closely watching
the developments in the region and are deeply concerned about the
situation."
</P>
<P>
The stalemate will not be broken unless the negotiations are
reopened from where they have stopped and based on the principle
of trading land for peace, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Qian arrived in Beirut overnight on the first leg of his
five-nation regional tour, which will also take him to Syria,
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule territories and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit here, Qian is expected to hold talks
with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri on bilateral relations,
regional and international affairs of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Qian is the highest Chinese official to visit Lebanon since the
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971.

<P>
KATHMANDU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
has agreed to grant an assistance of 4.3 million U.S. dollars to
support private sector's increased participation and investment in
hydropower projects in Nepal, Nepal's official RSS news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) will help the Nepali government to consolidate
the gains achieved to date by strengthening the capacity of the
Electricity Development Center of the Ministry of Water Resources
to attract increasing private sector participation and investment
in environmentally and socially-sound hydropower projects, the RSS
said.
</P>
<P>
With the USAID's assistance, substantial progress has been made
during the past two years in developing the policy and regulatory
infrastructure needed for private development of Nepal's
hydropower capacity, the RSS added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a huge hydropower potential of 83 million kw, but
less than one percent has been utilized so far.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has been encouraging domestic and foreign
private sector's involvement in developing the country's
hydropower resources.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reaffirms Condition of Troop Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed today that Israel's troop withdrawal
in the West Bank is conditional on the Palestinian fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a meeting of international Jewish journalists,
Netanyahu stressed the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) must
fulfill its commitments to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that an agreement on broad principles on security
cooperation has been reached in talks between Israeli and
Palestinian security officials.
</P>
<P>
He said the package deal discussed Thursday at his meeting in
Paris with United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
includes the planned second Israeli troop pullback in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
He added he is proposing handing over heavily-populated
Palestinian territories to the PNA while retaining so-called
security zones that will connect all existing Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
On the reported meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton next
month, Netanyahu said the exact date for the meeting has yet to be
settled.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, out of his displeasure with Netanyahu's handling of
the peace process, snubbed him when he visited the U.S. in
October. Rarely did an American president refuse to meet a
visiting Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who met PNA President Yasser Arafat in London
Thursday after her talks with Netanyahu, has said that Clinton
would meet Netanyahu and Arafat separately in Washington next
month.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to help break the stalemate in the peace process,
U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Affairs Dennis Ross is
scheduled to return to the region to continue his mediation
between the parties.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Elders Enjoy More Services From Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Though many Chinese people
cling to the traditional ways of life when they become old --
being taken care of by their respective families, they now enjoy
more and more services from society.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 541 old people, all above the age of 65, showed
that 41.9 percent of them have enjoyed services from neighborhood
committees or neighbors, though they love to be taken care of by
their family members.
</P>
<P>
Related services include chatting with the elderly, visits
during festivals, buying medicines and calling doctors, shopping,
contacting their relative, and cooking.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 32.2 percent of them unbosom themselves
to neighbors when they have troubles or are unhappy, whereas 25.5
percent talk with neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 55.6 percent of them seek help from
neighborhood committees when their rights and interests are
infringed upon or harmed.
</P>
<P>
At present, Tianjin has 188,500 volunteers involved in
neighborhood services, 1,093 various professional service
organizations, and nearly 20,000 apartments, related facilities
and homes for the aged.
</P>
<P>
Old people still require more services from neighborhood
committees, the survey said. About 28.3 percent of those surveyed
said that they want help from neighborhood committees, hospitals,
and neighbors when they become ill.
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed also expressed the hope for building more
cultural and recreational facilities, homes for the aged and
publicizing the tradition of respecting the elderly and
strengthening protection of old people's legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reflected elders' strong desire for medical
services, with 66.8 percent hoping neighborhood committees will
provide health and medical treatment consultations.

PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Mali President Alpha Oumar
Konare called Friday for understanding rather than mere assistance
from France.
</P>
<P>
Konare was being interviewed by the daily newspaper,
L'Humanite, on the eve of a visit by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin to his country this weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We will say to Lionel Jospin: We are very sincere friends, but
we are also very demanding. The present rule of the world is that
of a blind logic of the capital, crushing all the poor countries
like Mali. Faced with this threat, we need France, but not at
whatever price."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the forcible expulsion of African immigrants by
France on chartered planes, saying there is "an ideology of
expulsion which is insulting.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to fight clandestine emigration. It is the
traffickers who organize it and make profits of it. This fight
will not be possible unless there is a will to examine and solve
the overall problems on both sides."
</P>
<P>
France organized several massive expulsions of African
immigrants under the former conservative government last year.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said immigration will be a major issue during the
talks to be held between Konare and Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Government officials of Mali have warned that an anti-French
feeling has developed among the French-speaking countries of
Africa because of the expulsions.

and one-day delay, Israeli Airline EL Al today decided to buy
five U.S.-built Boeing aircraft instead of the European-built
Airbus in a deal worth 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The planes involved the Airbus 319 and 320 and the Boeing

The U.S. government has reportedly pressured Israel to
continue El Al's relationship with Boeing which has been its sole
supplier for several years.
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement issued by El Al's board of directors said
El Al will buy five Boeing 737-700 and 737-800 aircraft for
delivery in 1999.
</P>
<P>
El Al said the new aircraft will be used for regional flights
to Amman, Athens, Cairo, Cyprus and Istanbul and will also serve

<HEADLINE> Three Million Dropouts to Return to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Project Hope, China's largest
educational charity, is going to help 1.4 million children return
to schools and build 2,000 primary schools within three years.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by the China Youth Development
Foundation recently in Beijing, and the figure -- 1.4 million
dropouts -- almost equals the total number in the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
So far, Project Hope has helped 1.6 million dropouts go back to
school and built 4,000 Hope primary schools with project funds.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Project Hope has collected 978 million
yuan in donations during the past eight years, 94.1 percent of
which are from the cities. Of that 978 million yuan, 100 percent
has been used in the countryside, especially in 592
poverty-stricken counties.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicates that the cities of Beijing, Tianjin
and Shanghai, and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong
have provided 91.5 percent of domestic donations and received 7.5
percent in return. The other provinces, cities and autonomous
regions have donated 8.5 percent and received 92.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope, initiated by the China Youth Development
Foundation in 1989 to assist those children forced to drop out of
schools by poverty, will help three million school-age children
return to school and build 6,000 Hope primary schools, in total,
by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets US Congress Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
expressed the hope here today that China and the United States
would take President Jiang Zemin's successful U.S. visit as a good
opportunity to push bilateral relations in a healthy and stable
manner.
</P>
<P>
Li's words came from his meeting with a U.S. congressional
delegation led by Douglas Bereuter, chairman of the Asia-Pacific
Affairs Sub-Committee of the International Relations Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
China has always stressed its relations with the United States,
the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the Chinese National People's Congress and the
U.S. Congress constitutes an important part of bilateral ties, and
China welcomes more U.S. senators and representatives to China to
deepen their understanding about the country, Li said, adding that
mutual understanding serves as a basis for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have close economic and trade
relations, with increasing trade volume and an ever-expanding
number of joint projects, Li said. He expressed the hope that
economic and trade relations would proceed without any trouble or
interference.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed his guests on the construction of China's
democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>
Bereuter said that one of the purposes of the current visit is
to better understand the Hong Kong situation. He expressed the
conviction that Hong Kong would maintain its prosperity and
stability under the guidance of the "One Country, Two Systems"
policy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress will intensify its contacts with the Chinese
National People's Congress, Bereuter said, and the Asia-Pacific
Sub-Committee is willing exert efforts to that end.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Representative Donald Manzullo said that it demands effort
from both sides to develop bilateral relations and to settle the
problem of trade imbalances.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some U.S. enterprises regret that they have
missed certain opportunities to cooperate with China due to their
own reasons and they will exert more efforts in this regard in the
future.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Mexican national soccer
team coach Bora Milutinovic has signed a deal with Nigeria
Thursday, and will lead its national team to the World Cup finals
next year in France.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic will be Nigeria's fourth coach in 20 months. The
Olympic champions have been without a manager since Frenchman
Philippe Troussier left last August, after the team qualified for
the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic's contract will start from January 1 next year and
will last seven months in the first phase. The contract will
provide him 100,000 U.S. dollars as dealing fee and a monthly
salary of 35,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian side will also provide him with accommodations,
medical services, full insurance coverage and a Peugeot 504 car,
all free of charge.
</P>
<P>
By the contract, Milutinovic will get a bonus of 250,000
dollars if Nigeria wins the World Cup title, 150,000 dollars for
the second place, and 50,000 dollars for entering the second round.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said after signing the contract that Nigeria owns
some best players in the world, what they need now is to let the
players, officials and all Nigerians work together for good
results.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been drawn in Group D in the World Cup finals,
with Spain, Bulgaria and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic was fired from the coaching position by Mexico in
November, less than a month after helping his team clinch a World
Cup berth. Mexico is the first nation to assure itself of a berth
for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He coached Mexico to the quarter-finals in 1986 World Cup,
Costa Rica to the second round in 1990 and the United States to
the second round in 1994.

LANZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- With an investment of five
billion yuan from the Chinese government, the Jinchuan Nonferrous
Metals Company in northwest China's Gansu province has built an
annual nickel production capacity of 40,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
As Asia's largest nickel production base, Jinchuan has Asia's
largest nickel smelting furnace, a symbol of China's leading
position in the world's nickel industry.
</P>
<P>
The Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Company has the world's second
largest nickel mine. It produces more than 88 percent of China's
total output of nickel and 90 percent of its metals of the
platinum family.
</P>
<P>
Listed by the government as one of China's key projects, the
second phase project of Jinchuan, with a total investment of 2.66
billion yuan, started in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jinyi, general manager of the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals
Company, said that the second phase project is a trial of
improving nickel production technology and a practice of
combining imported technology with domestic scientific research.
</P>
<P>
About 89.9 percent of Jinchuan's products are of high quality.
Ten product varieties are exported to the United States, Japan,
Britain, France and Iran. The No. one electrolysis nickel is
exempted from examination and registered on the London
International Metals Market. It was also registered in the United
States, Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Jinchuan company has had a total profit of 6.6 billion
yuan, 1.7 times the government investment. Statistics
also show that profits from technology improvement accounts for
45 percent of the company's total profits.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is trying to
persuade tourists that it is safe to come to the city because the
bird flu is not so serious as to trigger an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health prepared a fact sheet to explain to
tourists the avian flu, which is caused by a virus H5N1 that is
only found in poultry. Seven people have been infected so far,
with two dead and two in critical conditions.

<P>
The present cluster of cases in Hong Kong has not reached the
scale of an outbreak, the fact sheet quoted the World Health
Organization's statement as saying. There is no need for travel
restriction or quarantine.
</P>

The sheet of paper provided information of Influenza A H5N1,

<HEADLINE> HK, Guangdong Against Cross-boundary Car Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Stolen vehicles, containers
and computer printers, worth of 6.4 million HK dollars (820,000 US
dollars), have been returned to the Hong Kong Police by the
Guangdong Public Security Bureau (PSB).
</P>
<P>
The booties, including six saloon cars, one tractor and four
trailers, two containers and 980 computer printers, were reported
stolen in Hong Kong between 1991 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lau Yuk-kuen, Hong Kong's acting Deputy Commissioner of Police,
took the custody of the stolen goods Friday at the Huanggang
Boundary Crossing Point in Shenzhen, a Guangdong city adjoining
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the Guangdong PSB handed back
missing vehicles after the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1,
1997. Since 1991, the Guangdong PSB has helped Hong Kong Police
recoup 131 stolen vehicles in 17 batches.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady fall in the number of missing vehicles
over the last few years thanks to stringent enforcement action on
both sides of the boundary, said a Hong Kong Police spokesman. In
the first eleven months this year, only 1,957 vehicles were
reported missing, a sharp fall from 6,918 cases in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman continued that Hong Kong and Guangdong
authorities would continue to cooperate in combating
cross-boundary crimes, especially in fighting against car
smuggling.

<HEADLINE> More Housing Projects Completed for Poor Families in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hotan Prefecture of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has spent more than 40
million yuan in building new houses and livestock shelters for
local poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 4,800 poor households without
proper housing or with only rundown housing in Hotan have moved
into newly-constructed houses.
</P>
<P>
Abebula, a farmer of Uygur background from Buzak Township,
Hotan County, recalled that in autumn of 1990 when Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin called on his family during his inspection
tour of Hotan, the farmer and his family lived in a cave dwelling
with a floor space of less than 20 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to local government, Abebula's family have now
moved into a new house with the floor space of more than 100 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The oasis region of Hotan, which is located between Talimakan
Desert and Kunlun Mountain Ranges, has been one of China's poorest
areas. In addition to bad natural conditions, local farmers here
used to live a hard life, and many families could not afford to
construct new houses for several generations and had to live in
cave dwellings or shelters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents here now have adequate food and clothing
as the Chinese Central Government has redoubled its efforts to
carry out poverty alleviation programs. But still many have
housing problems.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from 1995, Hotan Prefecture initiated a housing
program aimed at constructing houses for poor rural households by
using poverty alleviation funds from the central government,
financial allocations set aside by local governments and by
encouraging prosperous farmers help those with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to favorable policies, we now have adequate food and
clothing and have become affluent. Besides, the government has
helped build new houses for us," said the 40-year-old Abebula,
adding "I hope President Jiang Zemin would drop in again and be
our guest in my new house."

<HEADLINE> Basin Archaeological Discovery Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- After three years' field work,
archaeologists are satisfied with what they have discovered in
Luonan basin in northwest China, which is believed to be the main
site of human activities from Paleolithic Period.
</P>
<P>
Exploration of the 750-square-meter basin, about 100 kilometers
to southwest Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province, revealed 30 sites
teeming with trails of human activities.
</P>
<P>
The some 1,000 stonewares discovered in the area are mainly
smashing tools, stone balls, stone axes, large pointed wares and
some scrubers.
</P>
<P>
Among most conspicuous finds is a cave on the slope of
Huashiliang Hill that dates back five million years. The abodes
with traces of human treads and ashes indicate it was inhabited by
ancient man.
</P>
<P>
Excavation of the 20-square-meter cave found over 30,000
articles of stoneware lined up layer upon layer, with the density
unknown to any of the sites of ancient man activities from the
early Paleolithic Period.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists also found traces of cinder kept for starting a
new fire and lots of animal fossils.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they excavated an area of some 120 square meters
outside the cave and uncovered about 300,000 articles of stoneware
and fossils of over 20 kinds of animals, such as bear, wolf,
hyena, oriental stegodon, wild boar, and some fish fossils.
</P>
<P>
Experts concluded that cave should belong to the mid
Pleistocene period, approximately the time for the emergence of
Peking Man.
</P>
<P>
They suggested the archaeological discoveries of the Luonan
basin hold important clue to the evolution and convergence of
civilizations in north and south China, as the basin is located in
northwest China but archaeological finds there contains traces of
southern China civilization of the Paleolithic Period.
</P>
<P>
More important, the stoneware in the cave are typical of those
from northern civilization while those discovered outside the cave
bear the characteristics of southern civilization.
</P>
<P>
The animal fossils found outside the cave further reinforce the
idea since some of them like oriental stegodon had thrived only
in southern China, experts conclude.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: SAARC Striving to Move Faster Towards Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- For South Asian countries,
which are among the poorest in the world, it is an uphill task
setting up a free-trade zone in the region in efforts to achieve
the longed-for goal of getting rid of the scourge of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Too eager to catch up with its counterparts in other parts of
the world, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), which embraces the seven countries in the region, is
striving to move faster towards trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, SAARC, founded 12 years ago with the aim to promote
regional cooperation in economic development and other areas, has
taken a number of measures to speed up its pace towards the
creation of the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, at their summit meeting held in May in the
Maldives, the leaders of the seven SAARC member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka -- decided to bring forward the timetable for SAFTA to 2001,
four years ahead of the previous schedule.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian leaders had originally set themselves the goal
of realizing SAFTA hopefully by 2000, but not later than 2005.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the leaders agreed to steadily relax trade
barriers until the goal is achieved.
</P>
<P>
They also decided that preferential tariff concessions will
cover products which are being actively traded among member states
and that a third round of trade negotiations should deepen tariff
concessions along with the removal of non-tariff barriers and
structural impediments so as to move faster from the South Asian
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
Under the SAPTA scheme launched in December 1995, two rounds of
trade negotiations have been completed, offering more than 2,000
items of products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
SAARC's Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) on Trade Liberalization
began the third round of trade negotiations in late July. The
group agreed that it is necessary to provide special and more
favorable concessions to the least developed member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The group also agreed that all the member countries should
strive for the removal of the remaining non-tariff measures and
that direct bilateral talks and frequent exchange of visits should
be conducted to promote trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
As mandated by the Male summit and SAARC's governing Council of
Ministers, member countries have adopted a combination of
product-by-product, sectoral and across-the-board approaches at
their third round of trade talks.
</P>
<P>
After the third round ends in January 1998, the products under
SAPTA will be increased by many folds, said Ashok K. Attri,
director in charge of economy, trade and tourism in the
Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
An action plan for the transition to SAFTA was drawn up in late
October by the Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) on
Transition to SAFTA. The plan, which identifies the time frame,
the modalities and different steps towards SAFTA, will serve as a
blueprint for successive rounds of trade negotiations by the IGG.
</P>
<P>
The IGEG also finalized the terms of reference of an in-depth
regional study on the implications to the member states of
progression from SAPTA to SAFTA.
</P>
<P>
The study will identify all non-tariff barriers, discriminatory
practices in this process and implications of revenue losses and
trade imbalances among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
The efforts for SAFTA were also featured by a number of new
areas of cooperation this year among SAARC member countries, such
as customs administration, promotion and protection of investment,
arbitration, standardization, avoidance of double taxation, civil
aviation and tourism.
</P>
<P>
For all its enthusiasm and determination, the regional grouping
has a long way to go in achieving its goal, observers say.
</P>
<P>
SAARC seems to be somewhat hard-pressed for time as it
struggles to meet the target, for there were no concrete measures
on economic cooperation until 1995 when the organization
celebrated its 10th birthday. And currently intra-SAARC trade
accounts for only 3 percent of the region's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Wide discrepancies in tariff concessions exist among member
countries. A study carried out by the Metropolitan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry in Bangladesh found that only 10 out of the
106 items that India offered on the first tariff concession
schedule were relevant to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In addition, of the 35 products on the Pakistani concession
list, Bangladesh can export only four. Bangladesh itself offered
concessions for 12 commodities, but four of them have never been
imported by the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that due to corruption, bureaucracy, political
instability and political mistrust among nations, South Asia faces
more problems of non-tariff barriers, which are more obstructive
than tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, widespread poverty, which SAARC vows to eradicate
as the principal culprit through closer regional cooperation and
faster economic development, is in the first place a constraint on
greater economic cooperation among members.
</P>
<P>
But the coin has the other side. "Geographical proximity of our
countries, shared history, common tastes and habits and of course
the strong political will which has been displayed for years are
the favorable factors for moving towards the SAFTA," Attri said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, India and Pakistan, the two key players in the region,
are both committed to SAARC economic cooperation and the SAFTA
process, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is widely held that peace and stability in the region will
undoubtedly help SAARC develop faster, although there are still a
lot of challenges for member countries to meet ahead in this
regard, observers say.

SHANTOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chaoyang City, one of China's
top 100 counties (cities) from south China's Guangdong Province,
is witnessing rapid economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that the gross industrial output value
of Chaoyang, one of the hometowns of overseas Chinese, reached
16.9 billion yuan (over two billion US dollars) in January-October
of this year, increased by 25.5 percent compared with that of the
same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises have made one fourth more profits than
they did last year. The export trade volume surpassed 3.6 billion
yuan, 50 percent more than last year.
</P>
<P>
This southern city has obtained a financial revenue of over 500
million yuan (about 60 million US dollars), 20.5 percent more than
1996.
</P>
<P>
The average annual growth rate of Chaoyang's gross domestic
product, industrial and agricultural output value and financial
revenue has been kept above 30 percent since 1993 when Chaoyang
was escalated to a city from a county.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang also takes advantage of itself as one of the most
well-known hometowns for overseas Chinese in the country. Nearly
1,000 overseas-funded businesses are in operation in the city.
And It has established 11 bases producing goods for export.
</P>
<P>
"The economic growth rate of Chaoyang is rare even in the
world," commented renowned Chinese economist Xiao Zhuoji, who
believed that conditions are ripe for the city's economy to
take off.

<HEADLINE> Howard Says Australian Economy "Fire-Proofed" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy had
been "fire-proofed" from the Asian economic crisis, Prime Minister
John Howard said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that he could not predict what was going
to happen in the coming months as a result of Asia's problems.
</P>
<P>
"We have fire-proofed Australia's economy against the ravages
of the Asian economic meltdown," Howard told the ABC (radio) AM
program.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know precisely what's going to happen over the months
ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do know that although there will be some impact on
Australia, of course, and nobody suggests for a moment there
wouldn't be some impact, but it's not going to be severe and the
reason it's not going to be severe is that we have got our
economic foundations in very solid shape," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The budget review downgraded its GDP (gross domestic product)
forecast for 1998-99 down to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Howard described Thursday's mid-year budget review as
"fantastic".
</P>
<P>
"What the government has done in turning around a 10.5 billion
Australian dollar (7.27 billion US dollar) deficit into a
prospective surplus of 2 billion Australian dollars (1.32 billion
US dollars) or more next year is quite extraordinary." he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's an heroic economic achievement, achieved in the face of
enormous obstruction from the Labor party and others in the
Senate," he added.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997-98 May budget papers the government projected the
underlying budget balance to tip towards a surplus of 2.5 billion
Australian dollars (1.65 billion US dollars) up from the earlier
1.6 billion dollar (1.05 billion US dollar) estimate.

<HEADLINE> Space Rice Harvested in South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists have
recently harvested about 103,860 kg of space-treated rice from 12
hectares of land in Loudi of south China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
Named "Space Flight-1", the space-treated rice was developed
from "Rice Louyu-3", a hybrid of rice and maize.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, some "Rice Louyu-3" seeds took an 88-hour journey in
the outer space on a retrievable satellite. They were exposed to
high cosmic radiation and induced into mutation.
</P>
<P>
The agronomists planted the retrieved seeds, "Space Flight-1",
and found that the new strain of rice has shown great advantages
as it has been stablized after five generations.
</P>
<P>
This year, the agronomists sowed "Space Flight-1" on an
experimental plot of 12 hectares and harvested an average of 8,655
kg of rice per hectare. The highest yield per hectare reached
9,360 kg.
</P>
<P>
The "Space Flight-1", with shorter stalks and longer kernel, is
disease-resistant and has a good tillering capability.
</P>
<P>
The agronomists noted that the new strain of rice can be grown
as early rice because of its earliness of ripening.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Rice Research Institute, the
"Space Flight-1" contains 12.9 percent of crude protein.

<HEADLINE> China's 1997 Sugar Output to Top 7.4 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China's sugar output will top
7.4 million tons this year as the 1997-1998 refining period
begins, according to the China Light Industry Council (CLIC).
</P>
<P>
This year's output will basically meet domestic demand,
according to the CLIC.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is based on the good harvest of sugar-bearing
crops in major sugarcane growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Sugar-bearing crops were planted on 1.6 million ha in
1997. Favorable weather conditions enabled the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and Yunnan and Guangdong provinces to raise this
year's output over the 1996 figure.
</P>
<P>
China's sugar output set a record during 1991-1992 refining
period, but then plummeted for three successive years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
issued an ultimatum to the former rebel UNITA movement, demanding
it complete all the regulations under the 1994 Lusaka peace
agreement by January 22 next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Angolan State Radio today, the ultimatum was
included in a document on the Angolan peace process presented to
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
through representatives of the process observers: the United
States, Russia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the Angolan government urged UNITA to
strictly observe the peace accord and complete the remaining
tasks before January 22 such as disbanding all its soldiers and
surrendering all its weapons to the U.N. Observers Mission.
</P>
<P>
The government also asked UNITA to allow the establishment of
local governments in sensitive regions, such as Bailundo where
the UNITA headquarters are based, Andulo, and Cazombo which is
rich in diamonds as well as Jamba which used to host its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process is now at a standstill and the U.N.
sanctions against UNITA have not effected as expected. The fifth
summit between Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos Santos and
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi planned for late November or early
December failed to take place as schedule.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar has
finished Friday on a negative note, slumping one US cent following
a rise in the US dollar/yen exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished the local session at 65.08 US cents,
little changed from its opening level of 65.13 but one US cent
lower than 66.07 late Thursday after being knocked down in
offshore dealings.
</P>
<P>
Initially touching a bottom at 64.93 US cents in Australasian
trade Friday, the local unit spent most of its time circling the
65.10-20 area.
</P>
<P>
"There is some good two-way business going through, really on
the back of the weak yen," IBJ Australia foreign exchange manager
Darrin Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
The selling against the yen emerged as market players
negatively reassessed the likely impact of the Japanese
government's economic package announced this week.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a two trillion yen tax rebate had initially
been positively received but traders are now questioning whether
the measures will be enough to pep up Japan's moribund economy.
</P>
<P>
"It still looks heavy. People are looking at the package in
Japan," ANZ Investment Bank head of foreign exchange sales John
Reedyk said.
</P>
<P>
"The US dollar/yen is expected now to head north towards 130
yen and above, so the Aussie should trade on the downside again,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in the yen flowed through to a number of other
Asian foreign exchange and equity markets Friday, adding to the
Australian dollar's bearish tone.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended here at 84.05
yen from 84.15 previously and at 1.1521 marks from 1.1719.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France Prepare Grand Celebrations to Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and France will hold
grand celebrations in the coming months to mark the bicentenary of
forging modern relations between them despite a call for boycott
of the event, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will visit France in May on
the occasion of the event, the agency quoted Egyptian Ambassador
to France Ali Maher as saying in Paris Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Maher disclosed that an Egyptian pavilion costing 43 million
French francs (7.2 million U.S. dollars) will be inaugurated
Friday in Paris as part of the cultural celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's modern relations with France date back to French
expedition to Egypt in 1798 led by Napoleon Buonaparte who later
became Emperor of France.
</P>
<P>
The planned celebrations have stirred controversy. Some
Egyptian writers and groups have blasted the event as a
"celebration to mark an invasion of Egypt, which led to the
killing of many Egyptians." They have called for a boycott of the
event.
</P>
<P>
Maher said Egypt and France enjoy good ties, and the two
countries share similar views regarding various issues,
particularly the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Modify Foreign Investment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's government will make
major adjustments to its policy on foreign investment in the near
future, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Through the adjustments, the forth time since the law was first
adopted in December 1987, Vietnam hopes to draw some 15 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign capital in the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The revisions in the past were intended to create a more
favorable and attractive investment climate for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign investors, however, have demanded the Vietnamese
government accelerate its "open-door" process by diversifying
investment forms and expanding investment fields.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, foreign investors have pledged a combined
investment of 30 billion dollars in Vietnam, and 46 percent of the
total has been disbursed, the VNA report said.
</P>
<P>
The total annual sales of foreign businesses operating in the
country have amounted to 6.5 billion dollars, with export earnings
accounting for 30-35 percent of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
Some 84 percent of the total foreign capital was distributed in
three main economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
As illegal imports and business frauds are hurting local
producers, foreign investors hope the government could take quick
move to protect their manufacturing operations in Vietnam.

constructions of the era of former President Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
-- It is a small democratic revolution in South Korea, as Kim
Dae-Jung, the unique candidate of the opposition, was elected on

<HEADLINE> All Singapore Airlines Flights to Be Smoke-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Airlines (SIA)
announced Friday that all its flights worldwide will be smoke-free
from February 1, 1998, fulfilling its commitment to provide
smoke-free services.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the SIA operates more than 1,000 services each week,
of which more than 90 percent are smoke-free. The exceptions are
non-stop flights originating or terminating in Japan. From
February 1, 1998, these flights will be no-smoking services too.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the percentage of smokers in Japan is higher
than in many other countries. For this reason we have carefully
monitored passenger reaction to no-smoking services on Japanese
routes over a period of three years and have taken a progressive
approach to phasing out smoking on these services," Michael Tan,
SIA Deputy Managing Director (Commercial), said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a recent survey by Japan Tobacco Company showed
that the ratio of smokers in Japan is declining and the SIA
decided it was now appropriate to make all its services
smoke-free.
</P>
<P>
The daily Singapore-Tokyo-Los Angeles service went smoke-free
in October 1994, by which time the SIA had already phased out
smoking on all services except those to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The SIA first introduced smoke-free travel on shuttle flights
between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Capital of Malaysia, in April
1988, and became the world's first airline to offer a smoke-free
service between the United Kingdom and Australia in December 1993.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's President-Elect to Abide by IMF Bailout Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, president-elect of
South Korea, on Friday pledged to fully abide by the bailout
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The most important thing right now is to recover and strengthen
international trust over South Korea, Kim told a press conference
in the meeting hall of the National Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I will faithfully implement the agreement with the
IMF. Painful as it may be, it is the road that we must take," he
said after winning South Korea's 15th presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Kim is the first opposition leader to become the president of
the country since its founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will open its market with no hesitation, so as to
create a new environment for foreign investors to bring capital
into the country without fear and reservation, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
Amid a financial crisis triggered by the failure of a group of
conglomerates and bad loans of lending institutions, South Korea
signed a 57 billion U.S. dollars deal with the IMF on December 3.
</P>
<P>
In talking to the press, Kim appealed to the people to share
burdens for reconstruction and a new economic miracle. "We need
the tears, toil and dedication of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, Kim proposed
for a resumption of the inter-Korean talks and a summit based on
the implementation of the Basic Agreement signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would seek close cooperation with the United
States, Japan, China and Russia and push forward the four-party
talks over the peninsula's peace.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Naira to Be Convertible in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
planning a pilot test to turn the nation's currency Naira
convertible in the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The test, reportedly approved by the International Monetary
Fund on certain conditions, is expected to be done in the next
three months, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The national newspaper quoted government officials as saying
that the two main conditions of the fund have been fulfilled. But
the response of central banks of other countries in the
sub-region is not known.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of these banks is indispensable since the
convertibility of Naira would cover only transactions routed
through their current account transactions
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the planned convertibility has been lauded by
members of the organized private sector in the country, saying
that it will facilitate their quest to do more business in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is widely reported that Naira has been accepted in
non-governmental trade activities, especially trade at the border
areas, for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
Some financial experts have, however, warned that the
government would come under much pressure to radically upgrade
its data systems when Naira becomes convertible.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they argued, the pressure on the currency would
belie the real state of Nigeria's economy, and this could induce
unwarranted depreciation of Naira.
</P>
<P>
The experts therefore urged the government to overhaul its
data agencies to ensure availability of timely and correct data
on the actual size of the economy as well as the sizes of both
internal and external debts.
</P>
<P>
All these have direct bearing on how an economy and its
currency are perceived, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Huaihe River Polluters Face Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises discharging
excessive pollutants into the Huaihe River face production
suspensions or closure by the end of this month, according to the
Environment and Resources Committee under the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
According to a committee official, some 1,500 enterprises dump
100 or more tons of pollutants each into the Huaihe River on a
daily basis. The Huaihe, one of China's major rivers, meanders
through Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and Shandong provinces.
</P>
<P>
385 of the aforementioned enterprises are located in Jiangsu,
560 in Henan, 308 in Anhui and 303 in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Central Government set 1997 state
standards for controlling the volume of pollutants discharged by
enterprises in the Huaihe River Valley to ensure clean water
quality of Huaihe River by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
59.6 percent of the enterprises have fulfilled standards, 10.4
percent have been forced to close, and 28.3 percent are currently
installing facilities to reduce waste discharged into the river.
</P>
<P>
The committee recently organized a working group of officials
from the four provinces to conduct a fact-finding tour along the
Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Recent water samples indicate the volume of organisms in
industrial waste water discharged into the river has dropped 40
percent, with signs indicating improvements in the water quality.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Evaluations of Assets Involving Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Import and export commodity
inspection bureaus at different levels should closely cooperate
with local customs in improving evaluations of assets involving
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
While importing goods, some overseas investors quote higher
prices than actual value in an attempt to evade tariffs, according
to a circular jointly issued by the State Administration of Import
and Export Commodity Inspections (SAIECI) and the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some overseas investors also quote lower values
for imports in an attempt to evade inspections.
</P>
<P>
The circular stipulates that all overseas investors will be
required to subject themselves to evaluations of machinery,
equipment, parts and other materials imported as investment by
local commodity inspection bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will be required to apply for evaluations
and complete special forms prior to importing the said goods. The
SAIECI designed both the special seals and forms used by local
bureaus.
</P>
<P>
Local customs should check completed forms when overseas
investors submit customs declarations, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors also be required to submit all data when
applying for evaluations. Local bureaus will issue evaluation
certificates to applicants within 45 days after accepting
applications.
</P>
<P>
The SAIECI will examine and verify the names of commodity
inspection offices which agree to evaluate assets involving
foreign investment. The inspection seals will be submitted to the
General Administration of Customs and customs throughout the
country for record.

<HEADLINE> China Expects To Add 1.5 Billion Tons of Oil, Gas Reserves in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China expects to add 1.5
billion tons of proven oil reserves this year, the largest amount
for the past decade, according to Shen Pingping, president of the
Chinese Academy of Oil and Gas Exploration and Development.
</P>
<P>
China has discovered ten major oil and gas bearing structures
this year, each with 100 million tons of oil at least, two-thirds
of the country's new oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
These oil and gas bearing structures are along the Liaohe River
in northeastern China, the Junggar Basin, the
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin, the northern rim of the Qaidam Basin,
the Baimamiao region of the Sichuan Basin, the Turpan-Hami Basin
in Xinjiang, and the Songliao Basin in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the ten are in central and western parts of China,
which contributed to more than half of the country's newly-added
oil and gas reserves this year, Shen said. The
Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Sichuan, Junggar Basin, and Tarim Basin had
100 billion cu.m. of gas in all.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have contributed a lot this year to
proving oil and gas reserves, collecting seismic data, getting
pictures of geological layers, and drilling and logging.
</P>
<P>
A total of 302 million tons of oil and four billion cu.m. of
gas have been found in the Bohai Basin in east China.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the work this year has paved the way to reach
the goal of having five billion tons of oil and gas reserves by
the year 2000.

<P>
LIANYUNGANG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The seaport at the eastern

<HEADLINE> California Quakes Links With Seasonal Pattern: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- There might be some
correlation between recent earthquakes in California and seasonal
changes in air pressure, scientists suggest.
</P>
<P>
Shang Xing Gao, one of the two scientists who made the finding,
reported their research in the latest American Geophysical Union
conference beginning last week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Gao and his partner Paul G. Silver work at the Carnegie
Institution, a private organization engaged in basic research and
advanced education in biology, astronomy and the earth science in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
The fact that quakes in California occurred most often in
September and least often in April has led them to believe in a
seasonal pattern.
</P>
<P>
Their finding is the latest scientific oddity emerging from
research on the Landers earthquake in Southern California on June
28, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The 7.3-magnitude quake, centered in the town of Landers in the
high desert, transmitted seismic waves for hundreds of kilometers
across the American West.
</P>
<P>
In the five years following the quake, the two researchers have
monitored every incidence of quake in California and bordering
states.
</P>
<P>
They say western tremors tend to peak in September, several
weeks after the annual low in atmospheric pressure. In the west,
air pressure tends to reach the lowest during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
Their claim has revived the interest in an old discredited idea
that quakes may be triggered by the atmosphere above the ground.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts said major, destructive quakes in the
1980s and earlier ones did not show any atmospheric correlation.
</P>
<P>
Tom Henyey, a geophysicist with the Southern California
Earthquake Center, said if they are right, the question how
exactly the atmosphere help trigger quakes remains.
</P>
<P>
"Periods of lower air pressure might relieve pressure on an
earthquake fault, making it easier for it to slip," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lions Clubs Foundation Helps Catarat Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- "I'm very happy today to be
able to see the sweet smiles of my wife and children," said a
farmer at a recent meeting with a national cataract surgery group.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuefu, from suburban Changde in central China's Hunan
Province, is among the 1,400 who have restored their eyesight
after effective cataract surgeries, supported by an international
program.
</P>
<P>
"Sight First China Action", co-sponsored by the Chinese
Government and Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF), has
helped 2,000 blind people regain eyesight since its start in
August from north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that more than four million Chinese suffer
from cataracts, most resulting in blindness.
</P>
<P>
Because of existing medical conditions and other limitations,
only 9,000 patients can receive cataract surgery in Hunan among a
total of 180,000 sufferers, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The medical group has wound up its surgery tour of the rural
areas of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Nationalities Autonomous
Prefecture, Changde City, Yongzhou City and Huaihua Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The surgeons transplanted artificial crystalline lens into the
eyes of 639 patients.
</P>
<P>
The China Disabled Persons Federation, Ministry of Health and
LCIF also provided the patients with 660,000 yuan worth of
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The program will fund operations for 1.75 million people
suffering from cataracts and also train 4,000 ophthalmologists in
the upcoming five years.

ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Lahore High Court
(LHC) suspended Friday an order of the Chief Election Commissioner
that rejects the nomination papers of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (PML-N)'s presidential candidate Rafiq Tarar.
</P>
<P>
Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum from the court, who issued a
notice Friday to acting Chief Election Commissioner Mukhtar
Junejo, has referred the petition of Tarar to the LHC for the
constitution of a larger bench to discuss as the matter involves
important constitutional aspects.
</P>
<P>
Tarar was nominated as presidential candidate by the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League (PLM-N) Monday to bid in the presidential
election scheduled on December 31.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chief Election Commissioner rejected Thursday the
nomination papers of Tarar due to his alleged remarks against the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
After detailed scrutiny of the candidates for the presidential
election, the Chief Election Commissioner also rejected Thursday
the nomination papers of 22 other candidates, leaving only six
candidates in the run.
</P>
<P>
According to the order issued by the Election Commission, those
who remain in the contest for the presidency included Haleem
Siddiqui, the covering candidate of the PML-N.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Small Coal-Firing Power Plant in Chinese Province Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The oldest small coal-firing
power plant in east China's Shandong Province has been closed
down, reflecting the beginning of Shandong's efforts to phase out
small coal-firing power plants.
</P>
<P>
The Fangzi Power Plant, built in 1939, has a generating
capacity of only 42 megawatts, reported the recent issue of China
Trade News.
</P>
<P>
The power plant discharged 9,200 tons of soot and 224,000 tons
of waste water a year, seriously polluting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of the plant was announced by the Shandong Power
Group Company, which supervises the province's power industry.
</P>
<P>
The group company plans to close down 193 small
coal-firing power plants each with a generating capacity of less
than 25 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's dislike of small coal-firing power plants is in line
with the Chinese government's policy to encourage the building of
big and medium-sized coal-firing power plants while gradually
forcing small ones out of the market.

BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Domestically-manufactured
durable products have taken the biggest share of China's market, a
survey has shown.
</P>

The survey found that domestic brands have acquired the biggest
market share of most kinds of durable consumer products such as
refrigerators, washing machines, and TV sets. Domestic brands have
dominated almost all these products' top ten places for market
share.
</P>
<P>
The survey has shown that a product brand is playing an
increasingly important role in the product's market share, and
Chinese consumers are showing bigger recognition of name brands.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition is going on among different brands, the
survey said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Raises $70M from Privatized Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has raised 70 million
U.S. Dollars from privatized firms except the privatized copper
mines since the privatization program started in 1993, Zambia
Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a spokesman of the Zambia
Privatization Agency (ZPA) as saying here Thursday that the 70
million Dollars represents income from 224 parastatal firms sold.
</P>
<P>
Another 107 parastatals will be sold, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the ZPA is not in the position to know how
much revenue has been raised from the sale of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the country's major foreign
exchange earner, since the negotiations are being conducted by a
different team.
</P>
<P>
The agency does not expect total receipts from privatization
to be much higher at the end of the privatization program given
that most of the in-coming companies are in form of investment
commitments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the remaining companies are said to owe substantial
liabilities while others are in "limping state" which requires
huge investments to make them viable.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza said earlier that the
important issue about privatization was not how much money was to
be realized but rather the benefits such as investment flows to
make the firms efficient and save them from collapse.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been a mixed reaction to this assertion
with some people saying the firms were being sold at a give-away
price while other feel the economic benefits are what matters
than how much is raised from the sale, according to the local
newspaper.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
has made remarkable progress in high-tech development in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Fujian Provincial Science and Technology
Committee showed that the number of the province's high-tech
enterprises has increased from 20 in 1992 to the current more than
200. High-tech added value now accounts for 14.4 percent of the
province's total industrial added value, ranking the second in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fujian started the construction work on a high-tech development
belt in late 1980s, consisting of high-tech development zones in
the cities of Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Xiamen. The
belt now is expanding across the province.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou Science and Technology Zone has scored the fastest
development of high-tech industry. The zone's high-tech output
value for 1991 was less than 300 million yuan (about 36.1 million
US dollars), and the figure for 1996 jumped to two billion yuan
(240 million US dollars). In the first six months of 1997, the
zone's high-tech output value had exceeded two billion yuan (240
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the province's Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000),
its annual high-tech output value is expected to reach 65 billion
yuan (7.83 billion US dollars) in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Output to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production
will decline to less than 70,000 tons during the crop year from
October 1997 to September 1998, the East African Standard
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure will be below a previous forecast of 74,915 tons by
the Coffee Board of Kenya and 82,902 tons in the previous crop
year, industrial sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"As we see things on the ground, production this (crop) year
will be below 70,000 tons. Freak rains caused by El Nino are
responsible," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpour in the last two months resulted in sharp fall
of coffee production across this eastern African country, the
sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also badly affected roads in major coffee
producing areas, making it difficult to transport the products
for processing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, weekly coffee auctions have been suspended until
January 6 after prices hit the roof last week to fetch up 560
U.S. Dollars for a 50-kilogram bag of clean coffee.
</P>
<P>
The auctions were suspended to enable dealers to proceed on
Christmas holidays and to allow enough stocks to accumulate for
next year's auctions, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Large Military Plant in China Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A military enterprise in
southwest China's Sichuan Province has gone bankrupt due to weak
market competitiveness, leaving more than 1,700 employees out of
work.
</P>
<P>
The Wuzhou Power Source Plant, built in 1970, was one of the
largest and most advanced enterprises in China specialized in
alkaline battery production. It had 130 million yuan worth of
assets.
</P>
<P>
But in September last year, the plant had to apply for
bankruptcy, because it could do nothing with its 71 million yuan
of losses and 300 million yuan of debts. One month later, a local
court declared its bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
However, the news has not been made public until recently.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the plant was confronted with tense market
competition, mainly from some multinational corporations and
Chinese private firms. The state-owned plant was the loser,
said Xu Tiancan, a former senior engineer in the plant.
</P>
<P>
Lack of new products and efficient marketing measures was the
major factor for its failure, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Now, the plant has been bought over at 72.5 million yuan by the
Sichuan Changhong Electronics Group, China's largest color TV
producer, and turned into the Changhong Power
Source Company, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The new company has produced its first batch of batteries.

<HEADLINE> China Commends Model Prisons and Reeducation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Justice
today commended 15 model prisons and 10 model
reeducation-through-labor centers scattered throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Building modern prisons and reeducation-through-labor centers
represents a "significant move" to portray the true image of
related Chinese institutions, according to Minister of Justice
Xiao Yang, who was speaking at the commendation ceremony held in
Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang urged prisons and reeducation centers throughout the
country to render appropriate punishment for criminals and
introduce effective measures to reduce recidivism.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the ministry also recognized five prisons and five
reeducation centers as model institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Prison Law, passed in 1994, stipulates comprehensive and
strict regulations governing the management of prisons, and the
rights and obligations of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to modernize the vast majority of the
country's prisons and reeducation centers by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
All model prisons and reeducation centers honored by the
ministry feature stable internal order, modern facilities and
advanced management systems. In addition, they offer education and
recreational activities for prisoners and other detainees.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts attending the ceremony noted that the combination
of punishment and the transformation of China's prisoners through
reeducation will effectively prevent and reduce illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past five years show that less than eight
percent of inmates released from prisons and centers commit
crimes. China, in fact, is one of the countries in the world with
the lowest recidivism rates.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Graduates of 1998 Looking for Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- An educational official warned
Chinese graduates of 1998 that they should not expect too much
when looking for jobs, instead, they should try to find their
proper positions.
</P>
<P>
Gan Beilin, director of the student job assignment division,
said that related departments are working out policies to
encourage the graduates to work in the remote and impoverished
areas.
</P>
<P>
The state used to pay tuition for college students and assign
them jobs after graduation. But the state began to adopt a
"pay-to-learn" scheme in 1994. The students are responsible for
their own tuition and are encouraged to look for jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese graduates are facing more and more
difficulties in job-hunting. When Beijing's graduates of 1997 left
colleges this July, about 15 percent of them had not found their
jobs, said Gan.
</P>
<P>
"It's not because Chinese college graduates are too many," said
Gan, who has been in charge of student graduation and
job-assignment work for a decade.
</P>
<P>
So far, only three percent of the Chinese population have
received higher education. In Beijing, the capital and cultural
and political center of China, the number is only 13 percent,
compared with 30-50 percent in the western countries.
</P>
<P>
Gan explained that impractical expectations of many college
graduates do not conform with the demand of the society, since
they only want to work in large companies, important government
organs, and key research institutions, and seek prestige, good
working conditions, high pay, and chances of going abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, it is those middle- and small-sized enterprises in
small cities and remote areas that need graduates most, said
Gan. Statistics showed that only 0.3 percent of the workers in the
village and township enterprises in suburban Beijing are college
graduates.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Cholera Death Toll Rises to 118 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of cholera
in Zanzibar has killed 118 people in three weeks, The Guardian
said today.
</P>
<P>
"It's an epidemic -- it's not yet contained. We're still
having a high number of cases," Helena Eversol, project officer
with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) based in Zanzibar,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Eversol as saying the only good news was that
the rate at which people were dying was slowing and that meant
treatment was working.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zanzibar Health Minister, Said Bakari Jecha told
reporters Thursday that there has been a downward trend in the
last 48 hours with many patients being discharged.
</P>
<P>
Above-average seasonal rains, lack of latrines and waste
disposal pits, and contaminated drinking water are believed to be
the causes of the epidemic which began at the start of the month.
</P>
<P>
All schools on the island have been closed, festive gatherings
banned and the sale of water-based drinks and food, including ice
cream, prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar, a popular tourist destination, comprises two major
islands, Unguja and Pemba, with a population of around 840,000.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 570 had
been admitted to hospital by Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two task forces made up of international organizations and
local government and media representatives have been established
and were coordinating their work under the Zanzibar Health
Ministry, Eversol said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Growing in Eastern Chinese Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has had rapid growth in overseas investment in agriculture in
recent years, amounting to about 800 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu approved 800 foreign-funded agricultural projects in
the past few years, and at least 100 agricultural and sideline
product processors have annual output worth 100 million yuan each,
according to a provincial Agriculture Department official.
</P>
<P>
The Ruyi Group in Lianyungang has become the largest exporter
of vegetables and largest processing company after using Japanese
government loans and direct overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has made up for insufficient domestic
investment in agriculture, and has helped speed up agricultural
development in Jiangsu, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the potential high rate of return on investment,
more investors from the U.S., Japan, and Singapore have been
coming to Jiangsu, and have brought agricultural technology and
more advanced seed strains with them. This will help change the
local traditional agriculture structure.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Revenue Collection Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan governmental revenue
grew by 6.5 percent to 825 million U.S. Dollars this year, up 6.5
percent from 1996 but 86 million Dollars below the target, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 governmental expenditure stood at 900 million Dollars
at the same level of 1996 but eight million Dollars below the
target.
</P>
<P>
Value Added Tax and import and excise duties were all below
target, the report quoted Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) chief
economist Maurice Kanga as saying.
</P>
<P>
While, governmental borrowing from the CBK shot up by 47
million Dollars to 273 million Dollars this year, going further
to burden the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing, plus 4.7 million Dollars from non-bank sources
and 1.5 million from the sale of state enterprises, was used to
repay commercial banks (120 million Dollars), to finance the
purchase of goods and services (some 125 million Dollars) and to
repay external loans (33 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the government was taking tough measures to
meet a budget shortfall of 135 million Dollars by speeding up the
privatization of non-strategic state institutions, increasing
collection of income tax arrears and cutting development
spending.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall is due to salary increases in October for
teachers, university lecturers and police, which will cost the
exchequer 217 million Dollars -- some 153 million Dollars more
than the Finance Ministry had set aside.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also managed to keep inflation rate low
despite the coming general elections through a tight monetary
policy.
</P>
<P>
Continued inflow of foreign exchange has stabilized the
Shilling ahead of the poll set for December 29.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Girls Engage in Sex Before Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Some Zambian girls engage
themselves in sex before marriage for fear of being ditched by
their boyfriends, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
During a two-day workshop held near Lusaka recently on
enhancing youth peer education, some young female participants
charged that they were forced to have sex because they feared to
enter into new relationships after being ditched.
</P>
<P>
"A man can move from one woman to another and society will
call him a star while a woman will be called a prostitute. Some
young women are falling in the sex trap in the hope of
maintaining the relationship," said one female participant.
</P>
<P>
The workshop organizer, the Youth Activist Organization (YAO),
warned the youth about the dangers of getting involved in
relationships based on sex.
</P>
<P>
YAO project coordinator Holo Hachonda said YAO is sensitizing
youths to develop the courage of saying "no" to casual sex to
lessen problems such as unwanted pregnancies, STDs and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Lwiindi Musanu, another YAO official, urged women not to allow
men to use them as sex objects.
</P>
<P>
"Many young women get worried if they have no steady affair.
There is need to sensitize them that sometimes they are better
off without a boyfriend who will only use them as sex object,"
Musanu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herdsmen Join Hands in Control of Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- In Uxin Banner of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, a 200-hectare meadow with trees
has caught herdsmen's attention, because it is built on the Mu Us
Desert.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, there was a sandy waste with only 10 hectares of
grassland. Nayin Bair, a Mongolian herdsman, contracted the wasteland
and spent five years to transform it into an oasis.
</P>
<P>
"In the first year when I contracted the wasteland in the desert,
the annual income of my family was about 300 yuan," said Nayin
Bair, "I could hardly raise my cattle. Forty of my 70 sheep died of
lack of forage grass."
</P>
<P>
Nayin Bair now raises more than 200 Ordos sheep. He has also
built 3.7 hectares of the wasteland into irrigated farmland to
grow corn and herbage. Now, he earns about 10,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Nayin Bair's achivements represent Uxin Banner's efforts to
mobilize local farmers and herdsmen to control the expansion of
deserts.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the Mu Us Desert, Uxin Banner has 1.16 million
hectares of land, but 94.8 percent of the land are sandy wastes.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s, the farmers and herdsman in Uxin
Banner began to transform the sandy wastes into farmland at a rate
of 33,000 hectares a year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Uxin Banner government further encouraged
herdsmen to participate in a "household share-holding" program to
contract a certain amount of desert land for transformation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ming, a local government official, said that up to now
more than 500 herdsman households have joined in the
desert-transforming program.
</P>
<P>
He said that to be more effective, the herdsmen have even
turned to use airplanes to plant grass. In the last two years,
eight herdsman households adopted aerial planting on their
contracted desert land and now the new method has been applied on
91,000 hectares of land in the banner.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of the ecological environment in Uxin Banner
has promoted the growth of local economy. In 1996, the heads
of cattle in the banner rose to one million for the first time and
grain output increased by 43.8 million kilograms over 1990. The
annual income per herdsman has risen from 70 yuan in 1990 to 1,824
yuan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Cut Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government, mindful
about balancing the budget, decided on Friday to cut its five-year
defense spending by 920 billion yen (7.2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Expenditures under the fiscal 1996-2000 defense buildup program
will be down to 24.23 trillion yen (189.3 billion dollars) from
25.15 trillion yen (196.5 billion dollars) originally earmarked.
</P>
<P>
The decision, said a Kyodo News report, was made at a meeting
of the Security Council of Japan, headed by Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, and a subsequent session of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government program initially called for acquiring, among
other military equipment, 96 type-90 tanks, 168 armored vehicles,
47 F2 next-generation support jet fighters and eight destroyers.
</P>
<P>
However, under the latest decision, these new equipment will be
limited to 90, 157, 45 and 7, respectively; and military exercises
will also be curtailed, said government officials.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary outlays for maintaining the U.S. military forces in
Japan will be cut by 60 billion yen (469 million dollars) over the
next three years, the first reduction in this respect since Japan
began setting aside such expenditures in 1978.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- An erosion control project
using World Bank loans on the Loess Plateau is nearly half through,
with 250,000 ha. of water-eroded land treated and 22 million
tons of silt dammed.
</P>
<P>
The Loess Plateau is one of the most seriously water-eroded
area in the world and the major source of silt in the Yellow
River. Nine tributaries of the Yellow River run through the
plateau.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to spend 2.1 billion yuan (253 million
U.S. dollars) in eight years on transforming farmland in the peril
of erosion into steady high-yield fields and on planting trees and
grass in the valleys of the nine tributaries.
</P>
<P>
In the valleys of the nine rivers, 14,000 ha. of land suffer
from water erosion, producing 120,000 tons of silt into the
Yellow River annually.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting 38,000 ha. of orchards and economic forest
built in the project area, a WB official said that the targets of

<HEADLINE> Moi in Attempts to Remove Ethnic Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has declared security zones on the ethnic violence-torn
common borders of four districts in Nyanza and Rift Valley
provinces ahead of the December 29 poll.
</P>
<P>
The move apparently aims to end the clashes which killed some
35 people over the past month alone along the boundaries of
Gucha/Trans Mara, Gucha/Migori and Kisii/Trans Mara districts,
local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi directed Nyanza Provincial Commissioner Wilson
Chepkwony and his Rift Valley counterpart Yusuf Haji to move into
action immediately to curb the situation.
</P>
<P>
He subsequently barred politicians loyal to both the ruling
party and the opposition from outside the area from campaigning
along the common border areas in these districts.
</P>
<P>
"Only candidates of various parties within the constituencies
affected by the ethnic strife will be allowed to campaign there,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Democratic Party presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki
toured the security zones hours after Moi announced the ban and
Social Democratic Party's aspirant Charity Ngilu vowed to tour
the clash-prone region today.
</P>
<P>
Moi also ordered that any security officer hailing from the
warring communities be withdrawn immediately and neutral officers
from other communities be deployed.
</P>
<P>
"We shall post security officers who have no interest in the
area to bring the situation under control," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moi sacked Trans Mara police boss who is on charge of
laxity in handling the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Kisii, Luo and Maasai tribes have clashed along their
common boundaries for several months, leaving charred villages
and thousands of residents displaced.

<HEADLINE> CPC Develops External Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) has made important progress over the past year by actively
maintaining contacts and developing relations with political
parties in foreign countries, according to CPC official Dai
Bingguo.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with People's Daily, Dai, head of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee, said the
CPC has maintained contacts and exchanges with over 300 political
parties in more than 130 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, according to Dai, the CPC has established
links with a dozen political parties in a number of countries,
including Russia, Mongolia, Japan, Thailand, Malawi and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
He said the International Department has sent delegations to
Latin American countries which have not yet established diplomatic
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that the CPC has established contacts with almost all
major parties in Latin American countries that have not forged
diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC, with 58 million members, is developing
comprehensive, multi-level and multi-form external relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have gained a steadily increasing number of friends in
terms of party-to-party relations," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted this year's highly successful 15th CPC National
Congress, and said that a prominent characteristic of the CPC's
work for this year centers on making the congress better known to
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC received over 300 congratulatory messages from
200 political parties and organizations and leaders from over 100
countries. The number of messages received, both during and after
the congress, was unprecedented in the history of CPC congresses.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the CPC has extended a great effort to promote
relations between China and other countries, and in so doing has
fully used the advantages of party-to-party relations.
</P>
<P>
Dai pointed to numerous high-level visits by delegations from
communist parties in Socialist countries such as Viet Nam, various
Western nations and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that meetings between leaders of the parties and top
CPC leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji,
Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao and Wei Jianxing, have had a positive
influence on the development of relations between China and said
countries.
</P>
<P>
Visits by senior CPC leaders, including Hu Jintao and Wei
Jianxing, to Latin America, Asia and Europe helped promote
friendly relations and cooperation between China and countries
concerned, said Dai.
</P>
<P>
Dai stressed that the CPC is willing to forge new
party-to-party relations with political parties throughout the
world in line with the principles of independence, equality,
mutual respect and mutual noninterference in internal
affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Ulgi, chairman of the
Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China,
said here recently that the region will do its best to maintain
its economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The region has had rapid development since the country
initiated the reforms and opening-up policy in 1979, he said, but
during the process of industrialization, the region has also
encountered some problems like waste of resources, a deteriorating
environment, and an increasing population, which limit economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The region should take advantage of its resources to sustain
its development, he said, and better management should be part of
the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The local government is working hard to develop a service
industry with a growth rate higher than that of heavy and light
industries, according to the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Ulgi emphasized that the region should pay equal attention to
controling its population, saving resources, and protecting the
environment in the process of developing and that the population
in the region should not exceed 24.39 million by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Convenience Stores Popular in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Even with the fierce
competitions, Shanghai's convenience stores are doing well in the
chain store business.
</P>
<P>
The stores are usually located in densely-populated residential
areas, where they provide food, cooking oil, sweets, soap, toilet
items, cosmetics, newspapers, and magazines, and over-the-counter
medicines for working people, young people, and students.
</P>
<P>
They get customers by providing better service than large
supermarkets, which may include free boiled water and the use of
microwave ovens, and booking air and plane tickets. Most stores
have a refrigerator and tables and chairs, and are often open 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The Lianhua Supermarket Co. Ltd, which has 180 outlets, is a
pioneer in the convenience store business in Shanghai, China's
largest commercial center, and plans to increase the number of
convenience stores to 380 in three years.
</P>
<P>
Economists have a good opinion of convenience stores, and say
they have a special competitive advantage in the retail sector,
since they are small and flexible, and they supplement the large
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
They have been told, however, that they should improve their
management to face competition. Some large supermarket companies
are already eager to become involved in the business.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Africa Trying to Solve Its Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Although it is still like
wirewalking between violence and peace throughout 1997, Africa
has begun moving with its own forces and achieved gratifying
successes in settling its own problems that threaten stability on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
Among the driving forces of the trend are the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD) grouping seven
nations in the east African region and the Horn of Africa and the
16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
It is widely recognized that it was through IGAD's vigorous
mediation that the re-start of face-to-face peace talks between
the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) had become a reality in late October after a
three-year stalemate.
</P>
<P>
A major breakthrough emerged at the July IGAD summit when
Khartoum unexpectedly gave ground by accepting negotiation
principles the IGAD drafted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The principles which favor a secular state and more autonomy
in southern Sudan, cleared the way for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides now are set to open the second round of
talks next April with a shared understanding that diplomacy was
the only key to a settlement to Sudan's 14-year civil war which
has ended in economic devastation of the country.
</P>
<P>
In west Africa, after Sierra Leone's democratically elected
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was toppled by a
military coup in May this year, the Nigeria-led ECOWAS moved on
swiftly to the restoration of democracy, peace and security in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the high pressures imposed by ECOWAS through shuttle
diplomacy, tight economic embargos together with shell raids, the
Sierra Leonean mutineers were forced to agree in late October to
return the power to Kabbah's government next April.
</P>
<P>
"There is a consensus by the whole of Africa" that a
government freely elected by its people can only be changed by
its people, Salim Ahmed Salim, chief of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), noted when acclaiming the ECOWAS bid.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, fruitful efforts by African states on
their own will to ease or remove regional tension were observed
in 1997 across the whole continent stretching from Somalia in the
east to Rwanda and Burundi in the center; from Liberia in the
west to Lesotho and Swaziland in the south.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of the African community have helped Chad to
regain stability after decades of fighting and the government of
elected President Ange-Felix Patasse in the Central African
Republic to survive from an army mutiny.
</P>
<P>
Unrest inside both Lesotho and Swaziland has been scaled down
and the successful general election in Liberia in June this year
has given more hope to a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Territorial disputes between Chad and Libya, between Nigeria
and Cameroon, between Eritrea and Yemen, as well as between
Namibia and Botswana have also been settled as a result of the
common effort by the parties involved around the region.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by Egypt and Ethiopia, the warring sections in
Somalia are to attend an official peace negotiation in Addis
Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia, this month, igniting new hope
for ending the country's seven-year-long anarchy.
</P>
<P>
It was the concept that African problems should be solved by
Africans themselves that dominated September's U.N.-hosted
meeting of African foreign ministers in New York.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 actually saw "a surprising new determination by
many African countries to take command of their own regional
affairs," a veteran western analyst exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The new trend in solving African problems by African forces
comes with a firm consensus among African countries that the
development and security of one country cannot be isolated from
what is happening in its surrounding countries, and if the crisis
in one country is not checked, it could spill over into the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged war in southern Sudan directly led to the
severance of Sudan's diplomatic ties with Uganda and Eritrea. For
years, Sudan has traded with the two neighbors charges of hosting
rebels fighting to overthrow their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
In the Great Lakes region, the influx of refugees has become a
big problem as a result of one million or so of Hutus fleeing
Rwanda in 1994 for fear of reprisals over the genocide in which
more than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsi people, were killed.
</P>
<P>
"No country in Central Africa will have lasting peace as long
as tension exists in other countries of the sub-region." said
Gabonese Foreign Minister Casimir Oye Mba when he was mediating
the bloody clash in Congo mid this year.

<HEADLINE> China Develops New Medicine for Anemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China has become the fourth
country in the world to produce erythropoietin (Ep), a kind of
protein which can be injected to treat anemia, by genetic
recombination.
</P>
<P>
The new medicine was developed at the Nanjing Military Medical
Institute and is produced by Nanjing Huaxin Bio-Engineering
Medicine Co. LTD. after having obtained approval from the Ministry
of Health.
</P>
<P>
Ep is a significant element in producing blood in the human
body, and mainly produced in the kidneys. Many patients with renal
problems also suffer from anemia caused by shortage of Ep, or
renal anemia.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that when patients suffering renal anemia were
given injection of the new medicine, the recovery rate is 88
percent.
</P>
<P>
Doctors also found Ep effective in treating other types of
anemia.
</P>
<P>
Previously, only the United States, Germany and Japan produced
this medicine.

<HEADLINE> EU to Review Ban on Bangladesh Seafood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
review the ban on the import of frozen seafood from Bangladesh by
the end of next month, a senior European Commission (EC) official
said here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
A decision regarding the ban on the import of frozen shrimp
from the South Asian nation would be made by January next year,
Ruth Albuquerque, head of the EC's South Asia Desk, told reporters
after her week-long visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
She hinted that the ban would be lifted at the meeting of the
EC Council of Ministers next month, citing the example of
Madagascar where a similar ban had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, imposed
a ban on Bangladesh's shrimp in September this year for failing to
meet the EU's health and environmental requirements.
</P>
<P>
A technical team from the EC concluded its inspection on
Thursday of six fishing companies which Dhaka recommended in early
November as meeting the EC's standards, but results of the
inspection were not available so far.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics show that
the number of people out of work in New Zealand increased by 1.9
percent to more than 173,000 in November, Television NZ reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Employment Minister Peter McCardle as saying
that while any increase in jobless numbers is undesirable, it is
the second lowest rise in November in nine years.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the number will continue to climb in the
coming months. They said many factories had overemployed in the
past year to keep in line with the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that more and more unskilled workers will be
out of job, while skilled workers will take a bigger share in the
total work force.

<HEADLINE> Le Jingyi Focuses on Relay in Perth Swimming Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic champion Le
Jingyi won't compete in the 50 and 100 meters freestyle events in
January's world swimming championships because of tiredness and
elbow injuries, a Chinese coach said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Le will focus on the women's 4x100 freestyle relay and won't
compete in her two speciality individual events," her coach Zhou
Ming told reporters during the Chinese national short-course
swimming meet.
</P>
<P>
Le, who holds the world records over 50 and 100 meters, won
China's only swimming gold medal in the Atlanta Olympic Games by
beating American Amy Van Dyken and finished runner-up to Dyken
over 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chinese won the 100 meters event in the year's
world best time of 54.10 seconds at the Chinese National Games
here in October, two months after she snatched the 50 meters title
in the Pan Pacific Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Le was really tired and has been troubled with elbow
injuries," Zhou said. "Therefore she opted out of individual
events in the world championships."
</P>
<P>
The world championships will be held for January 8-18 in Perth,
Australia. Shan Ying, who won the 50 meters final and placed
second over 100 meters in the Chinese National Games, is now
China's top contender for the freestyle sprints in the Perth
Worlds.
</P>
<P>
"Le is too tired after a very competitive season," Zhou
said. "She has recently caught bad cold twice and her training is
sporadic."

<HEADLINE> S'pore Refineries Face Mounting Price Pressures: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's oil refineries
are facing mounting price pressures in the fourth quarter of this
year and the first of next year, as the continuing currency crisis
in Asia hit the industry with its spin-off effect, the Business
Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting industry executives, the Business Times report said
that the currency crisis had dealt a double blow on the industry,
causing a fall in regional oil demand, with this situation
exacerbated by outpouring of discounted oil products from South
Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, badly hit by the currency turmoil, are
believed to be desperately trying to raise foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Given this scenario, the executives said that the fourth
quarter performance by the Singapore oil industry is now likely to
be worse than in the previous quarter which already witnessed
refiners in the dumps with poor margins. And no respite is
expected in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the initial impact of the South Korean
woes was felt here as early as June/July this year, when some
surplus South Korean products, like petrol, began flowing out
because of lackluster home demand.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation was worsened in the last two months,
with a lot of oil, something like 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per
day, especially diesel and gasoil, coming out of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence, prices out of (South) Korea started to fall.
(South) Korean products are being sold here at an average discount
of 60 to 70 US cents per barrel to Singapore refinery prices," one
executive was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This had further dampened already weak refining margins here
caused by the earlier outflow of some 150,000 to 200,000 barrels
daily from Thai refineries, since September, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Given the price pressures, another executive was quoted as
predicting that prospects are poor, as a lot of businesses are not
doing anything much, and this must result in lower demand for oil
products.

<HEADLINE> Indian Customs to Introduce Fast Clearance Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian customs decided
to introduce a fast clearance scheme for the country's importers
from January 1 next year to enable them to clear their
consignments much faster than before in the customs, a government
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will become effective first in Mumbai (Bombay),
Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Sahar Air Cargo complex. The
government is trying to introduce the scheme in all major ports
and air cargo complexes in the country from the same date.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme will allow importers to avail of the facility of
self assessment. After filing a "Bill of Entry" complete with the
relevant original documents, importers will be allowed to pay duty
after a mere check of calculations. After payment of the duty,
importers will be given "out of charge" and no examination of the
goods shall be carried out in the docks.
</P>
<P>
After the goods have been cleared, the import documents will be
sent back for post audit check.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Takes Steps to Encourage Private Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
offering several incentives to encourage private sector investment
in road construction projects which are badly needed for the
country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The incentives included a 40 percent capital subsidy,
guaranteed traffic flows and flexibility to fix toll charges. The
capital subsidy to investors would entail acquisition of land and
licensing the land at concessional rates to potential investors, a
Surface Transport Ministry official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow flexibility in fixing toll charges is a
major departure from the current policy framework under which the
ministry fixes both the concession period and a ceiling on tolls,
making large projects unattractive to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
The Surface Transport Ministry has also offered minimum
guarantees on cash flows to potential investors. These guarantees
would operate on the basis of traffic projects measured on the
basis of passenger car units per annum with an annual growth rate
factored in. If the actual traffic falls below the projections
agreed upon by the ministry and project promoters, the ministry
will compensate the promoters.

<HEADLINE> Tighter Money Supply Growth Target Set in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, will tighten control over the country's money supply
next year to reduce inflation and boost public confidence in the
planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
At its last meeting of this year, the Bundesbank central
council left Germany's two benchmark interest rates -- the
discount rate and the Lombard rate -- unchanged at 2.5 percent and
4.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, has also decided to lower the target growth
range for the country's money supply in 1998 to between 3 percent
and 6 percent. The growth range in 1997 is from 3.5 percent to 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
This is a countermove to a government decision to increase
value added tax (VAT) next year which is said to have a
"multiplying effect" on the country's inflation, according to
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer at a news conference in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Bundesbank also wants to strengthen public
confidence in a stable Euro and to prevent any turbulence on the
foreign exchange market on the eve of the 1999 launch of the
European Monetary Union (EMU), Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
The German mark cannot enter the EMU with an inflationary
potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German government and the main opposition Social Democratic
party agreed last week to raise the VAT by 1 percent to 16
percent from April next year.
</P>
<P>
This is to help finance the country's increasing pension
payments. According to the estimates of the Bundesbank, the VAT
hike alone is likely to increase the inflation rate by one third
of a percentage point next year.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Latin America Endeavors to Secure Due Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Along with the development
of economic globalization and regional integration, Latin America
has been endeavoring over recent years to sharpen its competitive
edge to secure its due status in the future world economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
While making sustained efforts for economic development and
reform, Latin America has been trying to promote economic and
trade relations with all other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
After the crises in the 1970s and 1980s, Latin America started
an economic recovery at the beginning of the 1990s and is now in a
period of stable growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from different sources show that by the end of this
year, the region's gross domestic product growth rate, based upon
the increase of previous years, is to reach a 15-year record high
of five percent.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Latin American countries, long time
practicers of domestically-oriented economic modes, have not only
generally faced acute international competitions, but are also
increasingly becoming vulnerable to the process of global
interdependence.
</P>
<P>
Thus, to establish economic and trade relations with all other
regions is a strategic step Latin America has taken to adapt
itself to the global economic environment.
</P>
<P>
As regional integration is part of the world's economic
globalization, Latin American countries have attached great
importance to cooperation among organizations of regional
integration as well as cooperation among different countries.
</P>
<P>
The South American Common Market (Mercosur), a regional trade
bloc formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1991,
has developed rapidly in recent years. Trade volume between the
Mercosur members has risen sharply. It is expected to reach 60
billion U.S. dollars this year, as compared with merely 4.6
billion dollars in 1991 when Mercosur was born.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, mutual investments between the four countries
have increased year by year and total more than six billion
dollars today.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur's flourishing development has attracted countries like
Chile and Bolivia, which became its associate members in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The integration of other regional organizations, including the
Andean Community, the Central American Common Market and the
Caribbean Community, is also moving forward fast.
</P>
<P>
To expand its traditional trade and economic cooperation with
the United States and Canada constitutes an extension of the
regional integration process of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
For Latin America, the United States is the largest investor
and market, and Canada, an important economic cooperation partner.
</P>
<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been vital
in promoting trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States
after it was signed in 1994. Now other Latin American and
Caribbean countries have shown their interest in joining the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
To further strength economic and trade cooperation among
American countries, the Unites States, Canada and Latin American
countries plan to set up the Free Trade Area of the Americas
before the year 2005, and will discuss the details at the Second
Summit of the Americas in Chile next April.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of economic and trade cooperation with European
Union (EU) countries is an important step of Latin America in
diversifying its capital and technology sources as well as its
export market.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest trade bloc, the EU has overtaken the
United States in terms of annual trade volume with Latin America.
Meanwhile, its investment comprises a 35-percent share of the
region's total foreign investment, only second to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the four-member Mercosur and the 15-member EU agreed
in Madrid, Spain, that by 2005, they would have established a free
trade zone covering a population of 600 million in 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
High-level contacts between Latin American and EU countries
have increased this year. Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
visited France and Germany in October, in an effort to push
forward negotiations on a free trade agreement with the EU to
build an economic partnership at an early date.
</P>
<P>
In March, French President Jacques Chirac went to Brazil,
Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, and his proposal on an
Europe-Latin America summit evoked widespread responses from Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In the same manner, Latin America values its trade and economic
relations with Asian-Pacific nations. Cooperation between the two
regions has been strengthened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, trade volume between Mexico and Asian countries
has been growing at a fastest pace as compared with that between
Mexico other region, at an average annual rate of 28 percent.
Meanwhile, trade volume between Brazil and Venezuela on the one
hand and Asian countries on the other has grown at an average
annual rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chile has made itself a major trade partner of Asian-Pacific
countries, with its sales to the region accounting for more than
one-third of its total export.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Latin America and China has also grown
rapidly over recent years, from less than 3 billion dollars a year
in the early 1990s to more than 6 billion dollars annually today.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and development of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum have created favorable conditions for
strengthening economic cooperation and trade contacts between Asia
and Latin America. Chile and Mexico have taken the lead to join
APEC and Peru will follow. More Latin American countries are
expected to join.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the development of economic and trade relations with
all other regions, the Latin American economy has entered a phase
of vigorous and stable growth. In 1996, the region's overall trade
volume increased by 11 percent over 1995 to a total of 543 billion
dollars. This year, it is expected to increase by 20 percent over
last year.

<P>
Moreover, the development of economic and trade relations with
all other regions has enabled Latin America to avoid excessive
reliance on the U.S. economy, and has contributed to enhancing the
region's capability of economic self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Poland declines Russia's Proposal of Food for Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government turned
down the Russian jets-for-food proposal on Thursday after the
U.S. offer of its F-16 fighters.
</P>
<P>
ITAR-TASS reported Wednesday that Russia is interested in
trading 100 of its latest model SU-39 fighters for about 3 billion
dollars worth of food from Poland.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Russian Prime Minister made the proposal to
the Polish government last year and received an enthusiastic
response.
</P>
<P>
However, before Poland could give a positive reply, the United
States offered to sell F-16s to Poland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Russia's proposal, a Polish Defense Ministry
spokesman said as a future NATO member Poland has to
consider political factors when chosing which aircraft to
buy. Poland will definitely discuss with NATO members which
aircraft to use to arm its air force.
</P>
<P>
He added Poland is planning to buy some multi-function aircrafts
through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
"what interests Poland most is the opportunity to take over the
production of the aircrafts and pay Russia off with Polish
industrial products instead of food," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Polish government spokesman said on Thursday that the
government has not received a formal proposal from Russia yet and
will think it over when it does.
</P>
<P>
Bronislaw Komorowski, who chairs the Defense Committee of the
National Assembly, asserted that the proposal made by Russia is
only "a trial balloon."

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Latin America Endeavors to Secure Due Economic Status (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Along with the development
of economic globalization and regional integration, Latin America
has been endeavoring over recent years to sharpen its competitive
edge to secure its due status in the future world economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
While making sustained efforts for economic development and
reform, Latin America has been trying to promote economic and
trade relations with all other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
After the crises in the 1970s and 1980s, Latin America started
an economic recovery at the beginning of the 1990s and is now in a
period of stable growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from different sources show that by the end of this
year, the region's gross domestic product growth rate, based upon
the increase of previous years, is to reach a 15-year record high
of five percent.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Latin American countries, long time
practicers of domestically-oriented economic modes, have not only
generally faced acute international competitions, but are also
increasingly becoming vulnerable to the process of global
interdependence.
</P>
<P>
Thus, to establish economic and trade relations with all other
regions is a strategic step Latin America has taken to adapt
itself to the global economic environment.
</P>
<P>
As regional integration is part of the world's economic
globalization, Latin American countries have attached great
importance to cooperation among organizations of regional
integration as well as cooperation among different countries.
</P>
<P>
The South American Common Market (Mercosur), a regional trade
bloc formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in 1991,
has developed rapidly in recent years. Trade volume between the
Mercosur members has risen sharply. It is expected to reach 60
billion U.S. dollars this year, as compared with merely 4.6
billion dollars in 1991 when Mercosur was born.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, mutual investments between the four countries
have increased year by year and total more than six billion
dollars today.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur's flourishing development has attracted countries like
Chile and Bolivia, which became its associate members in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Vows Not to Join Yugoslav or Balkan Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatia will never rejoin any
Yugoslav or Balkan union, the Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
announced in a speech to parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman made the address to mark the amendment of the
Constitution and the seventh anniversary of the promulgation of
the first constitution of the republic.
</P>
<P>
He said the newly passed constitutional amendments ban Croatia
from joining any Yugoslav-Balkan community of states.
</P>
<P>
This ban is "truly historic" and represents a legal
confirmation of the Croatian people's struggle for national
freedom and independence, Tudjman said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a historic mission for the Croatian people to
safeguard the independence, autonomy and democracy of their
country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to work for the realization of equality for
all citizens, respect for human rights, social justice, economic
growth and national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian president criticized such social evils as
bureaucracy, malfeasance, abuses of power, human rights violations
and encroachment on national interests.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed at the government agencies for their
inefficiency and negligence in fighting against economic crimes
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He urged all public servants to work earnestly for the welfare
of the people instead of seeking personal gains or those of
interest groups.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A gunman who took more than
60 children and adults hostage at a day care center in Texas
surrendered on Thursday night after releasing his last two
captives, his own son and stepson.
</P>
<P>
The two-day standoff ended when the 33-year-old armed man,
James Monroe Lipscomb Jr., gave up shortly after 9 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Police said Lipscomb had tried to rob someone outside the
nearby Plano Bank and Trust on Wednesday afternoon before he
stormed the Rigsbee Child Development Center in Dallas' north
suburb and took the more than 70 children and teachers hostage.
</P>
<P>
He released most of the children and five adults soon on the
same day, but only let another group of children free this
morning, keeping only his own children in the house.

<TEXT>
<P>
The integration of other regional organizations, including the
Andean Community, the Central American Common Market and the
Caribbean Community, is also moving forward fast.
</P>
<P>
To expand its traditional trade and economic cooperation with
the United States and Canada constitutes an extension of the
regional integration process of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
For Latin America, the United States is the largest investor
and market, and Canada, an important economic cooperation partner.
</P>
<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been vital
in promoting trade between Mexico, Canada and the United States
after it was signed in 1994. Now other Latin American and
Caribbean countries have shown their interest in joining the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
To further strength economic and trade cooperation among
American countries, the Unites States, Canada and Latin American
countries plan to set up the Free Trade Area of the Americas
before the year 2005, and will discuss the details at the Second
Summit of the Americas in Chile next April.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of economic and trade cooperation with European
Union (EU) countries is an important step of Latin America in
diversifying its capital and technology sources as well as its
export market.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest trade bloc, the EU has overtaken the
United States in terms of annual trade volume with Latin America.
Meanwhile, its investment comprises a 35-percent share of the
region's total foreign investment, only second to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the four-member Mercosur and the 15-member EU agreed
in Madrid, Spain, that by 2005, they would have established a free
trade zone covering a population of 600 million in 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
High-level contacts between Latin American and EU countries
have increased this year. Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
visited France and Germany in October, in an effort to push
forward negotiations on a free trade agreement with the EU to
build an economic partnership at an early date.
</P>
<P>
In March, French President Jacques Chirac went to Brazil,
Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Bolivia, and his proposal on an
Europe-Latin America summit evoked widespread responses from Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In the same manner, Latin America values its trade and economic
relations with Asian-Pacific nations. Cooperation between the two
regions has been strengthened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, trade volume between Mexico and Asian countries
has been growing at a fastest pace as compared with that between
Mexico other region, at an average annual rate of 28 percent.
Meanwhile, trade volume between Brazil and Venezuela on the one
hand and Asian countries on the other has grown at an average
annual rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chile has made itself a major trade partner of Asian-Pacific
countries, with its sales to the region accounting for more than
one-third of its total export.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between Latin America and China has also grown
rapidly over recent years, from less than 3 billion dollars a year
in the early 1990s to more than 6 billion dollars annually today.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and development of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum have created favorable conditions for
strengthening economic cooperation and trade contacts between Asia
and Latin America. Chile and Mexico have taken the lead to join
APEC and Peru will follow. More Latin American countries are
expected to join.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the development of economic and trade relations with
all other regions, the Latin American economy has entered a phase
of vigorous and stable growth. In 1996, the region's overall trade
volume increased by 11 percent over 1995 to a total of 543 billion
dollars. This year, it is expected to increase by 20 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the development of economic and trade relations with
all other regions has enabled Latin America to avoid excessive
reliance on the U.S. economy, and has contributed to enhancing the
region's capability of economic self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Maintain Close Partnership with Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungary said Thursday that
Czech President Vaclav Havel's naming of a new Czech prime
minister Wednesday will not affect the two country's "strategic
partnership."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Hungarian Telegraph Agency (MTI),
Horvath Tamas, chief foreign affairs adviser to the prime
minister, said Hungary will maintain its "strategic partnership"
and close cooperation with Prague as usual.
</P>
<P>
Havel named Josef Tosovsky, Central Bank governor, as his new
prime minister following the resignation of Vaclav Klaus in a
party finance scandal on November 30.
</P>
<P>
Horvath said political leaders in the Czech Republic have
pledged a pro-Europe policy and efforts to speed up the European
integration process.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic and Hungary are partners in the bid to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Horvath said despite the fact that the Czech Republic and
Hungary once had differing views on regional cooperation, they
have been closely coordinating their policies toward European
integration closely.

<HEADLINE> Chip Prices Likely to Remain Weak in 1998: Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing currency crisis
in Asia is threatening sales plans for wafer fabs in Singapore as
they may have to contend with a delay in the expected rebound in
global chip sales next year, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The analysts, quoted by the Business Times Friday, said that
chip prices are likely to remain weak next year, with persistent
fab overcapacity and demand not rising enough to match supply.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times report said that Chip maker SGS-Thomson is
cautious about next year as the regional economic turmoil has
compounded existing industry problems.
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President Choong Chan Yong of the Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing (CSM), a prominent local wafer maker,
said that with all these currency issues happening out there, it
is difficult to project really far into 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, he also noted that despite the currency crisis,
business, as expected, "recovered quite considerably" in the
second half of 1997, following two halves of successive poor
showings.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization has also improved this year, with CSM's
first fab operating at close to full capacity, and its second and
third fabs operating at close to full utilization of installed
capacity.
</P>
<P>
But a drop in specialty chip prices has squeezed profits over
at SGS-Thomson this year and the French-Italian chip maker said
that it would slow down the building of its 700-million-US-dollar
second wafer fab by almost a year until end-1999, according to the
Business Times.
</P>
<P>
In another example, Hitachi Nippon Steel has pushed back its
production plans. The company's fab is in pilot production, and
volume shipments will start in the second half of 1998 instead of
the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
The analysts observed that indeed, the last two years have been
quiet on the investment front, with only two new investments
announced in 1996 and in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Singapore now has six wafer fabs in full production. In
addition, there is one fab under trial production while two others
are under construction. The island country hopes to have 25 fabs
by 2005.

BELGRADE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's President
Slobodan Milosevic urged the international community Thursday to
pave the way for democratically elected representatives to
play an active role in Bosnia.

<P>
Milosevic made the remark during a meeting with Carlos

During the meeting, Milosevic emphasized that the international
community should not attempt to monopolize Bosnian affairs. He
pointed out that supporting the decisions of these representatives
was not only in the interests of Bosnia's people but would also
benefit the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Milosevic called for the international community to
adopt an attitude of equality toward the two entities of Bosnia to
assure the balanced development of their economies.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Mexico Sign Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo and his Nicaraguan counterpart Arnoldo Aleman Thursday
signed a free trade agreement between the two countries in the
Nicaraguan capital.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents praised the signing of the treaty as being
important for the strengthening of bilateral relations and for a
market with 95 million people.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is the second Central American country to sign a free
trade agreement with Mexico. The first country is Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement practically includes all the areas of economic
activities: market access, agriculture, investments, copyright,
dispute settlement, government acquisitions, sanitary measures and
unfair practices," said Aleman.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Economy and Development Minister Noel Sacasa said
during a press conference after the signing of the agreement that
the agreement will come into force in the first half of 1998
after being approved by the respective legislatures.
</P>
<P>
He said that with this agreement Nicaragua will be able to
gradually eliminate trade deficit with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
According to Sacasa, Nicaraguan exports to Mexico will grow up
to 25 million dollars in 1998, if the country can sell 5,000 tons
of beef, 4,500 tons of powdered milk, 4,000 tons of beans and 500
tons of cheese to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that on the other hand, Nicaragua will be
able to attract more investments from Mexico and from other
countries.

signing of the free trade agreement, a main task for his two-day

<HEADLINE> Yearender: U.N. Faces More Challenges Than Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
found itself facing more challenges than opportunities in 1997,
with a worsening financial crisis attracting the attention of the
world.
</P>
<P>
For over half a century, the United Nations has played an
irreplaceable role in promoting world peace, security and advancing
the development of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
But since the end of the Cold War, it has become more and more
difficult for the world body to meet the growing demands of its
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The first problem is that the member states cannot agree upon
the mission and objective of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
While some countries argue that the United Nations should put
more emphasis on peace-keeping operations, the others believe that
economic development is more important.
</P>
<P>
The member states also have different opinions on whether the
United Nations should simply talk about human rights or should put
great efforts in solving social problems such as poverty and the
population explosion.
</P>
<P>
The second is the reform. With the changing of international
relations after the Cold War, the reform of the world body has
become the common wish of member states.
</P>
<P>
But the different interests of the member states have made it
very difficult for the reform to go forward.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some other Western countries maintain
that reform should be limited to reduction of agencies,
personnel, budgets and costs.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries, on the other hand, push for some
in-depth and constitutional reforms so that member states can
treat each other on a more equal footing.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis is the third problem facing the world body.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the United Nations can only rely
financially on the contributions of member states. Now it is owed
a total of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars by member states. Out of which
the debt of the United States accounts for 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
To keep the daily work going uninterrupted, the United Nations
has to borrow from the peace-keeping account, which in turn
damages the interests of the countries that provide troops to the
U.N. peacekeeping operations by delaying their fund return.
</P>
<P>
Despite the urgent and repeated appeals of the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and many member states, the
United States has refused to pay its debt in full.
</P>
<P>
The fourth problem lies in the tendency of over emphasizing the
importance of peace-keeping operations, while neglecting
development assistance under the pressure of some Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are quite dissatisfied with the
tendency and warned that if their economic development is delayed,
environment deteriorated or poverty situation worsened, the
developed countries will also be affected to a very large extent.
</P>
<P>
The fifth problem is that there are more expectations than
actions in the United Nations. Some countries are enthusiastic
about bilateral diplomacy and treat the United Nations as an
international forum.
</P>
<P>
Under such a situation, it is unavoidable that there are more
discussions than decisions, more decisions than actions. It is no
longer a rare case when a U.N. resolution is violated.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists that the United Nations need reform,
but at the same time it tries every means to twist the world body
to serve its national interests for world hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
As the top executive of the United Nations, Kofi Annan is both
worried and dissatisfied with the current situation. He has said
many times that unless thorough and fundamental changes occur, the
United Nations will not go into the next century as a vigorous
international organization.
</P>
<P>
Since he resumed office at the beginning of this year, Annan
has been working hard to reform the world body.
</P>
<P>
In March he recommended 29 reform measures and in July 15
reform suggestions. He hopes the United Nations will have a
clearer mission, so that its actions can become more coherent and
responsive.
</P>
<P>
Although as difficult as wire-walking, the reform process has
moved forward.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the United Nations faces more challenges than
opportunities. If the member states can set aside differences and
reach consensus for the sake of human peace and development, the
United Nations will continue to serve its special role in many
international fields.

<HEADLINE> Kansas Air Control Center Outage Delays Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A power outage at an air
traffic center that controls flights over several U.S. states
caused cancellations and delays throughout the Midwest Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were significant impacts on air traffic, but it was not
immediately clear how many airports or flights were affected, said
officials of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
</P>
<P>
The failure at the suburban Kansas City facility occurred about
9 a.m. local time and the outage lasted for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
The center controls air traffic in Kansas, Missouri and parts
of Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and Illinois. The
failure of the system could force flights through that airspace
either to be grounded or diverted.
</P>
<P>
Some morning flights at Kansas City International and Lambert
Airport in St. Louis were canceled and others were delayed, local
airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest air traffic incident since December 2, when
commercial flights in the southeastern United States were delayed
for more than an hour after dust forced the partial evacuation of
a major air traffic control facility in Jacksonville, Florida.

<HEADLINE> Nine USA States to Investigate Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine states of the United
States of America led by Texas have banded together in
investigating Microsoft's business practices.
</P>
<P>
California as one of the four states that has officially opened
an investigation into Microsoft, also joined the action, its state
attorney general's office revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nine states convened a three-day meeting in Chicago last
week to discuss actions against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
But the ground on which the states would sue Microsoft is not
clear.
</P>
<P>
The actions mirror the government's anti-trust lawsuit against
Microsoft, prompted by escalating concern that Microsoft is trying
to use its Windows operating system monopoly to dominate the
market for Internet software.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice accused the company of mocking
law Wednesday and again asked the federal court to fine one
million U.S. dollars per day for civil contempt.
</P>
<P>
Last week a U.S. District Court judge temporarily barred
Microsoft from requiring computer makers to install its Internet
Explorer Web browser with Windows 95 -- a practice that the
Justice Department says violates a 1995 anti-trust
agreement. Microsoft's response to the ruling has been widely
perceived as arrogant.
</P>
<P>
But this time a Microsoft spokesman said that the company is
willing to meet those attorney general offices and present its
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that a group of states have
threatened to band together and force a high-tech company to
change its ways.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, prosecutors from 20 states met also in Chicago to
consider legal action against American Online for spotty
service. The Online service provider quickly reached a settlement
with 44 states to provide cash refunds or free online time to the
disgruntled customers.

<HEADLINE> Names of Indonesian Vice Presidential Candidates to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The names of vice presidential
candidates for the 1998-2003 term have been collected and will be
submitted to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) for
consideration at its general assembly next year, Indonesia's House
Speaker Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
"All the names have been received by the MPR's Working Body and
they will be discussed and decided at the General Assembly," the
official Antara News Agency quoted Harmoko as saying Thursday at
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to the MPR's Working Body, the vice presidential
candidates are Try Sutrisno, current vice president, Harmoko,
house speaker, Hartono, information minister, Ginandjar
Kartasasmita, state minister of national development planning,
Siti Hardiyati Rukmana, one of the ruling party Golkar's top
leaders and President Soeharto's daughter, Ismail Hasan Metareum,
president of the United Development Party, Amien Rais, chairman of
the Indonesian Islamic Socio Organization "Muhammadiyah" and
General Wiranto, army chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
On candidates for the presidency, Harmoko stressed that Golkar
has been supporting Soeharto as its single candidate to be the
president again for the 1998-2003 term.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto had accepted the ruling Golkar's re-nomination of him
in October.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has won all six elections held under Soeharto. Golkar
won a landslide victory in May this year by obtaining 74.3 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-member MPR will convene in March next year to
formulate the 1998-2003 broad guidelines of state policy and elect
a president and vice president for the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto, 76, is widely expected to be re-elected for
a seventh consecutive term next year.
</P>
<P>
Given Soeharto's age, the vice presidential position is
regarded as even more important for the nation's future, observers
here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's 1945 Constitution, the vice
president is supposed to take over the presidential post if the
president cannot perform his duties.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 466 people or about
2.1 percent of the number of dengue-fever-infected persons
throughout Indonesia died from the cholera-like disease in 1997,
Antara News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar held here Thursday, Hadi M. Abednego,
director general of Contagious Diseases Eradication at the Health
Ministry, said the 1997 death rate was down from the 1996 figure
which reached 1,234 or 2.7 percent of 45,548 dengue-fever-infected
people.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dengue-fever-infected people or around 70 percent
were elementary school-age children, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical decease, leaves its victims
with fever, rash and severe pains in the joints and back. The
disease spread by mosquitoes, known locally as "muntaber", causes
vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
Abednego said the disease occurs in 162 districts, 891
sub-districts and 2,441 villages across the country.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Disburse More Fund for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Thursday said it would release the second installment
of South Korea's 57 billion U.S. dollar rescue package. It called
for united efforts to support the strong reform program.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told a press conference
that the 181-nation fund's executive board had decided, after
reviewing South Korea's efforts so far, to disburse another 3.6
billion dollar loan, thus bringing to nine billion dollars the
amount of support provided by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
By offering its assistance to South Korea, the IMF has
requested that South Korea restrain its economic growth, raise
taxes and interest rates, and slow the expansion of its powerful
conglomerates, as part of a program to restore confidence in the
currency and clean up the country's weak banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The 3.6 billion short-term loan for South Korea was disbursed
Thursday under a new IMF program approved on December 17 to help
countries facing the type of financial crises that so far this
year have rocked South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
South Korea obtained a rescue package from the IMF on December
3 and the lending institution paid a first installment of 5.6
billion dollars then. Fund officials have said South Korea is
scheduled to receive nearly 11 billion dollars by January 8.

<HEADLINE> Thai Civil Servants Urged to Be Frugal at Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Civil
Servants has urged its members nationwide to strictly adhere to
the government's austerity policy to help the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Khachadpai Burusapatana, chairman of the association, said on
Thursday that he will send letters to government offices
throughout the country to seek cooperation to help cut expenses at
the offices by 20 percent and scrap unnecessary projects.
</P>
<P>
He also called for that budgets for existing projects be used
wisely and prudently.
</P>
<P>
He said at the times of economic hardships, the civil servants
must work hard without demanding reward or extra money.
</P>
<P>
Khachadpai's appeal was in response to Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's concern earlier this week that the public sector's pay
bill had broken the 40-percent limit to stand at a "dangerous" 42
percent of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
If this was not reduced, there would be nothing left for
government investment, Chuan warned.
</P>
<P>
He said after three budget cuts, he did not want to make a
fourth one, which would hurt officials.
</P>
<P>
The civil service had escaped the pay cuts and layoffs felt in
the private sector, Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
Staff at some Thai embassies would also be reduced to save
expenditure, a foreign ministry official said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Lower House Passes 1998 Budget Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Lower House today
approved the Prodi government's 1998 budget draft and sent it to
the Senate for final approval.
</P>
<P>
The 25-trillion-lire (14.5 billion U.S. dollars) measure, which
passed with a 305-188 vote and three abstentions, contains 10
trillion lire in new revenues and 15 trillion in spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
The government expects the draft to give Italy the final push
it needs to participate in the European single currency among the
first group of nations on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Its passage was virtually assured, analysts say, after
yesterday's approval of one of the most contentious parts of the
budget, the welfare reform article which cuts 4.1 trillion lire in
social security costs and over 400 billion lire in health and
assistance sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Prodi government smoothed the budget's passage by agreeing
to several demands of the left-wing Communist Refoundation Party
this October. The party gives the government its majority in the
Lower House.

<HEADLINE> Restructure Industry In Western Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of Qinghai
Province in northwest China recently made a plan to restructure
its industrial sector which has seriously limited economic
development.
</P>
<P>
This year, 16,000 manufacturers in the province generated some
one third of the GNP in the province, but 63.5 percent of the
state-owned industrial enterprises are still running in the red,
and their assets-to-liabilities ratio is as high as 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
A provincial Planning Commission official said that enterprises
suffer from low profitability, inferior products, and improper use
of resources, and the present situation calls for a strategic
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is planning on giving full support to
the electric power, petroleum, salt chemicals, and nonferrous metal
industries to make full use of Qinghai's resources and to produce
goods with higher value.
</P>
<P>
It will also encourage mergers and listing of shares for large
businesses that are capable of competing in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the provincial government will back labor-intensive
industries that have incurred little debt.

<HEADLINE> Researchers See Potential in Bitter Melons as HIV Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai researchers believed that
bitter melons contain proteins which can inhibit the replication
of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
However, researchers from Thailand's Mahidol University said
that more than 10 years are needed before the protein extract from
bitter melon seeds could be developed into usable drugs.
</P>
<P>
The plant has been used by HIV-positive people in northern
Thailand since 1992, many of these people gained weight after they
ate bitter melons, which is known to stimulate appetite, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Bitter melon therapy was introduced to HIV-positive people in
the late 1980s in the United States and currently some researchers
in other countries and regions are tapping the potential on bitter
melon, botanically known as mamordica charantia, local newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, three proteins - alpha manorchorin, beta manorchorin
and map30 protein have been found active in inhibiting HIV.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Public Health Ministry now is studying the potential
of bitter melon for use in HIV treatment under its 'herbs for
HIV/AIDS' program.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Students Read Less Books Than Before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan students are not
reading as many books as those did a few decades ago because of
intense competition at schools and high book prices, a newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has urged school principals,
publishers and students to make a swift change of the situation,
the Island newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
She told them at her presidential residence Wednesday that
there was a definite drop in the time and interest the students of
today have for background reading in contrast to a few decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
The president attributed the drop to the hectic race that
students have to go through in preparation for examinations.
</P>
<P>
She said the competitive environment is so intense that the
time the students should have for sports, debate, discussions and
other activities is all lost.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they ended up in evening classes to spend extra time
on study, for which they had to pay a certain amount of money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recent surveys have also revealed that students are
moving away from reading due to the import duty and the turnover
taxes on books.
</P>
<P>
The duties and taxes have led to less demand by readers and in
a chain-reaction have caused many book shops to close.
</P>
<P>
Out of 1,100 book shops throughout Sri Lanka, about 700 have
closed down and been converted into textile shops or other trading
ventures, the paper said.

BUDAPEST, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is fully optimistic
about its European Union (EU) membership, Prime Minister Horn
Gyula said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a TV speech, Horn said the just-concluded Luxembourg EU
summit is of historic significance to Hungary because the summit
has made it possible for Hungary to join the EU in the first wave
of its eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the achievements Hungary has scored and
the efforts its people have made. The country's foreign policy
also played an important role, he added.
</P>
<P>
Horn said that the country's economic growth is steady and is
unlikely to be threatened by overbalance.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Hungary's economy will reach the lowest level
of development of EU countries and Hungary will receive all the
required ratifications for its EU membership between 2000 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
The two-day EU summit, which ended last Saturday, decided to
allow Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to be the first group
of the former Soviet allies to join the EU.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Natural disasters have
cost north China's Hebei Province 10 billion yuan in economic
losses this year, according to the province's Civil Affairs
Department.
</P>
<P>
The amount of crop loss from disasters was 3.26 million ha and
three billion kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
The disasters were mainly in the form of drought, hailstone,
flooding, and insects.
</P>
<P>
In the spring and summer, the province suffered a serious
drought after a long hot spell, with average rainfall down more
than 50 percent in most areas, which killed seedlings on a large
amount of farmland.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Chengde, 87 percent of the crops were affected,
and 153,000 ha produced nothing, and insects in Zhangjiakou ate
26,000 ha of crops.
</P>
<P>
In addition, coastal cities like Tangshan, Cangzhou, and
Qinhuangdao were hit by powerful wind and rainstorms, resulting in
1.1 billion yuan worth of losses.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Relief Project Benefits Farmers in Yimeng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A hostile environment. Hard
work for little reward. Never enough food or clothing.
</P>
<P>
Such was life a decade ago for most of the 1.5 million poorest
rural people in the Yimeng mountainous area in the southern part
of east China's Shangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
However, in Yimeng today, about 950,000 once indigent farmers
have bid farewell to such privation, thanks to a Sino-German
poverty-relief project, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The annual per-capita net income of the area's residents was a
threadbare 200 yuan (about 24 U.S.dollars) up to the late 1980s --
less than one-third of the then-national average or 10 percent of
the present level.
</P>
<P>
The environment of the area, one of China's 18 major
impoverished regions, had been worsening over the years, with
chronic drinking water shortages and serious soil erosion
complicating the plight of the area's farmers.
</P>
<P>
About half of the one billion yuan (120 million U.S.dollars)
project has been financed with free economic aid from the German
Government.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the program, which runs officially
from 1988 to 1999, a special commission has been established by
the two countries to manage the funds.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the program has poured 184,000 tons of wheat and
37,000 deutsche marks (about 54 million U.S.dollars) from the
German Government as free economic aid into the area.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the project has built 1,300 drinking water
projects, brought 603 square kilometers of eroded land under
control and increased effective irrigation in 7,500 ha, said Du
Shicheng, vice-governor of Shandong.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Du said, more than 1.5 million rural
people in the area's 11 counties and cities are expected to have
benefited from the projects in this long-term poverty-relief
program.

<HEADLINE> Russia Passes Energy-Saving Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government passed a
new energy-saving program on Thursday aimed at saving 365-435
million tons of standard fuels from 1998 to 2005 and reducing
energy consumption by 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, the program will be
implemented in two stages.
</P>
<P>
The first stage from 1998 to 2000 will highlight the
legislation on energy saving, the improvement of the management
and pricing systems, and the provision of high-quality and
low-cost equipment for the measurement and control of energy
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The second stage will focus on the development and
popularization of new energy-saving technologies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
If the program can be implemented as planned, Russia will be
able to stop all subsidies to energy supplies by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Russia consumed 840 million tons of standard fuels in 1996. The
figure will rise to 1.1 billion tons by 2001 if no energy-saving
measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Russia consumes two times more energy than western
European countries do for the same amount of Gross Domestic
Product.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Canadian Lean Pork Project on Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Second-phase work has
started on a Chinese and Canadian government-funded lean pork
project that began in 1995 in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to introduce animal husbandry technology from
Canada and produce high quality pork products. The second phase
involves Canadian help in setting up a farm and a joint venture
feed processing plant with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons of
meat, and continued assistance to Chinese in developing their own
lean pork breeding.
</P>
<P>
Early in the first phase, a pig breeding farm was set up to
house 312 Yorkshire hogs imported from Canada free of charge,
which has benefitted 14 Chinese provinces that have used the
improved hog species. During that period, 30 Chinese agronomists
from the farm were sent to Canada for further training.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that by 2000, the two pig farms will be able to
produce 620 of the animals for breeding stock, 5,000 second-grade
female hogs, and a million hybrid hogs and 450,000 young hogs for
export.
</P>
<P>
Yutian County, where the farm is located, is one of China's
major pork producers, with an annual slaughter capacity of 450,000
hogs and a stock of 350,000 hogs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Government is set to
pass legislation to allow foreigners to hold up to 100 percent in
Thai securities and brokerage businesses, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the world trade organization financial liberalization
pact reached last week, Thailand agreed to raise its 49 percent
foreign-shareholding limit to allow full foreign ownership in the
securities sector.
</P>
<P>
Laws to support the change will be passed within a month,
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several amendments are being considered to the alien
business law, under which more than 20 businesses are now reserved

<P>
For now, Supachai said, foreign investment in certain
restricted sectors will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to Eradicate Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government is resolved
to wipe out the "wild polio virus" and polio infections in the
country in the hope of eradicating the virus of the disease by the
turn of the century, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has launched national campaign in each of the past five
years, and the campaign has gained support from the Japanese
government, which has given donations for the purchase of vaccines
and senting experts to give on-the-spot technical advice.
</P>
<P>
Sources show that the Japanese government has donated 1.8
billion yen (about 14.35 million US dollars) to back the campaign
in the past seven years. The donations were used to buy polio
vaccines for children under four years old and to improve
cold-chain, way to store the vaccines and laboratory facilities in
China.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Japanese International Cooperation
Agency delivered about 30 million doses of polio vaccine to the
Ministry of Health yesterday in Beijing. The vaccines will be used
for a nation-wide supplementary polio immunization campaign next
month.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 million children aged four or below are expected
to receive supplementary polio vaccination in a second round on
January 5. The first round took place in early December.
</P>
<P>
Since Sino-Japanese co-operation started in 1990, the Japanese
government has sent about 100 short-term experts to help local
health areas carry out immunization and surveillance.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Grant Second Batch of Bailout Loans to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will grant its second batch of bailout loan valued 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars to South Korea before next Wednesday, said the Ministry
of Finance and Economy Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
IMF executive board made the decision to grant the loan at a
meeting Thursday. The loan will come to South Korea within five
days beginning from Friday with 2.1 billion U.S. dollars, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the IMF's second batch, worth one billion U.S. dollars
and 400 million U.S. dollars will be sent out to the country next
Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan also agreed Thursday to loan 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars to South Korea, which is suffering from a serious crisis
caused by failure of a group of conglomerates and bad loans of the
financial bodies.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with the IMF for the bailout loans with
harsh conditions, the ailing economy of South Korea, the 11th largest
one in the world has already received 5.5 billion out of the agreed
57 billion U.S. dollars early this month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Rural Consumers' Rights to Be Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China will make great efforts
to protect rural consumers' rights next year, according to an
official of China Consumers' Association (CCA) recently.
</P>
<P>
"Our annual theme of consumer protection work will be changed,
from this year's 'Providing Honest Service and Fighting Against
Cheating' to a new one for next year, 'The Benefits of Rural
Consumers'," said Cao Tiandian, director of CCA.
</P>
<P>
"About 80 percent of the Chinese population live in rural
areas, and rural consumers are weak compared with urban residents,
because of an undeveloped rural economy and a low level of
education, therefore causing a weaker sense of awareness and
ability of self-protection," Cao said.
</P>
<P>
Fake and shoddy goods are being transported to rural markets
from urban markets, which harms farmers and affects rural
production.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the successful implementation of the theme, CCA and
its local groups will arrange a nationwide survey of rural
consumers, asking if their rights have been infringed upon,
determining their self-protection awareness level and establishing
what kind of help they need, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
"We will also improve consumer protection groups in rural
areas, make laws on consumer protection and hold forums studying
the issue of safeguarding rural consumers," Cao added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Focuses National Strategy on Economic Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Thursday has rectified the country's security strategy, which now
gives priority to safeguarding economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rybkin, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, said
the strategic framework, which was introduced by the security
council, is a basic plan to guarantee the stable social
development and reconstruction of Russia, Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the strategy, which prioritizes the country's
economic security, the threat to Russia will not come from the
military field but exists as an economic crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It did not rule out the possibility of an external military
threat, but the strategy claims that regional and local conflicts
are more likely to occur than worldwide ones.
</P>
<P>
Russia intends to streamline and professionalize its army, and
maintain a certain number of nuclear weapons as a means to contain
aggression. The money saved will be used for the country's
economic reconstruction, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rybkin said that more concrete theories will be
introduced on the basis of the framework, which is only the
beginning of establishing a safeguarding mechanism for Russia's
security.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to pursue a sound national security
strategy, which was initiated during the period of the former
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Refuses U.S. Demand to Indemnify 1996 Plane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said today the
U.S. judicial decision to demand Cuba to indemnify the relatives
of the four occupants of two U.S. planes shot down in 1996 was
illegitimate and contrary to international laws.
</P>
<P>
The trial held in the United States, said Cuban Foreign
Ministry spokesmen Alejandro Gonzalez, was orchestrated by the
forces hostile to Cuba with an attempt to take advantage of the
U.S. aggressive policy" toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba does not feel bound in any way by that decision, said
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
The planes, which took off from Florida, United States, on
February 24, 1996, were downed by the Cuban Air Force 12.8
kilometers off its coast for violating the air space of the
Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
The United States has insisted that the incident occurred in
the international air space. In retaliation, it put into force the
"Helms-Burton Law" to frighten away foreign investment from the
island nation.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Future Success Assured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The return of Macao to the
motherland, which comes in two-years time, will be smooth, because
of the friendly, co-operative relations between China and Portugal
and the people of Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to a signed article by Xinhua reporters which is
released today to mark the beginning of the countdown, the return
of Macao, which comes on December 20, 1999, will represent another
great historical event in China's reunification drive, along with
the return of Hong Kong, which made a reality of the "one country,
two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese are inspired by this and are confident about
Macao's future, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and leaders have kept to their
commitment to the principles "one country, two systems", "Macao
people governing Macao", and "a high-degree of autonomy", since
the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The government places great importance on the Macao question
and, in 1993, the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) adopted
the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
giving legal backing to these principles for resolving the Macao
issue, and laying a foundation for a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have declared
repeatedly that the Chinese government is resolved to do a good
job of handling the Macao issue, and they have the support of the
Chinese people in this, it said.
</P>
<P>
The next two years are crucial to the Macao's return to the
motherland, and the forming of the Preparatory Committee for the
Macao SAR, the election of the Chief Executive, and the formation
of the Macao SAR government will be carried out in an orderly
fashion.
</P>
<P>
So, the question of the localization of civil servants and the
law, and the status of the Chinese as an official language,
required the co-operation of the Portuguese, the article said,
pointing out that the smooth return of Macao involves everyone in
Macao, whose people will witness and participate in the historical
process, and will continue the tradition of the love of the
motherland and of Macao and work hard for a smooth transition.

<HEADLINE> Poor Chinese Mothers Benefit From Happiness Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A happy smile often appears on the
face of Chen Chaoqiu, a farmer in Sichuan Province of southwest
China, as she expects to earn 12,000 yuan this year, thanks to a
nationwide project to aid poor mothers.
</P>
<P>
Chen is one of the 23,295 poor Chinese mothers who have
benefited from the Happiness Project, which started in 1995, with
the aim of helping mothers in poverty.
</P>
<P>
But things were quite different two years ago. The per-capita
income of her family in Danzi Village, Xuanhan County
was 390 yuan only, making her one of the poorest in the
county.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she began to raise milk cows, using a 2,000-yuan
loan provided by the project, and earned 1,118 yuan. Now she has
repaid the loan and has been cited as a model in achieving
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated by the China Population Welfare
Foundation and China Family Planning Association. Women account
for a large proportion of China's remaining 58 million poor
people in rural areas, and 80 percent of women in poverty are
illiterate and also plagued by poor health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The relief effort has received a positive response from people
from walks of life. To date, the project has received some 150
million yuan in donations from home and overseas. And local
supporting funds and money from other channels have
exceeded 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The project has given priority to poverty relief, illiteracy
eradication, and medical treatment. After experiments in four
provinces in Anhui, Gansu, Guizhou and Shaanxi provinces, the
poverty relief effort now has been expanded to 51 counties in 23
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Of the 189 households involved in the project, in Puding County
of southwest China's Guizhou Province, 80 have had enough to eat
and wear, and another 81 have met almost all poverty relief
targets.
</P>
<P>
In Qianshan County of east China's Anhui Province, 150 poor
mothers were taught to plant tea trees. As a result, the
per-capita annual income of their families increased by 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
An assessment of 18 areas involved in the project shows that
the production-based projects to aid poor mothers increased their
annual earnings by 400 to 3,000 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
Schools for mothers have been set up to offer training courses
on illiteracy eradication, practical techniques, medicare, and
family planning, in a bid to help them achieve self-improvement
and self-reliance.

<HEADLINE> More Gun Accidents In U.S. Holiday Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The risk of a child
accidentally shooting himself or herself at home increases during
holiday months, according to a new survey commissioned by the
Center To Prevent Handgun Violence.
</P>
<P>
The group's Chairwoman Sarah Brady said in the survey that the
number of unintentional firearms injuries involving children rises
when children are at home and unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
She said that most injuries occur in March "when children are
on spring break, the summer months of July and August, and of
course, December."
</P>
<P>
Brady said that 16 children have died so far in December from
gunshot wounds. For every fatal shooting, there are 13 non-fatal
incidents, she said.
</P>
<P>
Brady said too many families "buy into the 'great lie' of the
National Rifle Association (NRA)." The NRA says that guns prevent
more tragedies than they cause.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a study by the New England Journal of Medicine, Brady
said, "Guns in the home are 43 times more likely to kill someone
you know than to shoot someone in self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Brady called on parents to unload guns, purchase child safety
locks, and store weapons and ammunition separately.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Unemployment Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' unemployment
rate rose to 7.9 percent in October, compared with 7.4 percent in
the same month last year, a latest report from the National
Statistics Office said.
</P>
<P>
As of October, the government estimated that 2.4 million
Filipinos were jobless, 200,000 or 8.3 percent more than the
estimated unemployed of 2.2 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The under-employment rate increased by 1.4 percentage points to
20.8 percent in October. The number of underemployed increased
from 5.3 million in October last year to 5.8 million in the same
month this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The estimated labor force grew to 30.3 million from 29.6
million a year earlier, it added.
</P>
<P>
Some 628,000 Filipinos got new jobs but the big increase in
out-of-work individuals pulled down the employment rate from 65.8
percent to 65.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
This means that not enough jobs are being created to absorb all
the new graduates or of-age workers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total employment in October this year increased by 1.6 percent
to 27.9 million from 27.4 million the same period last year.
However, employment rate declined to 92.1 percent in October from
92.6 percent the same month last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President-Elect
Kim Dae-jung said that his top priority is to revitalize the
country's ailing economy as well as the development of democracy.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current financial crisis stemmed from placing too
much on democracy rather than economy, Kim told a crowd gathered
around his home at Kyonggi Province at 8 a.m. Friday in his first
public appearance after winning the presidential election earlier
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no country in history that succeeded without placing
value on its economy. I will put as much as priority on the economy as
on democracy," said Kim, who is the first opposition leader to become
the nation's president since the country founded in 1948,
</P>
<P>
After serious financial crisis caused by collapse of a group of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions, South Korea
has signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for
57 billion U.S. dollar to bail its troubled economy out of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kim urged his people to prepare for sharing the burden and pains in
reviving the country's ailing economy, the 11th largest one in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 72, won the 15th presidential election with a 40.3 percent of
the vote, defeating Lee Hoi-chang of the Grand National Party with a
38.8 percent.

ROME, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy will make huge investments
to implement a national plan on the treatment of sewage to deal
with waste water and help clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the government information released on Thursday,
Italy needs to invest 13 trillion Lire (about 7.5 billion
U.S. dollars) to complete the plan. The soon-to-start Number 1092
project on the disposal of polluted water will cost 10 trillion
Lire (about 5.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
These projects should provide about 100,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Italian Minister of Environment Edo Ronchi said only 70 percent
of polluted water in the country is being treated, and only a few
sewage treatment plants have adopted advanced technology, which
means the amount of waste water that is polluted is unbearable and
an immediate solution is necessary.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Needs More Top-class Tourist Hotels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- "We badly want top-class
luxury hotels," today's China Daily quoted Ruan Guodong, director
of Wuhan Tourism Bureau, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Central China's largest city with a history of 3,500 years,
Wuhan boasts 270 sites of historical interests. In the first ten
months of this year, 240,000 overseas tourists visited Wuhan, also
the capital of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
"As increasing number of foreign business tycoons or government
VIPs have come to visit Wuhan, we are very embarrassed that
sometimes we failed to offer satisfactory accommodations," Ruan
said.
</P>
<P>
That is way both the provincial and municipal governments have
rendered strong support to the building of Wuhan's first five-star
hotel -- the Oriental Hotel, another tourism official said.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Hotel was built with an investment of more than
400 million yuan (48.19 million US dollars) -- 63 percent from
Hongkong Lien Yik Far East Ltd.It is Hubei's largest and most
luxurious hotel.
</P>
<P>
Near the Hankou Railway Station and Wuhan Airport, the
European-style Oriental has 360 rooms, 20 suites, a presidential
suite, and many restaurants, offices and conference halls.

<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung Elected South Korea's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, the candidate from
the opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) party,
was elected South Korea's new president early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kim defeated his major rivals, Lee Hoi-chang of the Grand
National Party and Rhee In-je of the New Party by the People, by
winning 40.3 percent of the vote. Lee received 38.8 percent of the
vote while Rhee won 19.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who is the first opposition party leader to reside in the
presidential palace of Chongwadae, marks a significant change in
politics in South Korea. The Grand National Party has governed
since the country was founded in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Kim, whose victory came after his fourth bid for presidency at
the age of 72, will be sworn in next February.
</P>
<P>
His success came from the overwhelming support he received in
the Cholla region, his hometown, and from receiving more than 50
percent of the vote in the heavily populated city of Seoul and
surrounding areas. He did not do well in the Kyongsang zone, a
traditional stronghold of the ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also attributed Kim's victory to his political
experience and the people's desire for a change in leadership due
to the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kim strengthened his position by becoming a joint
opposition candidate by allying with Kim Jong-pil, leader of the
minor United Liberal Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
Kim is faced with various challenges, especially since the
nation has become entangled in an unprecedented financial crisis
caused by the collapse of a group of conglomerates, bad loans and
mismanagement of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He promised in the presidential campaign to restore the
international credibility of his country, the 11th largest economy
in the world, and pledged to double South Korea's per capita
income to 20,000 U.S. dollars a year within his five-year term.
</P>
<P>
It will, however, take time for South Koreans to see whether
Kim's government can set up a new and healthy financial system and
revitalize the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coalition government of Kim's NCNP and Kim
Jong-pil's ULD, established under the bipartisan agreement, is
anticipating some problems in policy making and administration
from inside and outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the two political parties' difference in political
thinking, their seats in the National Assembly (parliament), which
amount to less than 50 percent, may also lead to political
instability.
</P>
<P>
The two Kims have agreed to work for change in the nation's
constitution by 1999 to create a parliamentary cabinet system in
which a president with less power could be indirectly elected by
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell, however, whether the two Kims' alliance,
which Kim Dae-jung described as "the start of changes in South
Korea's political power," will succeed.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Suspends Assistance to Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland on Thursday
announced the suspension of its cooperation programs with
Nicaragua till the recent diplomatic conflict between the two
countries is solved.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland will not start new programs and activities of
cooperation in Nicaragua as long as this problem is not
satisfactorily resolved," said the Swiss Federal Department of
Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The crisis started early this month when the Nicaraguan
president ordered Peter Spycher, general coordinator of the Swiss
Agency for Development and Cooperation (COSUDE), to leave the
country on January 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Aleman decided to expel Spycher after the Swiss diplomat
protested at a diplomatic reception the dismissal of the
Nicaraguan director of a bilateral project without consulting the
Swiss counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan president described Spycher's action as
"tactless", "preposterous" and "insolent".
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government had tried to end the conflict on
Tuesday when it allowed Spycher to remain in Nicaragua until
April, as requested by the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Foreign Affairs Department "hailed" the postponement,
but warned that the change of personnel in the cooperative project
financed by the Swiss government is still pending.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government said in a communique that the problems
underlying the friction have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation programs between the two countries are worth 63
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The incident could affect a meeting of the Group of Cooperators
with Nicaragua, scheduled for February in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government expects new cooperation projects
worth 800 million dollars for the next two years to be approved at
the meeting.

Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also sign agreements on cooperation between
the National Bank of Foreign Trade of Mexico and the Exports and
Investments Center of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo will visit the Nicaraguan National Assembly, the
Managua Mayor Office and meet local authorities and businessmen.

STOCKHOLM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Carl-Axel Hageskog, captain
of Sweden's Davis Cup team that overwhelmed the United States 5-0
in this year's final, was named sports leader of the year in
Sweden on Thursday, according to reports from Vaxjo, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Sports editors of major newspapers, radio and TV participated

One of Hageskog's first coaching jobs was at Vaxjo Tennis club,

</P>
<P>
Hageskog, 43, has coached Magnus Larsson, who played singles
when Sweden took its sixth Davis Cup title last month in Goteborg,
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hageskog is the second official from the city of Vaxjo in
southern Sweden to receive the award since this decade. Soccer
coach Tommy Svensson, who led Sweden to the semi-finals in the
1992 European Championships and third place in the 1994 World Cup
finals in the United States, was named sports leader of the year

<P>
CHENGDU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
most urbanites in the most populous province prefer giving birth
to one child.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the birth rate for the urban population has
dropped to below 1.2 per thousand, and some of the cities in the
province have reached zero growth.
</P>
<P>
Low birth, low mortality and low growth characterize the
population situation in the province's urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The birth-rate decline means the young will account for a
smaller proportion of the population, accelerating the process of
an aging society.
</P>
<P>
People aged 65 and over will account for seven percent of the
total Chinese population at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of Chinese provinces and municipalities --

<P>
XIAMEN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Great changes have taken place
in Jimei, an academic but comparatively underdeveloped district of
Xiamen City in east China's Fujian Province since a Taiwan
investment zone was set up upon approval in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that gross domestic product (GDP) of the
district will amount to 1.13 billion yuan (136 million US dollars)
this year, comparing to 190 million yuan of GDP for 1992 and will
be placed higher up among seven districts of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The district will also generate 2.29 billion yuan (276 million
US dollars) of industrial and agricultural output value and chalk
up one billion yuan in retail sales of commodities this year, both
showing tremendous increases over 1992 standards.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the district is now home to 248
overseas-backed businesses, involving a total investment of 670
million U.S. dollars. Businesses financed by investors from Taiwan
make up 150, involving a total of 310 million U.S. dollars in
investment.
</P>
<P>
In the first eleven months of this year, overseas-backed
businesses generated 93.4 percent of the district's total
industrial output value and provided 80.2 percent of the
district's total industrial commodities for export.
</P>
<P>
As most of the overseas-financed enterprises have been doing
well in the district, many of them are planning to increase
investment and expand production scale. Jimei District has now
been blessed with an industry pattern featuring productive
industrial projects, agricultural development, real estate,
tourism and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Jimei District has increased its
urban area from previously two sq km to the present nine sq km,
coupled with great improvement in basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have also benefited greatly from export-oriented
enterprises in the district. It is expected that per-capita income
of farmers will reach 4,800 yuan (580 US dollars) this year, said
the sources.

<HEADLINE> Large Oilfield Found in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A large oilfield has been found
on the northern bank of Aydingkol Lake in the Turpan Basin,
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Xinjiang Turpan-Hami Basins
Oil Prospecting and Exploration Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The new oilfield, situated in Lukqun, north of Aydingkol Lake,
has oil reserves estimated at 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Aydingkol Lake, with a water surface of 152 sq km, has the
lowest water level of all lakes in China and is the world's
second low-lying land after the Dead Sea. It is visited by tens
of thousands of Chinese and overseas tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
From the spring of 1995 to the winter of this year, the
headquarters drilled four test wells in Lukqun and obtained oil
flows with a daily output of more than 20 tons. Workers also found
 70-meter-thick oil-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Wu Tao, a geologist and deputy head of the headquarters, said
the oil-bearing area in Lukqun exceeds 200 sq km.
</P>
<P>
It is the second oilfield with oil reserves exceeding 100
million tons ever found in the Turpan Basin after the first one
was discovered in hilly land of the basin seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the oilfield at Lukqun shows that areas along
Aydingkol Lake are an important region rich in oil resources and
have good prospects for oil prospecting and exploration, said Wu,
adding development and construction of the new oilfield would add
a new scenic spot to Aydingkol Lake.
</P>
<P>
Since large-scale oil and gas exploration in Turpan Basin
started in 1991, some 20,000 oil workers have found seven
oil-bearing structures, as well as 14 oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
The basin is expected to pump three million tons of oil this
year. The oilfield at Lukqun will increase Turpan's annual oil
production capacity by one million tons after its development
begins.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The county of Boluo in south
China's Guangdong Province has led the province's 121 counties in
the use of overseas investment in local agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The county's 146 agricultural projects have so far introduced
136 million U.S. dollars of overseas spending since 1989,
accounting for 21 percent of the local overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Local overseas-funded agricultural projects mainly cover the
areas of plantation, aquaculture, processing of farm products,
animal husbandry and forestry. And the vast majority of the
overseas funds in the sectors come from Taiwan, as well as Japan
and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s the local agricultural output rose by 11
percent annually, and per capita peasant's income increased by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The county has built high-yield and high-efficiency bases to
produce grain, fruits, vegetables, aquatic products and
livestock.

<HEADLINE> Profile: South Korea's President-Elect Kim Dae-jung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, 73, a veteran
opposition leader, has spent 26 years to win South Korea's
presidency at his fourth bid.
</P>
<P>
Kim, the first opposition party candidate to be sworn in
as the master of the presidential palace of Chongwadae, marks a
significant change in politics in South Korea the ruling camp has
ruled since the nation was founded in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Kim's success came from his own rich political experience and
the people's aspiration for a change due to the current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Born in Mokpo in the country's South Cholla Province in 1925,
Kim, during his more than 40-year political career, has been
elected lawmaker six times and has separately entered 10
opposition parties of different names.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who once spent six years in prison and 10 years under
house arrest or in exile, made his name opposing human rights
abuses and political repression under South Korea's military
presidents.
</P>
<P>
As a single opposition candidate in 1971, Kim ran for the
presidency for the first time, challenging then President Park
Chung-hee.
</P>
<P>
He won an astonishing 45 percent of the vote, despite strenuous
efforts by the propaganda machine of Park Chung-hee's government
to deafen his voice. During the presidential race, his car was hit
by a truck in what he alleged was a botched assassination attempt,
which left him a permanent limp and chronic neuralgia.
</P>
<P>
Because of his political activities against Park Chung-hee, Kim
was kidnaped from his Tokyo hotel room by Park's government agents
in 1973 and dumped blinded outside his home in Seoul. The incident
became a focus of the world's media at the time.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Kim was sentenced to death as he was accused of
plotting to overthrow Chun Doo-hwan's administration, but later
his death sentence was commuted to 20 years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
"I narrowly escaped from moments of imminent death five times,"
he once said.
</P>
<P>
He quit the politics after losing his third presidential bid in
1992, but returned to the political area by establishing his No.1
opposition party -- National Congress for New Politics -- in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
After the ruling camp's popularity plunged due to economic
scandals and current financial crisis in the country, Kim formed
alliance with Kim Jong-pil's of United Liberal Democrats last
October, appealed for shift of power to the opposition in his
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Although Kim promised in the presidential campaign to recover
the international credibility of his country, which is the 11th
largest economy in the world, and pledged to double South Korea's
per capita income to 20,000 U.S. dollars within his five-year
term, he surely would face various unexpected challenges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his alliance based on seizure of power and its weak
strength in parliament means a rugged road before his five-year
government, which is to be established next February.

<HEADLINE> Winter Farming Hot in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Winter is no longer a slack
agricultural season in some regions of north China, as the
technique of greenhouse farming is accessible to more farmers.
</P>
<P>
Li Xilong, a farmer in Shouguang, a city in east China's
Shandong Province, has earned more than 20,000 yuan of extra
income this year from his 500-square-meter greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
Li cultivates eggplants, cucumbers and kidney beans in his
vegetable greenhouse. "Now, I don't have to exhaust myself by
getting up and going back in dark and I can easily adjust
vegetable varieties according to market demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developed by Wang Leyi, a Shouguang farmer in the late 1970s,
winter farming in greenhouses has undergone a long-term
improvement and become more practical for large-scale practice in
chilly winter.
</P>
<P>
Shouguang's farming built up its fame in 1990 with 5,130
greenhouses turning in over 60 million yuan (7.2 million
U.S. dollars) in the year. Since then, Wang and his 1,200-member
team have been committed to sharing his techniques with 400,000
farmers in 15 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The Zhangye Prefecture in Gansu Province, landlocked in
northwest China where fresh vegetables are rare on the winter
market, has an annual capacity of producing 390 million kilograms
of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In Hami Prefecture of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, where
winter farming has been enthusiasticly embraced, 6,000 greenhouses
have already been set up along with 1,000 local vegetable
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
During the spreading process, greenhouse techniques have been
extended to planting and breeding. A Gansu farmer has spent
450,000 million yuan setting up a greenhouse for planting fruits
and breeding livestocks, which is expected to generate four
million yuan (482,000 U.S. dollars) output value this year.
</P>
<P>
Shouguang, emerging as the country's largest vegetable
wholesale center, is capable of producing two billion kilograms of
vegetables all season, most of which are transported to markets
all over China as well as abroad. Winter farming accounts for 2.2
billion yuan (265 million U.S. dollars) in profits annually.

NANNING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Beihai fishing grounds,
home to artificially cultivated pearls, has increased the output
and variety of aquatic products because of protective measures
taken by the local government.
</P>
<P>
The fishing grounds in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has cultivated many kinds of aquatic products, including
prawns, oyster clams and some rare fish as well as pearls.
</P>
<P>
Last year, all fishing grounds in the city of Beihai received
400,000 tons of artificially cultivated aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The city, near the Beibu Gulf, is abundant in fishery
resources. However, the city's marine cultivation has suffered
heavy losses because of man-made damage in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Faced with damage to the fishing grounds, the local government
has tried to restrict the catch in coastal waters and to punish
illegal activities such as bombing and poisoning fish.

<HEADLINE> British Tabloids Urged to Respect Privacy by New Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's press watchdog
today published a new code of practice which bans persistent
pursuit by reporters or photographers.
</P>
<P>
The new code was drawn up after public outcry against media
intrusion following the death of Princess Diana, who died in a car
crash in Paris on August 31 while being followed by paparazzi
photographers on motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Britain's royalty- and scandal-obsessed tabloids
to respect new guidelines on privacy, harassment, intrusion into
grief, children and what may be published in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
The code, which newspapers observe on a self-regulatory basis,
also provides protection for the children of the famous by banning
newspapers from approaching or photographing pupils without the
permission of school authorities.
</P>
<P>
The new code of practice also bans the use of long lens
photography to take pictures of people in private without their
consent.

<HEADLINE> Search Operation Fails to Locate Missing Ukrainian Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Rescue teams in northern Greece
today continue their extensive search for the missing Ukrainian
plane with 73 people on board, but have failed to locate it so far.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-built Yakovlev 42, on route from Kiev to
Thessaloniki, disappeared at 9:13 p.m. local time Wednesday from
radar screens as it was preparing to land in northern Greece's
Macedonia airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane is believed to have crashed in an uninhabited area,
possibly in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 p.m. Wednesday, a massive search operation
was launched with Greek air force planes, navy ships, soldiers,
police and farmers, scanning the countryside and the northern
coastline in bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the rescue teams resumed their land, sea and air
search which is being coordinated by Greek Transport Minister
Tassos Mandelis and Macedonia-Thrace Minister Philippos
Petsalnikos.
</P>
<P>
Both Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister
Costas Simitis expressed their sorrows for the loss of the
Ukrainian plane and their sympathies to the relatives of the
missing passengers.
</P>
<P>
Among the 62 passengers, 20 are foreigners and 42 Greeks. Most
of the Greeks are businessmen or construction workers coming home
for Christmas and new year holidays.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached in Lawsuit by Homeless in Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Homeless residents could
get up to 1,500 dollars each if they can prove Miami police
violated their rights, under a settlement signed Thursday between
the city and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
</P>
<P>
Mayor Xavier Suarez approved the agreement, which could cost
the city as much as 1.5 million dollars. Suarez was in office in
the 1980s when the suit was filed -- a time when advocates said
the city treated the homeless likes pests.
</P>
<P>
If the deal is ratified by federal courts and a state-appointed
board overseeing Miami's finances, the checks could be handed out
by the Spring. Checks would go to those who could show they were
wrongfully arrested or had their civil rights violated since 1984,
The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The deal also requires police officers to undergo special
training on the circumstances and rights of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which covers 5,000 homeless people, calls for
Miami to pay at least 600,000 dollars to the homeless and an
additional 900,000 dollars in attorney fees to the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 lawsuit, the ACLU alleged that police violated
constitutional rights by arresting and harassing people who slept
and ate in public places. The city's practice amounted to what
critics called "pest control."
</P>
<P>
People sleeping in a downtown park in 1990 were awakened and
handcuffed while their personal belongings were set on fire,
according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
The deal would allow police to resume arresting homeless people
who block sidewalks, camp in parks, litter, loiter in public
restrooms or commit other infractions.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rebounds on Japan's Uncertainty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar recovered
against the Japanese yen and German mark today as traders began to
worry that Japan's plan to fix economy may fall short.
</P>
<P>
A report that the U.S. trade deficit shrank in October also
helped the dollar recoup some of its losses from Wednesday, when
it suffered the worst one-day loss against the yen in nearly seven
years. The plunge came after Japan's government announced a 15
billion U.S. dollar income tax cut and its central bank's plan to
pump dollars for the first time since August 1992.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 128.72 yen,
up from 127.08 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 1.7757 marks, up
from 1.7735, mainly following dollar-yen dealings as traders
concentrated on Japan and the rest of Asia's troubled currencies.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6653 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6521 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4379 Swiss francs, up from 1.4360; 5.9454 French
francs, up from 5.9380; 1,742.50 Italian lire, up from 1,741.25;

WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 2, 000 fugitives
have been arrested in the last 11 months for illegally receiving
food stamps, U.S. Government officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested in the food stamp investigation included people
wanted on charges of murder, kidnapping, child molestation, drug
violations, armed robbery and rape, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture ran the nationwide sting, called
"Operation Talon," in coordination with local law enforcement
agencies. Through the last 11 months, the department reported the
arrests of 2,199 fugitives and claimed millions in savings for
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The operation was made possible under last year's welfare
reform law that, for the first time, allowed local food stamp
offices to release to law enforcement officers the addresses of
fugitives wanted for felonies.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Enjoy Religious Freedom: Tibetologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans are enjoying total
religious freedom, contrary to Western accusations of "religious
destruction" and "monastery destruction" there, a group of visiting
Chinese tibetologists told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform and openness policy, the central government of
China has allocated more than 300 million yuan (over 36 million
U.S. dollars) in restoring and opening some 1700 monasteries in
Tibet, said Li Guoqing, research fellow of the China Tibetology
Center.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan buddhist monks are now numbering 460,000 in Tibet with
a population of 2.4 million and religious festivals are held
regularly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting the rumor that the Tibetan population is declining,
Dotar, another research fellow of the Center, said the fact is
that the ratio of 97:3 between Tibetans and other nationalities
including Hans has always been maintained.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's image has dramatically changed since the democratic
reform started in 1959, said Choejor, who is of the Tibetan origin
and has worked more than 30 years with media in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Economic output in Tibet has grown nearly 10 times in the last
four decades and 85 percent of the population have got rid of
poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
A transport net with Lhasa as the center and the international
communications facility have been built up.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy rose from 36 years in 1959 to 67 now as a
result of the improvement of living conditions.
</P>
<P>
The transformation should be attributed to the support of the
Central Government and various provinces, Choejor said, adding
that the state government has channeled more than 40 billion yuan
(close to 5 billion dollars) into Tibet's projects.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that Tibet is an inalienable part of the
territory of China, and that any separatist attempt will not end
in success.

100.91 points to 7,846.50 today as lingering Asian economic woes
and concern over company profits at the year end.

<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 2-to-1

The Nasdaq composite index dropped 24.21 points to 1,523.17,
and the American Stock Exchange composite index dipped 6.41 to

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Fights for Radical Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said today he would do his best to convince his Labor Party
of the need for a radical reform of Britain's welfare state.
</P>
<P>
"It is only when you can get the facts of this over that people
understand what you are trying to do. When you explain, people
support it," his chief press spokesman quoted Blair as saying at
the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 47 of Labor's 418 MPs voted against cuts in benefits
for lone parents. The welfare state costs the government 92
billion pound (152 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have warned of an even bigger revolt if the
government goes ahead with cuts to sickness and disability benefit
that are being considered by Social Services Secretary Harriet
Harman.
</P>
<P>
Ministers believe cuts may be needed if they are to concentrate
resources on getting welfare claimants into work, improving health
provision and cutting school class sizes.
</P>
<P>
Harman said today she had refused to rule out cuts in
disability benefits as part of the welfare review and the reform
was aimed at helping the disabled people into work.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Unlikely to Get U.S. Attack Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- United States is unlikely
to promise purchase of U.S.-made military attack helicopters to
Turkey when Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz meets President
Bill Clinton on Friday, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters any administration approval for the
purchase would depend on Turkish commitments and progress on
human rights.
</P>
<P>
"To some degree it depends upon representations that they
might make in the human rights area," he said, adding that
conversations on the issue "are still going on."
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz comes to Washington after The European Union rejected
membership talks with Turkey last weekend. He said he will
freeze political contacts with the European Union and seek a
"strategic partnership" with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told a news conference on Tuesday that Turkey is a
critically important U.S. ally and said it is "very important
that we do everything possible to anchor Turkey to the West."
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed his continuing concern over Turkey's
handling of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Middle East Peace Process Opens in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A four-day conference began
here today with the participation of Palestinian and Israeli
delegations to examine the course of the Middle East peace process
and seek ways of speeding up the process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the second of its kind, will be held behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, a two-day conference on the Middle East peace
process took place in Athens, focusing on issues such as the final
status of the Palestinian territories, peace procedures, the Oslo
agreements and the future prospects of the region.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting are members of the Palestinian authority
and of the Legislative Council, two Vice Presidents of the Israeli
Knesset and deputies from both the Israeli coalition and
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the opening ceremony, Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that Greece wanted to offer
organizational support through these meetings in a more informal
climate which offers the opportunity to both sides to exchange
ideas and opinions on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Greece would like to help train the Palestinian police officers
in anti-terrorist services, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Legislative Council member Marwan
Barghouti stressed that the priority should be given to the
political problem and the implementation of agreements already
signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Meir Shitrit, vice president of the Israeli
Knesset, said that peace in the region was the only possible path
for both peoples.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of Palestine and Israel were the only ones who
could provide a solution to the problem, he said, adding that this
solution could take the form of a new agreement once the greatest
possible consensus had been secured from all the political
parties.

<HEADLINE> US Considers Easing Trade Restrictions on Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States is moving
to further improve economic relations with Vietnam by seeking to
remove the country from a key restriction imposed under the
so-called Jackson-Vanik Amendment, White House National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are consulting with Congress about the possibility of
making a Jackson-Vanik waiver," Berger told reporters. "If those
consultations go well, I would expect that we would go forward."
</P>
<P>
The Jackson-Vanik Amendment was enacted in 1974 in a bid to
force the former Soviet Union to permit Jewish emigration, but its
requirements for market economies and free emigration affected
other countries including Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A waiver of the restrictions imposed by the Jackson-Vanik
Amendment would make U.S. exporters to Vietnam eligible for
financial backing through the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation and other programs.
</P>
<P>
It also could clear the way for Vietnam to receive
"most-favored nation" status. Without MFN, products exported to
the United States by Vietnam incur duties of 40 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the decision to actively consider a Jackson-Vanik
waiver was tied to Vietnam's revision of a program for a return of
refugees who fled the country after the Vietnam War in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the revised plan was "a sound one." He also said
Vietnam had shown "very, very strong" cooperation in accounting
for U.S. soldiers missing since the Vietnam War, another criteria
for granting the waiver.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: EU Goes on Ambitious Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
embarked on its most ambitious but also the most difficult
expedition with agreements on its eastward expansion and the
single currency plan at its year-end summit held in Luxembourg on
December 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed at the summit to launch the its enlargement
process on a formal and wider scale and decided to kick-start the
long-planned single currency program.
</P>
<P>
EU entry talks will be started early next year with Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The five-plus-one configuration, which was recommended in July
by the EU's executive body, the European Commission, was
considered advanced in required political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The EU also promised to start negotiations with the other five
candidate countries -- Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania and
Slovakia, though at a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
Turkey proved a headache for the EU leaders at the summit.
Frustrated with the EU's reluctance to recognize its candidate
status, Ankara snubbed an invitation to attend a summit dinner
with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
However, most EU leaders still want to keep Turkey facing
eastwards with the promise of a place in the EU in the future,
saying that it was politically difficult to exclude Turkey from a
big "European family".
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the EU has to be faced with the dilemma for a long
time because it seems impossible for Turkey to meet the EU's
criteria for membership within a short period of time, such as
improving its human rights record and resolving the long-standing
feud with EU member Greece.
</P>
<P>
Another compromise deal at the summit ended a potentially
damaging rift over the French-proposed "Euro-x" -- a term coined
for the inner circle of countries planning to join economic and
monetary union (EMU) due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece, the four countries who ruled
out the possibility of joining the EMU at its launch time,
insisted on having a seat at the euro council to avoid being cut
out of key European economic and monetary policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise deal, regular EU finance ministers
(Ecofin) meetings will be kept as the main decision-making body
but EMU countries are allowed to meet informally on specific
single currency issues.
</P>
<P>
Most EU leaders said the summit was a success. Jean-Claude
Juncker, Luxembourg prime minister who hosted the summit, even
used words like "historical" and "monumental" to describe the
summit.
</P>
<P>
However, they should realize at the same time what a price they
have to pay for their ambitions -- the biggest single enlargement
in the EU's 40-year history and a rarely seen single currency plan
in world history.
</P>
<P>
The EU members, especially the less rich ones, expressed their
worry over the financial implications of the eastward enlargement,
which will include mainly central and eastern European countries
which are economically feeble.
</P>
<P>
Germany and most other north European members of the EU, want
to help candidate countries reach membership sooner rather than
later. Meanwhile, they say that they do not want to suffer
excessive financial burden because of enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the EU presidency country for the first half of 1998,
wants the EU spending ceiling to be fixed at current own resources
maximum of 1.27 percent of EU GNP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany and the Netherlands, both facing elections
in 1998, wanted as little said as possible about this issue,
saying that they wanted the summit to be nothing more than an
"enlargement summit".
</P>
<P>
France is particularly concerned with implications of the
enlargement for the Common Agricultural Policy, which eats up more
than half of the EU budget, and for structural funds which benefit
the poorer regions of the existing EU.
</P>
<P>
With the enlargement process launched, EU members, especially
the poor ones, will have to face and worry about the prospects of
redistributing the EU wealth together with the poorer future
members.
</P>
<P>
It seems that member states have to shoulder the cost burden
for the enlargement and the single currency, but the question for
now is whether it will be cost-effective or not.
</P>
<P>
Together with the enlargement process, which is likely to
increase the number of EU members from 15 to 26 in a decade's
time, the EU has to grapple with the heady issue of reform of its
own institutions, which are already clumsy and financially
burdensome.
</P>
<P>
France, Belgium and Italy maintain that they see institutional
reforms as a pre-condition for widening EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg would like the EU to set ambitious targets at its
next summit for achieving internal EU reforms. But the next
rotating EU presidency country Britain seems only intent on
"successfully launching the single currency" though it will not be
part of first wave of EMU countries.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the summit, Europe's geography and
history have been finally reunited, as Mr. Juncker said. But he
failed to see the complete picture with different members and
potential members still having differing views on many issues.
</P>
<P>
The expedition has started. The EU has spent the past 40 years
on designing ambitions and seeking agreement on them. Now it's
time to stand up to the test of fulfilling them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Arrives in Lebanon, Starts Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen arrived here tonight on a two-day
official visit at the start of his multi-nation Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Qian, the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Lebanon
since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two
countries in 1971, was greeted by his Lebanese counterpart Farez
Boueiz at the Beirut International Airport.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Qian will hold talks on bilateral relations
and developments in the Middle East peace process with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, House Speaker
Nabih Berri and Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian stressed
Lebanon is an important party in the Middle East peace process.
"There will not be a complete, just and lasting peace in the
Middle East if without the participation of Lebanon and a
settlement of the Lebanon issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, China, a permanent member of the U.N.
Security Council, has been supporting Arab struggle for
sovereignty and territorial integration, including the
implementation of U.N. Resolution 425 which demands Israeli
unconditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the visit of Lebanon, Qian will go to Syria, Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule area and Egypt for talks with these
countries' leaders on bilateral relations, regional situation, and
issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> US Reaffirms Unimpeded Inspections in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged the United Nations to reaffirm its aim that weapons
inspectors in Iraq be given full access to sites they deem
essential.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler told the U.N.
Security Council today that he did not receive "full satisfaction"
from Iraq on unimpeded inspections to presidential sites during
his four-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N. Security Council gathered to determine how it will
handle the standoff, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said the United States wants the council to clearly state the
necessity for the access to those sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
"I think the next step here is to seek a very clear statement
from the Security Council that access means access," he told
reporters. "We will take it from there one step at a time in a
steady way."
</P>
<P>
"Our belief is that for the U.N. inspection teams to do its job
it must have access to all locations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger said refusal only ensures that Iraq will not be able to
get out from under the sanctions and he hoped sanctions against
Iraq will be extended indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
He also restated remarks by President Bill Clinton that "we
have ruled out no other options" for responding to Iraq.
