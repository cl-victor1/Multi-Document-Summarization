<HEADLINE> British NFU Leader Urges Farmers to End Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the British National
Farmers Union (NFU) today appealed to British farmers to put an
end to their blockade across the country in protest against cheap
beef imports.
</P>
<P>
NFU President David Naish made the appeal early today when the
farmers' protests are quickly spreading across the whole country
and thousands of farmers were set to turn up at ports like
Stranraer, Dover, Liverpool and Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
Naish was quoted by the BBC television as saying, "I am asking
them (farmers) not to block the roads. The dispute is with the
government, not with the public and not with the shops and not
with anybody else."
</P>
<P>
The farmers' leader also made it clear that it was important
that people should not be inconvenienced and otherwise they might
lose sympathy.
</P>
<P>
"I very much hope therefore that the farmers don't
inconvenience the public -- we need the general public on our
side," he added.
</P>
<P>
British farmers were further angered Wednesday when British
Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham proposed a ban on beef sold
on the bone to prevent a possible risk of infecting with the mad
cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Li Holds Talks With Senior CPV Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved great
achievement in recent 20 years mainly because it has correctly
understood and scientifically stuck to Maxism under the new
historical conditions, and has taken Maxism as the theoretical
basis of guiding principles, a senior Chinese official said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks during his talks
with Le Kha Phieu, member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist of Vietnam (CPV).
</P>
<P>
While briefing on the recently-closed 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), Li, who is also member of the
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee, said that a party
must have a flag, without which the party will lose its bearings.
</P>
<P>
Just as Vietnam has Maxism, Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought,
China has Maxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and the Theory of
Deng Xiaoping, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has experience and lessons on how to deal with the
Maxism, Li noted, adding that after the founding of new China in
1949, great changes have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
However, in the 20 years after 1956 when the socialism
transformation was basically completed, China has scored great
achievements, and also made serious mistakes, especially launched
the 10-year Cultural Revolution which deviated from the Maxism,
and led to disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
After the Cultural Revolution, China began to bring order out
of chaos by returning back to the track of Maxism, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China established once again the thought of
seeking truth from facts, making clear that China is still in and
will continue to stay in the primary stage of the socialism for a
long time by adhering to materialism and criticizing idealism.
</P>
<P>
China has stuck to the view of development, opposed
conservative ideas and absorbed and learned from all beneficial
civilization fruits of the mankind, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country has also adhered to the view of
practice by taking practice as the standard of testing theory and
policy and answering and resolving problems with practice.
</P>
<P>
China has also stuck to the view of productive forces by
defining the development of productive forces as the fundamental
task of the socialism, and taking economic development as the core
of the work of the party as well as the country, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li continued, China has regarded the constant
improvement of people's living standard as the fundamental aim of
the reform and opening-up, and offered opportunities for people to
give full play of their talent in order to push forward the cause
with the initiative of the people.
</P>
<P>
The success of China's reform and open-up has proved that the
Maxism is not out of date, and its many basic views, especially
the materialism and historical materialism are still of
significance, he said, adding that the key is that the Maxism
should be treated in a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
Sticking to Maxism means adherence to the basic principles of
the theory rather than holding stubbornly some out-of-date words
and conclusions, or even being perplexed by some wrong views under
the name of the Maxism, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He added that adhering to the Maxism should combine theory and
reality because only in this way can the vitality of Marxism be
kept.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theory is a combination of the basic principles
of Maxism and China's reality, and it is the Maxism of the
contemporary China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of CPC has defined Deng Xiaoping's
theory as the guideline of the CPC, which has been put into the
party constitution, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The theory is the basic guarantee for overcoming the
difficulties and furthering the socialist cause with Chinese
characteristics, he added.
</P>
<P>
Phieu agreed with Li, saying that both China and Vietnam's
practice has proved that the success of the socialism lies in the
combination of the basic principles of Maxism with the reality of
the countries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction with the friendly
cooperative ties between the two countries and between the
Fatherland Front of Vietnam and CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
He noted that CPV and the Vietnamese people will never forget
the support of CPC and the Chinese people. The great achievements
in China's reform and open-up have encouraged Vietnam, he added.
</P>
<P>
As close neighbors, the two countries should strengthen
cooperation and exchange experience in economic development and
party organization.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that the historical problems between
the two countries would be properly resolved through friendly
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here earlier in the day for a four-day goodwill
visit to Vietnam.

<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Zimbabwe
National Army have been urged to take advantage of the peace
prevailing in the region and pursue non military professional
courses to enhance their lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Higher Education Sikhanyiso Ndlovu today
told a function named "Band Sunday" for the army in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city that military courses would help
them to start and improve their own income generating projects
when they leave the army.
</P>
<P>
"Educating the military establishment is a force freeing the
individual and the nation from the bondage of ignorance, poverty,
insecurity and incapability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "you must therefore be prepared educationally in
matters pertaining to the needs of society, the national and the
international community in order for you to make better
decisions."
</P>
<P>
Band Sunday is an occasion during which the army interacts
with suppliers of its goods and services from various sectors of
the economy.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hopeful of Kyoto Deal Despite Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott today expressed Britain's optimism about striking a
deal on reducing gas emissions despite serious differences among
various participants at the UN climate talks in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Prescott was quoted by the BBC television as saying in Kyoto
today that the climate conference was split over concrete
reductions of the greenouse gas emissions, but he still thought
"there is political will for an agreement now."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get an agreement, then quite frankly it will be
quite catastrophic," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister sounded an optimistic tune by saying,
"I think no one wants to be blamed for the breakdown of this
conference because public opinion is such that they want to see an
agreement on the environment."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States, the world's biggest
polluter, wants to stabilize gas emissions at 1990 levels between
2008 and 2012, while the European Union demands a 15 percent cut
on 1990 levels by 2012.

<HEADLINE> Russian Party Leader Voices Support for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Russian Liberal
Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky today voiced
support for the Iraqi people in their fight against
U.S. aggression.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Zhirinovsky also called on "all
good powers in the world to stand against the U.S. aggression
(against Iraq)."
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened to oust U.S. members of the U.N. weapons
inspection team last month, saying they were spying under the
cover of the U.N. mission to eliminate the country's mass
destructive weapons. Washington responded by preparing military
attack before the crisis was defused by Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraqi 1990 invasion
of Kuwait will only be lifted when weapons inspectors prove that
Iraq is clear of mass destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky said that he is carrying a letter to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein from Russian President Boris Yeltsin
tackling bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Saturday evening, leading a delegation
comprising a number of parliamentary and trade figures.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Iraq, Zhirinovsky will hold talks with
Iraqi officials to discuss means of enhancing cooperation between
Iraq and Russia in all domains.

<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Republic police
today has threatened to crush next Tuesday's Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions (ZCTU) national mass demonstrations to protest
against the proposed five percent war veterans levy.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said the force would
without hesitation thwart any unlawful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point anymore to go ahead with the demonstration.
We do not want a demonstration just for the sake of a
demonstration. The people's objective has been achieved and that
decision has been reserved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want people to capitalize on other matters which
have nothing to do with the taxes. The end result of such
disorder will be chaos and we cannot tolerate that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the possibilities of the planned demonstration
turning violent were very high and the police would not take
chances.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to those who have been mobilized that they
should forget about this demonstration. The police will not
tolerate any gatherings by people bent on bringing disorder and
causing chaos," said Chihuri.

<HEADLINE> US Changes Strategy on Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- US President Bill Clinton
has issued new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, ordering
the Pentagon to shift the focus from planning a prolonged nuclear
fight with a superpower to deterring chemical or biological attacks
from maller powers.
</P>
<P>
The president's new orders were issued last month to the
secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
The Washington Post reported today citing senior administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines replace those that were put in place in 1981
under President Reagan at the height of the cold war as Clinton
realized that much of the old policy was outdated.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines, signed by Clinton just before Thanksgiving,
recognize the world's fundamental shift in power and the rapidly
changing threats to the United States since the collapse of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines ordered the Pentagon to revise its strategy to
win an all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Instead, the
Pentagon must be prepared to use the United States' still
formidable nuclear weapons to respond swiftly and decisively to
more limited attacks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's action marks the first formal adjustment in 16 years
of presidential policy for the targeting of US nuclear weapons and
could pave the way for further reductions in the total number of
such weapons, senior officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, the guidelines do not change the posture of
the United States' nuclear forces, which include air, land and
submarine-launched missiles and affirm that the United States will
continue to rely on nuclear arms as a cornerstone of its national
security for the indefinite future, said Robert G. Bell, a special
assistant to the president.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Coalition Govt Vows to Ensure Law and Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's present coalition
government is determined to ensure law and order in the country
and will launch a public security drive to free the country from
killings and terror, said a document titled "joint policy and
programs" issued today by the ruling partners.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government has decided to come up with a concrete
program within one month on the basis of a national consensus
among responsible political parties, said the 21-point document
issued by the National Democratic Party (RPP), the Nepali Congress
(NC) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party.
</P>
<P>
The police and the administration will be effectively mobilized
to end the violence by the ultra-leftist guerrillas under the name
of people's war, the document said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people including policemen, civilians, government
officials have been killed since February 1996 when the guerrillas
launched their movement in the mid-western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NC had accused the former coalition government of being
ineffective in dealing with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The three coalition partners said they would also resolve the
Bhutanese refugee problem with the cooperation of India.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in eastern
Nepal in eight UN-run camps after being forced to flee Bhutan in
1989 and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan have held seven rounds of ministerial-level
talks on the issue but reached no agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has asked India, who handles Bhutan's foreign and defense
affairs, to help resolve the problem, but India refused, saying it
is a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
The document said the coalition government will also
immediately launch a program for promoting economic activities by
taking the private sector into confidence.
</P>
<P>
The NC, which toppled the former coalition government in early
October with a no-confidence motion, joined the RPP-led coalition
government on December 3.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Fredrick
Chiluba said here today that "everything is now perfectly normal
in Zambia after the October 28 coup attempt and as you can see
our region is peaceful at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a two-hour meeting with Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, Chiluba said he discussed with President
Mugabe all matters affecting the region.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was in the country to brief Mugabe, in his capacity as
chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on politics,
defence and security, on the recent foiled coup attempt that was
staged by junior army officers in his country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said, "i live in the embarrassment that unlike most
African countries i have no-one to look up to as the founding
father of the Zambian nation, i'm embarrassed because i was
robbed of that pride."
</P>
<P>
"We hope and trust that some day my older brother (Kaunda)
will wake up and realise that his time in politics is up and
leave the country to grow peacefully and economically but i
haven't pinched him, not at all," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He also said, "Zambia will not reverse its current political
path, economic reform programmes and other essential policies
that are directly related to the democratic progress."
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia would not abandon the privatisation programme
despite an outcry by individuals against reforms.
</P>
<P>
On the reported Zambia-Angola strained relations over the
failed coup attempt, Chiluba said, "our relations have never been
strained, there have been rumours and speculations in the press,
i'm being honest with you, there are no problems between Zambia
and Angola."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba arrived in the country this morning for the one-day visit.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Settle Differences On Security Organ: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries will soon meet to discuss and settle
the differences over the organization's organ on politics,
defense and security.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, the current SADC chairman,
said here today after a meeting with Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, SADC member countries had agreed during their last
September summit in Blantyre, Malawi, that they should resolve
the issue amicably to ensure the issue would not bring any
hostilities between member countries.
</P>
<P>
The organ on politics, defense and security is an off shoot of
the now defunct frontline states which fought apartheid South
Africa which attained independence in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now current SADC Chairman, President Nelson Mandala has
demanded that the organ be answerable to the regional grouping
rather than remain a separate entity, which Zimbabwe and at least
three other countries have resisted.
</P>
<P>
"Differences in perceptions do arise but we must all guard
gainst them so that we do not allow them to split our
organization. We have to work them out and move together
positively," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"That is South Africa's view point that the organ must not
operate as a separate establishment altogether for the SADC
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The view for the organ to operate as a separate establishment
was accepted by the majority of the SADC countries and it was
upon the need to sign the protocol that South Africa's view point
was made in a manner which has now caused us to look at the organ
again," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe added that South Africa may not be alone in its view
point and the meeting, whose venue and date has still to be made
public, sought to settle the differences and perceptions
amicably.

<HEADLINE> Ousted S. Leone President Takes Money Printer to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Ousted Sierra Leone leader
Tejan Kabbah disclosed Friday that his deposed government has
taken the London-based currency printing firm of Thomas de la Rue
to court "to block disbursement of state funds" to the military
junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The firm of de la Rue has been the sole printer of all Sierra
Leone currency since independence in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said to the clandestine FM 98.1 radio that the junta in
Sierra Leone wanted to withdraw some money left in the de la
Rue's account of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I was advised by the British government that any action
against the company would only be effective if an injunction is
brought on the company in a British Court,' Kabbah declared.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Government Spokesman Allicu Kamara said in spite of
the Conakry Peace Agreement, ousted president Kabbah has
continued to wage a diplomatic war against the military
government.
</P>
<P>
He explained that following the signing of the agreement, the
government applied to the United States Federal Reserve Bank in
America for permission so that the Bank of Sierra Leone could
have access to money and property to do business for the
government abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, the American authorities contacted Kabbah for the
matter. After the consultation, the Reserve Bank sent a message
to the Sierra Leone government saying that the American
government only recognizes Kabbah as president of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"The telex message said that Kabbah had instructed that the
Bank of Sierra Leone should not be allowed to do any business
with the reserve Bank or be allowed to draw any money for Sierra
Leone," Kamara said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also instructed that any request for such facilities by
the government or the Bank of Sierra Leone should be ignored.
</P>
<P>
The United States government earlier denied it was directly
involved in the matter when the claim was first made last Monday
by the Secretary-general of the military government, Colonel
Abdul Sesay at a press briefing.

<P>
MAPUTO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Resistance of
Mozambique (Renamo), the major opposition party in the country,
is to join hands with four other smaller parties in the coming
election scheduled to be held on May 29 next year.
</P>
<P>
Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo Chairman, said in central Mozambique's
Beira City that his party would cooperate with four other parties
to win over several cities in the country's first-ever regional
autonomy election.
</P>
<P>
The four parties are the United Front of Mozambique (Fumo),
the National Convention Party (PCN), the National Movement of
Mozambique (MONAMO), the Trade Union Party (PT).
</P>
<P>

<P>
There are only three parties in Mozambique's parliament,
namely, the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front, the National
Resistance of Mozambique and the Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party would divide power with the ruling
party, admitting that his party is facing a financial difficulty.

CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Shootings broke out today near
the residence of Egyptian Interior Minister Habib Ibrahim el-Adli
here as police chased a car thief, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The security men stationed at el-Adli's home saw a man driving
on the wrong side of the road near the Agouza area, and tried to
stop him, said MENA.
</P>
<P>
But the man sped up his Mercedes, hitting and wounding a
policeman when he drove through a road block near the home of
el-Adli.
</P>
<P>
The police opened fire at the car and wounded the driver.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by Egyptian Interior Ministry,
the man, identified as Mohamad Zeinhom Ahmad, 23, was in

<HEADLINE> Arafat Slams Israeli Breach of Peace Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today accused Israel's unilateral
activities for blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has not delivered a single pledge of the signed
agreements," Arafat told reporters after a meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, during which he briefed Mubarak on the
outcome of his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in Geneva Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed U.S. efforts to salvage the stalled
peace process bogged down by Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Saturday night en route to Iranian capital
Tehran for the first time in more than a decade to attend the 8th
summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference due Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's judaization of Jerusalem, construction of settlements,
refusal to open the airport and seaport of Gaza and the safe
passage between the West Bank and Gaza Strip have stalled the
peace process, Arafat said before leaving here for Tehran via
Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor Osama el-Baz said that
Arafat expounds to Albright the Palestinian point of view and the
Palestinian demands to forge concrete progress in the situation.
</P>
<P>
Albright is pushing Israel to carry out troop withdrawal from
the West Bank and freeze Jewish settlements, said el-Baz, adding
that Albright will meet with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu later this month to step up efforts to break
the deadlock.

<HEADLINE> European Business to Face Massive Bill for Converting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- European businesses could face a
really massive bill for converting to the European single currency
named euro, according to a research report.
</P>
<P>
The survey, prepared by the KPMG Management Consulting, said
that larger European businesses would have to spend more than 30
billion pounds (about 50 billion US dollars) in converting to the
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Each major European company would spend an average of 19
million pounds (about 32 million dollars) in this process, said
the survey, which was carried in today's Sunday Times.
</P>
<P>
Vick Pryce, chief economist at KPMG, said, "If the predictions
in this research are accurate, EMU is going to represent a heavy
cost for European business and significant number of companies
will not be ready in time."
</P>
<P>
"We surveyed Europe's largest companies because they have been
the most committed supporters of monetary union. Companies of this
size to be underprepared for the euro could therefore pose
considerable problems in the post-EMU environment," Pryce said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also suggested that larger British companies are
well-advanced in their preparations in spite of the London
government's decision not to join the single currency, due to be
launched in 1999, over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
More than nine out of 10 British firms have carried out a
review of the likely effects of EMU in comparison with 74 percent
of German businesses and 66 percent of Italian firms, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Promising Unilateral Cuts in Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev has confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin's statement
made in Stockholm means that Russia is ready to cut down its
northwestern military grouping by 40 percent, the Interfax news
service reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TV program Vremya Saturday, Sergeyev
said that cuts are to be made in the Kaliningrad special defense
region, in the Leningrad military district and in the Baltic and
Northern fleets.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Yeltsin's proposal to reduce the number of
nuclear warheads, the minister said the proposal deals with
"further and more radical cuts in the strategic forces within the
limits of the negotiating process."
</P>
<P>
"There was no talk about any unilateral cuts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev indicated this initiative will be implemented if the
Russian Duma ratifies the START-2 treaty, "after which a
transitional period at the START-3 level will begin, with more
radical cuts."
</P>
<P>
Thus, he said, Russia and the United States approaching the
level of strategic armaments will have every right to invite other
members of the nuclear club -- Britain, France and China -- to
join the talks on further cuts with more rigorous control over the
nonproliferation of nuclear know-how.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin last Wednesday in Sweden pledged to
unilaterally slash Russia's military presence by more than 40
percent near the Baltics. His remark drew great attention from the
West and the Baltic states.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects CIA Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 7 (Xinhua)-- Iraq today rejected allegations
of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that Iraq can
produce weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles again
if without U.N. inspections and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted an Iraqi National
Monitoring Department spokesman as saying that CIA's claims
clearly reveal the ties between U.S. espionage and
U.S. interventions in the work of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman termed the CIA as the only source of the
"misleading statements the U.S. officials and UNSCOM executive
chairman have been making for a month."
</P>
<P>
"CIA is also based on one of its informed sources, UNSCOM,
through which the Americans are leading and steering its anti-Iraq
activities," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad announced to oust U.S. members of the U.N. inspection
teams last month in charge of espionage, triggering off a crisis
in which Washington threatened military action. Tensions have been
reduced after Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Major General Hossam Mohammed Amin, director general
of Iraq's National Surveillance Department (the Iraqi counterpart
of the UNSCOM) announced that the inspection teams today inspected
18 Iraqi sites of the industry, water supply and sewerage sectors
in addition to a site in a university.
</P>
<P>
The teams also visited a customs complex situated on the Iraqi-
Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Amin said that the Iraqi side cooperated completely with the
UNSCOM teams and provided for them the support required.
</P>
<P>
It is the 16th day for the UNSCOM teams to resume their duties
in Iraq since Iraq decided to allow U.S. members of the UNSCOM
arms inspection teams to take part in arms inspections.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Briefs Inner Cabinet on European Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today briefed the inner cabinet members on his
just-concluded talks with European leaders and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The inner cabinet meeting was convened Sunday afternoon shortly
after Netanyahu returned from Paris after his talks with Albright,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
During his two meetings with Albright in Paris, Netanyahu was
asked to make a "more credible" decision on the further
redeployment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Albright held a meeting with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in Geneva, Switzerland,
in a bid to narrow the gap between Israel and the PNA over the
further troop redeployments. To balance her pressure on Israel on
the redeployment issue, she demanded Arafat launch an all-out war
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, attended by Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, also discussed the planned
second phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It was the third session held by the four-member inner cabinet
which was formed to decide the extent of further redeployment and
the guidelines on the permanent talks with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has yet to overcome the different approaches among
the ministers on Israel's security needs, including the size of
the proposed security zones to be discussed in the final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to hold another round of talks separately with
Netanyahu and Arafat in Europe next week in further peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Friday it would take several weeks for his inner
cabinet to formulate the extent of further redeployment as well as
the guidelines on the permanent talks.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier: Too Early to Say Reasons of Aircrash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Russian government
Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived in Irkutsk early this morning for the
investigation work on the air crash which created serious damage
in the resident region, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters that work on overcoming
consequences of the tragedy proceeds promptly and in an organized
manner.
</P>
<P>
He said it is too early to speak about reasons for the tragedy.
"We should not draw hasty conclusions," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, a government decision will be signed
today to allocate funds and to render relief aid to the victims.
Funds will be channeled to build a new children's home and 72
flats for those who were deprived of housing. Some 50 billion
roubles (8.45 million US dollars) will be appropriated for these
purposes.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Russian Ministry for Emergencies in
Moscow was quoted as saying that bodies of 41 people were found at
the site of the air crash by 12:00 Moscow time. The fate of
supposedly 23 people remains unknown. Fifteen people, including
seven children, were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The military cargo plane, An-124 Ruslan, took off from the
factory airfield in Irkutsk at 09:45 Moscow time Saturday and
plummeted on a housing neighborhood several seconds after the
take-off from an altitude of 70 meters and burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The plane destroyed one 64-flat four-storeyed house, damaged
one 100-flat five-storeyed house, two 16-flat wooden houses, the
three-storeyed building of a school and the four-storeyed building
of a children's home.

TEHRAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The following is a chronology of
the summits of the Organization of the Islamic Conference:
</P>
<P>
-- The first Islamic summit was held in Rabat, capital of
Morocco, on September 22-25, 1969 with the participation of 25
heads of state, to recommend the establishment of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). In March 1970
Islamic foreign ministers met for the first time to translate the
proposal into reality. The OIC was formed in the following May in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia with the aim of promoting Islamic solidarity
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- The second Islamic summit was held in the Pakistani city of
Lahore on February 22-24, 1974 with the participation of heads of
states and representatives from 36 Muslim countries. The summit
decided to offer assistance to Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the
Palestinian people against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
-- The third Islamic summit was held in Mecca and Taif, Saudi
Arabia on January 25-29, 1981 with the participation of 38 Muslim
countries and decided that summit conference would be held every
three years in future. The summit reaffirmed earlier resolutions
on the liberation of all Arab and Palestinian territories under
Israeli occupation, and assignation of Jerusalem as the capital of
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
-- The fourth Islamic summit was held in Casablanca, Morocco on
January 16-19, 1984 with the participation of 42 Muslim
countries. It called for Israeli withdrawal from all Arab and
Palestinian territories it captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
-- The fifth Islamic summit was held in Kuwait on January 26-
29, 1987 with the participation of 44 Muslim countries. It
emphasized the Palestinian issue was the core of Arab-Israeli
conflict and there can be no just and lasting peace without a
complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
-- The sixth Islamic summit was held in Dakar, capital of
Senegal on December 9-11, 1991 with the participation of 45
Muslim countries. Iraq boycotted the summit, which condemned the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and voiced support for effort toward
a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- The seventh Islamic summit was held in Casablanca, Morocco
on December 13-15, 1994 with the participation of 54 Muslim
countries. It demanded the return of all Israeli-occupied Arab
lands and realization of a complete peace in the Middle East based
on U.N. resolutions. It condemned the Serbs' brutality against
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
-- The eighth Islamic summit is to be held on December 9-11 in
Tehran, Iran with an anticipated participation of 54 countries. It
is expected to endorse more than 140 resolutions in various fields
and discuss the formation of an Islamic common market.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Lagos With Tap Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- More people in Lagos, the
largest city and economic center of Nigeria, are expected to
enjoy tap water with the completion of a World Bank-assisted
water project this month.
</P>
<P>
The 173-million-U.S. Dollar project has helped lay 800 km of
water pipes with a capacity to serve 60 percent of the local
people, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today, quoting the
general manager of Lagos State Water Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Part of the project also covers the rehabilitation of the
corporation's largest Iju waterworks, which is expected to supply
45 million gallons of water per day.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued a week ago, the corporation, the sole water
supplier in the country, said the current water supply stands at
827 million liters a day, which can meet only 40 percent of
demand.
</P>
<P>
The demand for tap water is expected to rise to 1,509 million
cubic liters per day by the year 2010 with population projected
to be 12.4 million at that time, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the short supply to financial
constraints in the state government and calls for the
participation of private investors to meet and sustain the water
needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Lagos is one of the largest metropolises in Africa, which has
a population of about 10 million and covers an area of 3,577
square kilometers with 22 percent of lagoons and creeks.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Nationwide Strike Expected to Be Over Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Trade Union is
expected to sign a compromise agreement with Finance Ministry
this evening to end the five-day nationwide strike, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came late this afternoon when the National
Labor Court succeeded in brokering a compromise, which was
accepted by both the Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz and Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, Peretz said the understanding has nearly
resolved all of the sticking points related to the strike, which
was launched last Wednesday in protest against government plans
for wages reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Treasury has made significant compromises,
noting that if both sides sign an agreement on principles this
evening, he will announce an end to the strike.
</P>
<P>
Neeman said he has accepted the court's proposal and hoped for
an early end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the strike has caused irreversible damage to
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
As the strike by 700,000 public sector employees entered its
fifth day today, the situation in the country became almost
intolerable, especially in the airports, where hundreds of
passengers were stranded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturer Association estimated that the economic
losses caused by the strike is approaching 200 million shekels
(about 57 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle against
the government's economic reform plans, which have sparked fears
that worker's rights would be harmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Trade Union today
announced an end to the crippling five-day nationwide strike,
saying that the striking workers will return to their work
tonight, Israel Channel 1 Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came late this afternoon when the National
Labor Court succeeded in brokering a compromise, which was
accepted by both the Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz and Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Trade Union and the Treasury are
working out a memorandum of understanding to settle the dispute
over the wages reform.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was attended by 700,000 public sector
employees, was launched last Wednesday in protest against
government's plans for wages reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
It has paralyzed the country by effectively shutting down
airports, seaports, banks, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, government
offices and state-owned industries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Manufacturer Association estimated that the economic
losses caused by the strike are around 200 million shekels (about
57 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The strike was triggered by the remarks made by Neeman on
December 1 that striking workers were "exploding bombs" and
enemies from within. About 150,000 workers had been on a two-day
strike starting from November 30.
</P>
<P>
In response to the assault, Peretz declared the strike last
Tuesday night at an emergency gathering of thousands of union
members in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The strike is the latest round in a Trade Union battle against
the government's economic reform plans, which have sparked fears
that workers' rights would be harmed.

They also reaffirmed full respect for Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
But informed sources said that Iran was against a Syrian
recommendation to condemn Turkey's incursions into northern Iraq
for fear of implicating itself, thus angering Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is reportedly supporting a Kurdish faction in fighting
for control of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The reservations of OIC members toward a variety of resolutions
did not prevent the meeting from working out a draft agenda and
program for the summit.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that the summit be entitled "session of
dignity, dialog and participation."
</P>
<P>
It decided to grant observer status to the Republic of Cote
d'Ivoire of west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 49 foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers,
and representatives of 20-odd international organizations attended
the meeting, the 24th since the founding of the OIC in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Tomb of Ancient Egypt's King Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have found the
tomb of the wet nurse of ancient Egyptian King Tutankhamen and
said it is an extremely rare case in which a tomb was devoted to a
single woman thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, which dates back to 1330 B.C., has been unearthed in
the Sakkara area, 20 kilometers south of Cairo, by a French
archaeological mission, Middle East News Agency quoted Egyptian
Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni as saying.
</P>
<P>
This area was a mausoleum of the courtiers and high-ranking
officials of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt from 1400 B.C. to
1100 B.C..
</P>
<P>
One scene on the walls of the tomb featured the nurse, whom has
been identified as Maya, with the six-year-old king sitting in her
lap.
</P>
<P>
But archaeologists did not find any gold, funerary objects, or
Maya's coffin in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
The French team has cleared two of the five known chambers. A
third was filled with rubble, and two others were sealed off with
masonry.
</P>
<P>
The excavation was expected to finish in two years.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Maya's tomb coincided with the 75th
anniversary of that of Tutankhamen's, which was kept intact when
it was uncovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in the
Valley of Kings near Luxor, about 500 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Tutankhamen, who died at 19 in a suspected palace coup, was
believed to be the youngest pharaoh of ancient Egypt.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-party Democracy (MMD) will set an office in the capital
city of Lusaka Monday where the opposition parties interested in
dialogues with the ruling party can register.
</P>
<P>
MMD national secretary Micheal Sata said here today that the
preliminary meeting of the inter-party dialogues will start
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling party will not set any pre-conditions for
the inter-party talks.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks failed to kick off as planned in last
July after opposition parties renewed their calls for abolishing
the current constitution, establishing an interim government and
new elections.
</P>
<P>
But now the United National Independent Party (UNIP) has said
it is ready to attend the inter-party talks without setting out
pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
UNIP chairman Malimba Masheke told a news conference last
Thursday that his party is willing to attend the talks regardless
of who chairs the meeting but only as long as the contentious
national issues are included on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of dialogue is now becoming monotonous and
hoped the meeting of party secretary generals scheduled to take
place ahead of the inter-party talks would set out an agenda that
will address the issues causing the political impasse in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Operation Continues in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's cross-border military
operation in northern Iraq entered the third day today, dealing a
heavy blow on the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Two F-16 jets of the Turkish Air Force bombed the PKK
positions in Khwakurk near the Iranian border as the Turkish
ground troops continued their battle, the Anatolia News Agency
quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 PKK rebels were reportedly killed in Sunday fighting
with the government troops. No casualties of the government
soldiers were available.
</P>
<P>
The latest military operation started last Friday when around
20,000 Turkish government troops poured across the border to round
up some 1,000 PKK militants who gathered in Khwakurk for the past
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Ministry Saturday issued a statement condemning
Turkey's invasion of the Iraqi sovereignty and territorial
integrity, demanding an immediate pull-out of the Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly launched cross-border incursions to wipe
out the PKK camps in norther Iraq, leading to strong protests
from Iran and the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has lost its effective control over northern Iraq
since its defeat by the Western alliance in the 1991 Gulf War
following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for
autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Butelezi today said his
party wanted to be at peace with ruling African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford divisions and we must realize that in
the end, if our country is to succeed, we must stand together,
failing which we are doomed to fall together," Buthelezi said at
the launch of 31 new IFP branches.
</P>
<P>
IFP is the biggest black opposition party in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in Emhubheni near Estcourt in
Kwazulu-Natal Province, Buthelezi said IFP leaders had applauded
a speech three weeks ago at Inchanga by Defense Minister Joe
Modise.
</P>
<P>
Modise had appealed to the security forces to be partial when
dealing with political strife, or face tough action from
government.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi warned that if a spirit of tolerance was not
cultivated before next year, South Africans could expect many
problems in 1999. He said only if the IFP was in govenrment after
1999 could a unified leadership necessary for the promotion of
economic prosperity and stability be provided.

<HEADLINE> Financial Instability Continuing in South Korean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Although the first tranche of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s bailout package arrived in
Seoul last Saturday, instability in South Korea's financial sector
was continuing with local currency depreciating and interest rate
soaring.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean won, weakened all the daytime to close at
1,342.40 against one U.S. dollar, hit its daily drop limit of 10
percent the first time since South Korea and the IMF reached an
agreement to bailout its ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The basic exchange rate to be posted Tuesday will be 1,332.50
won against one U.S. dollar, a 112.10 won lower from Monday's.
</P>
<P>
Although the IMF sent its first installment of the rescue loan
amounting 5.2 billion dollars to Seoul over last weekend, many
investors felt that the loan would hardly satisfy the fund
shortage hitting the local financial and business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yield for guaranteed three-year corporate bonds
soared to a historic high of 22.95 percent, along with annual
yields on call loans reaching 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the wide-spreading fears that current fund shortage
in both company and financial sector is likely to worsen, the
composite stock price index on Monday plunged 20.9 points to close
at 414.83 points.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sets Up Committees on Financial Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
set up three committees to review regulation of the local stock
market, the corporate financing sector and rules over disclosure
of information by banks, the Prime Minister's Office announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Financial Sector Review Group, chaired by
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, has formed two committees
to study issues related to Singapore's capital markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Financial Sector Review Group has also set up
another committee to study commercial banking disclosure
standards.
</P>
<P>
The committees would aim to develop Singapore's role as a
financial center by providing scope for initiative and innovation
while keeping the integrity of the system, the Prime Minister's
Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The intention would be to shift the emphasis "from regulation
to supervision" and focus more on systemic risks than on
protecting individual participants, products or projects, it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) Review
would consider regulatory and structural options and recommend a
conceptual framework that will make Singapore's capital markets
more international, competitive and robust, and able to
participate fully in the dynamic global network of capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
"This includes liberalizing market access and commission rates
for transaction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also review the regulations, by-laws,
administrative notices and other prudential and regulatory
approaches of the SES, and recommend industry development
initiatives by the government, the SES, and member firms of the
SES.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Corporate Financing Issues will recommend an
appropriate framework of rules, regulations and administrative
guidelines governing corporate fund-raising that will support
steady and sustainable growth of corporations in Singapore, foster
innovation and entrepreneurship, and make Singapore an attractive
center for international corporate fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
It will also recommend ways to improve the efficiency of the
fund-raising process, as well as standards of corporate
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
The committee on banking disclosure standards will review and
evaluate banking disclosure standards and practices in the
developed and the Asia-Pacific countries, and to recommend changes
in disclosure standards and practices for Singapore banks, with a
view to attaining the standards of disclosure of the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said that the principles outlined
by the government for these committees also included providing
greater transparency in regulations, and relying more on market
discipline and full information disclosure to protect investors.

BELGRADE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Serbian voters will have to
cast their ballots for the second time to elect a new president
for the republic.
</P>
<P>
The run-up election, as called for by the procedure, is
announced Monday and scheduled for December 21.
</P>
<P>
Racing into the new round will be the top two of the three
candidates in Sunday's election, when none of them gained half of
the votes cast.
</P>
<P>
They are Serbian Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic, of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party,
and Vojislav Seselj, of the Radical Party.
</P>
<P>
In the first round, joined by some 51 percent of the 7.2
million eligible electorate, Milutinovic pocketed about 43 percent
of the votes compared with Seselj's 32.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although a straight majority will be sufficient in the second
round for deciding the president-elect, the voter turnout must
exceed 50 percent of the electorate for a valid result.
</P>
<P>
Seselj defeated Socialist candidate Zoran Lilic in a
presidential poll in October but the vote was below the 50 percent
threshold for his election.

NANJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Historians in east China's
Jiangsu Province gathered today in Nanjing, the provincial
capital, to attend a seminar marking the 60th anniversary of
Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 60 years, historians in the province have
extended great effort to collect volumes of historical documents
and to systematically study the Nanjing Massacre. Provincial
historians have earned an excellent reputation in the field of
international history.
</P>
<P>
Historians noted that Japanese aggressors launched an invasion
in Shanghai on August 13, 1937, and seized Nanjing, the Chinese
capital at that time, on December 13.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers were
savagely butchered and almost a third of the city's houses were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The historians pointed out that the Chinese people will never
forget the tragedy and cannot accept the fact that some Japanese
continue to distort the truth.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the Japanese Government will
respect the fact and convince the Chinese and Asian peoples that
Japan will never again resort to aggression.

<HEADLINE> New Scheme to Help Tenants Own Their Own Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to introduce a
new housing scheme, under which tenants living in selected public
housing blocks can buy their rental units at prices about one
eighth of the market value.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority (HA) today endorsed the Tenants Purchase
Scheme (TPS), under which tenants only need to pay about 12
percent of the assessed market value to own their flats if they
buy in the first year after the scheme is introduced.
</P>
<P>
Rosanna Wong, chairwoman of the HA, said that the scheme would
make a significant contribution to achieving the 70 percent
ownership target set by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa in his first
policy address in early October this year.
</P>
<P>
She added: "Purchasers will generally spend no more than twice
of what they currently pay for their rents." About 25,000 units
will be put up for sale in the first phase. Those who buy in the
second year of the introduction of the scheme have to pay 21
percent of market value.
</P>
<P>
Sky-high property prices in Hong Kong have deterred buyers,
posing a tough challenge for the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural policy address, Tung Chee Hwa promised to
build at least 85,000 public and private flats annually, to
achieve a home ownership of 70 percent in 10 years, and to reduce
the average waiting time for public rental housing to three years.
</P>
<P>
To hit the targets, the government has mapped out a five-year
land sales program to enlarge supply of land.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Unemployed to Exceed 1 Million Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's top labor official
said Monday that the number of the country's unemployed is likely
to reach 1.25 million next year.
</P>
<P>
The expanded jobless population, said Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho,
is partly due to a 3 percent economic growth called for by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The jobless rate will likely increase to 4 percent next year,"
Lee Ki-ho said in his report to an economic ministers' meeting
presided over by President Kim Yong-sam.
</P>
<P>
Based on the figure, 900,000 will lose their jobs and 350,000
more will enter the "hidden unemployment" category, as they intend
to work but give up looking for jobs in the tough economy.
</P>
<P>
"Fear of unemployment is expected to spread through society
next year," the official predicted, adding that the labor ministry
will do its best to deal with the instability.
</P>
<P>
Lee raised concerns that if the country has a lower economic
growth rate than expected, the number of the unemployed could
increase to more than 1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
To help solve the problem, he said, the government needs to
invest more in labor-intensive projects such as housing and road
construction, to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to handle imminent job instability, the minister said
his ministry will provide various financial aids to the unemployed
for vocational training.

<HEADLINE> Unemployed Double in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless Ukrainians
reached 640,000 in the first 11 months of 1997, almost double the
figure a year ago, the State Statistics Committee said today.
</P>
<P>
However, as the official figure doesn't take into account the
laid-off workers, employment experts here estimate that 2.5 to 3
million of Ukraine's total 51 million labor force are jobless.
</P>
<P>
Over the 11-month period, the government's statistics agency
said, the State Employment Fund paid out about 20 million hryvnas
(about 10.7 million U.S. dollars) in unemployment relief.
</P>
<P>
Igor Sharov, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, urged that
urgent measures be taken to tackle the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
Among those most needed, Sharov said, are measures to ease the
tax burden and simplify the procedure for registering new
companies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists on Current Economic Situation in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- This year, China's economy has
been in a status of "high growth and low inflation", while the
relationship among major economic indices have been the most
appropriate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the long-time contradictions caused by structural
problems still exist, such as the growing difficulties faced
by some enterprises and the increasing number of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
These are the views expressed in an article, written by
economists from the State Council Development Research Center, on
the current economic situation in China and the economic work for
next year.
</P>
<P>
The article says the period of inflation caused by the shortage
of goods has on the whole come to an end, but the current
activities of consumers have been distorted due to structural and
policy factors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the problems of unemployment and lack of social
security are increasing, the risks in the financial sector are on
the rise, and the country's economic growth depends more on
foreign investment and export, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article urges people to understand the current
situation from a new angle and opposes the so-called moderate
inflation policy advocated by some economists.
</P>
<P>
On the large number of loss-making state enterprises,
the article regards it a cost the State has to pay in the process
of restructuring the state sector. However, it stresses, great
attention must be paid to the problem of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The principle thinking for the country's economic work in 1998
should be: deepening the reform, speeding up the readjustment,
advancing amid stability, and improving the quality.
</P>
<P>
It calls on accelerating the restructuring of state firms,
stepping up reforms of the social security system, improving the
structure of consumption, bolstering industrialization of the
agricultural sector, opening wider to the outside and boosting the
export sector.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Nominates Ruling Party's Presidential Bet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos announced
tonight the ruling Lakas-NUCD party's presidential candidate for
the 1998 national polls, ending a months-long fierce race for his
blessing among the party.
</P>
<P>
Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives, was
chosen by Ramos as the man who will carry the ruling party's
banner in the May 11, 1998 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the announcement after a meeting with all contenders
for the party's presidential nomination and vice presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was given the blanket authority to endorse the party's
presidential candidate during the party's consultative caucus on
November 19.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia's candidacy will be formally confirmed at the
party's national convention scheduled to be held in January.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' decision was unexpected to many political observers and
the opposition camp which has been ready to celebrate the break-up
of the ruling party due to the row for Ramos' anointment as his
successor.
</P>
<P>
Ramos had been expected by the opposition to give his
endorsement to former defense secretary Renato de Villa, a retired
general who has a similar background with Ramos.
</P>
<P>
If Ramos chose de Villa, de Venecia, the governing party's
secretary-general, would probably opt to break away from the
Lakas-NUCD, which he formed with Ramos in the 1992 presidential
elections. De Villa joined the ruling party just four months ago.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the bases for his endorsement of de Venecia,
Ramos said he had tabulated and analyzed carefully the results of
the survey conducted among the party during the past several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
After announcing his choice, Ramos called on the seven other
contenders to "support Speaker de Venecia, stay with the party,
and stay with me," according to a statement from the Presidential
Press Office.
</P>
<P>
Other six contenders for the candidacy included Finance
Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, Socio-economic Secretary Cielito
Habito and Senator Ramon Magsaysay.
</P>
<P>
"All of them (other contenders) pledged enthusiastically to
close ranks and rally behind the choice of the president to ensure
the victory of Lakas in next year's polls," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
While the defeated contenders were asked to give their options
for an elective position, Ramos said that the party's vice
presidential candidate should also be known after five or six
days.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also announced that the complete senatorial slate of the
party will be known after about 15 days or before Christmas. The
country's congressional and local polls will be held
simultaneously with the presidential elections.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale China
Commodities Fair will be held here on December 10-14 to promote
economic and trade cooperation between China and India.
</P>
<P>
The fair, the first of its kind that the Chinese government has
held in India over the decades, will be participated by more than
100 leading enterprises from all over China, Zhang Yuzhen, who is

metals, medicines, textiles, and arts and crafts, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The fair is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation of China and the Confederation of Indian
Industry.
</P>
<P>
India is China's leading trade partner in South Asia. In 1996,
bilateral trade volume between the two countries amounted to a
record high of 1.407 billion U.S. dollars, up 20.9 percent than
the previous year.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Balance With U.S. Back in Credit: Eurostat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's trade
balance in goods with the United States registered a surplus of
1.6 billion ECUs (2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, Eurostat said
today.
</P>
<P>
Figures, released today by the EU's statistical office based in
Luxembourg, showed that the EU's same trade balance with the
U.S. was 1.4 billion ECUs (1.7 billion dollars) in the red in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Its exports grew 11.8 percent to 114.2 billion ECUs (137
billion dollars) while imports increased 8.7 percent to 112.7
billion ECUs (135 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most important "players" in the EU-U.S. trade were Germany,
Britain, France and the Netherlands, who account for two-thirds of
the total.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. accounted for 19.5 percent of total extra-EU
imports of goods and 18.3 percent of exports. Nearly 38 percent of
total EU outflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) went to the
U.S. which provides 70 percent of EU FDI inflows.

<HEADLINE> China Real Estate Index Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Since June this year, China's
real estate sector has witnessed recovery from an extended period
of depression, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China's Real Estate Index released here today indicates
optimistic and bright future for local developers.
</P>
<P>
The index is based on three major factors -- land, capital and
the market. It is obtained by calculating the following eight
basic reference indices: land sales, the yearly acreage for
developed land, real estate investments, investment sources, sales
of commercial housing, acreage dedicated to new buildings, acreage
for buildings under construction, and unsold commercial housing.
</P>
<P>
The index covers all annual and monthly indices for the real
estate sector since 1991. Calculations for the period between
March 1995 and October 1997 show that the index reached as high as
more than 100 points in 1995, as a result of a government funded
project to construct inexpensive housing for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been sluggish since 1996 due to government's
efforts to curb investment in the real estate sector. Nonetheless
the index continued to rise and eventually hit 98.52 points in
October this year due to new government policies on mortgage loans
for individuals to purchase housing, interest cuts and sales of
previously unsold commercial buildings.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz today predicted a "turnaround" in the country's
depressive economy in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, he said the country's
economy is expected to recover due to decline in trade deficit and
inflation as well as better performance in agriculture and
manufacture.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has registered a decline by 33 percent in the
first five months of the current fiscal year beginning from this
July, and fell to 618 million U.S. dollars from 2,117 million
dollars of the same period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves rose from 722 million dollars in
November 1996 to 1,400 million dollars at the same month of this
year, the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was brought down to 8.5 percent from 11-13
percent in the past four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is expected to achieve the growth target
of 5 percent despite damage to the cotton crop, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Market Role in Coal Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The market has long been the
major factor affecting China's coal production, and the nation's
coal producers, transporters and consumers should enhance
cooperation, Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State Planning
Commission, said at a National Coal Trade Fair in Zhengzhou today.
</P>
<P>
Ye predicted that the situation for coal production,
transportation and demand will remain stable in 1998 since the
supply and transportation capacity of the railway system can
satisfy the demands.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that coal mines with better marketing
and transport conditions should increase their output, while mines
facing difficulties of selling their products due to low quality
or poor marketing capabilities should reduce production.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) announced today that at least 600,000 people die of typhoid
every year, 70 to 80 percent of them are in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
WHO bacteriologist Bernard Ivanoff said at the opening of the
13th Typhoid Symposium in Bali, Indonesia, that typhoid also
infects 16 to 33 million people a year and most of them live in
developing countries, according to reports reaching here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
"The typhoid bacteria grows in a place where the sanitation and
hygiene systems do not function well," he said, adding that this
bacteria usually attacks the respiratory system.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, "antibiotic therapy is sufficient to treat typhoid
for now," he said, adding that but there is no vaccine to prevent
this disease.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium is attended by 200 participants from
the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan,
Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, India, Australia and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Spiker Declines Invitation from Italian Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China's star spiker Zhang Xiang
declined an invitation from an Italian first division club,
preferring to play in the Chinese volleyball league, a Chinese
sports official said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, the best attacker of Asia, was afraid that he could meet
tough pressure and challenge in a country that has the world's
most successful volleyball league, said Gao Shenyang, gerneral
secretary of the Chinese Volleyball Association (CVA).
</P>
<P>
"Of course he will not be as good as in China if he plays in
Italy," Gao said. But he failed to reveal the name of the Italian
team.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for the national to receive an
invitation from an Italian club. Last year, Zhang was invited to
play in the Italian volleyball league for a season with being
offered house, car and tens of thousands U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the CVA, who was worried that his departure could harm the
inaugural Chinese volleyball league, refused the invitation on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
However Wang Jiawei, who took over the national squad early
this year by halting his ten-year coaching career in Japan, threw
all his weight behind the national spikers to play abroad,
especially in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It's the best way to have a deep understanding of world's most
advanced techniques and improve the players' quality," said Wang,
who led China to regain the Asian champion in October.
</P>
<P>
China's volleyball, which once was Asia's domain in early 1980s
and a strong force in the world, lags far behind the rising tide
of professionalism, which has fully embraced soccer and basketball.
</P>
<P>
No Chinese spikers have signed clubs in Europe or America and
the Chinese volleyball league remains an all-Chinese affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a long way to go before introducing foreign
players to our home league though we are making efforts to this
end," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
The second season of Chinese volleyball league starts on late
December, with eight men and eight women squads clashing on a home
and away format.

<HEADLINE> No Change of Housing Program in Hong Kong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official
today reiterated that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government has no plan to change its housing program, which is
aimed to build 85,000 flats a year starting from 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bowen Leung, Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands,
told a group of surveyors today: "Let me say, once again and
categorically, that the government is determined to implement the
housing program. It is a long-term objective, and there is no plan
whatsoever to change it."
</P>
<P>
SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa outlined in his first policy
address in October the housing program and related land sales
plans, with the aim of sustaining annual production of at least
85,000 flats in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Leung said today at the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors'
luncheon that the housing land would be made available on the
basis of the first Five-Year Land Disposal Program (LDP),
announced in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the LDP, the SAR government will provide 120 hectares of
land for private housing up to March 1999, and an additional 260
hectares in the following three years. Over the same period, about
285 hectares of land will be used for public sector housing.
</P>
<P>
Sky-high housing prices have posed a tough challenge for the
SAR government, who has targeted to enlarge land and housing
supply so that up to 70 percent of the Hong Kong people can own
their own houses in ten years' time.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Amend Money Laundering Decree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is set to
amend its money laundering decree promulgated two years ago to spell
out more severe penalties for bank officials who aid or abet money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
A top official of the money laundering surveillance unit of the
Central Bank of Nigeria was quoted by today's Business Times as saying
that the new law will crack down on banks failing to take appropriate
action to stem money laundering activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, some bank are complying with the
provisions of the degree by reporting suspicious transactions to the
central bank, but others are defaulting in this area.
</P>
<P>
The official, however, did not give details on the nature of the
amendament.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing decree, transfer to or from a foreign country of
funds or securities of a sum greater than 10,000 U.S.Dollars or its
equivalent shall be reported to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The report shall cover the nature and amount of the transfer as
well as the names and addresses of the sender and receiver.
</P>
<P>
Banks are also required to seek information from their customers as
to the origin and destination of the funds, the aim of the transaction
and the identity of the beneficiary, where a transaction whether or
not it relates to money laundering, is surrounded by conditions of
unusual or unjustified complexity.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions are also required to report to the National
Drug Law Enforcement Agency within seven days any single lodgement,
transaction or transfer of funds in excess of 500,000 or two million
Naira (about 6,250 or 25,000 dollars) or the equivalents in case of an
individual or corporate body.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, some banks may have shunned the decree,
arguing that to carry out its directives would scare away their high
networth customers.
</P>
<P>
Others said that the provisions run counter to the traditional
confidentiality suppose to exist in banker-customer relationships.
</P>
<P>
Though the drug control agency has prosecuted some car dealers
under the decree, the central bank has so far not charged any bank
officials with flouting the decree, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The government promulgated the money laundering decree in 1995 in a
effort to combat the activities of narcotics dealers deemed as the
major source of illicit money.

<HEADLINE> Tehran in Tight Security for Islamic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Tight security has been
enforced in Iran's capital city of Tehran on the eve of the
eighth Islamic summit as heads of state are arriving.
</P>
<P>
Unusual measures have been taken to the surprise of foreign
guests. Most of the highways and main streets leading to the
venue of the summit and residences of the Islamic leaders were
closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
Four-day holiday for government offices, schools and
universities and other state institutions was announced as of
today for the three-day summit of the Organization of Islamic
Conferences (OIC) due to open Tuesday with the participation of
more than 30 monarches, sheikhs, presidents and prime ministers
from 55 Islamic states.
</P>
<P>
The city with a population of over 10 million has thus been
deserted and it has turned deadly quiet. But cross roads,
streets and even alleys on the southern slope of the Alborz
mountain have stationed with groups of police with AK-47
rifles.
</P>
<P>
Police cars with red alarm lights on were patrolling up and
down the highways and streets decorated with colorful flowers and
green grass, while flags of the 55 Islamic states were fluttering
in the wind.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of heads of state, including Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat, Kuwait Emir Jaber al-Sabah,
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani and Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, have arrived at the Tehran
Mehrabad international airport but refrained from talking to 100
odds reporters who had been waiting there since the small hours of
the day.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel lined up in a distance of a hundred meters
each along the streets from the Tehran Mehrabad international
airport on the western outskirts to northern part of the city
where the foreign dignities are to stay.
</P>
<P>
Thorny issues have been discussed and draft resolutions of
more than 140 endorsed by OIC foreign ministers in their
just-concluded two-day sessions here, paving the way for the
eighth OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Declaration to be adopted by the summit will cover
all problems facing the Islamic world. Iran is trying its utmost
with patience and reconciliation to make the summit a success,
another thrust towards breaking U.S. isolation against it.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Islamic body has recommended that the summit
be entitled "session of dignity, dialogue and participation,"
bringing friends and foes alike together in confrontation with
the U.S. and Israel in particular.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Develops Financial Services to Support Real Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- "The time is right for booming
financial services to support the development of Shanghai's real
estate industry," according to Di Weiping, deputy director of the
Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Di made the remarks today at a Shanghai financial seminar on
real estate and finance. He said that Shanghai will witness the
rapid growth of financial and banking services related to the real
estate industry due to the city's recent economic achievements and
the country's successful housing reform.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the
People's Bank of China, the Shanghai Branch of China Construction
Bank and U.S-based Morgen Stanley Asia Limited.
</P>
<P>
"Many ramshackle houses in Shanghai are in critical need of
repair and affluent residents hope to move in comfortable houses
to improve their living environment," according to Di.
</P>
<P>
However, financial and banking services catering to the
development of Shanghai's real estate industry remain somewhat
immature, and the city needs more related services, said Di.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai initiated housing reform in the early 1990s, and is
currently approaching its goal of providing commodity housing for
sale to Shanghai residents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city's total outstanding loans for
housing have grown to 17.8 billion yuan over the past few years,
with individual mortgage loans rising by 120 percent in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Enzhao, director of the Shanghai Branch of the China
Construction Bank pointed out that the city needs to readjust the
structure of housing loans and credits, and establish an insurance
system for individual mortgage loans. Shanghai also needs to adopt
regulations concerning the sector and perfect the administration
system for housing loans and financial services, according to
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Seventy Chinese and foreign experts attending the seminar
exchanged views concerning the possibility to increase both
housing deposits and the purchasing capacity of local residents in
order to revitalize Shanghai's real estate market.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediencies Council and former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today expressed hope for broader relations
between Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that there are common
views between Tehran and Cairo, Rafsanjani said in a meeting
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, according to the
Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a powerful and effective state in the Muslim world
and can make constructive efforts to coordinate the Islamic
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stressed that the Islamic states should take
practical steps to deal with the interventionist policy of the
Israeli government and solve the regional problems.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the three-day summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC) to be opened here Tuesday could be a
turning point in fostering unity and solidarity among the
Muslims and tackling the difficulties created for the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, currently in Iran for the OIC summit, said that the
regional and international developments have brought about a
closer relations between Iran and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said the Middle East peace process has been deadlocked,
accusing the Israeli government of its "inhuman and anti-peace
approach" which has caused annoyance of the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim world has faced with numerous difficulties and
Egypt has pinned strong hopes on the OIC summit to find ways out
of the current situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Egypt was severed in 1979 after
the later signed the David Camp Accord with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Both Tehran and Cairo have expressed their readiness for a
full resumption of ties.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Stops Lending Due to Arrears of Members' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has stopped all forms of lending due to
more than 27 million U.S. Dollars of debt being owed by its
member states in unpaid capital contribution and loans.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS finances its development projects through the ECOWAS
Fund, but the huge deficit has put the fund into a "precarious
financial situation" as described by ECOWAS Chairman, Nigeria's
Head of State General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
According to Abacha, the fund has been running deficit budget
for the past two years and it will be operating a deficit budget
in 1998, preventing the institution from effectively performing
its financial functions.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the 30th session of the Board of Directors of
the fund last Friday in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, Abacha said
further loaning from the fund's resources has been frozen as a
result of the financial situation.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS chairman suggested that urgent steps be taken to
complete the on-going restructuring of the fund in order to
enable it to attract the much needed resources from non-regional
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of ECOWAS earlier lamented the failure of
member states to pay their membership fee, making it unable to
execute many community programs of the 16-member sub-regional
body.
</P>
<P>
As of last June, member states owed ECOWAS about 44.7 million
U.S. Dollars. The debt included arrears of between three to 17
years as well as contributions for this year.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, ECOWAS leaders decided at their August
summit to impose a community levy to replace contribution by
member states for funding community projects beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
The 0.05 percent levy will be imposed on all imports into the
sub-region from third countries.

<HEADLINE> Source of Killer "Bird Flu" Hunted in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong health authorities
are stepping up the hunt for the source of a deadly influenza
strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global
alert.
</P>
<P>
The "bird flu" has claimed four victims here, killing two,
including a 54-year-old man who died Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were
experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had
also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking
poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that
it could have been passed to humans by chickens.
</P>
<P>
All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to
test patients for the flu.
</P>
<P>
A number of the patients' relatives were also found developing
flu-like symptoms and were undergoing tests.
</P>
<P>
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after
catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a
13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
</P>
<P>
Another victim, a two-year-old boy, who was hospitalized with
fever in November, later fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Geneva said
leading researchers would this week decide whether a vaccine
should be developed, according to reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Drops On Depressed Gold Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar fell to
a new four-year low today, driven down to 66.85 U.S. cents by
depressed gold prices and anxiety over the domestic impact of the
Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 67.11 U.S. cents, from 67.25
U.S. cents late Friday, after reaching a high of only 67.16 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local currency was continuing to trend lower
on concerns about the Asian crisis and the gold price in lieu of
domestic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Sydney trading in gold bullion closed at 287.70 U.S. dollars an
ounce from 286.85 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
SBC Warburg Australia foreign exchange director John Radinoff
said the currency fell to 66.85 U.S. cents today, marking another
new four-year low for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
It was last at these levels in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
Radinoff said trading was extremely quiet today due to lack of
interest in buying the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"There still seems to be export interest down at 67 U.S. cents
and below, and there didn't seem a lot of reason to buy it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Also disappointing the market today was news that the Federal
Government had not opted as expected to remove the 10 percent
interest withholding tax on interest payable to non-residents
holding Commonwealth and state government bonds.
</P>
<P>
The government instead decided to widen tax exemption to
include corporate debentures only.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen this evening, the Australian dollar was at
87.05 from 87.34 Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's NP Calls for Death Penalty Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
oppositlion National Party (NP) has urged the government
to hold a referendum and summit on the reintroduction of the death
penalty
</P>
<P>
NP safety and security spokesman, Piet Matthee, said in a
statement Sunday that the summit should be convened to investigate the
possible reintroduction of capital punishment within three
months, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The summit should investigate the moral and legal implications
and be convened by a multi-party committee to hear arguments for
and against the death penalty's reintroduction, Matthee said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress has been vehemently
opposed to the restoration of the death penalty on the grounds
that the capital punishment is barred by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
South Africa abolished the death penalty on the eve of the
first democratic elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The NP made the call after the conviction of a serial killer
Moses Sithole last week, at which Justice David Curlewis said it
as a "mistake" to have done away with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Sithole was sentenced to 2,410 years in prison after being
found guilty of 38 counts of murder, 40 rapes and six cases of
robbery.
</P>
<P>
The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party last month introduced a
bill to amend the constitution so as to allow for the death
penalty, but it is believed that the bill will be vetoed at the
committee level and would not be able to reach the ANC-dominated
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
ANC President Nelson Mandela, who had been in prison for 27
years, personally abominated the death penalty on the grounds
that it was used as a major tool by the apartheid regime to
oppress the black majority.
</P>
<P>
The issue, which Mandela said should never be reopened, became
hot again when Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel, a member of the
NP, called for a referendum in his province last month.
</P>
<P>
The question of death penalty looks set to be a matter for
debate in the 1999 general election as there is louder and louder
calls from the society for the restoration along with spiraling
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Verify Marcos' Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., son of
Philippine late president Ferdinand Marcos, today authorized a
Senate committee to look into the bank accounts allegedly
controlled by his father.
</P>
<P>
The young Marcos submitted to the Senate Blue Ribbon committee
a letter officially requesting concerned banks to reveal the
transactions which the Marcos family had entered into.
</P>
<P>
The committee disclosed the existence of 93 bank accounts of
the Marcoses which are not covered by the 500 million U.S. dollars
being pursued by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has filed litigation cases against
the Marcoses to recover the alleged ill-gotten wealth amassed by
the family of the former president.
</P>
<P>
The young Marcos insisted that no such accounts exist, and was
confident that investigation into the so-called Marcos wealth,
particularly the Marcos gold hoard, will end up nowhere.
</P>
<P>
But still, he proposed that the government directly request the
countries where the bank accounts were opened to assist in
uncovering the alleged wealth.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Urges Trade Unions To Play Greater Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), today called on
trade unions at all levels to enhance understanding of the goals
and tasks set forth during the 15th CPC National Congress, and
bring the talents of workers into full play.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who also serves as president of the All-China Federation
of Trade Unions, made the remarks in a speech at the Fifth Session
of the federation's 12th Executive Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that trade union officials should arouse the
enthusiasm of workers to promote the reform and development of
state-owned enterprises and safeguard their legitimate rights in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should pay close attention to the daily-life
difficulties faced by workers, especially laid-off workers, and
should place the reemployment of laid-off workers at top of the
agenda, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that trade unions should promote legislation and
the enforcement of labor laws, and should at the same time
establish and improve the mass inspection system.
</P>
<P>
He urged trade union organizations to provide workers with
instructions related to Deng Xiaoping Theory and teach them to
effectively deal with new circumstances and problems stemming from
reform and development. Wei said that trade unions should help
improve the professional skills of both laid-off and employed
workers.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out trade union should accelerate its pace of reform
to help organizations coordinate the demands of new situations by
introducing improved management and operational methods, and
should help trade union officials update their thinking and
improve their work styles.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Spends Huge Sum for Dengue Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government spent
up to 47 billion rupiah (13.4 million U.S. dollars) every year to
finance the medical treatment of about 45,000 dengue patients, a
health ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have been trying to combat the dengue cases since
1995, meaningful progress have not been achieved so far including
reducing the number of the cases and the contaminated regions,"
Director General for Contagious Disease Prevention Dr. Hadi M.
Abednego said at a symposium on dengue.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease, leaves its victims
with fever, rash and severe pains in the joints and back. The
cholera-like disease spread by mosquitoes, known locally as
"muntaber", also causes vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Abednego said the number of people infected with dengue
increased from 35,000 in 1995 to 45,000 in 1996 in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
And by November this year, some 22,500 people had been infected
with the disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death rate among dengue patients also rose from
2.5 percent in 1995 to 2.7 percent in 1996. By November this year,
2.1 percent of the total dengue patients had died, he said.
</P>
<P>
The disease occurs in 162 districts, 778 sub-districts and
2,402 villages across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, the number does not
really reflect the actual situation as many have missed a diagnose
and died.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's state assembly
election on Saturday was again dominated by the United Nigeria
Congress Party (UNCP), the same case as in the local council poll
on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Results released so far by the National Election Commission of
Nigeria (NECON) show that the UNCP was leading in almost all the
states, winning in a total of 490 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria came the second with 151 state
legislative seats. It was leading in Osun, Oyo and Kano states.
</P>

of all the four other parties.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's state assembly election was marked by an
impressively low turn-out amid a generally orderly peaceful

<HEADLINE> TDC to Focus on Promotion of HK's Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) today announced a refocusing of its
promotional efforts next year on Hong Kong's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of TDC's global promotional program for 1998,
Executive Director Michael Sze said: "We are redeploying resources
 to competitiveness, the key issue facing Hong Kong, and indeed
the entire Asia-Pacific, as we prepare for the next century."
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, the council has allocated much
energy in easing concerns in overseas markets about Hong Kong's
post-handover prospects. "Now that the transition is successfully
behind us, confidence in Hong Kong's future is no longer a big
issue for our trading partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sze said important groundwork for the shift in focus has been
done over the past two years, when the council has taken a lead in
 major research studies on Hong Kong's economy and the sources of
its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no doubt that the issue has been given extra edge
 by the Asian currency crisis and a round of competitive
devaluation in the region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The TDC will act on two levels: first, highlighting Hong Kong's
 competitive strengths across the world; second, directly helping
the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which
form the backbone of Hong Kong's economy and its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
TDC's strategy emphasizes practical help for the 300,000 SMEs
in Hong Kong, upgraded market information particularly from the
inland areas of China, and a mix of initiatives to more vigorously
 promote Hong Kong's value-added economy, Sze said.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the financial crisis in the region, Sze said Hong
 Kong will be positioned as a partner offering unique financial
and professional services to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The council will also be stepping up its efforts on the
mainland by instituting a series of fact-finding missions to find
out how Hong Kong-based companies can take advantage of business
opportunities as Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are
restructured.
</P>
<P>
Plans include creating a detailed databank on SOEs and
developing dialogs between Hong Kong business people and senior
SOE executives.
</P>
<P>
"One of the cornerstones of Hong Kong's competitiveness is our
role as China's international business hub and our increasingly
important function of providing funding and expertise for the
mainland's modernization," said Sze.
</P>
<P>
As a direct help to SMEs, a dedicated SME information center
and a well-equipped training facility for practical workshops will
 be set up in the expanded Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
TDC is also looking to further promote Hong Kong's services, a
key area of competitive advantage for the local economy. A series
of anchor exhibitions have been planned for major sectors such as
finance, information technology, design and marketing.

<HEADLINE> Flower Industry Blossoms in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China's flower industry is
booming as an increasing number of affluent Chinese are learning
how to brighten their life with flowers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released during the Third Executive Council of the
China Flower Association (CFA), which opened today in Beijing,
show that the nation's area under flower plants in 1996 reached
75,000 hectares and the industry recorded a total output
value of 4.8 billion yuan (578 million US dollars), up 60 percent
on 1993.
</P>
<P>
The export value for flowers jumped from 50 million US dollars
in 1993 to 130 million US dollars last year, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and honorary president of CFA, told
participants of the meeting that China enjoys favourable climatic
and geological conditions, and has abundant human resources to
develop the flower industry.
</P>
<P>
According to CFA sources, southwest China's Yunnan Province has
developed into China's major fresh flower production base, with
south China's Guangdong province as the country's production
center for decorative plants.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China should use the experiences of
countries such as the Netherlands and Japan which have highly
developed flower industries.
</P>
<P>
The CFA, founded in 1984, has joined a number of international
flower organizations, including the International Horticultural
Producers Association and the World Rose Federation.
</P>
<P>
CFA President He Kang said the association held China's first
flower trade fair in Shanghai, the nation's largest city, in April
this year. He noted the event attracted some 100 enterprises from
14 countries and regions, and ended with a total business volume
of some 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the CFA will sponsor an international flower
exposition in Shanghai in 1998, and an international horticulture
fair in Yunnan Province in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces 10 Percent Pay Cut for Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today announced a 10 per cent pay cut for
ministers and deputy ministers as one of the "Strategic Measures
to Strengthen the Country's Economic and Financial Stability."
</P>
<P>
The salaries of officers in Super scale C and above, political
secretaries and those holding equivalent posts would be cut by
three per cent, Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, announced in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the decision was made after the holders of these
posts offered to have their salaries cut.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had also decided to freeze salary
increment for government officers in the A and B categories until
the economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that in line with this move, the
government hopes that the private sector will take similar
measures to ease the inflationary pressure on the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that to extend the incentives for the tourism sector
and make domestic tourism more attractive, a 10 per cent tax break
on service tax and five per cent on sales tax on rooms would be
given to all hotels in the country.
</P>
<P>
To prevent outflow of funds and to encourage domestic tourism,
ministers and civil servants who enjoy travel and vacation
benefits are no longer allowed to tour overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that in line with this, companies giving their staff
travel and vacation benefits to travel within the country would
continue to receive tax reduction. However, the same benefits, if
used for overseas travel, would no longer be given tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said for the education sector, the
entry of experienced foreign tutors would be simplified in efforts
to ensure a high standard of education in the country while in
keeping with the current economic situation, the government had
taken the step to reduce in stages the number of students sent
overseas starting next year.
</P>
<P>
On the property sector, Anwar said the industry must make urban
renewal an important component of its strategic thinking in the
long run and in this respect, housing developers and the banking
system would be encouraged to widen the concept of redeveloping
old housing estates, whether government-owned or
private-sector-owned.
</P>
<P>
"Property developers will continue to be given incentives and
facilities to build more low-and-medium-cost houses," he said.
</P>
<P>
On December 5, Anwar already announced several measures towards
economic recovery and restoring investors' confidence including a
18 per cent cut back in federal government spending.
</P>
<P>
He scaled down the country's growth to between four and five
per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from the earlier forecast
7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
He announced reducing the current accounts deficit in 1998 from
four to three per cent of GDP; deferring all major projects;
ensuring banks' safety as the guiding principle in deciding
between the interests of the banks and their debtors; protecting
depositors in the banking system; freezing applications for new
listings, rights issues and corporate restructuring; and
reaffirming the government's commitment to a flexible exchange
rate regime.

<HEADLINE> 56 Thai Finance Firms Ordered to Close Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda announced today that 56 of the 58 earlier-suspended
finance companies had been ordered to close down, leaving only two
allowed to reopen.
</P>
<P>
Operations of the 58 finance firms were suspended in June and
August this year by the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh Administration
because of their massive debts and lack of liquidity. Their bad
debts severely bogged down a number of commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Tarrin said the mass
closure was a major step in restructuring the country's financial
sector and will lead to increased investor confidence, inflow of
foreign capital and stability of the weakening Thai baht, which
has lost more than 60 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar
since its floating in July .
</P>
<P>
The bad assets of the closed-down finance firms will be handled
by a newly-established asset management corporation, which may
sell the bad assets at auction.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 employees of the shut-up firms will be made
redundant in accordance with Thailand's labor law.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) reacted positively to the
mass closure, with its index rising 3.35 percent from the last
trading day, reversing the falling trend of last week.

LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A unified maritime policy may
soon be adopted by 24 west and central African countries to boost
the development of the industry in the two sub-regions.
</P>
<P>
The step is intended to enable the countries responsible to
changes in international maritime transport, especially in the
Area of Trade Liberalization, the weekly Business Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
It will not only match developments in international maritime,
but also ensure that the sub-regions maximize the benefits of the

</P>
<P>
Transport ministers of the 24 countries are scheduled to meet
in Abuja, Nigeria, between December 9 and 12 to ratify
recommendations on the maritime policy and other issues made at
the previous session of the Ministerial Conference of West and
Central Africa on Maritime Transport (MINCOMAR).
</P>
<P>
MINCOMAR, which is coordinating the policy formulation, has
already directed at its 9th ordinary session general assembly
that member states should adopt new strategies to make the
proposed policy a reality.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the ministers will ratify
deliberations on the reform of shippers council, definition of a

ancillary activities and the establishment and implemention of
short- and medium-term sub-regional integration projects in
international shipping.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Concerned over Dumping of Banned Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official today
expressed the government's deep concern over continued dumping of
banned chemicals on the third world countries by industrialized
nations, Zambia News Agency (ZANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a three-day workshop held in Lusaka on
sound management of chemicals for countries in Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Peter Mwamfuli, Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, said that
the victims of such exports have been innocent people in the
third world countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the use of such chemicals which are
creating serious environmental and human health hazards has led
to thousands of deaths in the third world countries as the level
of awareness among the users is not very good.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian official called for a regional approach towards
the prevention of banned chemicals into the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Mwamfuli urged countries that are exposed to chemical
disposals to work together to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
For over ten years, he said, Zambia has 300 metric tons
of obsolete pesticides lying around in the open and creating
serious health problems.

MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent

to it, CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya said today in
Minsk, Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Korotchenya was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying
that six years are too short to say that the CIS has failed. He
believes that the CIS has done its job.
</P>
<P>
It has "created a real basis for comprehensive cooperation of

and legal framework for voluntary cooperation," Korotchenya said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the CIS is recognized throughout the world as
a large regional organization.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary said that in certain cases, the member
states may have to cede their interests for the sake of
coordinating joint activities, otherwise the economic and other
integration might be "problematic".
</P>
<P>
Korotchenya added that the union of Belarus and Russia is not
an alternative to the CIS, which was founded on December 8, 1991,
after the former Soviet Union collapsed.

JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were killed
when fire engulfed the top floors of a 25-storey tower block in
Indonesia's central bank complex here this morning, said head of
Jakarta's fire brigade Suharso.
</P>
<P>
The fire started at the 24th floor of the 25-storey A tower and
was believed to have been sparked by a short circuit in the air
conditioning at 9:30 a.m., spokesman of the Central Jakarta Fire
Brigade Freddy Aling said.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters are still evacuating the 24th and 25th floors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rescuers are still searching for six others who
were believed to have been trapped in the A tower's top floors,
where the fire broke out, policemen said.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters faced difficulties reaching the top floors of the
25-storey tower but tried to prevent the fire spreading to the
floors below by spraying water on floors where the fire not yet
reached, Suharso said.
</P>
<P>
At least 25 fire engines and two helicopters operated by the
Jakarta police were deployed to extinguish the fire and evacuate
people. One helicopter was seen flying over the building several
times to pour water on the blaze.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian central bank constructed the twin towers in
downtown Jakarta, the A tower houses the bank supervision
department. The nearby twin B tower is not yet occupied and is

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two U.S.-made Iridium Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A China-made rocket
successfully carried two U.S.-made satellites into orbit at
3:16:49 P.M. today (Beijing time) from the Taiyuan Satellite
Launch Center in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese carriers have thus fulfilled all launching tasks set
for the year, scoring successes for six launches in a row.
</P>
<P>
This was also the 49th launch of the Long March rocket family,
according to corporate sources.
</P>
<P>
Initial results from Xi'an Satellite Monitoring and Control
Center indicated that the satellites, made by Motorola Corp. of
the United States, and the rocket separated 50 minutes after
launch.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites were positioned at the low-earth orbit with
a perigee of 629 km, an apogee of 632 km and a bank angle of 86.3
degrees, marking the successful end of the commercial launch
undertaken by China Great Wall Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has contracted the Great Wall group to send another 20
iridium satellites into orbit in ten launches in coming years.
</P>
<P>
The launch used an improved version of China-developed Long
March 2C, with an initial propelling capacity of 213 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with Motorola, the iridium satellite
system is a global wireless communications network that will
combine its worldwide reach of 66 low-Earth-orbit satellites with
land-based wireless systems. Subscribers to the network will have
a variety of telecommunications services -- such as telephones and
paging services -- virtually anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch also marked the debut of Taiyuan Satellite
Launch Center in the international commercial launching
market. Three decades of efforts have turned the center into an
all-round player capable of launching various satellites into
orbit. Two China-made FY-1 meteorological satellites have been
launched from this center.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta, Hunter Militia in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks are going on in
Sierra Leone between the military junta and traditional hunter
militias known as Kamajors loyal to former President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is brokered by Nigeria, a report reaching here
said today, without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have reportedly fighting against the military
government for the restoration of Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
Under an earlier peace agreement, the junta agrees to step
down in April next year and all groups, including the national
army and the Kamajors, will be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
However, several negotiations between west African countries
and the junta have failed to reach consensus as the junta
insisted that the disarmament should not cover the national army.

<HEADLINE> Manila Declares Busting of Three Kidnap Syndicates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission announced today the busting of three
kidnap-for-ransom gangs in a concerted action against kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
During the action, 25 kidnap suspects including four of their
leaders, who victimized mostly wealthy Chinese-Filipino
businessmen, were arrested, it said.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the suspects gave heat to the anti-kidnapping drive
launched at the beginning of the month by the anti-crime
commission and its various affiliated units from the National
Bureau of Investigation and the national police.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona, the fall of
the kidnappers brought solutions to nine cases in which the
suspects blackmailed for some 1 million U.S. dollars in ransoms.
</P>
<P>
Guingona said that five of the 25 suspects were involved in the
kidnapping and murder of Gordon Tan, son of a wealthy shop owner,
on November 24.
</P>
<P>
The killing of Tan and another young Filipino Chinese
businessmen by abductors promoted the Filipino-Chinese community
to stage a series of protests and urge President Fidel Ramos to
stop kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told the chiefs of the law enforcement departments that
he "wanted to see results" of the campaign against kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Foundation to Be Set Up at ASEAN Informal Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An ASEAN foundation will
be set up during the second ASEAN informal summit in Kuala Lumpur
next week to accelerate intra-ASEAN cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding for the establishment of the
foundation will be signed by ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) foreign ministers in the presence of their heads of state
and government at the summit, Malaysian Foreign Ministry
Secretary-General Abdul Kadir Mohamad said today at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- will
meet for their second informal summit in the Malaysian capital on
December 14 and 15 amid the region's on-going efforts to grapple
with its economic problems which surfaced after speculative
attacks on some regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The first ever summit between ASEAN heads of state and the
president of China as well as the prime ministers of Japan and
South Korea will be held in the afternoon of December 15, Abdul
Kadir said. He described the three countries as ASEAN's
traditional trading and investment partners.
</P>
<P>
He said the meetings come at a very important time in the sense
that the region is facing an economic setback that affects all
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meetings will be an opportunity for ASEAN member countries
to discuss between themselves and then take up certain issues of
common concern with the three countries.
</P>
<P>
On the "ASEAN Plus Three" meeting, Abdul Kadir said: "I would
expect the meeting will discuss ways to re-establish confidence in
this region as ASEAN Plus Three relations are based on mutual
support and mutual prosperity."
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN officials hoped issues such as prospects for East
Asia in the 21st century, cooperation towards regional economic
stability, preparations for the second Asia-Europe meeting in
London in April and further collaboration in the Mekong Basin
would be discussed at the "ASEAN Plus Three" meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the ASEAN informal summit, which is also known as the
ASEAN Commemorative Summit celebrating the 30th anniversary of
ASEAN, ASEAN finance ministers who met in Kuala Lumpur recently
would submit a written presentation to the ASEAN leaders on the
outcome of their meeting which helped strengthen the region's
resolve to deal with the economic setback, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines who have been charged with determining ASEAN's role in
bringing back peace in Cambodia are also expected to brief the
leaders on the latest development there.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's admission into the grouping was deferred in July at
the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting due to political instability in
that country.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has
suspended Generalized System of Preference (GSP) treatment on 44
Thai exports, according to the Nation today.
</P>
<P>
At present, Thailand is enjoying preferential trade treatment
under the third 10-year GSP program from April 1991 to March 2001.
The GSP concessions were granted to 125 groups of products,
covering both industrial and agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials claimed that the number of Thai goods taking
advantage of the GSP has by far exceeded the ceiling set by Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai Commerce Ministry expects Japan will continue
to be a key market for Thailand, as Thai exports have become more
competitive after the Thai baht has depreciated by more than 60
percent against the U.S. dollar since July 2 float.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued their
upward trend from last week and increased sharply on the Singapore
market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index rose by
39.86 points to close at 1,753.63 points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the share prices were lifted by an improved
sentiment arising from Malaysia's decision to take active steps to
tackle its economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Helped by the firmer tone on the Malaysian front, Singapore
blue chips received a mild boost. Particularly, the
government-backed engineering entity Singapore Technology
Engineering, which debuted today, performed strongly, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 346.87 million units,
valued at 631.39 million Singapore dollars (about 394.62 million
US dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 306 to 45, while 267
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 38.58 million units.
It was followed by Magnum Corporation which had 20.74 million
shares traded. RHB Capital Warrant99 was next with 16.96 million
units changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Malaya Banking 200 led the gainers of the day as it rose by 1.1
dollars to end at 5.4 Singapore dollars. Malaya Banking increased
by 1.08 dollars to close at 5.4 dollars too. Uniphoenix gained one
dollar to finish at 3.4 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Two U.S.-made Iridium Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A China-made rocket
successfully carried two U.S.-made satellites into orbit at
3:16:49 P.M. today (Beijing time) from the Taiyuan Satellite
Launch Center in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese carrier has thus fulfilled all launching tasks set for
the year, scoring successes for six launches in a row.
</P>
<P>
This was also the 49th launch of the Long March rocket family,
according to corporate sources.
</P>
<P>
Initial results from Xi'an Satellite Monitoring and Control
Center indicated that the satellites, made by Motorola Corp. of
the United States, and the rocket separated 50 minutes after
launch.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites were positioned at the low-earth orbit with
a perigee of 629 km, an apogee of 632 km and a bank angle of 86.3
degrees, marking the successful end of the commercial launch
undertaken by China Great Wall Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has contracted the Great Wall group to launch another
10 iridium satellites in coming years.
</P>
<P>
The launch used an improved version of China-developed Long
March 2C, with an initial propelling capacity of 213 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with Motorola, the iridium satellite
system is a global wireless communications network that will
combine its worldwide reach of 66 low-Earth-orbit satellites with
land-based wireless systems. Subscribers to the network will have
a variety of telecommunications services -- such as telephones and
paging services -- virtually anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch also marked the debut of Taiyuan Satellite
Launch Center in the international commercial launching
market. Three decades of efforts have turned the center into an
all-round player capable of launching various satellites into
orbit. Two China-made FY-1 meteorological satellites have been
launched from this center.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: New Opportunity for Private Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- As state enterprises are
accelerating the transfer of property rights under new reform
schemes, the non-state sector in China is facing another
historical opportunity for expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a major move, the inland Shaanxi Province in the
less-developed northwestern China has decided to grant private
businesses equal rights with state-owned enterprises in obtaining
bank loans and acquiring land, as well as water and power supply
and transportion.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's leading industrial and commercial center,
recently came out with a series of policies encouraging
Sino-overseas joint ventures, private and collectively-owned
firms, and share-holding companies to launch new and high-tech
enterprises, as well as encouraging technicians to take stakes or
setting up high-tech companies of their own.
</P>
<P>
In its new policies, Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's
Hebei Province, stresses providing support to large-scale private
enterprises, including issuing a "protection card" to these
enterprises to reduce their burdens and enjoy a good production
environment.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has decided that qualified non-state enterprises will
be given approval to issue stocks and bonds, and will enjoy
reduced taxes. Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, has also followed suit.

<P>
Chinese economists have also been airing their support for
expansion of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a renowned economist at Peking University,
stressed the need to improve the competitive environment so the
non-state sector can enjoy equal terms with the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Economist Wang Zhuo advocates establishing a modern enterprise
system that would ensure the introduction of non-state property
rights mechanism through the market.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses that emerged in the early 1980s have already
become part of the national economy through decades of
development. However, the sector still plays a supporting role in
China's political and economic life.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held
in September issued a call for further expansion of the private
economy. Analysts believe this has provided a new opportunity for
further development of the non-state sector.
</P>
<P>
The private sector can take advantage of the reorganization of
assets and the transfer of property rights of state enterprises,
experts say, adding that the private sector should shift the focus
of its business from the countryside to the cities, and from
commerce, trade and processing to industry and high-tech field.
</P>
<P>
Many private enterprises are now actively involved in acquiring
state enterprises. For example, most of the 50 million yuan (6.024
million U.S. dollars) of the share capital of the Shanglian
(commercial alliance) Group in Harbin, capital of northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province is held by private enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Boosting Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has decided to expand
tourism industry and plans to turn the sector into a new economic
powerhouse for the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a goal set recently for developing the tourism
industry, by 2000 Shanghai expects to annually attract two million
overseas tourists and 100 million domestic visitors, and earn 20
billion U.S. dollars. The added value from tourism would account
for 6 percent of the municipality's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Yao Mingbao, executive deputy director of Shanghai's Municipal
Tourism Commission, explained that the city would have to increase
the number of foreign tourists by 10 percent and domestic visitors
by 15 percent in the next three years to meet the goals.
</P>
<P>
He said that goal can be reached as long as arduous efforts are
made and sound measures are practiced to explore tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Yao said his commission will take measures to boost tourism
such as establishing six service organizations and tourism
enterprise groups, developing chain management companies, pooling
funds from society to form share-holding companies for developing
tourism, advancing development and production of tourist
commodities, tightening management of the tourist market and
strengthening training of professional tourism personnel.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's tourism sector has been operating more than 40
tourist routes and more than 400 scenic sites, and has added new
tourist programs of special features while intensifying its
promotional work in overseas tourist markets. In 1996, overseas
tourists stayed in the city for an average of 4.3 days, an
increase of 16 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has also decided to practice a strategy of
seeking simultaneous development of overseas and domestic tourism
by adjusting its existing tourism strategy which involved focusing
only on international tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Tourism Commission has cooperated with
concerned local departments to build an all-embracing service
network for tourism development.
</P>
<P>
The city has also dispatched missions to other parts of the
country to publicize Shanghai's tourism resources, hoping to build
a multi-level tourist network with concerned departments of other
areas on the basis of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of this year, the city received 1.38
million overseas tourists, a rise of 16 percent over the same
period last year. More than 50 million domestic tourists visited
Shanghai during the same period.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Up by 6.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased by 6.4 percent in October, compared to the same
month of last year, as most of the major industries continued to
record higher output except for the pharmaceuticals and plastic
industries, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increase in October, the cumulative output
growth for the first ten months of this year was 3.1 percent over
the same period of last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
In October, the output of electronic products was 4.2 percent
higher compared to the same month last year, with higher
production of semiconductors, computer peripherals and printed
circuit board assembles.
</P>
<P>
However, the EDB said, there was lower output of personal
computers and telecommunication equipment due to fewer orders from
the United States and China respectively.
</P>
<P>
For the first ten months of 1997, cumulative output of the
electronics industry grew by 1.6 percent compared to the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals industries, including petroleum, petrochemicals,
pharmaceuticals and industrial/specialty chemicals, maintained a
steady growth in October. The year-on-year increase was 17.5
percent in October 1997 and 17.1 percent for the first ten months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The machinery and equipment industry increased by 17.7 percent
due mainly to more work done in the fabrication of oil rigs and
higher output of lifting machinery, conveyors and metal working
machines. Cumulatively, output for the first ten months of the
year grew by 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of rubber and plastic products fell by two percent
in October with lower output of components for consumer
electronics. But the output of plastic packaging materials, tubes
and pipes increased.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, the output for the January-October period was 7.2
percent less than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The output of pharmaceuticals declined for the second month in
October, down by 25.9 percent, the EDB noted. It said that the
decline was caused by a temporary shutdown of a plant for
cleaning. The cumulative output for the first ten months was
marginally higher by 0.4 percent from the corresponding period
last year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Islamic Leaders Seek to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran has been quick to declare
victory in hosting the Islamic summit, which it says symbolizes
that it did not fall victim to the isolation and containment
attempt plotted by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel isolated," said a ranking Iranian official
while fielding questions at a press conference on whether the
summit will act on Washington's long-standing hostile policies
against Tehran.
</P>
<P>
This feeling is perhaps shared by some other time-tested foes
of the U.S. - Libya, Iraq, Sudan, to name a few - whose leaders or
high-ranking officials are scheduled here Monday for the eighth
summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on
December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 monarches, sheiks, presidents and prime ministers
are said to turn up at the summit, represented by all the 55 OIC
member states but Afghanistan, whose seat was preferred to be
kept vacant due to the nebulous situation of civil conflict in
the country. Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani will be present
at the summit as an observer.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Islamic body has agreed to define the
upcoming get-together as a "session of dignity, dialogue and
cooperation," an expectation it has tried hard to conceive.
</P>
<P>
With one fifth of the world population and rich resources,
the Islamic countries have been eager to iron out their grudges
and differences, and close ranks; they are even more so now in
the face of the latest developments in the international arena
and at the threshold of a new century.
</P>
<P>
This was reflected in the just-concluded Islamic foreign
ministers' meeting in preparation for the summit. The past two
days witnessed a barrage of draft resolutions in the fields of
politics, economy and culture gaining endorsement of those
ministers.
</P>
<P>
They were differing on many issues, of course. But they
reconciled, trying to seek common ground while shelving
differences. For example, the summit is expected to oppose
Islamic countries' military cooperation with Israel, in general
and in principle, but refrain from calling names. It will also
condemn the "expansionist policies" and "hegemonism" of Israel
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This reasonable approach has evidently cleared the way for
the summit to become time-efficient in working out a strategy
for the organization's future role and objectives.
</P>
<P>
As OIC Secretary General Izziddine Al-Iraki put it, there are
many developments in store in the next century, the Islamic
world "should be prepared to take calculated stances on those
developments while maintaining its values and principles."
</P>
<P>
Not only will the Islamic leaders discuss such political
topics as Arab-Israeli conflict, Jerusalem, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
U.S.-Libyan crisis over the Lockerbie aircraft bombing,
Afghanistan, Kashmir and many others, but also they will focus
attention on unity and solidarity, as well as "all-out
cooperation" among Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
There is going to be roaring diplomacy, on bilateral or
multi-lateral bases, on the sidelines of the summit. Iran and
Egypt which cut off diplomatic ties 17 years ago, for example,
have said they believe this summit is helpful to improve
their relations.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Tehran are said to be ready to send their recalled
ambassadors back to work next month, while Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel is to be in town today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the summit will also put emphasis on
intra-Islamic economic, scientific and technological cooperation,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing an Islamic common market is set to
attract much interest. The leaders have yet to draw a
step-by-step plan to enable such an ambitious common market to
take shape.
</P>
<P>
More conspicuous is the summit being held in the immediate
wake of a botched U.S. attempt to bring together Arab Muslim
leaders and Israelis in the November conference on economic
cooperation in Doha, Qatar. The meeting met outright boycott by
a majority of Arab countries, which cited lack of progress in
the Middle East peace process as the reason.
</P>
<P>
Actually they blamed the U.S. policy as "not impartial," but
in favor of Israel at the sacrifice of Arabs and Palestinians,
and condemned the Israeli government as "hard-line" and
expansionist."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic leaders now gather in Tehran, much to the
resentment of the U.S. and Israel, to try to speak in one voice
and make it heard in the rest of the world. Should they succeed
in settling bitter divisions, this goal can be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Redeployment Map Won't Be Ready Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israel's final map on
next troop redeployment in the West Bank may not be ready when
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright again on December 17 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
This assessment by local media was based on the latest session
of the Israeli four-member cabinet committee, which was held here
Sunday shortly after Netanyahu's return from Paris, where he
conferred twice with Albright on the redeployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu briefed the committee on his just-concluded European
trip, but the committee only decided to appoint two
subcommittees of topographical and security experts to crystalize
a map of national interests and security and then submit them to
the committee for consideration.
</P>
<P>
Although its general outlines of demarcation of territory to
be ceded to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the
concepts behind it are almost certain to be in hand, it is in
doubt that it would be complete in time for Netanyahu's next
meeting with Albright in Europe when she returns from Africa.
</P>
<P>
Besides Netanyahu, the newly formed cabinet committee in
charge of making decisions on troop redeployment in the West
Bank also includes Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Foreign
Minister David Levy and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Big differences exist among the four members. Sharon prefers
to have a 20-kilometer-wide Jordan River Valley security zone in
the East and another seven to 10 kilometers wide security zone
along the 1949 Armistice Line in the West of the West Bank. But
Levy said that it may not be accepted by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Because of Mordechai's official visit to Turkey, the committee
will not reconvence until after Mordechai's scheduled return
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, during her meeting with Netanyahu in Paris,
Albright urged Israel to decide on a swifter, more credible
withdrawal from the West Bank than Netanyahu has promised.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said that there will be no government's final
decision on the depth of the redeployment by December 17, the
government's discussion will likely go on until the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in Paris Sunday
after meeting with Netanyahu that France holds that Israel's
plans for a promised troop pullback from the West Bank are
insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Open, Fair Election of HK Deputies to NPC (by Feng Xiuju and Tao Wenge) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The smooth election of the 36
deputies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) of China is believed to
result from the dedication of the Election Conference and the
support of the HKSAR government and people.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, this is the first time for Hong Kong to
elect its NPC deputies as an independent constituency. In the
past, HK deputies were elected by the Guangdong Provincial
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The month-long election process in three stages -- the
discussion and adoption of the Detailed Election Method, the
nomination of candidates, and the preliminary and final elections
-- has been described as "open, fair and impartial."
</P>
<P>
As early as March this year, The Fifth Session of the Eighth
NPC approved the Method for Electing Deputies of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth NPC on the basis
of views and opinions collected from among Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Method, the 36 HKSAR deputies are
elected by an Election Conference which is composed of Chinese
citizens among the members of the Selection Committee for the
first HKSAR government, and Chinese citizens among HKSAR
residents who are members of the Eighth National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) or
members of the HK Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), but are
not on the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
A 424-member Election Conference was formed in early November
and its members in the past month kept in close touch with people
in all walks of life, participating in various discussions on
matters related to the election. A detailed method for the
election was adopted on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong people responded with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
From November 13 to 28, a total of 139 people obtained
Registration Forms for applicants for NPC deputies and 72 became
nominees with at least 10 nomination letters signed by Election
Conference members.
</P>
<P>
The Registration Office in the South Pacific Hotel received
phone calls, letters and inquiries about the election every day.
</P>
<P>
A middle school student from Sha Tin said in a letter that he
learned about the election from a local television
advertisement. He raised a number of questions about the number of
the Hong Kong NPC deputies and their functions and also about the
election of NPC deputies in Macao after it returns to the
motherland in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A taxi driver in another letter aired his views on the
requirements for the Hong Kong NPC deputies. He described the
election as a matter of great significance, saying that the NPC
deputies should be responsible for the whole of the Chinese nation
and safeguard the interest of the state wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
Even after the registration ended on November 28, there were
still people coming to the office to present their applications.
</P>
<P>
During the whole process of the election, a spokesman for the
Presidium of the Election Conference released news about the
election from time to time while the local media followed the
election process closely and gave a wide coverage of the event.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers ran special columns, introducing among other
things the nominees, candidates, election procedures and the NPC
systems.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the smooth run of the election, a code of
conduct was imposed on the Election Conference members, which
stipulated that they are not allowed to directly or indirectly
accept bribes or seek any kind of interests from the election.
</P>
<P>
According to the Presidium spokesman, the Presidium has
received no complaints of unfairness or corrupt practice.
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary and final elections held on December 6
and 8 respectively, all Election Conference members took an
earnest, serious and responsible attitude toward the election.
</P>
<P>
Those who have been elected NPC deputies expressed their
determination to serve Hong Kong and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Those who failed said they were not disappointed at the results
of the election. Some said their participation in the election was
a good beginning for their involvement in China's state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Through the election, Hong Kong people have deepened their
understanding of the people's congress system, its status and
role in China's political life. Hong Kong people will hence take
a direct part in state affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing's Import and Export
Commodity Inspection Bureau has paid close attention to famous
brand products manufactured by medium and large enterprises in
order to expand the international market.
</P>
<P>
The bureau plans to regularly test major products in order to
raise quality, with related tests to be carried out on items such
as automobile parts and raw chemical materials for export.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has helped nine medium and large enterprises earn
ISO-9000 quality certifications and enhance their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will continue to encourage exports and promote
foreign trade, but has nonetheless ruled out a series of
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Joint ventures, cooperative companies and solely foreign-funded
enterprises applying for approval under the quality certification
system have the right to undergo commodity inspections.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will provide fast, effective and fair services when
foreign partners in joint ventures provide funds, or when Chinese
partners entrust them to purchase equipment and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials noted that related measures will help
Chongqing Municipality improve its infrastructure and investment
environment.

<HEADLINE> New Regulation Governs Accounting at State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance has
issued a new regulation to improve supervision of accounting
practices in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
All enterprises should reasonably arrange their spending under
the principle of "production first and consumption second," the
regulation urges.
</P>
<P>
Project budgets and spending plans should be compiled and
approved by the congress of worker representatives and the board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that increases in an enterprise's
total salary should be lower than the growth of its economic
returns, while the actual rise in average employee salary of an
enterprise should be lower than that of work efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets should be made only after the need
for operating funds is met, the regulation says.
</P>
<P>
Business activities between related enterprises must be managed
through separate and independent accounting, it says, adding that
a sheet reporting system should be established.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should set up necessary internal fund distribution
schemes and strict internal cost control systems, the regulation
says.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth implementation of the regulation, the
Ministry of Finance has also issued a notice calling for financial
and accounting administrations at all levels to conduct effective
supervision over accounting in enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo to Take over Ssangyong Motor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Daewoo Group will take over Ssangyong
Group's auto unit within this month, making it the first merger and
acquisition (M&AMP;A) case in the IMF-led reform movement.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Motor Chairman Kim Tae-gou and Ssangyong President for
planning Kim Duk-hwan held a joint press conference Monday morning,
formally announcing that the two will be signing a contract to hand
over Ssangyong Group's 53.5 percent stake in its car-making unit to
Daewoo this month.
</P>
<P>
The takeover will go into effect on December 15.
</P>
<P>
Ssangyong, the nation's sixth biggest largest business group,
decided to sell its debt-ridden automaking subsidiary to ease the
managing crisis due to the tight financial flows.
</P>
<P>
Under the two group's agreement, Daewoo will assume over 2
trillion won (1.6 billion US dollars) of Ssangyong Motor's total
debts of 3.4 trillion won. Ssangyong will shoulder the remaining
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Ssangyong Motor, the first case after the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) asked South Korea to undergo
restructuring by M&AMP;As, would change the landscape of South Korea's
glutted auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, the nation's second largest auto-maker and fourth
biggest industrial giant, will fill the business vacancy of
commercial motor vehicle by the takeover.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo started its takeover bid at a time when the domestic auto
industry is undergoing restructuring due to production glut and
shifted to Ssangyong Motor from Kia Group's Asia Motor for takeover
target, in consideration of Ssangyong vehicle's popularity.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo hopes to build a two-tier structure in the local auto
industry, to help it pit against Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's
largest automaker, industry sources said.

<HEADLINE> Almost All HK Households Visited in Voter Registration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 Voter
Registration Ambassadors have visited nearly all the two million
households in Hong Kong during the past two days, in an all-out
effort to involve as many eligible voters as possible for the
Legislative Council polls in next May.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Home Affairs Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) said today that the results of
the weekend's unprecedented drive to register eligible voters had
amply justified (the SAR) government's determination to make the
first Legislative Council election in the SAR "a success."
</P>
<P>
"At the latest tally early this morning, the weekend's efforts
had resulted in the registration of 230,000 new voters and
collection of 60,000 forms on change of particulars," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Those households, whose residents were not at home when the
Voter Registration Ambassadors called on them in the last two
days, will be visited again in the next five days after 18:00.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also reminded all eligible voters of registering
before the deadline on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony of the ambassadors in Hong
Kong Park on Saturday, Chief Executive of the SAR Tung Chee Hwa
said: "This is a golden opportunity for us to show the world how
we put the concept of 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' into
practice."
</P>
<P>
To kick off the voter registration week, more than 30,000
volunteers, most of them are students of secondary schools, began
knocking at the doors of an estimated over two million households
throughout the SAR on that day.

<HEADLINE> China Making Progress in Human Gene Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A human genome project which
involves researchers from 16 Chinese institutes has produced an
enormous amount of significant data, according to the National
Natural Science Fund Committee.
</P>
<P>
The project, "Studies on Several Gene Loci Structure of the
Chinese Human Genome," has three sub-projects, said a committee
official in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The sub-projects include building a bank of immortalized cell
lines to reserve genes from representative nationalities and
endangered ethnic minorities, introducing and upgrading new
techniques of human gene science and studying the position of the
gene related to human diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found abundant resources for their human gene
studies in China, which has 22 percent of the world's total
population, 56 different nationalities and several separated human
groups, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the project said they have completed 733 cell
lines of two groups of Han nationality in southern and northern
China, and 12 ethnic minorities in southwest and northeast China,
and conducted comparative studies on the diversity of Chinese
multi-nationality genomes.
</P>
<P>
Researchers have also made progress in cloning a group of genes
related to such human ailments as leukemia.
</P>
<P>
The project can help form a cooperative system of human gene
studies in China, which includes many outstanding research groups.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative system, along with data banks and research
centers built for the project, will enable the country to carry
out studies on genome diversity, self-positioning, cloning of
disease-related human genes, genes linked to human functions and a
large-scale survey of DNA orders.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the results of the project and related
improvements in the country's human gene study will help China
make further developments in the field.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Nationwide Strike Causes Serious Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Treasury has
estimated the cost of the five-day-old nationwide strike launched
by the Trade Union (Histadrut) against the government economic
reform plans at 300 million shekels (about 86 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that the crippling general
strike, which came to an end Sunday night after the Trade Union
and the Finance Ministry reached a compromise over pension
dispute, has dealt a serious blow to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman was quoted as saying that the
understanding could have been reached without the strike, which he
said did damage to exports and the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
While the Israeli Manufacturers Association said the total cost
of the strike, which had paralyzed the country by effectively
shut down airports, post offices, banks, government offices and
state-owned companies, was 195 million shekels (about 56 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Workers in industry and those on low pay in the business
sector themselves are those most likely to be harmed", the
association's economist, Shuki Abramovitz, said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the damage would be felt in lost wages and loss
of customers. In addition, industrialists have already started
complaining of a lack of raw materials as a result of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Another concern is losing competition of Israeli goods abroad
after foreign buyers saw Israeli exporters missing
deadlines. Abramovitz said the Federation of Chambers of Commerce
decided to file damage claims against strike leaders.
</P>
<P>
Trade Union Chairman Amir Peretz apologized for the hardships
the strike caused to the public, but said that "a society which
wants a recognized and protected workers' class, must accept the
temporary suffering."
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike was the latest round of the Trade
Union's battle against economic reform plans of the government,
which have sparked fears that the workers' rights will be
harmed.

plan to introduce 1,000 pounds (about 1,600 U.S. dollars) tuition
fees but stop university charging any more than in top-up fees has
angered university chancellors.

<HEADLINE> Sustainable Agricultural Development Be Ensured for 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China should adopt a strategy
of sustainable agricultural development for the 21st century in
order for the sector to achieve modernization, according to
experts attending a conference on China's agricultural development
held in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
The traditional mode of agricultural production will not be
able to meet all needs of social, economic and ecological
development, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Farui, a professor from the China Agricultural
University, said that sustainable and intensive agricultural
development offers the only way to resolve contradictions between
the growing population and inadequate resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the strategy would allow the nation to tap the latent
potential of agriculture by raising labor productivity.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to resolve acute ecological problems,
including the excessive use of farmland and groundwater, as well
as soil erosion and desertifcation, according to Wan Baorui,
vice-minister of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the strategy of sustainable agricultural
development will help farmers increase their income levels and
improve the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the technology sector will play an important role
in implementing the sustainable development strategy.
</P>
<P>
China has placed priority on sustainable agricultural
development and has made agriculture the foundation for overall
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the sustainable development strategy will
become the catalyst for promoting the nation's agricultural
development.

<P>
HEFEI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chizhou, China's only pilot
prefecture for developing an ecological economy, has enhanced
efforts in environmental protection by strictly controlling
factories that pollute and by encouraging clean production methods.

</P>
<P>
The Malaysian bank has subsidiaries in other African countries

<HEADLINE> Intifada Can Start Any Time: Hamas Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the tenth
anniversary of the intifada (Arab uprising), the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) leader in Gaza Abdul Aziz Rantisi has
warned that new intifada against Israel could start at any time.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi issued the warning in an interview with Israel's only
English daily The Jerusalem Post, which was published today,
claiming the flare of confrontation still burns within the
Palestinian people and could explode at a suitable time.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that it was Hamas which encouraged the uprising
in December 1987 by calling out from the mosques for people to
protest in response to an accident involving an Israeli
semi-trailer that collided with a Palestinian vehicle and killed
four passengers and injured 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi said pent-up feelings of injustice led to the
explosion of protests. "The intifada forced the Palestinian
people to face a reality and the continual injustice wrought
upon them by Israel. Their inner fears and frustration were
translated externally in the shape of stones, declarations,
rallies and protest marches and then the people regrouped and
headed into direct confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although most mainstream Palestinian groups consider the
intifada as having ended in 1993, with the signing of the Oslo
accords, Rantisi charged that "the Israeli government continues
to treat the Palestinians in a similar fashion, kindling the
intifada flame felt by the people."
</P>
<P>
"It is only a matter of time before it explodes again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rantisi vowed that Hamas, which opposes the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, would continue its struggle
against Israel as long as Israel occupies Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Hamas' political and military wings are
separate entities and that any threats regarding further attacks
come from Hamas' military wing known as Izzadin Kazzam.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hamas has gained its fame around the world through
Izzadin Kazzam's suicide bombers, who often blew up themselves in
crowded Israeli buses, bustling markets and other public
places, inflicting heavy casualties of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
In the latest two suicide bombing attacks carried out by
Izzadin Kazzam in two central Jerusalem markets in late July and
early September, 25 people were killed and 300 others wounded by
five Hamas suicide bombers. The Israeli government has been
pressuring the Palestinian National Authority to launch an
all-out war against Hamas so to advance the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiashi County, shaken by seven
earthquakes measuring over 6 on the Richter Scale in less than
three months, has reported a record harvest of grain and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the most seriously stricken Yingmaili Township of
the county in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, who have been busy collecting cotton, are expecting 1,500
kilograms of ginned cotton per hectare.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers' average per capita income is estimated at 1,250 yuan,
250 yuan more than last year," said Zheng Genchang, head of the
township.
</P>
<P>
However, the series of quakes brought destructive losses to
Jiashi. Local people almost immediately began new efforts to
rebuild their homes with outside help.
</P>
<P>
The county government sent officials to every village to help
with recovery work, and invited experts from the regional Academy
of Agricultural Sciences to help prevent bollworm infestation.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also exempted farmers from agricultural taxes of 7
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The county had 141,700 tons of grain, with a per-hectare output
450 kilograms more than last year; and 27,000 tons of cotton, 31.7
percent higher than the previous record in 1995.

TAIYUAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Work on the foundation for a
highway bridge over the Yellow River has drawn wide attention
because it is being financed privately rather than by the

The bridge in Shaanxi Province, which will link the city of

remainder.

products to other parts of the country from the poverty-stricken
mountainous area.

After talks with farmers on the other bank of the river, an

<HEADLINE> More Ballot Boxes Prepared for Eventual Run-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electoral Commission
has placed orders for additional ballot boxes for the use in the
event of a run-off in the December 29 presidential race, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu as saying
that his commission had to order for extra boxes in case none of
the presidential candidates garners the mandatory 25 percent
votes in at least five of the country's eight provinces, thus
necessitating a run-off.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the number of voting centers had increased
from 2,000 in 1992 to 13,500 during the December 29 poll, making
it necessary for the number of ballot boxes to be increased.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's law stipulates that ballot papers be returned into the
specific ballot boxes after counting and kept sealed for six
months.
</P>
<P>
This makes it impossible for the commission to use the same
boxes during the presidential run-off, which must be conducted
within 21 days of the holding of the General Election.
</P>
<P>
The commission chairman pointed out that the clearing process
had started at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Lifts Ban of Research Into "AIDS Drug" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Medicines
Control Council (MCC) has given a new lease of life to Virodene
P058, a drug developed locally to fight HIV/AIDS, local daily
"The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The MCC announced at the weekend its turnabout, which allowed
for the renewed research into Virodene.
</P>
<P>
Virodene was formulated by former Pretoria University
researcher Olga Visser, cardiothoracic surgeon Dirk du Plessis,
and a clinical assistant Callie Landauer 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The discovery became public knowledge in January this year
when the trio approached the government for 3.7 million Rand
(770,000 U.S. Dollars) to continue research.
</P>
<P>
The developers claimed Virodene could reverse full-blown AIDS
to HIV, but their claims were met with disbelief and suspicion by
their peers because the clinical trials were said not have been
conducted ethically.
</P>
<P>
The MCC at the time had substantial concerns about Virodene
and banned research on it for the reason that the product was
made from "an industrial solvent with un-known impurities and was
known to be toxic".
</P>
<P>
However, on Friday last week, the MCC said it was committed to
supporting the facilitating the development of new safe drugs for
the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Ziggie Visser, spokesman for Cryo Preservations Technology
which holds the patent for Virodene, said yesterday that a plan
was already in place to continue developing the AIDS drug, and
the results should be available in about four months' time.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma has expressed welcome to MCC
announcement, saying she was interested in establishing whether
Virodene was effective.

<HEADLINE> Election of HKSAR Deputies to National People's Congress Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Conference for Electing
Deputies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) of China completed its
mission after it elected the 36 deputies today.
</P>
<P>
The 36 HKSAR deputies to the NPC were selected out of the 54
official candidates by the 424-strong Election Conference through
secret balloting at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center this morning.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred and nineteen Election Conference members attended
the session and cast their votes today.
</P>
<P>
The Presidium of the Election Conference published the list of
the 36 deputies and will report the list to the Credentials
Commission of the Standing Committee of the NPC for approval.
</P>
<P>
Today's plenary session was chaired by Tung Chee Hwa, executive
chairman of the Presidium of the Election Conference.
</P>
<P>
The election was supervised by Chief Scrutineer Leung Chun-ying
and eight scrutineers, who are members of the Election Conference
but do not run for the NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
The 54 official candidates were chosen from 72 nominees at the
preliminary election last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The election of the 36 HKSAR deputies to the 9th NPC began on
November 10.
</P>
<P>
From November 10 to 12, the Election Conference elected an
11-member Presidium with Tung Chee Hwa as the executive chairman
and approved the Detailed Method for Electing HKSAR Deputies to
the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of candidates began on November 13 through
November 28.
</P>
<P>
During this period, a total of 139 people applied to run for
the 36 deputies and 72 of them became qualified nominees by
obtaining nominations from at least 10 members of the Election
Conference.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary election was held on December 6 because the
number of the nominees exceeded the number to be elected by more
than one-half. Members of the Election Conference chose 54
official candidates out of the 72 nominees.
</P>
<P>
After today's election, Tung extended his congratulations to
the 36 elected deputies on behalf of the Presidium of the Election
Conference and the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his thanks to the media which have had
extensive coverage of the election and helped Hong Kong people
learn about the whole process of the election, which is "open,
fair and impartial as anybody can see."
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Hong Kong to elect its own deputies
to the NPC as an independent constituency since the Chinese
government resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
This is a demonstration and successful practice of the
implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung vowed to support the work of the HKSAR NPC deputies and
believed that they will make contribution to the development of
the country and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary general of the Standing Committee of the
NPC, who was entrusted by the NPC Standing Committee to chair the
election, said that the whole process of this election is open,
fair and impartial.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that the media were welcomed to cover the whole
process of the election and the Presidium of the Election
Conference appointed a spokesman to communicate with the media.
These moves had helped make the election open, fair and impartial.
</P>
<P>
Through this election, the Hong Kong people deepened their
understanding of China's people's congress system and NPC's
position and role in the country's political life.
</P>
<P>
During the election, people in various circles of Hong Kong
also offered ideas and suggestions on the election of HKSAR
deputies to the NPC in future. The Standing Committee of the NPC
will ponder these ideas and suggestions seriously, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Cao expressed the hope that the newly elected deputies will
perform their duties as representatives of the Hong Kong people
and make positive contribution to the prosperity and strength of
the country and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Cao also announced the closing of the Election Conference.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Praised for Efforts to Combat Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is well prepared to
fight the drought likely to be caused by the prevailing El Nino
weather phenomenon, a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
official has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local newspaper "The Herald" yesterday,
FAO Cooperation
and Food Security Officer Mark Smulders said the Zimbabwean
government had enough grain in its reserves and funds to fight
the effects of a possible drought.
</P>
<P>
He said availability of information on El Nino made it
possible for Zimbabwe and other countries in the region to put in
place drought management measures.
</P>
<P>
"Early warnings on the possibility of drought have helped the
governments and other charity organizations to put in place
measures which will help cushion the effects of drought," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said although some people felt that availability of
information would cause panic, FAO believed that the public had
to be well informed about any possible disasters so that they
could also gear themselves for possible difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He called on organizations which dealt directly with communal
farmers to conduct massive awareness campaigns in all areas.
</P>
<P>
"Communal farmers know their area best and if they are warned
in time they may grow early maturing crops and look for means of
cushioning themselves from the effects of drought," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unveils 880M US Dollar Industry Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today unveiled a 1.26 billion Australian dollar (880
million U.S. dollar) industry package designed to increase exports
and investment in Australian industry.
</P>
<P>
"The package of new measures announced in this statement, which
include spending of 1.26 billion Australian dollars over five
years, will further boost innovation, investment, export trade and
innovation in new, high growth industries," Howard told the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
The four-year package includes an additional 389 million U.S.
dollars to be directed to a major expansion of the Research and
Development Start program over the four years to the financial
year of 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
The existing duty drawback and tariff export concession schemes
are to be consolidated into one integrated and simplified scheme
to be known as TRADEX.
</P>
<P>
The package, known as the Investing for Growth package, also
announced a manufacturing in bond (MiB) strategy to complement
TRADEX, through which imports would receive a tax break if they
were to be used to make goods which would then be exported.
</P>
<P>
"MiB will allow companies to use Australia as a base for hub
operations servicing the Asia-Pacific region without incurring
duty liability on goods intended for re-export or used as inputs
to exports," the industry statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The combined effect of TRADEX and MiB will deliver the same
outcomes as foreign trade zones and enhance Australia's
attractiveness as an investment destination," it said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the package outlined the important initiatives
required to further enhance innovation, investment and exports and
to develop Australia's finance and information technology sectors
as vital building blocks in a coherent economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
The industry policy is part of the measures made by the
Australian government to promote economic growth and reduce high
unemployment (about 9 percent on average annually in the past five
years), one of the major social issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Howard said, "The overriding aim of our extensive economic
reform agenda is to deliver Australia an annual growth rate of
over 4 percent on average during the decade to 2010."
</P>
<P>
He explained strong and sustainable economic growth was the key
to significantly reducing unemployment and raising living
standards for all Australians.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Moves to Lower Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said here today that he would urge commercial
banks to lower prime lending rates before the year-end.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Central Bank's opening of overnight lending window
and the release of additional liquidity reserves, the Bankers
Association of the Philippines (BAP) failed to lower the prime
lending rates to below 20 percent before the end of the year as
promised, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would meet with the members of the BAP Friday
to encourage them to lower the prime lending rates before the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
"If this will not happen at the end of this year, I will
encourage them to do it at least during the first week of January
1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson further explained that some banks intentionally raised
the prime lending rates depending on who wants to borrow loans
from banks.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there are banks which imposed higher prime
lending rates if they feel that the track-record of a certain
borrower is not good.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this is their way of saying "no" to clients
whom they cannot turn away. But to those who are good creditors,
they would simply give them a lower interest rate on borrowings.
</P>
<P>
However, Singson discounted rumors that the liquidity of some
banks was affected because some big borrowers were not able to
repay their loans due to the prevailing currency crisis.

ZHENGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has awarded two cities the title of "Garden City" for
excellence in greenery.
</P>
<P>
After strict expert examination and appraisal, the cities of

</P>
<P>
After its elevation to city status from a prefecture in 1994,
Nanyang has devoted its efforts to becoming a garden city. The
city planted trees, flowers and lawns in 37 percent of its urban
area.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Ready to Guard Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan police protection
group has been set up to provide security for 14 opposition
presidential candidates during their campaigning for the December
29 General Election, The East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said that 75 officers of the group had
completed their training at the General Service Unit (GSU) camp
at Ruiru near Nairobi and some had already been attached to their
charges.
</P>
<P>
The decision to offer security to opposition leaders was made
at the talks by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG)
about providing a level playing field for the coming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, leaders from opposition parties have been
regularly teargassed, their meeting disrupted and their
supporters dispersed by Kenyan security forces.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira as saying
last month that several of the presidential candidates had asked
for and received police protection.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi, by virtue of his incumbency, enjoys
round-the-clock protection by an elite GSU and police
intelligence unit.
</P>
<P>
Mwai Kibaki, presidential candidate for the Democratic Party
of Kenya, and Raila Odinga, presidential candidate for the
National Development Party, are said to have their own security
details.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Commissioner Wachira pledged to make available a
security detail for each of the presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
The offer was seen as a goodwill gesture by the Kenyan
government following a series of constitutional reforms brought
about by the IPPG before the dissolution of the Seventh
Parliament in October.

JINAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
one of the nation's leading garment production bases, has set a
goal for significantly developing the local garment industry.
</P>
<P>
Plans for the next five years call for the province to
establish an annual production capacity of three million suits,
eight million shirts, 20 million units of denim clothing, and 50
million sets of knitted underwear.
</P>
<P>
The province currently has an annual production capacity of 1.3
billion pieces of clothing, ranking fourth in the country in terms
of both clothing output and exports. The province produces 7.2
percent of the nation's total garment output.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is also home to national name brands such as "Lanyan"
clothing made of denim, "Xianxia" suits, and "Yuanshou" knitted
underwear.
</P>
<P>
The industry is preparing to introduce a series of reforms
which will emphasize the development of name brand products and

<HEADLINE> China Donates Relief Medicines to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China has donated medicines,
blankets, sweaters and other desperately needed relief items worth
about 360,000 U.S. dollars to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
At a formal ceremony held here this morning, Chinese Economic
Councilor Fu Guangting, on behalf of the Chinese government,
handed over the substantial donation for Afghanistan to the office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
"As a close neighbor of Afghanistan's, it is our duty to give a
helping hand to the Afghan people," Fu said. "We hope that peace
will soon return to the country and every Afghan could enjoy a
normal life."
</P>
<P>
"This donation couldn't have come at a better time," said UNHCR
Chief of Mission for Afghanistan Sri Wijeratne at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"These items will help many Afghans, including refugees who
have returned from Pakistan and Iran, to get through what promises
to be an extremely difficult winter," Wijeratne said.
</P>
<P>
"We are really grateful to the Chinese government for this
donation," he said. "But our gratitude will be nothing compared to
that of the Afghans who will receive these items."
</P>
<P>
The shipment of medicines, blankets, sweaters, shoes and black
tea, worth a total of three million yuan (about 360,000 U.S.
dollars) reached Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan,
last week on a convoy of seven trucks after traveling down the
Karakoram Highway from China's northwestern Xinjiang region.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials said most of the donated relief items will be
flown from Peshawar to Bamyan province in central Afghanistan,
which is in the grip of a major food crisis and a shortage of just
everything.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Promotes Building of Unemployment Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 95 percent of the
workers in north China's Hebei Province have bought unemployment
insurance policies this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebei Provincial Commission for Restructuring
the Economy, workers from state, collective, joint-venture and
private ownership enterprises are all entitled to such insurance.
</P>
<P>
The state and enterprises will pay part of the insurance fee
for each worker, who pays just two yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment insurance fund gathered in Hebei has increased
by 40 percent, hitting 210 million yuan (about 26.25 million
U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has provided unemployment relief funds for more than
100,000 unemployed workers from more than 40 bankrupt enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the unemployment insurance system ensures smooth
economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> More Laid-off Workers Find New Jobs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Statistics by the State
Statistical Bureau show that four million laid-off workers
throughout China were able to find new jobs between January and
September, according to a front-page story in today's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economy, China for decades pursued a policy
of "full employment but low pay." However, inefficiency,
excessive expenditures and overstaffed factories hindered
the competitive edge of Chinese companies, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council specified that most large- and medium-sized
companies should step out of their financial predicament and
should establish modern enterprise system within three years, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's coal industry, with 3.6 million workers, lost
nearly six billion yuan, or 723 million U.S. dollars, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1996, key state-run coal mines laid off
760,000 employees, with 320,000 of those finding jobs in other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
In four years the loss was reduced by 2.49 billion yuan, 1.29
billion yuan, 940 million and 2.1 billion yuan
successively. Average productivity in the coal industry has
increased to 2.1 tons per worker from 1.33 tons per worker in
1992, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment project is the only way to help companies in
financial difficulties, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> More Laid-off Workers Find New Jobs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laid-off workers should be given help to find other jobs, officials
said, because the country's insurance system is not mature enough
to deal with the large numbers.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining social stability, the country should make
full use of the talents of laid-off workers. The re-employment of
laid-off workers is important for the well-being of hundreds of
thousands of Chinese families, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has provided job opportunities for more than 800,000
laid-off workers. The municipal government has reportedly
considered the benefits for those laid-offs.
</P>
<P>
The country's government organizations should also provide
financial support and practical policies in tandem with carrying
on the re-employment project, the story said.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers should also be encouraged to establish
individual or partnership businesses featuring voluntary
cooperation, self-funding and self-management.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from various levels must concentrate on improving the
quality of workers in the next century, it added.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chinese people, especially the young, must bring some
change to the current idea of job-hunting. In the past, many
Chinese regarded jobs in state-run businesses and government
offices as lifetime employment.
</P>
<P>
Another key issue, the story said, is continuous vocational
training for workers.

<HEADLINE> EU Implements New Decision on African Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- African elephants and elephant
products can now be exported to Europe under strictly monitored
regulations following the adoption of revised lists of wildlife
species protected from international trade by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The Herald" daily reported today that the revised lists
reflect in full agreements made by the parties to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) of wild
fauna and flora at a conference in Harare in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The key changes are the opening of strictly limited and
conditional import possibilities for African elephants and
elephant products, including ivory, as well as the submission of
sturgeons and sturgeon caviar to export and import licensing.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted member of the European Commission responsible
for the environment Ritt Bjerraard as saying, "This action
demonstrates our full commitment to CITIES and our respect for
the decisions of its conference of parties."
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, elephant trophies for
non-commercial use from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe can now be
imported into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Leather goods and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes
from Zimbabwe can now also be exported to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Live elephants can be exported to "appropriate and acceptable"
destinations. These would also be for non-commercial use.
</P>
<P>
All other imports into the EU of African elephants and their
products remain strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent sale of ivory products imported from Zimbabwe
is prohibited as all ivory carvings are to be for non-commercial
personal use.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the changes opened the way for possible
experimental resumption of trade in existing stocks of ivory
between Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU said this would not start before March 18,
1999, adding that a series of strict conditions would have to be
met first.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the international trade in wildlife was not only a
significant industry worldwide but could also contribute to
biodiversity loss and threaten some species with extinction.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Told to Hold On to Tight Fiscal Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
been told by the World Bank that it should maintain tight fiscal
and monetary policies if it wants to ensure financial stability
and keep investor's confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank acknowledged that the monetary policies
implemented after the de facto devaluation of the peso had been
"appropriate" but said "the tradeoffs involved have inevitably
caused policy tensions to rise," local newspaper the Business
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Tight monetary policies are called for to adjust to the
diminished demand for domestic assets, to limit the extent of
exchange rate depreciation and increase in inflation, and to
maintain the confidence of international creditors, exporters and
overseas workers," the World Bank said in its macroeconomic
report.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, the bank said the Philippines' adjustment to the
financial storm had been "relatively rapid and certainly better"
than that of its neighbors. It added that this was evident despite
policy tensions that arose from conflicting policies triggered by
the shift in market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The bank viewed the country's performance as different from
that of other nations in Southeast Asia, noting that the period of
significant foreign borrowing by the private sector and rapid
credit growth was shorter in the country when compared with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the ratio of private credit to gross national
product is more modest, large corporations appear less leveraged
and vacancy rates for vulnerable segments of the real estate
market appear lower," the World Bank said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, has succeeded in increasing its urban
building fund by 400 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's city government used to be the sole investor in the
city's infrastructure construction before 1980, with an investment
of less than 10 million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Because of this low level of funding, the city was not able to
keep up with the rapid economic development due to China's reform
and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The city government then took advantage of non-governmental
sources to greatly improve fund raising for capital construction,
pushing up the figure from 1.37 billion yuan (about 171 million
U.S. dollars) in 1992 to 6.74 billion yuan (about 842 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a city official, non-government funds mainly come
from securities, overseas funding, and loans from foreign
governments and organizations.

<HEADLINE> Six Thousand Beijing College Graduates to Choose Their Own Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- In China the state used to pay
tuition for college students and assign them to jobs after
graduation, but that is changing.
</P>
<P>
Next year 6,126 college graduates in Beijing, under China's new
policies, can choose their own jobs. These graduates account for
12 percent of the class of '98, according to the Beijing Municipal
Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 6,126 students are at 13 colleges and universities,
including such top schools as Beijing and Qinghua universities.
</P>
<P>
The state adopted a "pay-to-learn" scheme in 1994 where
students were responsible for their own tuition, said Gan Beilin,
director of the student job assignment division.
</P>
<P>
The state still provides some employment services to graduates
such as holding talent exchange markets and offering employment
information.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 23 Kidnap Suspects Arrested in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government agents
have arrested 23 suspected kidnappers in a series of raids that
started last Friday, Philippine Daily Inquirer reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agents of almost all law enforcement departments took part in
what was considered the biggest operation launched against kidnap
gangs in the past few years, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The operation came on the heels of the resignation of
Philippine National Police chief Recaredo Sarmiento and President
Fidel Ramos' stern order that he wanted results in the campaign
against kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino-Chinese community recently staged a series of
protests after two young Chinese businessmen were killed and
several others abducted by kidnappers. They appealed to the
president to stop the rampant incidence of kidnapping cases in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were members of a big syndicate tagged as the
Mindanao Group, which was responsible for more than 10 recent
kidnapping cases in Metro Manila and nearby provinces, the
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
It added that eight of the suspected were arrested in a series
of raids on the gang's safe houses. Interrogation of them resulted
in the capture of 15 more suspects in the follow-up operations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been taking action to stop and
solve kidnappings in the country, where 950 persons have been
kidnapped and 85 of them have been killed since 1993.

<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen persons were sentenced
to death for heinous crimes in November in the Philippines,
bringing to 514 the total number of convicts awaiting execution,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said 11 of the 14 were convicted of aggravated rape,
two of murder and one of robbery with homicide.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ernesto Herrera, an anti-crime crusader and chief
advocate of the death penalty, said that among those sentenced to
death by lethal injection were eight fathers who raped their
daughters aged 9 to 17.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines resumed death penalty in 1995, but no one was
yet executed.
</P>
<P>
In light of the rampage of kidnapping-for-ransom cases, Herrera
appealed to the Supreme Court for expeditious review of such cases
"so that the executions may be carried out without further delay."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he prodded the Department of Justice to speed up the
prosecution of accused kidnappers, especially those facing the
death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Least Developing Countries Should Use Technical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has called for finding
ways to break out of technological trap of transferring natural
resources at low prices in crude form from least developed
countries (LDCs) to advanced economies with a much higher value
addition, the independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"The LDCs could use technical assistance to learn to diversify
their products so that their share of the final price can
increase," Bangladesh Minister of Commerce and Industries Tofail
Ahmed said at the 7th UNIDO conference which began in Vienna
Monday, UNB quoted the message received in Dhaka as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is no alternative to industrialization for "it is only
through this that can we activize our dormant resources both
natural and human and attempt to energize our teaming millions
towards meaningful productive activity," the minister told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister mentioned the LDCs' recommendations urging the
international community to initiate appropriate supportive
measures for enhancement of UNIDO's role as the specialized UN
agency for accelerating the industrialization process in the LDCs.
</P>
<P>
"In the foreseeable future, I see little prospect of LDCs being
able to make a breakthrough in the modernization process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Fast growing fields, such as finance, information and
biotechnology hold no hope for us in the short and medium terms,"
he stated. "Technological gap in these areas between LDCs and the
advanced countries are far too large."
</P>
<P>
Referring to barriers of entry of LDCs' outputs into the
developed markets, the minister said the benefits of
liberalization, which were expected to flow from the Uruguay Round
Agreement for all signatories, have often been eliminated by
raising new issues in the name of core labor standards,
environmental protection and even human rights.

<HEADLINE> India Formulates New Reforms on Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has recommended alliances and joint ventures between private
and public sector banks to improve the profitability as well as
accountability of the latter, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank in its latest report on "Trend and Progress of
Banking in India" has sought such operational freedom as part of
the second phase of banking sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Strategic alliances and cooperation would give banks a
competitive edge over other banks and financial intermediaries,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Public sector banks will have to acquire more expertise in
pricing of various risks to enable themselves to manage and modify
such exposures, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This can be done through greater managerial and operational
autonomy in strategic alliances with private sector banks, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, cautioned against overlapping of services
offered by banks, financial institutions and non-banking financial
companies which could lead to asset-liability mismatches.

<HEADLINE> Minority Staff in U.S. Senate Get Less Pay Than White </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Minority staff members in
the U.S. Senate get less pay than their white counterparts, said a
congressional study released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The average pay for black staff members dropped in 1997 -- 76
cents for every dollar earned by their white counterparts,
compared with 83 cents per every dollar in 1993, a report by the
Congressional Management Foundation, a nonpartisan group funded by
corporations, said.
</P>
<P>
The average pay for Hispanic staff workers increased this year,
but was still considerably lower than white members. Hispanics
earned 85 cents for every dollar in 1997, compared with 75 cents
per dollar in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Asians and Native Americans, who were grouped collectively in
the report, made up less than 2.8 percent of minority staff
members who worked in the Senate. They made 93 cents for every
dollar earned by white workers.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the pay disparity to an overrepresentation
of minorities in lower paying jobs and an underrepresentation in
positions that were paid more.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minorities comprise 13.6 percent of Senate staff, but
they hold only 4.6 percent of the five top-paying positions in
Senate personal offices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasized that the salary disparities do not
reflect a different pay scale for employees who have similar
experiences and qualifications -- even if they are of different
races.

DHAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has call on political parties to extend full cooperation in
implementing the peace accord to end the decades-old insurgency in
the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the call while exchanging views with
newsmen at her official residence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
She asserted that the implementation of the agreement would
ensure human rights and establish "unity in diversity" in the
trouble-torn CHT region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed on December 2 between the government and
the tribal leaders has been hailed by the international community
including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom,
France, the Netherlands and Pakistan, she told newsmen.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her government's appreciation for the support
extended within and outside the country, she believed that the
peace agreement had not only enhanced the country's image but also
paved the road to national development through peace and harmony.
</P>
<P>
She called upon the opposition to shun the false and baseless
propaganda aimed at misleading the people.
</P>
<P>
She observed that only arms smugglers and the vested interest
group opposed peace in three hill districts that constituted one
tenth of the country's total area.
</P>
<P>

president after it was signed, she said, adding that her
government wants discussion on the peace agreement in parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
The ASEAN economic ministers meeting succeeded in moving the
ASEAN process of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Other notable events in the year for ASEAN included the haze
which resulted from forest fires in Sumatera and Kalimantan in
Indonesia and blanketed parts of the region including Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei for the last few months, affecting tourism
and other economic activities in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Of course, all the ASEAN countries are now completely free from
the haze and the ASEAN National Tourism Organizations have
launched a series of post-haze initiatives to stimulate tourist
arrivals to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Facing the currency and environmental problems, all the ASEAN
members realized more clearly the importance of closer cooperation
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
The members practiced the concept of "constructive engagement"
even though they adhere to the policy of non-interference in each
other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi pointed
out, close cooperation among the ASEAN countries does not permit
them to isolate themselves or ignore each other's problems.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that in tackling regional issues, there has been a
tendency among the ASEAN members to help each other, showing the
grouping's unity.
</P>
<P>
To help Indonesia overcome its economic difficulties, Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei pledged financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the regional haze, Malaysia sent more than 1,000
firefighters to Indonesia to help put out the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Local economists and analysts said the recent setbacks must be
viewed as temporary and transient, given the general resilience of
the ASEAN region.
</P>
<P>
As Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad put it, ASEAN has
emerged as one of the most cohesive regional groupings in the
world.

<P>
More Importantly, the speculative attacks on the region's
currencies have shown individual ASEAN countries that they cannot
isolate themselves from their neighbors, illustrating the
increased economic interdependence in the region and the mutual
interest in maintaining financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the region's currency crisis prompted ASEAN to
decide to speed up economic cooperation, a necessity in the era of
globalization, by increasing regional trade and investment through
the realization of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by the year 2003
as scheduled or earlier.
</P>
<P>
At the 11th AFTA council meeting held here on October 15, ASEAN
economic ministers agreed that the recent currency fluctuations in
the region have made the implementation of the AFTA an even more
important ASEAN economic cooperation activity.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing progress in the implementation of the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT), the main operating mechanism
for AFTA, the ASEAN economic ministers agreed to speed up the
schedule and tariffs cuts for the AFTA.
</P>
<P>
Work on the proposed ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) which seeks to
promote ASEAN as a "single investment region" is also progressing
well.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers shared the view that the implementation
of AFTA would facilitate long-term adjustments of their economies
to enhance ASEAN's resilience towards external volatility, and
they further expressed optimism on the long-term economic
prospects of the region as well as its attractiveness to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the achievement of the AFTA, they endorsed at
their 29th annual meeting here on October 16-17 several agreements
for liberalizing trade.
</P>
<P>
They approved the protocol on the Notification Procedure (NP),
expected to be signed early next year, which requires member
countries to inform each other at least 60 days in advance of any
modifications in their AFTA commitments, which might impair or
nullify any benefit of the CEPT scheme to members.
</P>
<P>
The economic ministers also endorsed the first package of
offers under the Framework Agreement on Services covering mainly
tourism, maritime and air transport services, which is scheduled
to be implemented simultaneously by all ASEAN members.

<P>
The financial turmoil caused the currencies of these countries
to fall between 10 and 50 percent against the U.S. dollar and
their stock markets to plunge into new lows since July.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has brought about inflationary pressures and a
potential slowdown in the region. In Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand, inflation in the second half of this
year was estimated to move higher, offsetting gains that each of
these economies made in reducing inflation in the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently released report "ASEAN Macroeconomic
Outlook 1997-1998" by ASEAN Secretariat, the prolonged turmoil in
the region's currency markets can affect economic fundamentals and
the grouping's prospects in the short term and possibly medium
term.
</P>
<P>
To curb currency speculation and manipulation, Malaysia put
forth a proposal that currency trading be regulated, which has
been supported by all ASEAN members and accepted by other
groupings such as G-15 and APEC.
</P>
<P>
On December 1-2, ASEAN finance ministers and their counterparts
from China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the United States and
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China met here to
especially address the current economic situation in the region
and exchange views on the causes and extent of the currency crisis
and policy responses needed to restore stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the financial crisis, they focused on three key
issues -- the importance of enhancing transparency in currency
trading, the need for developing prudential and disclosure
standards in the financial markets and recent initiatives towards
the establishment of a regional surveillance and financing
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
On December 1, the ASEAN finance ministers also agreed to form
a regional surveillance mechanism within ASEAN as a preventive
effort to avoid the emergence of risks that would precipitate a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in the region on one hand has hit badly
these economies and on the other hand has also provided ASEAN
members with an opportunity to eliminate inherent weaknesses and
to strengthen the foundation of their economies, with most
affected members currently making adjustments to counter the
effects of the currency and equity market turbulence.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 8 (Xinhua) -- For the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the outgoing year of 1997 is a
year of cooperation with many events worth being recorded in its
history for both sweet and bitter memories.
</P>
<P>
In the year when ASEAN celebrated its 30th anniversary, the
first and foremost sweet memorable event was the expansion of the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
At the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) held in Malaysia in
July, Laos and Myanmar were admitted into the fold of ASEAN which
also groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Myanmar's admission, ASEAN faced with pressure
from certain Western countries. But by making a right decision to
admit Myanmar against the pressure, ASEAN showed its independence
and maturity in dealing with its own regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The expansion put ASEAN, now with a population of 480 million
and gross domestic product of 711 billion U.S. dollars, in a
better position to contribute to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
With Laos and Myanmar in, ASEAN was left with only one step
ahead toward realizing the vision of a united Southeast Asia or
ASEAN-10, that is, to embrace all the countries in the dynamic
region.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's ASEAN membership, together with that of Laos and
Myanmar, was initially okayed by ASEAN foreign ministers at their
first special meeting here on May 31 as a mark to commemorate the
30th anniversary of ASEAN, but it was deferred at the second
special meeting of the foreign ministers on July 10 in the wake of
sudden changes in the situation in that country.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is still making efforts to welcome Cambodia to the family
and most ASEAN leaders pledged that the admission of Cambodia was
just a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the delight of ASEAN in celebrating its 30th
anniversary with an enlarged membership went side by side with the
unexpected bitter experience that some members saw their
currencies depreciated over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Weaknesses in the currencies of some ASEAN economies have been
accompanied by volatility and sharp declines in regional stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
The instability emerged first in early July when Thailand
allowed its baht to have a "managed" float in the wake of
speculative attacks on the currency in mid-May, and then spread to
neighboring economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Singapore, notably all founding members of ASEAN, resulting in
a currency crisis in the region.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Proposed Port to Be South Asia's Cargo Hub: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank (WB) specialist
said that a proposed port at Hambantota, Southern province of Sri
Lanka, could become a major cargo hub in South Asia once
completed, according to the local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Mobarak, a WB official who was in Sri Lanka recently,
was quoted by the reports as saying that the proposed port was a
viable project specially for transshipment, break-bulking and
entrepot services.
</P>
<P>
The cost for the first phase of the project is estimated at 400
million U.S. dollars. The reports said once the first phase is
completed, the port will be able to handle nearly 200 ships daily
for bunkering and other services.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's two major ports, the Colombo and Galle ports, are
overcrowded by ships due to a lack of space, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Hearing on TWA Flight 800 Crash to Open in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A week-long hearing to
explore causes of the TWA Flight 800 accident will open on Monday
in Seattle, where Boeing is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a technological failure in the airplane, the
25-year-old Boeing 747-100, will dominate the hearing sponsored by
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the 30-year
old agency in charge of investigating all civil-aviation accidents
and major accidents involving railroads, ships, hazardous
materials and pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 broke up two and half miles above the Atlantic
Ocean, 13 minutes after it took off from John F. Kennedy
International Airport on July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to representatives from Boeing and TWA, 95
relatives of the 230 crash victims as well as their lawyers will
attend the Seattle hearing. Also present will be representatives
from France, the destination of the flight, and 500 journalists
from about 100 news organizations around the world.
</P>
<P>
Criminal probe at the early stage of the 17 months'
investigation seemed promising. But it ended last month with the
FBI conclusion that for the time being, the explosion was neither
an act of terrorism nor the result of a military mistake.
</P>
<P>
Now a center-wing-tank explosion, ignited by an undermining
spark, seems to be the only remaining clue to solving the mystery.
</P>
<P>
How a spark could have been produced inside the tank, which was
designed by Boeing to keep out flame, is now the kernel of the
issue. The Seattle Times quoted a top NTSB official as saying that
there are so far neither surprises nor any key piece of evidence
which could well account for a cause.
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing families of the crash victims has
contended that the three pumps on the rear spar of the 747's
center wing tank were vulnerable to malfunctions that could cause
fire, explosion or electrical arcing.
</P>
<P>
But the NTAB has virtually ruled out the pump as a cause for
lack of evidence in the Flight 800 wreckage of fire and tests had
shown that explosions inside the pumps did not lead to a blast
that could penetrate the pump housing and enter the fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
What is left is electricity inside the tanks. The 747's
fuel-quantity indicating system uses low-voltage current and metal
probes to measure fuel. In the event of a short circuit, Boeing
engineers say, the current could not ignite a spark sufficient to
cause fuel vapors. But if high-voltage current was somehow
introduced into the low-energy fuel-system circuit, a spark
sufficient to ignite the fumes was likely to occur.
</P>
<P>
Thus, how high-energy current could find its way into the tank
seems to be NTSB's current focus of investigation. But Boeing said
laboratory testing against the hypothesis has failed to prove it
as a realistic cause of the accident, and more tests remain to be
done.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 100 suits have been filed against Boeing. A
lawyer for a victim's family said an explosive situation did exist
and that was a good product-liability case against Boeing.

<HEADLINE> Asian Retreat From U.S. Financial Industry Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Analysts have
predicted a major Asian retreat from the U.S. financial industry
after Japan's Sumitomo Bank Ltd. said it was seeking to sell its
California Banks.
</P>
<P>
Asian Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Sumitomo Bank
has commissioned U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs &AMP; Amp Co. to
find a buyer for its California unit, Sumitomo Bank of
California. It also said Goldman has approached several California
banks to see whether they were interested in an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo's action is just the beginning, said Kelvin Lee, a
director at the accounting and consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
"Once you see Sumitomo find a buyer and if the price is
reasonable, you may see other people follow suit."
</P>
<P>
Hobbled by the crisis at home and burdened with hundreds of
billions of dollars in soured loans, Asian banks, such as
Sumitomo, are looking for ways to support their financial health,
analysts said, adding that one of the ways is shedding some or all
of their U.S. operations.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big reversal of strategy," said analyst Ricardo
Kleinbaum of Paine Webber in New York. He was referring to the
fact that the Asian financial institutions, during the past decade,
briskly expanded into the U.S. banking and real estate markets,
often using California as a beachhead.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank of California, which has 47 branches and 5.2
billion U.S. dollars in assets, makes it the six-largest bank in
the state, according to the California Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had feared that Japanese banks might try to raise
capital by selling their vast holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds,
which could push U.S. interest rates higher. But others said
Sumitomo's action appeared to be an alternative that others might
follow.
</P>
<P>
There is another compelling reason for Sumitomo and the others
to consider selling their U.S. assets -- it is a seller's market
right now. The merger wave engulfing U.S. banking has placed
premium prices on banks that come up for sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Leader Khin Nyunt has
stressed the need to implement low-cost housing projects for the
public and service personnel.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with housing project officials here Sunday, Khin
Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, said every nation needs construction activities according
to its size, pointing out that there should be no over-building
that exceeds the requirement, official daily The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the Myanmar Privatization
Commission and chairman of the Housing Project Committee, spoke of
taking lessons of construction entrepreneurs who suffered loss in
some countries due to lack of systematic project appraisals.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has drawn up new housing projects in the capital of
Yangon to move more residents from huts to apartment buildings due
to considerable population growth in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The population in the capital has exceeded 5 million living in
35 townships, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more residents have been relocated to
several new towns near Yangon as old huts and buildings have been
demolished or reconstructed to give the capital a more urban look.

<HEADLINE> 5 Phones for Every 100 People in Sri Lanka by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is aiming to achieve
a target of 5 telephones per 100 people by the year 2000, the
local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, every 100 people have only 1.4 telephones today,
the reports quoted the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned SLT now has 270,500 lines in service. The
company predicts that there will be 700,000 people on the
telephone waiting list by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The SLT believes it will be able to support around 500,000
telephone customers once the ongoing Wireless Local Loop (WLL)
projects are completed.
</P>
<P>
If Sri Lanka is to achieve the target of 5 telephones for every
100 people, another 300,000 lines should be provided, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
Sources in telecommunications circles said that in addition to
the investment already made, Sri Lanka needs about 500 million
U.S. dollars to fulfill the target.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the pace, the country is exploring ways
for private companies to participate in telecommunications
infrastructure development endeavors.

BELGRADE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Electorate in the Republic of
Serbia began to vote today to elect a new president of the
republic to replace Slebodan Milosevic, who became federal
president of Yugoslavia in July.
</P>
<P>
The three main candidates are Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic, representing President Milosevic's ruling Socialist
Party (SPS), Radical Party (SRS) leader Vejislev Seselj and Vuk
Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement.
</P>
<P>
The poll today follows the elections in October which failed
when none of the candidates got more than half of the votes.
</P>
<P>
In October, Seselj, a hardline nationalist, won the biggest
share of the vote in a run-off against Socialist candidate Zoren
Lilic.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll in November by Ipress said 36 percent of the
electorate would be given to Milutinovic, 34 percent for Seselj
and 15 percent for Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
There is a saying here that the election today might also be
invalidated because of voter apathy and a low-key campaign.
</P>
<P>
If no one of the three candidates gets an overall majority in
today's re-run, a run-off between the top two candidates will be
held, probably on December 21.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Party Wants Polls to Be Postponed in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tamil United Liberation
Front (TULF) urged the government to postpone the local government
elections in the north on the ground that the current situation in
the region does not ensure a free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
The local press said here today that the party urged the
government not to hold elections in Velanai, Kayts and Delft in
the north, which are controlled by an armed group that is
interested in contesting the polls.
</P>
<P>
The TULF, Sri Lanka's biggest Tamil party that holds five
parliament seats, also pointed out that displaced persons,
particularly the Muslims, have not been able to resettle in their
hometowns. Besides, people within the Jaffna district cannot move
freely due to various restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The party urged all parties in the north, which have armed
groups, to be disarmed prior to the elections.
</P>
<P>
Many other Tamil parties have also expressed their reservations
on the coming polls.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for general elections to municipal, urban and
village councils in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts in the north
are to be received from December 16 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka held its local elections in all but Northern province
and parts of Eastern province in March this year. The polls had
been scheduled for 1995 but were postponed twice for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-long civil war is going on between government troops
and the Tamil rebels in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nominations were called at a time when troops of Operation
Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) are advancing further north through
rebel-held territories in their final phase of offensives.

<HEADLINE> Fifty Billion Roubles to Help Air Crash Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to allocate
50 billion roubles (about 8.62 million U.S. dollars) to help the
suffering residents in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, where a plane
crash took place on Saturday, killing more than 47 people.
</P>
<P>
A governmental decree made by Prime Minister Vikto
Chernomyridin, who arrived in Irkutsk to head the investigation of
the crash, said the money will be used mainly by the sufferers to
rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin said in a statement, "I
expected the government to carry out a prompt investigation of the
causes of the tragedy and find those responsible."
</P>
<P>
The crash took place at about 2 p.m. local time Saturday, when
an Antonov-124, a huge Russian military cargo jet, plunged to the
ground seconds after taking off, plowing into four apartment
buildings, an orphanage and a school.
</P>
<P>
The victims included 23 people aboard the plane, two orphans in
the orphanage and 22 local residents. The death toll is reportedly
expected to rise as the rescue work goes on.
</P>
<P>
About 450 people have been evacuated from the area and the
rescue workers were continuing to search the debris and nearby
homes, 23 people were reportedly missing up to now.
</P>
<P>
Irkutsk experienced a crash in 1994 when all 125 people on
board a Russian Tupolev-154 plane were killed.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Establish Edible Oil Industrial Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An edible oil industrial zone
will be established near the newly-developed Thilawa Port in the
capital of Yangon, according to today's official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The edible oil industrial zone, to be jointly implemented by
the Myanmar Industrial Manufacturing Co Ltd and the Myanmar Edible
Oil Dealers Association, will be set up on a plot of 121.5
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar laid down a plan in 1995 to ensure self-sufficiency in
edible oil within three years. However, the plan has not been
fully realized.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the edible oil industrial zone is expected
to realize the aim.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar consumes about 300,000 tons of edible oil on an annual
basis, of which some 200,000 tons is produced at home and the rest
has to be imported.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the country imported 65.25
million U.S. dollars worth of edible vegetable oil and other
hydrogenated oils in the 1996-97 fiscal year which ended in March.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Publishing of National Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China has drafted a set of
rules on improving official administration and coping with the
problem of greater piracy in the publication or duplication of
national standards.
</P>
<P>
The rules stipulate that the Standards Press of China has the
exclusive right to publish national standards. Departments under
the State Council and local governments in charge of drafting
sector and local standards are authorized to designate publishing
houses that should be responsible for the publication of relevant
sector and local standards.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS), which
monitors drafting and use of standards in China, has teamed up
with the State Press and Publication Administration to work out
the rules, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The rules stipulate that the Standards Press of China is the
only publishing house entitled to publish and issue formal
international documents including ISO/IEC (International Standards
Organization/International Electrotechnical Commission) standards
and technical reports, translated or recognized by the SBTS as
authorized by ISO/IEC.
</P>
<P>
Any unit or individual wishing to issue standards for
profit-making motives will have to obtain written agreement in
advance from publishing houses with exclusive publication rights
before reproducing any part of the standard in any form.
</P>
<P>
Publishing houses which plan the publication of collections of
standards are also required to obtain written agreements in
advance from publishing houses with exclusive rights.
</P>
<P>
Any publication activities without official approval will be
punished. Those infringing the legal rights of standards
publishing houses will have civil responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The SBTS statistics showed that China has issued 17,720
national standards, 22,000 sector standards, and 8,000 local
standards by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"China is protecting the intellectual property rights of
international standards in line with international agreements,"
said an SBTS official.

<HEADLINE> Psychological Education Expands in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- In China, teachers and parents
used to think that a good, healthy student simply means a strong
body and high scores in exams. The times are changing.
</P>
<P>
More and more college students today have come to realise that
healthy emotions and personalities are important for their lives
and studies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from academic subjects, college students are showing an
increasing interest in moral and psychological education,
according to the National Psychological Counselling Committee for
College Students, a non-government organization focusing on
promoting psychological education among college and universities
in China.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of the country's 1,032 colleges and
universities have set up psychological counselling centers.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Education Commission (SEC), moral
education has long been taught in primary and middle schools, and
colleges and universities in China.
</P>
<P>
And 70 percent of colleges and universities in Beijing and
Shanghai and all those in Dalian have opened psychological
counselling services to students.
</P>
<P>
However, in other areas, such as northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, no school has yet introduced
psychological education.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Hong Kong Is My Home (by Tao Wenge) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Sinclair, a New
Zealand-born freelance journalist, was wild with joy when he
received his permanent identity card (ID card) of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China on November 18.
</P>
<P>
"I have waited for it for 30 years and now I am a Hong Konger,
not a foreigner," said Sinclair, 55, who came to Hong Kong in 1968
with a dream to seek a new and better life after working for 10
years in New Zealand, Australia and Southeast Asia for the press.
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I could never get permanent residence of Hong Kong
before, because neither of us are British," said Sinclair in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua at his home office with furniture
of ancient Chinese style and Chinese paintings and collections.
</P>
<P>
"So, to me, that is a big change for the better after the
Chinese government resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July
1," Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
"But in most ways, life has not changed. Everything works the
way it worked before, transport, shopping, education," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair began his career in Wellington, New Zealand, as a copy
boy and promoted to a cadet reporter, a junior reporter, a
reporter and a chief reporter in the following years.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, Sinclair continued his career as a journalist and
four years later became a columnist for South China Morning Post,
one of the major English newspapers in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, he has worked as a freelance journalist. Everyday
he spends long hours working at his computer, and every week he
gets his articles printed in local English newspapers and overseas
publications.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair writes for the Asia Magazine, the largest English
circulation in Asia, the Sunday Express in London, Business Travel
International and other newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
He has published 12 books on Hong Kong and China, which include
"Asia's Finest," "A History of the Royal Hong Kong Police," "The
Yellow River: a 5,000 year journey through China" and "Over China:
geographical overview of the nation."
</P>
<P>
His articles are mainly about the current affairs of Hong Kong
and China as a whole. Asked which of his articles he likes most,
Sinclair said he doesn't know but he is keen to tell the truth of
Hong Kong and China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair and his wife, Kit Allred, a professor at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University, have been visiting China's mainland provinces
regularly.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future, Sinclair said the social outlook for
Hong Kong is good because SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and
his colleagues are determined to make life better for the average
people.
</P>
<P>
"We have a marvelous team in our government and civil service,
all of them are dedicated to making sure Hong Kong remains a
wonderful place to live in," Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
"The stress on a better housing policy is something that our
society needs. We also need to remain an international city and
here is one area that I do not think Tung has done enough to
express himself," Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's social development depends solely on its sound and
strong economic development, as it always has, he said. "I think
Tung knows this," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not have a good economy, we can not have social
improvements. What's good for the average person is good for our
community," Sinclair continued.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent financial turmoil in Asia and the stock
market volatility in Hong Kong, Sinclair said that he feels that
Tung and Donald Tsang, the secretary for finance, have done a very
good job in controlling forces which are mostly out of their
control.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong alone can not stop international markets from falling
and if Tokyo and Wall Street and other markets fall, then so will
the Hong Kong market. That is inevitable, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
But the determination and efficiency with which they have shown
they will keep the peg with the U.S. dollar has been very
effective in stopping Hong Kong's economy from suffering more.
</P>
<P>
"I think they have done a very good job so far. Let's hope this
can continue," Sinclair said. "Naturally, as a Hong Konger, I
support what they are doing," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I love Hong Kong because this is my home. It's the best place
to live in. I don't think someday Hong Kong might become a place
where I can not live comfortably. Hong Kong gets a wonderful
future for me and my family," Sinclair said.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Democrats Lose Ruling Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian Democratic Party,
though leading in the National Assembly election of the Republic
of Srpska November 22 to 23, has lost its ruling party position.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Rodzer Brajant, the European
Security and Cooperation Organization representative to Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Brajant said the Democrat Party pulled 24 out of the 83 seats
in the assembly. It was followed by the Bosnian League for
Integrity and Democracy with 16 seats; the Srpski Narodnisavez,
founded by President Biljana Plavsic in late August, and the
Serbian Radical Party, with 15 seats each; the Serbian Socialist
Party with 9 seats; and the Serbian Independent Socialist
Democratic Party and the Socialist Democratic Party with two seats
each.
</P>
<P>
Observants here say, despite its victory, the current election
has cost the Democratic Party its ruling position and thus ended
its dominance in the assembly. However, they believe the election
result was not likely to overcome the present political crisis in
view of the fact that the Bosnian Serb Republic has actually been
separated into two regimes in the east and west.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Peace Remains Distant Dream in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 is approaching
its end, yet for the war-weary Afghans peace remains a distant
dream.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan civil war, which has been protracted for nearly 18
years, is in no way dying out as rigid warring factions are
reluctant to bury their hatchets.
</P>
<P>
The lingering conflict has witnessed perhaps the most dramatic
changes on the war front this year as the Islamic Taliban militia
and rival northern alliance were engaged in the see-saw fighting
time and again.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who control about two-thirds of the Afghan
territory and the capital of Kabul, remain the dominant force in
the country though they have failed in several attempts to seize
northern Afghanistan controlled by the northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, based in Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300
km north of Kabul, is composed of forces led by Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum, former Afghan military chief Ahmad Masood and the
Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had been locked in a stalemate for about 5 months
since January when the Taliban pushed in a blitz the northern
alliance forces from 20 km north of Kabul to 150 km.
</P>
<P>
The situation took a dramatic turn in mid-May when Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik, Dostum's right-hand man, suddenly mutinied
against him and sided with the Taliban, enabling the hard-line
militia to make a breakthrough in the opposition-held north.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by their landmark victory, the Taliban, who vowed to
impose a strict Islamic rule in Afghanistan, entered on May 25
Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan's second largest city, and even
claimed they would complete "in days" their three-year campaign to
take over the whole country.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, however, Malik unexpectedly broke rank with
the Taliban and rejoined the northern alliance, forcing the
Taliban to retreat from the newly-captured northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Malik's about-face led to the Taliban's worst defeat after
their rise from southern Afghanistan in 1994. It also provided an
opportunity for Masood, who had been biding his time in Panjshir
valley, about 150 km north of Kabul, to launch a strong offensive
against the Taliban in early July.
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks, Masood's forces advanced to within 20
km north of Kabul, putting the city within the striking range of
Masood's rockets. So far the Taliban have failed to force Masood's
men to retreat.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world may have given up Afghanistan as a hopeless case but
peace in Afghanistan is vital for the survival of its people and
for the economic progress and political stability of the entire
region.
</P>
<P>
As the Afghan war continued to rage, the United Nations has
never stopped its efforts this year to bring rapprochement among
the warring factions but has failed to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Norber Holl attributed this
failure to "internal and external factors which were not ready for
peace in the country."
</P>
<P>
"The internal factor is that there was not sufficient sense of
compromise among all Afghan parties and secondly the country with
influence has not yet in the past seriously discussed with the
U.N. the way to get out of the Afghanistan dilemma," Holl said in
a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The German diplomat, who resigned from his U.N. post recently,
said the U.N. has been focusing its attention on mediating between
the Afghans during the past five years, but the lack of comprise
among all Afghan parties has rendered this method fruitless.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the U.N. is considering changing its
strategy in brokering peace in Afghanistan by shifting the focus
from the Afghan warring factions to the regional countries with
influence upon the country.
</P>
<P>
The developments of the Afghan situation this year once again
proved that the country's lingering conflict could not be solved
militarily.
</P>
<P>
It is evident that Afghanistan, a country composed of
multi-ethnic groups, cannot function smoothly under the complete
domination of one particular group even though it might be
militarily the strongest.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that given the deep divisions among the
Afghan warring factions on political, ethnic, ideological and
tribal lines, permanent peace, which has eluded Afghanistan for a
long period, will not return to the country in the absence of a
broad-based government representing interests of all the groups.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Romario and Bebeto both
scored in the first half to lead world champion Brazil to a 2-1
win over South Africa in an exhibition soccer match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have qualified for the 1998 France World Cup finals
but the hosts was no match for Brazil's quickness and
ball-handling wizardry.
</P>
<P>
The South Africans had few serious scoring chances but they
really caught one on a 78th minute goal from substitute Helman
Mkhalele to cut the gab at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
South Africa qualified for the World Cup finals for the first
time since it returned to international soccer in 1992 after being
banned two decades because of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Despite a strong record in Africa, including its African
Nations Cup triumph in 1995, South Africa has yet to defeat a
legitimate European or South American power in the past two years,
including two losses to Brazil and defeats by England, France,
Germany and the Netherlands.

LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Nursing in Britain is currently
the most dangerous profession, with 34 percent of nurses having
been attacked while doing their jobs, five times more likely than
the average worker to be the victims of such violence.
</P>
<P>
Citing a latest research by the Health and Safety Executive,
local press reports today said that security and protective
services workers, including police officers and doormen, are less
vulnerable, with 25 percent of workers being attacked.
</P>
<P>
Then come social and care workers, with 21 percent, and
teachers and other education staff, with 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the possibility of being threatened with violence is
now commonplace in many workplaces in the country. Once again,
nurses are most at risk, with 48 percent saying they have been
threatened.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Cyprus' Accession Talks With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said here today that Turkey firmly opposes the upcoming
accession talks between the Cypriot government and the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot-dominated government has no right to seek EU
membership on behalf of the whole island, Yilmaz said in a meeting
with a Turkish Cypriot delegation, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Turkish Cypriot community should also be
represented in the delegation for the negotiations as an equal
partner.
</P>
<P>
"No other formula could make Turkish Cypriots attend the
upcoming negotiations," he was quoted by the news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an eastern Mediterranean island, submitted in 1990 its
application for full membership to the European Union, which has
decided to start the negotiations early next year.
</P>
<P>
EU's decision angered the Turkish Cypriots as well as Turkey
which also has applied for EU membership, but excluded in the
process of enlargement of the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Turkish Cypriots signed in August an agreement on
partial integration in protest against EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said that Turkey has made its position clear in various
contacts with EU leaders, adding that it is the EU that should
make a wise decision now.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
on the island and took over the northern third following an
abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Islamic World Awakened: Iranian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi stated today that the forthcoming Islamic summit will
tell the enemies that the Islamic world is awakened.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Kharrazi said the Islamic
world is keeping pace with global changes and will play an
important role in the future world.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) to
be held here December 9-11 will also help improve mutual
understanding, unity and cooperation among the Islamic countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following the conclusion of the OIC foreign
ministers' meeting which endorsed more than 140 draft resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that in order to brush up the OIC functions,
a group comprising OIC previous, present and future presidents
will look into the OIC structural and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official dismissed the claims that Iran has not
taken concrete steps to improve its relations with the Arab
world, saying that Iran always tries to remove misunderstandings
and expand friendly relations with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
In the context of the latest development in the region,
particularly the deadlock of the Middle East peace process,
Kharrazi said, a suitable circumstance has been created for Iran
to promote its relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Iraqi government for releasing two Iranian
nationals recently, saying that Baghdad's decision has indicated
its willingness to improve relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also voiced Iran's readiness to
solve remaining problems between the two neighbors, particularly
the issue of prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated that Tehran opposed recognition of the
Israeli identity and the establishment of ties between some
Islamic countries and the Jewish state, adding that Iran would
not establish any ties with Israel due to its aggressive nature.

<HEADLINE> Lower Alcohol Limit Won't Cut Road Death: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A New study suggested that a
lower alcohol limit will have no long-term effect on road accident
rates, which is at odds with British government plans to introduce
tougher drink-driving laws, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the UK government is planning to reduce
the permitted alcohol limit from 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100
milliliters of blood to 50 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
However, the study by the British Institute of Traffic
Education Research said that the main problem lies with heavier
drinkers who habitually break existing limits and thus a 50 mg
limit offers little help.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that there are 1.5 road deaths for every
10,000 vehicles in Britain, compared with three per 10,000
vehicles in France, which has a 50 mg limit. In the Netherlands,
where the limit is 22 mg, there are 1.8 deaths per 10,000
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The study, which is funded by several drinks companies,
proposed instead measures such as devices to disable cars if the
driver is over the limit and also harsher sentences alongside
rehabilitation programs.

<HEADLINE> Progress in Guerrilla-Israeli Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic resistance force in
South Lebanon Hezbollah today called for more progress in
negotiations with Israelis for exchange the remains of an Israeli
soldier for Lebanese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in the negotiations, but the
developments are "not enough," Secretary General Sheikh Hassan
Nasrallah of the Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in an interview
with the radio Voice of People, a mouthpiece of the Lebanese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out possibility to hold more talks in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah is negotiating with Israel, under the auspices of
the International Committee of the Red Cross, for exchanging the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in a raid in south Lebanon
last September for Lebanese prisoners held in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The two sides currently have been bargaining how many Lebanese
prisoners should be freed. At the next stage, they would determine
who should be released.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in South Lebanon to oust
Israeli troops from the 1,100-square-kilometer security which was
set up by Israel in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks.
