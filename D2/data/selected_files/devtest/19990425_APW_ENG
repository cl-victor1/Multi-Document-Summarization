	Yugoslav Industrial Sites Targeted  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Five NATO missiles hit a chemical  
plant 60 miles south of the Yugoslav capital earlier today, 
according to local news. It was the fourth attack on the largest 
factory in the town of Lucani. No details about casualties or 
damage were immediately available. Seeking strategies to stop oil 
imports from reaching Yugoslavia, NATO officials are considering 
bombing pipelines and possibly searching ships heading into 
Montenegro, the republic that along with Serbia forms Yugoslavia.

	NATO Wraps Up Anniversary Meeting  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 19-member North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization concludes a three-day meeting today marking the 50th 
anniversary of a powerful military alliance committed to a 
one-for-all, all-for-one common defense. Leaders of the alliance 
nations originally envisioned the summit as a gala celebration, but 
NATO's continuing air war against Yugoslavia and the crisis in 
Kosovo have dominated the gathering.

	Diary of Suspected Shooter Released  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A handwritten diary written by one of  
the gunmen in the Columbine High School shooting spree shows the 
pair had been planning the attack for a year. Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone said the diary uses German phrases and that the 
assailants' reasoning behind the rampage was: ``We want to be 
different, we want to be strange and we don't want jocks or other 
people putting (us) down. ... We're going to punish you.'' Twelve 
students, one teacher and the two gunmen were killed in the 
murder-suicide massacre.

	PC Users Warned of New Virus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive  
and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection. The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its 
most common version was programmed to activate on computers using 
Windows 95 and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the 
nuclear disaster in Ukraine. But warnings from many experts lacked 
any sense of panic or impending doom because the virus was 
discovered last summer, giving antivirus companies time to develop 
free software updates to identify and destroy it.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A car bomb has exploded in a busy street in east  
London, injuring seven people. The bomb exploded yesterday 
afternoon in Brick Lane, the center of one of the city's biggest 
Bangladeshi communities and the site of a popular Saturday market. 
Two hours after the blast, police said they received a call from 
someone claiming to be from an extreme right-wing group, Combat 18, 
saying the organization carried out the bombing.

	Jews Said To Have Settled West Bank  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Jewish settlers have established a new enclave  
in the West Bank, despite U.S. protests that Israel's recent drive 
to expand its presence in the territory damages the peace process 
with the Palestinians, a watchdog group said yesterday. The Peace 
Now group said settlers moved Friday into a structure set up on a 
hill located several hundred yards from the West Bank settlement of 
Maaleh Levona, about 10 miles north of the Palestinian city of 
Ramallah. Relations between Israel and the United States have 
become increasingly strained over the issue of settlements.

<P>
	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve  
Forbes has urged conservative activists to lay the groundwork for 
banning abortions by turning public opinion against the procedure. 
Forbes favors a constitutional ``human life'' amendment to outlaw 
abortions. Forbes was the second of five GOP White House hopefuls 
to address the conservative CRA, which will endorse a candidate in 
November and by doing so mobilize thousands of its activists.

<HEADLINE> Hero Teacher Taught Life's Lessons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In the gym and classrooms at Columbine  
High School, William ``Dave'' Sanders sandwiched life's lessons 
between pointers on jump shots and tips on reading a stock table. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire and explosions echoed through Columbine's cafeteria  
Tuesday, Sanders was there for his kids. He leapt onto tables, 
frantically waving and shouting for them to get out. He raced 
through the halls, herding students to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sanders was shot twice in the chest and staggered into a  
classroom, the students he loved so much were there for him. They 
tore off their T-shirts and pressed them to his wounds. They 
covered him with blankets and told him how much he meant to them. 
They tenderly showed him the pictures from his wallet, of his wife 
and daughters. They tried to give him hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make it,'' Sanders told them. ``Tell my girls  
I love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sanders' students will be there again for him --  
mourning him at his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids were a lot of why he did what he did,'' said his nephew  
Rich Jarman. ``He really made it a point to know all of his 
students on a first-name basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 47, was an unassuming guy with an easy smile, a  
teacher-coach who taught old-fashioned values. He urged students to 
look for the best in every situation, to strive to do their best 
and be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would spend time with kids and talk with, stuff like  
that,'' said Adam Oliver, a 17-year-old junior. ``There was little 
that upset him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Oct. 22, 1951, in Eldorado, Ill., Sanders was raised in  
Veedersburg, about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In high 
school, the 6-foot-1 Sanders played basketball and baseball and ran 
cross country. He got his college degree from Chadron State in 
Nebraska in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a former coach, Sanders landed his first -- and  
only -- teaching job at Columbine, where he taught business and 
substituted in the science department. He also coached girls' 
basketball, girls' softball and track for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned the respect and praise of co-workers and competitors.  
His main asset, they said, was that he lacked an ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't out for glory,'' said Arvada girls' basketball coach  
Joe Poisson. ``His team played really tough defense, and you'd have 
to play your best to win against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Martin, who coached with Sanders at Columbine for 22 years,  
said Sanders ``was more concerned with the student athlete and what 
they got out of games than he was with winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Sanders coached his girls' basketball team through  
its first winning season in several years. Even-tempered as always, 
Sanders sat on the bench for most of what turned out to be his 
final game. ``He was making all the right moves,'' Martin said, but 
the team lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first love was his family: wife Linda, daughters,  
Angela, Cindy and Coni, and 10 grandchildren. He organized an 
annual reunion and frequent gatherings, which typically included a 
softball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Easter, he hid brightly decorated eggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``He always had a separate egg hunt and things set aside for the  
grandchildren, basically centering the whole day around them,'' 
nephew Jarman said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Mortally wounded, Sanders stumbled into a second-floor classroom  
where Eagle Scourt Aaron Hancey and two dozen other students were 
hiding. They barricaded the door and heard the gunmen running down 
the hall, still firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancey and another student used their T-shirts to try to stop  
the blood gushing from Sanders' chest. In the background, a 
classroom television broadcast the unfolding events. 
</P>
<P>
	They stayed with him for 3 1/2 hours, until about 3 p.m., when SWAT  
team members forced them to evacuate and leave Sanders behind. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time help arrived, Sanders was dead, said Dr. Christopher  
Colwell, who supervised the paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if paramedics had reached Sanders earlier, Colwell said, it  
likely would not have made a difference because of the severity of 
the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of miscommunication, Sanders' family didn't learn with  
certainty for another 24 hours that he had died, Jarman said. 
</P>
<P>
	His family had little doubt about what Sanders would have done  
had he and the gunmen survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably would be the first down there, offering assistance  
to turn their lives around,'' Jarman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Guard Young and Cortney Bramwell are doing  
all they can to make sure Brigham Young's gymnastics program goes 
out with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	Young won the vault and Bramwell won the rings Saturday night as  
the NCAA men's gymnastics championships concluded with individual 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Bramwell were BYU's first individual champions since  
1975, and their titles came just three weeks after they learned the 
school will discontinue its program after next season. Both will be 
seniors next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty frustrating,'' Bramwell said. ``BYU is doing  
better as a program than it has ever done, and now we're being 
dropped. It's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bramwell scored a 9.925 to finish the season unbeaten in rings.  
Young, whose father Wayne won the 1974 NCAA all-around title, 
scored 9.8125 in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's Todd Bishop, the 1999 Nissen Award winner as the  
nation's top senior gymnast, won his second straight high bar title 
with a 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been disappointed if I hadn't won again,'' Bishop  
said. ``It comes with the territory, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan sophomore Justin Toman, who on Friday night led the  
Wolverines to their first team title since 1970, won the parallel 
bars with a 9.8375. Toman also finished fifth on the pommel horse 
and third on the high bar.

<HEADLINE> Refugees: Serbs Seek Women To Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- City by city and village by village,  
Serbs are hunting down young women to rape as they loot, empty and 
burn Kosovo's ethnic Albanian communities, women escaping beyond 
the province's borders say. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors, war crimes investigators and NATO all  
are reporting numerous accounts of rapes in Kosovo -- atrocities 
that Yugoslav and Serb officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
	Witness testimony so far indicates the rapes in Kosovo are  
``neither isolated nor incidental,'' said Patricia Sellers, a U.N. 
war crimes prosecutor at The Hague, Netherlands, whose workers are 
gathering the first accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the police entered the town, that was the first question  
they asked: 'Are there any women here?''' said Valbona Rrustemi, 
19, of the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	Rrustemi fled Urosevac with her family April 16, the day after  
two girls came running through her family's garden, saying Serb 
police were after them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, police knocked at the family's door, asking if  
there were any young women, she said. Her father said no while she 
hid, Rrustemi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Word later reached her of four Urosevac women who had been  
caught by the Serbs that day, she said. They included a friend who 
was raped in the street, Rrustemi said. She named the friend and 
gave her age, 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's cousins had confirmed the attack, Rrustemi said. No  
one has heard of the woman or her immediate family since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened to them. I hoped they escaped,''  
said Rrustemi, one of several women at the Brazda refugee camp to 
give accounts of rapes in Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, also citing refugee accounts, contends there have been  
several instances of mass rapes, well-organized on at least a local 
level: 
</P>
<P>
	--At Djakovica, near the Albanian border, Serb soldiers allegedly  
took women from their families and sent them to an army camp where 
they were held for repeated rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Pec, a local Serb commander allegedly held ethnic Albanian  
women at a hotel, organizing a schedule by which his soldiers could 
come to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
	--At an ammunition factory and ferronickel plant at an  
unspecified site in Kosovo, 100 women allegedly were still being 
held as of mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, word that Serbs were separating ethnic Albanians  
into groups of women and men was enough to send families fleeing -- 
making rape a means of emptying communities, as much as massacres, 
arson and looting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent is to not just to intimidate and humiliate the  
actual physical victim but also to somehow intimidate those who are 
standing there either looking at it or hear about it,'' Sellers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations first prosecuted rape as a separate war crime  
after the 1992-95 Bosnian war. In the first case to focus 
exclusively on rape, the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for former 
Yugoslavia sentenced a Bosnian Croat paramilitary chief in December 
to 10 years in prison for failing to stop subordinates' 1993 rape 
of a Bosnian Muslim woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in Bosnia were widely accused of using rape as a  
means of ``ethnic cleansing.'' Sellers said it was too early to 
tell if rapes in Kosovo were as widespread as in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees from Kosovo say the targeting of women continued even  
as their convoys were being escorted out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, Serbs looking for women stopped vehicles of  
residents from the area of the southern city of Gnjilane en route 
to the border, but the convoy's Serb escorts protected the women, 
villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the accounts of Serbs seeking out women to rape come  
from people who escaped rather than those who were caught. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, reports gathered by the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe number in the dozens, ``and not many 
dozens,'' said Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the head of the 
OSCE's Kosovo mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers predicts the numbers will rise.  
</P>
<P>
	``The incidents are very close right now. We notice that people  
are much more willing to come forward several months ... after 
sexual violence has happened,'' she said. ``Right now, some of 
their priorities might be actual physical survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of rapes are increasing, including reports from  
refugees arriving Sunday in Macedonia that Serb paramilitaries 
raped four girls ages 15-20 before killing them, along with about 
15 other people of their village of Ribar i Vogel, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	War-crimes investigators will also have to cope with the horror  
with which ethnic Albanian culture regards rape. Kosovo Albanians 
said many victims may be too shattered to talk, particularly women 
from villages rather than cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Teuta Beselica, a student forced from Pristina and now living in  
Skopje, Macedonia's capital, was one of many to call rape the worst 
crime imaginable -- a ``disaster'' to Kosovo Albanian families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst thing you can do to an Albanian male,  
basically,'' Beselica said. ``Killing a man or a woman is not half 
as bad. And they know that.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Education Not Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Graphic CYBER EDUCATION    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Fewer students are seeking high-tech  
degrees despite a need for graduates in those fields, a new study 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, being issued by the American Electronics Association  
today, found that high-tech degrees -- including engineering, math, 
physics and computer science -- declined 5 percent between 1990 and 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings from 1997 and 1998 indicate the trend is  
continuing, the AEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are some bright spots in the CyberEducation  
results, the bottom line is that the U.S. educational system is not 
adequately preparing our youth for today's information age 
economy,'' said AEA president William Archey. 
</P>
<P>
	The AEA said elementary and high schools must do more to get  
students ready to tackle a high-tech education. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the decreasing number of high-tech degrees awarded, the study  
found a significant portion went to foreign nationals. At the 
doctorate level where 45 percent of high-tech degrees were granted 
to non-U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the states, California's colleges conferred the most  
high-tech degrees, but it also had one of the greatest declines, 
awarding 1,600 fewer degrees in 1996 than in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide the unemployment rate for high-tech careers is  
extremely low --1.6 percent for engineers and 1.2 percent for math 
and computer scientists last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of trained workers has been a common complaint in the  
high-tech industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists successfully pressed last year for Congress to raise  
dramatically the number of foreigners with high-tech skills who can 
be hired by American companies. Critics argued the industry is 
overlooking qualified domestic workers in its search for cheaper 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new law provides for 142,500 more visas between 1999 and  
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaela Platzer, AEA vice president for research and policy  
analysis, said the industry ``is interested in recruiting the best 
and the brightest wherever they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it's disappointing that students are not choosing  
high-tech educations. But she said their study did point to a few 
hopeful factors. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past two years, more students have been seeking  
computer sciences degrees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the study found U.S. high school students are  
taking more math and science. For example, in recent years the 
percentage of students completing Algebra II and chemistry has 
doubled.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Genes Don't Predict Destiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- While expert Robert Kahn addressed a  
conference on aging, 75-year-old Anthony LaCapra was completing his 
1 1/2-hour workout on a stationary bike and treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn explained that much of what Americans believe about aging  
is either myth or half-truth. LaCapra, who is retired, was 
following a fitness regimen that would make many youthful weekend 
warriors weep. 
</P>
<P>
	After his workout on the bike and treadmill, he uses resistance  
weights for about an hour before turning to the pool for an hour of 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	And LaCapra does this three times each week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better today than I did at 30,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He began going to the gym at the suggestion of his doctor about  
a decade ago. He suffered a massive tear in his rotator cuff while 
working as a warehouseman. His physician said he could recover more 
quickly if he built up his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my ups and downs in earlier years,'' LaCapra said. ``But  
it dawned on me after I retired. Instead of being a couch potato, I 
could keep active and live longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what Kahn, co-author of the book ``Successful  
Aging,'' was telling an audience April 9 at the 14th Annual 
Regional Geriatric Conference. Upstairs, in the Downtown Athletic 
Club, LaCapra was working out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to you, genes are not your destiny,'' said Kahn, a  
psychology and public health professor at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn, 81, says, while many people blame ``getting old'' on fate  
and genetics, staying young is mostly a lifestyle choice. 
</P>
<P>
	While your cellular blueprint does have some influence on how  
well you age, much of that can be counteracted with a lifestyle 
that includes regular exercise and healthy eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying mentally active and maintaining connections to other  
people through family, volunteer work or hobbies is also important. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, studies show that only about one in every five  
elderly people get any regular exercise, Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is sad, because muscle atrophy is not only reversible,  
but avoidable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that years of inactivity and unhealthy living  
can be reversed with consistent exercise in later years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn gives himself as an example. At age 35 he was diagnosed  
with cancer. He recovered but, at age 50, doctors told him he had 
high blood pressure and needed to make some serious lifestyle 
changes. Now, he goes to the gym regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a little embarrassing at first,'' Kahn said. ``I see  
those beautiful young bodies and they see mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He now goes with a group of friends, and they support and cajole  
each other to keep it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, I'm still around to see my grandkids,'' Kahn  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second-highest population of elderly people in the  
country living in Allegheny County, Jerry Duch of the county 
Department of Aging said he sees the daily effects of inactivity in 
older people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are isolated and alone, they don't want to get out in  
western Pennsylvania's hilly terrain and often foul weather. Money 
can also be an issue -- many don't have the extra funds to join a 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger generations can help reverse that trend, he said, by  
doing simple things like visiting with elderly neighbors or 
volunteering to stretch or walk with an inactive older person.

<HEADLINE> 'The Matrix' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The cyberspace adventure ``The Matrix'' was  
No. 1 at the box office during a weekend coming just before the 
release of highly anticipated movies. 
</P>
<P>
	The futuristic Keanu Reeves thriller grossed $12.9 million this  
weekend, after crossing the $100 million mark last week. It 
replaced the prison comedy ``Life,'' which slipped to second place 
with $11.6 million after losing 43 percent of its audience, 
industry estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two comedies that opened in wide release failed to grab a  
sizable audience and may have been rushed to market to avoid 
upcoming blockbusters such as the ``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pushing Tin,'' the John Cusack-Billy Bob Thornton comedy about  
a rivalry between two frantic air traffic controllers, opened with 
$3.6 million for fourth place. ``Lost &AMP; Found,'' featuring David 
Spade as a smarmy dognapper who falls in love with a beautiful 
neighbor, opened in sixth place with $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend is considered a dumping ground for films by the  
industry, their last chance to make something before summer 
releases start coming out,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, a movie analyst 
with Reel Source Inc. ``Once the summer opens all the other films 
just fall like a ton of bricks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bucksbaum said studios have started opening ``summer-style''  
big-budget films in the spring -- including ``Entrapment'' on Friday 
and ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' in May -- to take 
advantage of a time when smaller movies are in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked for ``The Matrix,'' he said. The film about a hacker  
who battles cyber-overlords in a twisting world of virtual reality 
has taken in $117.3 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The high school satire ``Election,'' starring Reese Witherspoon  
as a compulsive do-gooder and Matthew Broderick as a civics 
teacher, opened in only six theaters nationwide but averaged 
$20,000 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Inc., with final figures 
to be released Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Matrix,'' $12.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Life,'' $11.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $6.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Pushing Tin,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Analyze This,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Lost &AMP; Found,'' $3.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``10 Things I Hate About You,'' $2.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Out-Of-Towners,'' $2.02 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Go,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Forces of Nature,'' $1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Munnings Painting Fetches $739,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A watercolor by Alfred J. Munnings, which once  
graced the walls of a Manhattan apartment belonging to socialite 
Betsey Cushing Whitney and her husband, set an auction record for 
the artist Saturday at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
	Munnings' ``Violet Munnings' Horse `Chips' at Chantilly,'' a  
portrait of a racehorse belonging to the artist's wife, fetched 
$739,500, setting a new auction record price for a Munnings 
watercolor. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record was $122,173 for Munnings' ``A Little Piece  
of England,'' sold in November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The racehorse painting, auctioned off as part of Mrs. Whitney's  
estate, was originally forecast to sell for $125,000 to $175,000, 
according to the auction house. Five telephone bidders were locked 
in a bidding war before it was snatched by an anonymous buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Whitney sales at Sotheby's continues Sunday with ``Country  
Life,'' which will include sculptures, paintings and furniture. The 
four-day auction is expected to bring in between $80 million and 
$100 million total for the estate of Mrs. Whitney, who died last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Whitney was first married to James Roosevelt, son of  
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They divorced and in 1942 she married 
John Hay ``Jock'' Whitney, a financier, publisher of The New York 
Herald Tribune, philanthropist and ambassador to Great Britain from 
1957 to 1961.

	NATO Bombers Pound Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO bombers have caused heavy  
damage in regions southeast and southwest of Belgrade early Sunday, 
according to local news. State-run Serb television went off the air 
shortly after the night's airstrikes began, but it was unclear if 
it was because transmitters were damaged or broadcasts were 
suspended. The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that NATO bombs 
struck near a communications tower 10 miles south of Belgrade. The 
tower, which broadcasts TV signals, was not damaged but a 
transformer station nearby was reportedly hit, cutting off power.

	Diary Sheds Light on Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A handwritten diary written by one of  
the gunmen in the Columbine High School shooting spree shows the 
pair had been planning the attack for a year. Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone said the diary uses German phrases and that the 
assailants' reasoning behind the rampage was: ``We want to be 
different, we want to be strange and we don't want jocks or other 
people putting (us) down. ... We're going to punish you.'' Twelve 
students, one teacher and the two gunmen were killed in the 
murder-suicide massacre.

afternoon in Brick Lane, the center of one of the city's biggest 
Bangladeshi communities and the site of a popular Saturday market. 
Two hours after the blast, police said they received a call from 
someone claiming to be from an extreme right-wing group, Combat 18,

	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Steve  
Forbes urged conservative activists Saturday to lay the groundwork 
for banning abortions by turning public opinion against the 
procedure. Forbes favors a constitutional ``human life'' amendment

Mexico killed 45 people returning from a free vaccination program. 
Twenty-eight children were among those killed when the truck they

	PC Users Warned of New Virus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive  
and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection. The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its 
most common version was programmed to activate on computers using 
Windows 95 and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the 
nuclear disaster in Ukraine. But warnings from many experts lacked 
any sense of panic or impending doom because the virus was 
discovered last summer, giving antivirus companies time to develop 
free software updates to identify and destroy it.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Likely in Colo. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Lawyers are eyeing the Columbine High School  
shooting for its lawsuit potential, sizing up who might have known 
-- or should have known -- what the teen-age gunmen were planning. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous school shootings, victims' families have sued the  
killers' parents, schools, gun manufacturers and purveyors of 
violent images in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no immediate rush of legal vultures to Colorado. State  
law prohibits lawyers from soliciting clients until 30 days after 
an injury. And while nothing prevents victims from seeking legal 
help on their own, people touched by the shooting appear to be 
focused for the moment on grieving, not suing. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sense of morality would dictate waiting,'' said Marc Kaplan,  
president of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. ``Right now, I 
feel that this is a time for healing and grieving, not a time for 
even discussing lawsuits, never mind bringing them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not to say attorneys aren't watching the case carefully.  
</P>
<P>
	One possible avenue for lawsuits would be to charge negligence  
on the part of police, teachers, court officials, the gunmen's 
parents or their friends -- ``anyone who had frequent contact, or 
should have had frequent contact,'' with the gunmen, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Columbine students have claimed that teachers knew about  
vengeful videos the pair made last fall, but school administrators 
deny there were any videos that spelled out their murderous plans. 
A parent at the school has complained that the sheriff's department 
didn't follow through on his complaint about one gunman's 
harassment of his son. For his part, the sheriff claims there's 
evidence the parents of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris should have 
known their sons were planning the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Such allegations raise questions, ``but we're far from  
answers,'' Kaplan said. ``There is the potential of lawsuits, but 
it's impossible at this point to say whether or not there are 
factual grounds to bring them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Jonesboro, Ark., where two boys shot four classmates and a  
teacher in March 1998, an attorney for victims' families decided 
against pursuing a negligence case against the school and teachers. 
Instead, they sued the parents of the convicted killers, 
manufacturers of the guns they used, and one boy's grandfather, who 
owned the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents' attorney argued last winter against allowing that  
lawsuit to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no law that holds parents responsible for their  
children's vicious acts,'' David Cahoon told the judge. ``Nobody 
could foresee the tragedy that would occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge threw out several motions to dismiss the case,  
which is now in pretrial discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Paducah, Ky., the relatives of three teen-agers gunned  
down at their high school in December 1997 have sued confessed 
shooter Michael Carneal, his parents, school officials and other 
students who they say conspired with the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge dismissed all but 10 of the 45 original defendants.  
Those remaining are Carneal, his parents, the owner of the guns 
used in the shooting and six friends of Carneal's. The trial likely 
won't start until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate lawsuit in West Paducah, filed April 12, takes on the  
entertainment industry, claiming it profited from selling violent 
imagery that inspired Carneal to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	That suit seeks $130 million against two Internet porn sites,  
several computer game companies and the makers and distributors of 
the film ``The Basketball Diaries,'' which shows the lead character 
gunning down his teacher and classmates in a dream sequence.

<HEADLINE> Development To Offer Shooting Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRONT SIGHT, Nev. (AP) -- In the midst of simmering desert, in a  
town yet to be, Ignatius Piazza envisions a gated community that 
will offer residents not golf courses, not swimming pools, but an 
array of 13 shooting ranges. 
</P>
<P>
	Its name is Front Sight. Call it home on the range.  
</P>
<P>
	The 550-acre, master-planned community, straddling two counties  
whose planners have already given their approval, will offer 
prospective buyers 177 one-acre custom-home lots and 350 townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Front Sight will have its own community center, school and  
landing strip -- at a cost of almost $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, of course, the handy gun ranges to fire off a few rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Pebble Beach of firearms training,'' Piazza boasts,  
wearing the Front Sight uniform of navy fatigues and black boots. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza insists he and others involved in the project are not  
affiliated with any militia group. He says most of the students who 
have taken his classes here or in Bakersfield, Calif., are 
professionals, law enforcement officers and housewives. 
</P>
<P>
	And he understands that just the concept of Front Sight will  
offend some people after Tuesday's massacre in Littleton, Colo., 
where two high school students used a semi-automatic rifle, two 
sawed-off shotguns, a pistol and homemade bombs to kill 12 fellow 
students and a teacher before taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	He maintains, however, that a familiarity with guns, Front  
Sight's goal, could have reduced the bloodshed at Columbine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had any of the adults in Colorado at the school been armed  
with a concealed weapon, it would not have been a six-hour siege by 
two very disturbed individuals,'' he says. ``The problem would have 
been handled immediately. Lives would have been saved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy Neil Gardner,  
assigned full-time to Columbine High, exchanged gunfire with the 
attackers early in the assault and radioed for backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza expects Front Sight's first phase -- more training ranges  
and classrooms -- to be ready by year's end. New residents will be 
welcomed by the end of 2000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the planned community is just a maze of gravel and dust  
with some tents to hold classes, which have drawn 2,000 students 
since they began in January. The site, roughly halfway between 
Death Valley and Las Vegas, as yet has neither water nor power. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, 39, says he got interested in guns in 1988 after a  
drive-by shooting in his upscale neighborhood in Aptos, Calif. He 
owned guns but says he really didn't have the skills to defend 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After some lessons, the former chiropractor thought about  
building the ultimate weapons training center. He opened the Front 
Sight Firearms Training Institute in Bakersfield in 1996. Then, 
with the cash flow from those classes, he bought the Nevada land 
from a company getting rid of surplus holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	He declines to name the price. ``It was dirt cheap,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was also attracted to Nevada because of what he calls the  
state's ``firearm-friendly laws.'' Nevada allows citizens to own 
Class 3 weapons, such as submachine guns. California does not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt there was a need for a world-class facility, much done  
like the golf resort industry,'' Piazza says. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza has developed the Front Sight project with Las Vegas  
engineer David Dwyer and says he has several investors. Local 
government is treating it just like any other new development. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our planning commissioners are in support of it,'' says Tom  
Riley, Nye County planning commissioner. ``They don't have any real 
concerns with it. ... Instead of the 19th hole, they've got the 
bullet hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is amused. A proponent of gun control called  
Piazza's community ``a scary idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am frightened by these isolationists and gun fanatic people  
who want to commune together and promote a life that focuses on 
guns,'' says Eric Gorovitz, legal director for the Trauma 
Foundation in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Front Sight's residential lots lie in Nye County; the shooting  
ranges are in Clark County, which has approved use permits for 
them. The site is 10 miles from the nearest town, Pahrump. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the street names will have something to do with guns.  
``You can live on Second Amendment Drive if you want,'' Piazza 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Lots in the gun-oriented, gated community aren't for sale; they  
are an added benefit of purchasing a membership. The $200,000 
platinum membership entitles a person to gun training classes and a 
lot. Other memberships include classes but no living space. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza said 25 platinum memberships have already been sold.  
</P>
<P>
	One platinum member is Dr. Gary Cecchi, a 47-year-old oncologist  
in Walnut Creek, Calif., near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think that he is going to pull this kind of unique  
community off, so I just took a shot at it,'' says Cecchi, who has 
taken Piazza's classes for three years and plans to use his Front 
Sight house as a second home. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the 13 shooting ranges, Front Sight will have a video  
center, a five-story, recreational SWAT tower and underground 
tunnels and a rappelling area for training. And don't forget the 
Front Sight-style pro shop and armory.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Leader Criticizes NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A frustrated Macedonian President Kiro  
Gligorov sharply criticized NATO on Sunday for not inviting his 
country to become an alliance member. He also complained that 
outside aid for Kosovo refugees in Macedonia has fallen far short 
of needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gligorov said NATO has shown no appreciation for the extensive  
efforts Macedonia has made to qualify for NATO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Macedonia has been circumvented and has again been put in last  
place,'' Gligorov told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia is one of 24 NATO ``partner'' countries that maintain  
links with NATO but lack full membership. The partner countries 
joined the alliance members for NATO's 50th birthday commemoration 
here this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO accepted Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic into  
membership last month. The alliance maintains an ``open door'' 
policy for new members but no concrete steps toward further 
enlargement were taken at the summit here this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Gligorov's criticism contrasted sharply with the overall  
optimistic tone of the large majority of the heads of government 
assembled here for three days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking through a translator, he called for a program similar  
to the Marshall Plan to help southeastern Europe overcome economic 
backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO cannot expect southeastern Europe to change in an  
economic, political and social point of view unless a helping hand 
is extended to this region,'' he said. ``I believe this is the best 
response to the super nationalism which has reigned in this area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the humanitarian assistance provided for the tens of  
thousands of Kosovar refugees is disorganized, and he expressed 
disappointment that more refugees have not been relocated to third 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been expecting pledges to relocate 100,000  
refugees outside Macedonia, which borders Yugoslavia, but that the 
actual figure is far short of that. Germany has accepted the 
highest total, about 10,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the refugee flow began, Macedonia's gross domestic product  
has declined by about half, Grigorov said, adding that if the 
refugee flow continues, displaced Kosovars could constitute fully 
40 percent of the country's total population. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,  
Sadako Ogata, for suggesting that refugees be relocated as close as 
possible to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	That statement discouraged some countries outside the immediate  
area from offering to accept refugees, he said. But he said that 
problem may now be changing for the better.

<HEADLINE>  Hancock May Honor Next Derby Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Every now and then, Arthur Hancock III,  
who once recorded an album of country songs, will get out the 
guitar and sing one of his compositions -- ``The Sunday Silence 
Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tune honors the winner of the 1989 Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, who was co-owned by Hancock. Maybe, in tribute to the 
125th Derby on Saturday, Hancock will be moved to compose ``The 
Menifee March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, bred by Hancock, who also co-owns the colt, is a  
leading Derby contender off his victory in the Blue Grass Stakes on 
April 11 at Keeneland. That was his fourth win in five career 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, also owned by James Stone, won his only two starts as  
a 2-year-old in July and August. He then chipped a bone in a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're dealing with a chip, the longer it stays in the  
joint, the more cartilage it tears up,'' trainer Elliott Walden 
said Sunday. ``He was a colt with a future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So surgery was performed.  
</P>
<P>
	Menifee opened his 3-year-old campaign with a win in a  
seven-furlong allowance race Feb. 27 at Gulfstream Park, but then 
he finished second in the Tampa Bay Derby on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pat Day, the winningest jockey in Churchill Downs  
history, elected to ride Menifee instead of Cat Thief in the Blue 
Grass or Answer Lively in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got our confidence back in the Blue Grass,'' Walden said.  
``Everything is going pretty much to plan. He's had three or four 
weeks between races, and my goal was to get three races into him 
before the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, sixth in the eight-horse Blue Grass field, stormed past  
three horses on the outside in the stretch and won by 1 1/4 lengths 
over Cat Thief, with Florida Derby winner Vicar another half length 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was second by a length to Pineaff in the Tampa Bay  
Derby, but Walden does not regard it as a bad race by the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was five wide on the first turn and three wide on the  
second turn,'' Walden recalled. ``He got beat by circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee worked five-eighths of a mile in 1 minute flat Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He worked super,'' Walden said. ``He had running on his  
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move was similar to Victory Gallop's final work before last  
year's Derby, according to Walden, who added, ``That worked out 
well, but not quite well enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, second by 1 1/2 lengths to Real Quiet in 1998, was  
the first Derby starter for the 36-year-old Walden, whose father 
was a respected Kentucky owner and breeder and whose older brother, 
Ben Jr., operates the Vinery, a breeding farm near Midway. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible Walden will get two shots at winning in his second  
Derby. He also trains Mark Stanley's Ecton Park, fourth in the 
Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	That colt, however, might not get into the field if the  
20-starter rule is involved. The Derby is limited to 20 starters 
based on money earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ecton Park is in the Derby, that's fine,'' Walden said.  
``If not, we'll go to Illinois with him.'' The Illinois Derby will 
be run May 8 at Sportsman's Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden bought Menifee for $35,000 at a Keeneland September  
yearling sale in 1997. Hancock bought back a half interest, and 
Stone bought the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock, whose brother Seth is president of Claiborne Farm, also  
bred and co-owned Gato Del Sol, the 1982 Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first Derby for Stone, the 74-year-old owner of  
Stone Energy Corporation, based in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Professor Finds Fungus Fascinating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Be grateful for fungus.  
</P>
<P>
	Sure, it's to blame for athlete's foot, moldy bread and that  
slimy mildew on your shower curtain. But without fungi, there would 
be no beer, no penicillin, no Gorgonzola cheese. And we'd be up to 
our necks in dead plants and animals if there were no fungi to rot 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, fungus has had a key role in human history. Just ask  
George Hudler, professor of plant pathology at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, read his book.  
</P>
<P>
	In ``Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds'' (Princeton  
University Press, $29.95), Hudler shares an infectious fascination 
with fungus that overtook him like a religious conversion 30 years 
ago, when he was in forestry school. 
</P>
<P>
	The epiphany came as he peered through a microscope at mold  
spores, ``lined up in a row like eggs inside a balloon.'' At that 
moment, Hudler says, ``my life took on new meaning.'' He was hooked 
on fungus. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 10 years, Hudler has shared his fungal fervor with  
Cornell students in a popular undergraduate course by the same name 
as his book. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudler introduces the book with a series of stories  
demonstrating the role of fungus in history. For instance, the 
infamous witch trials in Massachusetts had their roots in 
fungus-infected rye that sickened people and cattle with symptoms 
attributed to evil spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Ergot poisoning from moldy grain also was responsible for  
numerous epidemics in Europe over the centuries. The hideous 
illness, sometimes described as ``Saint Anthony's Fire,'' caused 
burning pain before limbs would blister, rot and fall off. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudler goes on to tell how a chemist at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals  
in the 1930s isolated a potent hallucinogenic compound from the 
ergot fungus: LSD. It was enthusiastically embraced by the CIA as a 
potential mind-control agent in the 1950s before it became a 
popular recreational drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scholars believe the great philosophers of ancient Greece --  
including Socrates, Plato, and Homer -- gained inspiration through 
the ceremonial drinking of a secret, sacred beverage in the temple 
of Eleusis. The hallucinogenic purple potion is believed to have 
contained a crude form of LSD, derived from ergot-infected grain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ergot derivatives also are used in modern migraine medications  
such as Cafergot and Ergate. 
</P>
<P>
	A toxin produced by another grain mold causes internal bleeding  
and strangulation death. The U.S. government accused the Soviet 
Union of dropping that toxin in the form of ``yellow rain'' during 
the Vietnam War. But some scientists later theorized that what 
villagers called ``yellow rain'' was actually the feces of massive 
swarms of bees, Hudler writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, molds aren't the only fungal sources of toxic,  
hallucinogenic or medically useful compounds. Mushrooms had a 
celebrated role in human culture long before Timothy Leary extolled 
the mind-altering virtues of psilocybin from ``magical mushrooms'' 
in the psychedelic '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Several centuries ago in Siberia, Hudler writes, an explorer  
discovered that native tribespeople enlivened life in a harsh land 
by eating hallucinogenic mushrooms. Those too poor to afford the 
fungi enjoyed its effects second-hand -- by drinking the urine of 
the mushroom-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scholars believe the same mushroom -- fly agaric -- was the  
Soma, a mysterious life force worshiped by ancient Hindus and a 
factor in the genesis of modern religions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Soma was passed from one person to another through urine. It  
is said to have had one foot and a red-and-white head -- a good 
description of the fly agaric, or Amanita muscaria. 
</P>
<P>
	There is evidence that the ancient Mayans also used the fly  
agaric in shamanic rituals. And some scholars have suggested that 
the red-topped mushroom, rather than an apple, was the forbidden 
fruit in the story of Adam and Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Interwoven with Hudler's entertaining accounts of the role of  
fungus in history, culture, medicine and everyday life are detailed 
explanations of the underlying science -- including classification, 
structure, chemistry, growth habits and other facts of fungal life. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, we learn how a fungus called Phytophthora  
infestans awakens from winter dormancy to produce wind-blown spore 
capsules, which disgorge swimming spores onto potato plants. The 
spores germinate, grow threadlike into the plant, and produce 
enzymes that digest tissue. Infected potatoes turn to putrid mush. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened in 1845, when a devastating blight led to  
the Irish potato famine during which more than a million people 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Lest his readers write off fungi as vile and destructive, Hudler  
devotes the latter half of the book to the benefits derived from 
fungi. Penicillin, for instance. And cyclosporin, another 
mold-derived drug which helps prevent rejection of transplanted 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
	The shiitake mushroom, long used in East Asian medicine as well  
as cuisine, produces potent anti-tumor and anti-viral compounds 
that are being investigated as treatments for cancer and AIDS. Some 
common North American mushrooms also have been shown in clinical 
trials to have therapeutic effects against cancer, hypertension and 
hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudler devotes a chapter to the biology of yeast and how its  
metabolic processes are put to use in making bread, beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me assure you that for all the problems fungi have caused,  
they have also extended our lives and made them far more 
enjoyable,'' Hudler writes. He invites any reader who remains 
unconvinced to stop by his office in Cornell's Plant Science 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll chat,'' he writes, ``for as long as it takes.''

<HEADLINE> It Could Be More Than a Hunch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- When a horse owned by James R. Stone won  
a race at Keeneland last October, he was unable to find his 
pari-mutuel tickets, worth $600. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's plane was waiting for him and he had to leave, so his  
friend, Arthur Hancock III, searched for the tickets and found them 
amid debris on the floor of his box. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock called the plane, and was told by King to bet the $600  
on a 2-year-old colt named Menifee in the Kentucky Derby Future 
Book. The odds were 29-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The price on Menifee, bred by Hancock and co-owned by him and  
Stone, will be a lot shorter Saturday in the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee won his only two starts last year in July and August,  
then had surgery for a bone chip in a knee. He opened his 
3-year-old campaign with a win in a seven-furlong allowance race 
Feb. 27 at Gulfstream Park, then finished second in the Tampa Bay 
Derby on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Still Pat Day, the winningest jockey in Churchill Downs history,  
elected to ride Menifee instead of Cat Thief in the Blue Grass 
Stakes on April 11 at Keeneland or instead of Answer Lively in the 
Arkansas Derby the same day at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got our confidence back in the Blue Grass,'' trainer  
Elliott Walden said Sunday. ``Everything is going pretty much to 
plan. He's had three or four weeks between races, and my goal was 
to get three races into him before the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, was sixth in the eight-horse Blue Grass field until he  
stormed past three horses on the outside in the stretch and won by 
1 1/4 lengths over Cat Thief, with Florida Derby winner Vicar another 
half-length back. 
</P>
<P>
	While Menifee's second by a length to Pineaff in the Tampa Bay  
Derby was a disappointment to Walden, the trainer does not look at 
it as a bad race by the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was five wide on the first turn and three wide on the  
second turn and the winner was one and one,'' Walden recalled. ``He 
got beat by circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee worked five-eighths of a mile Sunday in 1 minute flat.  
</P>
<P>
	``He worked super,'' Walden said. ``He had running on his  
mind.''

	The 36-year-old Walden, whose father was a respected Kentucky  
owner and breeder and whose older brother, Ben Jr., operates the 
Vinery, a breeding farm near Midway, made his first Derby 
appearance in 1998. His Victory Gallop finished second, 1 1/2 lengths 
behind Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible that Walden will get two shots at winning in his  
second Derby. He also trains Mark Stanley's Ecton Park, fourth in 
the Arkansas Derby. That colt, however, might not get into the 
field if the 20-starter rule is involved. The Derby field is 
limited to 20 starters based on money earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ecton Park is in the Derby, that's fine,'' Walden said.  
``If not, we'll go to Illinois with him.''

<HEADLINE> Community Draws Together in Grief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They streamed in from all over --  
hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed 
at comforting a town torn asunder. One good wish, soaked by the 
morning rain, was signed, simply, ``Your community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what community was it from? So many forms of community,  
rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have 
come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown  
of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has 
produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, 
still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our  
community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway 
said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 
70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine  
students and Columbine Valley residents. There are myriad 
mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, 
their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, 
united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and 
Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's 
anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community. 
</P>
<P>
	The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver,  
past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of 
the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the 
community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done 
to stop this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating  
outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has 
become a mourner's Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-food restaurants are flying flags at half-staff and posting  
sympathy signs. Businesses are contributing goods and raising 
funds. Denver's newscasters have donned blue Columbine ribbons. 
Big-league sports teams canceled games in deference; Mile High 
Stadium now sports a giant Columbine ribbon visible from Interstate 
25. Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes, 
between strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so  
self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our 
community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot 
drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's when something like this happens that we realize the  
community's there for us,'' she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came  
in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that 
repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into  
town. Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share 
grief. In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P. Kenneth 
Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as 
``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of 
Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What unifies regions this way? A national culture, for one -- the  
very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence. 
Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief, 
creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet 
users that didn't exist 40 years ago. Thus, people who don't know 
each other can mourn together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of  
grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. ``One of the hidden 
truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of  
35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its 
existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving 
as salves for recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte  
River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since 
the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and 
houses sprouted up around it. This was long before the retail 
sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and 
make the area a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``A community formed around that high school, and the school  
grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened 
Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years. ``It 
has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a 
suburban high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses  
continue to sprout. And the families that have streamed into 
Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace 
unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together 
that the Columbine deaths caused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst. People may  
not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter. We 
knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R. 
Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how 
people cope with public tragedy. ``That sense of reaching out makes 
us feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people  
sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping  
that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry 
boys' violent acts can last. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have known the revival they have started, they  
never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose 
daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. ``They wanted death and 
destruction. Instead, we've all come together.''

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Kerrey met with fellow Medal of

<HEADLINE> San Jose Reaches Critical Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks need to stay out of  
the penalty box if they hope to catch the Colorado Avalanche in 
their first-round playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche capitalized on San Jose penalties for a 3-1  
victory in the opening game Saturday night. Game 2 is set for 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, which finished fifth in the league on the power play  
during the season, was 2-for-8 with the man advantage in the opener 
at the San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it would be a key to our playoff success,'' Avalanche  
right wing Theoren Fleury said. ``We practiced it all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks are well aware of the opposition's talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be one little flaw,'' San Jose coach Darryl Sutter  
said. ``You can't have a weak couple of minutes against them, you 
can't have a weak shift against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series was started on Saturday in San Jose because of the  
mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The 
first two games originally were scheduled in Denver on Wednesday 
and Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series, both teams will honor those slain -- the  
Sharks have stickers on their helmets and the Avalanche have 
patches on their jerseys reading CHS for Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to captain Joe Sakic's two goals and an assist,  
goaltender Patrick Roy helped Colorado's effort with 42 saves in 
Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy said the playoff future of the team depends on its proven  
ability to win on the road. The Avalanche finished 23-14-4 away 
from home this season, the fourth-best road record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success on the road is key to us winning the series,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy, known for his postseason prowess, claimed his 100th career  
playoff victory in the opener, an ongoing NHL record. He is 16-3-1 
against the Sharks over his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get more traffic in front of him, and do a good  
job of getting the rebounds,'' Sharks left wing Jeff Friesen said. 
``We have to play more disciplined and play harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose goalie Mike Vernon, who stopped 28 shots, has 75  
postseason victories and Stanley Cup wins in Detroit and Calgary. 
However, his backup, Steve Shields, was hot down the stretch in the 
regular season while Vernon healed a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Vernon stays in goal on Monday night remained to be  
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask the coach. He makes all the decisions,''  
Vernon said. ``(But) I'm preparing myself like I'm playing.''

<HEADLINE> Group Says Farmers' Income Plunged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas farm income fell 72 percent last  
year, making 1998 the worst year for Kansas farmers since the 
disastrous drought of 1989, according to the Kansas Farm Management 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual analysis of its member records, the group said the  
average income dropped from $59,352 in 1997 to $16,778 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	As bad as those numbers sound, economists insist that farmers'  
economic woes have not yet reached the crisis level of the 1980s, 
when hundreds of family farms faced bankruptcy because of soaring 
interest rates, debt and operating costs, and falling land and 
equipment values. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is taking more government money to make ends meet on the  
farm, and the so-called Freedom to Farm law hasn't translated into 
fewer government payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Management Association report measures ``accrued  
income'' -- total receipts, minus costs, plus the value of unsold 
crops or livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the latest indication of how farmers are faring since the  
Kansas Agricultural Statistics office last month released its 1997 
cash receipts report, which put the average farm income that year 
at $27,956 in Kansas. That estimate measures actual marketing and 
production costs, and does not include the value of unsold crops 
and livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Forces beyond farmers' control were partly responsible for the  
income plunge. Floods and drought struck virtually all of Kansas 
but were especially severe in the central and northeast portions. 
And weakness in the global economy and surpluses in the domestic 
market drove prices for grain and livestock to near all-time lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop was partly mathematical. Farmers' accrued income was  
excellent in 1996 and 1997, making the decline in 1998 that much 
steeper, said Barry Flinchbaugh, public policy economist for Kansas 
State University Research and Extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the numbers are causing concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``If there's no turnaround in the next year or two, we'll be  
looking at a much worse problem,'' said Gary Nuss, the Farm Service 
Agency's farm loan manager for Sedgwick, Butler and Cowley 
counties. ``Right now, many farmers are restructuring debt. If they 
can't make the income to repay that debt, they'll be in real 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Farm Service Agency, which makes loans to farmers who have  
been denied credit by conventional lenders, has seen a 50 percent 
increase in applications for emergency and operating loans this 
fiscal year over last. Nuss said that is evidence of the problems 
farmers have had paying back regular bank loans for operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said farmers coming to the FSA this year are borrowing to  
maintain their operations, not to expand. ``I'm seeing very much a 
defensive mode,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, land values are not showing steep declines, although  
Federal Reserve Bank reports for the region have shown some 
declines for two consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many analysts are predicting that the global economy will bottom  
out in 1999 and gradually return to ``normal'' by 2002. That may 
not be fast enough for many farmers, warned Fred DeLano, chief 
analyst for the Kansas Farm Management Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Flinchbaugh and others insist it is too early to say new  
federal farm policies are not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington doesn't need to 'fix' agriculture,'' Flinchbaugh  
said. ``Washington just needs to help farmers buy time with another 
cash infusion like the $6 billion last year. It also needs to keep 
working to reform crop insurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nuss said another cash infusion is definitely in order if he is  
to continue making loans. Many programs are already out of money, 
and the two most crucial areas, direct and guaranteed loans, will 
be out by May 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 returns may actually indicate an even worse farm  
economy because much of that income came in the form of government 
payments.

<HEADLINE> Refugees: Serbs Seek Women To Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZDA, Macedonia (AP) -- City by city and village by village,  
Serbs are hunting down young women to rape as they loot, empty and 
burn Kosovo's ethnic Albanian communities, women escaping beyond 
the province's borders say. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors, war crimes investigators and NATO all  
are reporting numerous accounts of rapes in Kosovo -- atrocities 
that Yugoslav and Serb officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
	Witness testimony so far indicates the rapes in Kosovo are  
``neither isolated nor incidental,'' said Patricia Sellers, a U.N. 
war crimes prosecutor at The Hague, Netherlands, whose workers are 
gathering the first accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the police entered the town, that was the first question  
they asked: 'Are there any women here?''' said Valbona Rrustemi, 
19, of the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	Rrustemi fled Urosevac with her family April 16, the day after  
two girls came running through her family's garden, saying Serb 
police were after them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, police knocked at the family's door, asking if  
there were any young women, she said. Her father said no while she 
hid, Rrustemi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Word later reached her of four Urosevac women who had been  
caught by the Serbs that day, she said. They included a friend who 
was raped in the street, Rrustemi said. She named the friend and 
gave her age, 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's cousins had confirmed the attack, Rrustemi said. No  
one has heard of the woman or her immediate family since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened to them. I hoped they escaped,''  
said Rrustemi, one of several women at the Brazda refugee camp to 
give accounts of rapes in Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, also citing refugee accounts, contends there have been  
several instances of mass rapes, well-organized on at least a local 
level: 
</P>
<P>
	--At Djakovica, near the Albanian border, Serb soldiers allegedly  
took women from their families and sent them to an army camp where 
they were held for repeated rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Pec, a local Serb commander allegedly held ethnic Albanian  
women at a hotel, organizing a schedule by which his soldiers could 
come to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
	--At an ammunition factory and ferronickel plant at an  
unspecified site in Kosovo, 100 women allegedly were still being 
held as of mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, word that Serbs were separating ethnic Albanians  
into groups of women and men was enough to send families fleeing -- 
making rape a means of emptying communities, as much as massacres, 
arson and looting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent is to not just to intimidate and humiliate the  
actual physical victim but also to somehow intimidate those who are 
standing there either looking at it or hear about it,'' Sellers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations first prosecuted rape as a separate war crime  
after the 1992-95 Bosnian war. In the first case to focus 
exclusively on rape, the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for former 
Yugoslavia sentenced a Bosnian Croat paramilitary chief in December 
to 10 years in prison for failing to stop subordinates' 1993 rape 
of a Bosnian Muslim woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces in Bosnia were widely accused of using rape as a  
means of ``ethnic cleansing.'' Sellers said it was too early to 
tell if rapes in Kosovo were as widespread as in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees from Kosovo say the targeting of women continued even  
as their convoys were being escorted out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, Serbs looking for women stopped vehicles of  
residents from the area of the southern city of Gnjilane en route 
to the border, but the convoy's Serb escorts protected the women, 
villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the accounts of Serbs seeking out women to rape come  
from people who escaped rather than those who were caught. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, reports gathered by the Organization for Security and  
Cooperation in Europe number in the dozens, ``and not many 
dozens,'' said Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the head of the 
OSCE's Kosovo mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers predicts the numbers will rise.  
</P>
<P>
	``The incidents are very close right now. We notice that people  
are much more willing to come forward several months ... after 
sexual violence has happened,'' she said. ``Right now, some of 
their priorities might be actual physical survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of rapes are increasing, including reports from  
refugees arriving Sunday in Macedonia that Serb paramilitaries 
raped four girls ages 15-20 before killing them, along with about 
15 other people of their village of Ribar i Vogel, last week. 
</P>
<P>
	War-crimes investigators will also have to cope with the horror  
with which ethnic Albanian culture regards rape. Kosovo Albanians 
said many victims may be too shattered to talk, particularly women 
from villages rather than cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Teuta Beselica, a student forced from Pristina and now living in  
Skopje, Macedonia's capital, was one of many to call rape the worst 
crime imaginable -- a ``disaster'' to Kosovo Albanian families. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst thing you can do to an Albanian male,  
basically,'' Beselica said. ``Killing a man or a woman is not half 
as bad. And they know that.''

<HEADLINE> Daley Apologizes to Murder Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Two young boys who were falsely accused of  
killing an 11-year-old girl deserve an apology from the city, Mayor 
Richard M. Daley says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll apologize to them personally -- to the family, to all of  
them,'' Daley said Saturday when questioned by reporters about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys, ages 7 and 8, were charged with first degree  
murder in the slaying of 11-year-old honor student Ryan Harris. Her 
body was found July 28 in a vacant lot in Chicago's poverty-plagued 
Englewood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against the boys were dropped in September after crime  
lab tests found semen in Ryan's clothing. Floyd Durr, 30, an 
ex-convict who has served time for attempted murder and robbery, 
was charged in a 40-count indictment with murdering, kidnapping and 
sexually assaulting the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the 8-year-old, R. Eugene Pincham, declined to  
comment on Daley's offer of an apology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll wait until he apologizes to them (in person),'' said  
Pincham. He has filed a $100 million lawsuit against the city and 
the police department on behalf of the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr, who remains jailed without bond, also is suspected of  
three other attacks on young girls. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys were arrested after six hours of questioning by  
detectives, who said the two confessed to killing Harris because 
they wanted her new bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Police Supt. Terry Hillard and Cook County State's Attorney  
Richard Devine have told the boys and their families that they 
regret how the case was handled.

<HEADLINE> Violence Rocks Dutch Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- In the worst soccer violence in  
years in the Netherlands, fans smashed windows, looted stores and 
attacked riot police Sunday following Feynoord Rotterdam's 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they shot and injured three fans in the street  
fighting. They were shot in the neck, stomach and leg, and their 
conditions were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on the number of arrests and injuries were not  
immediately available but Dutch television reported that ambulances 
were driving to and from downtown, taking the wounded to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said officers were attacked with bottles, stones and  
other makeshift weapons, and one officer was injured when hit by a 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans also disrupted railway traffic by walking on tracks that  
run through central Rotterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of extra police were brought into the city before the  
game with NAC Breda, which ended in a 2-2 tie and gave Feyenoord 
its first Dutch league title since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a gigantic party and after that a group of 80-90  
turned against police,'' police spokesman Anne Geelof said on Dutch 
television. ``It is terrible that you have to end a party with this 
kind of incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, 250,000 fans packed Coolsingel street to  
celebrate. Fighting broke out in the early evening among hooligans 
after most people had returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We closed in on a group of about 100-150 hooligans and the  
police felt so threatened they had to fire into the air,'' Geelof 
said. When that had no effect, the police fired directly into the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Geelof broke off a telephone interview with The Associated Press  
because he said he was being pelted with stones. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m., downtown reportedly was peaceful but small pockets  
of hooligans were said to be looting shops and smashing car windows 
elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Feyenoord fans, among the Netherlands' most notorious, rioted  
earlier this season. The club has banned them from traveling to 
road games in next season's Champions League. 
</P>
<P>
	The final of next season's European Championship is at  
Feyenoord's De Kuip Stadium. The Netherlands and Belgium are 
co-hosts for the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Depends on Road Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Now that the playoff series between the  
Avalanche and the Sharks is underway, Colorado needs to continue to 
do what it does well: win on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly worked in the series opener, which the Avalanche  
won 3-1 at the San Jose Arena, as Patrick Roy had 42 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success on the road is key to us winning the series,'' Roy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche finished 23-14-4 away from home this season, the  
fourth-best road record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been a good road team all year,'' captain Joe Sakic said  
after Saturday's victory. ``So this isn't really a surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic had two goals and an assist in the first game, while  
former Shark Sandis Ozolinsh added a goal and an assist. Jeff 
Friesen got the lone goal for the Sharks in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	The series started Saturday in San Jose because of the mass  
killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last 
Tuesday. The first two games originally were scheduled in Denver on 
Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the series, both teams will honor those slain -- the  
Sharks have stickers on their helmets and the Avalanche have 
patches on their jerseys reading CHS, for Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks tried to keep up in the first game, but the Avalanche  
took advantage of their mistakes. Colorado, which finished fifth in 
the league on the power play during the season, was 2-for-8 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of their trouble early on was they kept making mistakes  
in their zone,'' Sakic said. ``We capitalized on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks will have to fix this if they hope to even the series  
Monday night. All the teams that won Game 1 in the opening round 
last season went on to claim the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can't be one little flaw,'' San Jose coach Darryl Sutter  
said. ``You can't have a weak couple of minutes against them, you 
can't have a weak shift against them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there's getting by Roy, who claimed his 100th career playoff  
victory Saturday night, an ongoing NHL record. Roy is 16-3-1 
against the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't beat him, but we've got to get more traffic in front  
of him, and do a good job of getting the rebounds,'' Friesen said. 
``We have to play more disciplined and play harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Vernon stopped 28 Colorado shots and has 75 postseason  
victories himself, with Stanley Cup wins in Detroit and Calgary. 
However, his backup, Steve Shields, was hot down the stretch in the 
regular season while Vernon healed a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Vernon stays in goal on Monday night remained to be  
seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to ask the coach. He makes all the decisions,''  
Vernon said. ``(But) I'm preparing myself like I'm playing.''

<HEADLINE> Lung Group Splits From Research Arm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After nearly a century together, the American  
Lung Association and its lesser known research division, the 
American Thoracic Society, have parted ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the groups voted unanimously Saturday and Sunday, the  
start of their weeklong annual conference, to end a partnership 
that dates to 1905. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the American Thoracic Society decided they would be  
better off as an independent research organization, leaving the 
high-profile advocacy and public education efforts to the lung 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a divorce with all the negative implications, but  
it is a separation,'' said Dr. Edward R. Block, president of the 
ATS. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are to announce details of their new arrangement  
Tuesday. Block said it includes a $19 million payment by the 
thoracic society to the lung association to acquire ownership of 
assets such as the conference and two journals. 
</P>
<P>
	The thoracic society, with annual revenue of $15 million, makes  
up nearly 40 percent of the budget of the lung association's 
national office, based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The society's contribution, however, is much smaller when  
considered in the context of the overall budget of the lung 
association, which takes in nearly $200 million each year through 
its nationwide chapters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both organizations formed at the beginning of the century to  
combat tuberculosis, then ravaging the nation, and have worked as a 
single organization since 1905.

<HEADLINE> Cracks Showing in Still-Strong NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As NATO celebrated its 50th birthday and  
brandished its might over Yugoslavia, cracks showed through the 
brave front. In a polyglot alliance that no longer confronts the 
Soviet bear, unity does not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
	``This summit was an impressive demonstration of unity despite  
the fact that some skeptics feared it would not be wise to hold a 
summit in times of war,'' said German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 
elected only last year and hence new to the bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	But even Schroeder, like French President Jacques Chirac, who is  
more vocal in his independent views, did not yield submissively to 
the hard-line leadership of President Clinton and his loyal friend, 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Military interventions must be legalized by a U.N. mandate as  
a rule,'' the German leader said, reflecting a widespread view that 
NATO lacks the authority to stop merchant vessels carrying oil to 
Yugoslavia and to send armed peacekeeping troops to Kosovo without 
at least the approval of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Where a smaller NATO could close ranks easily to confront the  
Soviet Union, the now 19-member alliance, with its door open to 
even more members, has to struggle to work together when the issues 
no longer are black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the otherwise airtight bonds between the United States and  
Britain were loosened over the question of whether NATO should send 
combat troops to Yugoslavia to try to deliver a knockout punch 
after more than a month of NATO bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
	France and Britain had signaled before the summit that they  
favored using ground troops in the inconclusive conflict, but 
Clinton much prefers depending for now on an air campaign; so the 
contentious issue was shelved. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no way, though, to disguise the fissures over the  
American initiative to mount a blockade to keep oil shipments from 
getting to Yugoslavia. Stopping neutral vessels normally is an act 
of war, and Chirac registered his reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Insisting also on specific approval of the U.N. Security Council  
for peacekeeping operations, Chirac said: ``NATO cannot and will 
not be able to act without the authorization of this international 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States contends the authority to intercept oil  
tankers at sea and to deploy NATO peacekeeping troops in Kosovo is 
derived from a U.N. embargo and other Security Council resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a news conference whether NATO would need a new  
resolution to intervene outside the territory of its members, NATO 
Secretary-General Javier Solana said, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, the U.S. view on peacekeepers prevailed, but the  
communiques and other statements NATO issued at the summit 
reflected some of the divergence that marked the private 
deliberations of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the Clinton administration had in mind a NATO force,  
supplemented by troops from Russia and some other non-members. 
</P>
<P>
	This was transformed at the summit to a statement that ``NATO  
remains ready to form the core of an international military 
force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a little-noticed ripple of discord, meanwhile, Turkey forced  
the allies to guarantee that it and other allies that are not in 
the European Union would be consulted before NATO troops are sent 
into emergency action. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece, which came into the summit more impressed than any of  
the other allies with a potential cease-fire and other proposals 
floated by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, fell in with the 
non-compromise NATO stance on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who also was considered  
a bit wobbly before the summit, concurred as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian warplanes are participating in the attacks on the Serbs  
and, dramatically, so is the German Luftwaffe, the first battle 
campaign for German forces since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Hungary, one of the three new members of the alliance, is also  
among the most anxious. ``It's extremely complicated for Hungary,'' 
said Prime Minister Viktor Orban, clearly referring to 300,000 
ethnic Hungarians who live in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. 
There is concern they could be put in jeopardy by Hungary's active 
support for NATO's military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	But with it all, the 19 allies pulled together reasonably well.  
``It's not any more difficult than it would have been in the 
past,'' said a NATO official. ``The 19 have achieved real 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the curtain came down on the summit, Clinton declared: ``The  
alliance leaves Washington more united even than it was when we 
came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest test of the unity could be just over the horizon,  
though, if Russia decides to challenge the blockade.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise in East, Drop West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices continued to rise in  
the East but declined in the West, keeping the nationwide average 
about the same, an industry analyst said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil price hikes forced pump prices up about 2 cents per  
gallon in states along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, while 
prices dropped about 1.5 cents in the West and Midwest, according 
to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes,  
was $1.2296 per gallon Friday, a 0.15 cent rise from two weeks 
earlier, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind that apparent lack of activity there, a lot has been  
going on,'' Ms. Lundberg said. ``There have been price increases in 
Eastern and Gulf Coast states, which washed out the price cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Explosions and problems in several California refineries caused  
prices to skyrocket in that state in recent weeks. However, 
increased supplies of gasoline have helped stabilize the market to 
knock down prices in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The capacity is not all the way up to what it was, but as the  
situation normalizes in California, prices in the West will 
continue to topple,'' said Ms. Lundberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The average prices at self-service stations was $1.1733 per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.2748 for mid-grade and $1.3598 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.5304 for regular, $1.6173 for  
mid-grade and $1.6905 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Columbine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- As rays of sunshine burst through a  
slate gray sky, more than 70,000 mourners clutched flowers, blue 
and silver balloons and Bibles on Sunday as they wept for victims 
of the Littleton high school massacre and wondered why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities delayed opening the service by 30 minutes as twice  
as many mourners as expected had arrived, despite the 40-degree 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath a fluttering awning of blue and white, the Columbine  
High School colors, Vice President Al Gore and retired Gen. Colin 
Powell led an array of dignitaries surrounding the makeshift stage 
stretching across a movie theater's concrete steps. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1:30 p.m., brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen of Littleton  
opened the service with a simple ``Hi,'' and sang a song they wrote 
in tribute to 12 students and one teacher killed by the gunmen, who 
then killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Cohen is a junior at Columbine, and was trapped in the  
choir room when the shooting started. Stephen is a senior; he was 
in the cafeteria where many students were shot or hit by shrapnel 
from pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turn our pain to your gain,'' they sang, to applause. ``Can  
you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious ones?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver opened the  
services with a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surely the past week is about as much suffering as any  
community can bear,'' Chaput said. ``Love is stronger than death. I 
believe that. Perhaps beyond all this suffering, something good can 
be achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other dignitaries included U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard and most of  
the state's congressional delegation, Gov. Bill Owens and other 
state officials, Christian singers Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith, 
and the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see through the grief and the tears, an outpouring of  
love,'' Owens said. ``In the face of an unimaginable evil, this 
community has drawn closer. The community has found in itself a 
tremendous healing power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners of all ages began arriving four hours before the  
service. For some, it was the second or third vigil they had 
attended since Tuesday's rampage. Many were Columbine alumni. One 
student painted a heart over his entire face in Columbine blue. 
</P>
<P>
	A quartet of F-16 fighter jets from the Colorado National Guard  
zoomed overhead, led by Columbine graduate Capt. Scott VanBek. A 
private plane trailed a banner overhead reading: ``Our love and 
prayers are with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing crowd was a swarm of dark winter parkas splotched  
with bright floral bouquets. Florists in Colorado and California 
donated 25,000 bouquets of white and orange lilies, yellow 
sunflowers and daisies, pink carnations and roses of all hues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could do more,'' said Margaret Stark, 19, who  
graduated from high school in nearby Aurora last year. ``You can 
only give so many flowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For some, after absorbing continuous media coverage since  
Tuesday, it was a wrenching experience just to walk a few blocks 
from the heavily damaged high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim and Donna Weitzel drove 250 miles from Grand Junction to  
attend. They left their children, ages 11, 5 and 3, at home on 
Colorado's Western Slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid Littleton's strip malls and subdivisions, the Weitzels  
looked a little out of place wearing cowboy hats and ranching 
coveralls. They said they didn't know any students at Columbine or 
their families, but their reaction to the violence was common to 
parents everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that can help us personally by coming and  
seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain,'' Weitzel said as his 
wife hugged him. ``It's just something that struck my heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service shifts the physical and emotional focus away from  
the school, where classmates Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 
12 students and one teacher before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for  
the day, concentrating instead on directing traffic for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found a diary detailing the plot over the past year, as  
well as bomb-making materials and weapons in plain view in the 
bedroom of one of the dead suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Later on Sunday, the families of victims Daniel Mauser and Kelly  
Fleming planned a joint funeral for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, life in Littleton is returning to normal, even as  
memorials and investigations continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, 
a few miles south. They said Columbine's graduation ceremony will 
be held May 22 at Fiddler's Green, a large suburban amphitheater 
normally used for rock concerts and dance performances.

<HEADLINE> A Less Than `Fascinating Rhythm' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What were they thinking when they thought of  
doing ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm''? 
</P>
<P>
	Not that you can't play around with the classic songs of George  
and Ira Gershwin, dousing them in a modern sensibility that makes 
audiences sit up and listen. Look what Ella Fitzgerald did with her 
jazz-tinged ``Gershwin Songbook,'' one of the definitive recordings 
of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	But this new musical revue at Broadway's Longacre Theater is  
something else entirely. Instead of celebrating the Gershwin 
brothers, ``Fascinating Rhythm'' diminishes them. It distorts 
George's music with glossy yet uninviting arrangements and 
obliterates Ira's lyrics with overdone, often frantic renditions by 
performers who have been instructed well in the hard-sell approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lamos and Mel Marvin, who came up with the idea for this  
misguided show, can't leave the songs, most of them written in the 
1920s and '30s, alone. They impose an extra level of activity on 
more than one well-known melody. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Fascinating Rhythm'' certainly is filled with standards --  
starting with the title tune and working its way through ``The Man 
I Love,'' ``Love Is Here to Stay,'' ``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Someone to 
Watch Over Me,'' ``Embraceable You'' and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider what Lamos, who also directed the revue, has done to  
tart up some numbers. ``But Not for Me'' has been jacked up -- from 
a plaintive rueful refrain to a wail of self-absorption that 
wouldn't pass muster on most easy-listening radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'' transforms Ira Gershwin's  
witty banter into a screaming match, while ``Isn't It a Pity?'' 
becomes a love duet for two women, a gender-bending moment that 
seems to be thrown in solely for novelty's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	And the evening's finale, ``Hang on to Me,'' once a sweet little  
ditty for the young dance team of Fred and Adele Astaire, has been 
inflated into an all-encompassing friendship anthem that rivals 
``Seasons of Love'' from ``Rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is some nice juxtaposition of songs -- pairing two femme  
fatale comedy numbers -- ``My Cousin from Milwaukee'' and ``The 
Lorelei,'' for example. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the cast appears mechanically programmed,  
unable to let their considerable musical-theater talents shine 
through. One exception is Sara Ramirez, whose flair for comedy in 
``Just Another Rhumba,'' one of the Gershwins' lesser known 
efforts, is welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
	David Marques' choreography is hard-driving yet aimless, more  
distracting than discerning in its attempt to complement individual 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The backdrops by designer Michael Yeargan are variations on the  
expanding and contracting lens of a camera, stylish apertures that 
at least frame the performers well. 
</P>
<P>
	You can't say ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' doesn't have  
a concept. Too bad it is such a wrong-headed idea, one that in the 
end smothers rather than showcases the songs.

<HEADLINE> Fox OKs Advance 'Star Wars' Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bowing to pressure from theater owners, 20th  
Century Fox has authorized the sale of advance tickets to the 
``Star Wars'' prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bit of compromise for us, but the theaters have  
invested a lot of equipment and money into providing the advance 
ticket service to their customers,'' Fox spokesman Tom Sherak said. 
``They really wanted this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and LucasFilm Ltd. originally banned advance ticket sales to  
stave off scalpers who they feared would hoard the seats, Sherak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They lifted the ban on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Theaters are restricted from selling more than 12 advance  
tickets for each person, but there are now no formal ways to stop 
scalpers from snagging tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theater owners promised sellers would watch so that some  
guy doesn't buy tickets and then get right back in line,'' Sherak 
said. ``But if somebody wants to do it bad enough, they will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tickets will become available on May 12 at 3:00 p.m. EDT at  
theater and ticket outlets in North America that offer the advance 
sales service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opens on May 19.

<HEADLINE> Trial Focuses on Miami Port Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The county-owned Port of Miami looked like a  
success with splashy cruise ships carrying millions on floating 
holidays and busy gantry cranes handling shiploads of cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	But federal prosecutors said the port was being used as a  
personal piggy bank by three of its top people, who spent money on 
everything from yacht maintenance to Disney World trips. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the three executives face an embezzlement trial in  
the latest of Miami's many recent corruption cases, which have 
brought down a mayor and landed the city commission chairman in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charges $1.3 million in port funds was stolen,  
although Miami-Dade County says the port, which functioned 
autonomously, ran up a $36 million deficit under the old 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation disgraced the county, embarrassed Democrats  
because it turned up thousands in questionable contributions to 
their party and helped shut down the nation's largest 
minority-owned municipal bond underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment last summer named 17-year port director Carmen  
Lunetta; Calvin Grigsby, the owner and president of Fiscal 
Operations Inc., which operated the gantry cranes in the nation's 
eighth-busiest cargo port, and port contractor Neal Harrington, a 
part owner of Continental Stevedoring &AMP; Terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Grigsby's bond firm of Grigsby Brandford &AMP; Co. shut down in 1996  
after he became a target of the Miami investigators. He also is 
scheduled for trial in July trial on charges of arranging $350,000 
in kickbacks to two Dade County executives in return for county 
bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevedoring companies paid Fiscal Operations for crane time.  
Fiscal Operations, in turn, paid the county, but after deducting 
$150,000 a year plus expenses. Prosecutors charge the expenses were 
heavily padded. 
</P>
<P>
	The county had to file a lawsuit before it could examine Fiscal  
Operations' books, which revealed $120,000 in contributions to the 
Democratic National Committee, plus money spent on Lunetta's house, 
Super Bowl tickets, Victoria's Secret lingerie, vacation trips, 
luxury car rentals and bar tabs. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC put the $120,000 in escrow while the county sues Fiscal  
Operations to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	After the indictments, Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas  
launched an anti-corruption campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new port. We've totally turned the port around. We went  
from a $36 million deficit to a $22 million surplus last year,'' he 
said. ``In a really short period of time we were able to clean up 
the port and get it back in the black.''

<HEADLINE> 'Military Brats' Plan Reunion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Joanne Woltgen Mouser is going home. Sort of.  
</P>
<P>
	Her childhood home no longer exists. Neither does her high  
school at a now closed Air Force base in Chofu, Japan, where she 
lived when her father served there in 1967-1969. 
</P>
<P>
	She is one of thousands of ``military brats'' -- children of  
Americans who were in the service overseas -- expected to connect 
with old schoolmates at the ``Grand Homecoming '99'' in Dallas on 
Aug. 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4 million people have attended more than 500  
military or international schools provided for children living 
abroad with their parents. Reunion organizer Joe Condrill says 
almost all the schools are expected to be represented in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like most of these people can go home and see old  
friends. The places they grew up, the bases, either don't exist 
anymore ... or it's impossible to take a trip like that,'' says 
Condrill, founder of Overseas Brats, an organization dedicated to 
reuniting military dependents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mouser, who lives in Manhattan and works in the fashion  
industry, says she lost her ``home'' when the Army transferred her 
father from Japan to South Carolina, but she hopes to regain it in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people you went to school with, your friends, helped make  
wherever you were home,'' says Ms. Mouser, 45. ``It's been a long 
time since I felt at home like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Author Pat Conroy, whose experience as the son of a Marine  
inspired his novel ``The Great Santini,'' believes enthusiasm for 
such reunions comes from ``the fraternity and sorority of the 
shared military brat experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I feel this great tenderness for any military brat I  
meet,'' he said. ``There's a bond there. It's about how many times 
you moved, where your father and, these days, your mother was 
stationed. You want to be able to talk about it with people who 
understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the brat experience wasn't always easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the son of a career Army  
soldier, recalled the pain and problems involved in constantly 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember how difficult it was to repeatedly leave behind  
the friends you'd made and the life you knew only to go somewhere 
else and start all over,'' says Gingrich, who attended Stuttgart 
American High School in Stuttgart, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also says the experience made him more adaptable to new  
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those experiences made me feel that I was a part of something  
much larger than myself, and they taught me about the value and 
cost of freedom,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's those shared experiences that caused Condrill,  
himself a military brat, to begin holding small reunions about 10 
years ago. Groups of several hundred got together in Washington, 
D.C., Atlanta and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was done by mail and telephone calls,'' he says. ``It was  
almost impossible finding brats, let alone letting them know about 
a reunion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Internet has changed all that. At least one graduate of  
almost every overseas school has established a homepage on the 
World Wide Web. This time, word about the reunion spread mostly by 
e-mail and Web page postings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas gathering will offer such traditional reunion fare as  
dances, dinners and awards as well as classes on how to find 
missing friends and panel discussions about the brat experience. On 
display will be ``Operation Footlocker,'' a traveling museum of 
brat memorabilia, including dog tags, yearbooks, military 
identification cards and school lettermen jackets. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we came back to stateside schools, we were outsiders. We  
didn't go to the same school in the same town our whole lives. We 
didn't have the same friends our whole lives,'' says Gene Moser, 
one of the Footlocker's organizers in Hampton, Va., and a former 
student at Yokohama American High School in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Dallas,'' says Moser, a retired Army officer, ``we won't be  
the outsiders.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Asian Crisis Seems Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the head of the International Monetary  
Fund declaring a possible end to the Asian currency crisis, U.S. 
officials convened an unusual meeting of finance officials from 33 
countries Sunday to gather support for changes aimed at taming the 
boom and bust cycles of the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, asked if the 20-month  
crisis is over, said: ``It seems to be.'' But he counseled 
unrelenting efforts to remodel the global financial architecture 
and make countries less vulnerable to market instability. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of crisis has prolonged effects,'' Camdessus said.  
``We will never be able to quantify all the social consequences'' 
of the financial firestorm that has pushed one-third of the world 
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	It has cost millions of jobs and an estimated $600 billion in  
lost output, the equivalent of Canada shutting down for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	To develop a consensus on reforms, Lawrence Summers, the deputy  
Treasury secretary, and Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin 
were hosts for what was billed as a ``Seminar on the Financial 
Architecture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting involved representatives from the world's seven  
richest countries plus other industrialized and developing nations 
ranging from Australia and Argentina to Thailand and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance meetings, being held across town from where NATO  
heads of state were wrapping up their discussions, were a prelude 
to talks Monday among finance officials of the Group of Seven 
wealthy countries. Those will be followed in turn by two days of 
meetings of steering committees of the 182-nation IMF and its 
sister lending organization, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials hope from all the talk will emerge a concrete  
program to regulate better billions of dollars of investment that 
can bring jobs and better living standards in poor countries. It 
also can plunge nations into deep recessions if investors suddenly 
lose confidence and start fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus told reporters Sunday that a key U.S. proposal to  
create a new ``contingent credit line'' at the IMF is near to final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can expect good news in this domain pretty soon,''  
Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton first proposed the new line of IMF loans last  
fall as a way to provide financial backing for countries before a 
crisis hits. The idea was to create a way to convince investors the 
host governments have resources to meet their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is general support for the approach, there have been  
many questions about what conditions to apply and how to involve 
private banks in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to overhauling the global architecture, the finance  
officials had more country-specific issues to grapple with. One is 
whether and on what terms to resume loans to Russia, which has been 
in economic turmoil since August when it had to devalue the rubble 
and default on billions of dollars in foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank are occurring at a  
time when the outlook for the global economy is certainly brighter 
than during last October's fall meetings. At that time, Russia's 
default had sent Wall Street and many global markets into tailspins 
and raised the specter of global recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve was able to restore investor confidence by  
cutting U.S. interest rates. Now U.S. stocks have soared to 
records, and even many of the countries forced to seek billions of 
dollars in IMF rescue packages have seen rebounds in their 
financial markets and currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials have let it be known they remain ill at ease that  
the United States is the only major economy doing well at present. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is expected to press his  
colleagues in Europe and Japan to do more to boost their growth 
levels and provide a sounder footing for the global recovery. That 
also would take some of the pressure off America's ballooning trade 
deficit.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Genes Don't Predict Destiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- While expert Robert Kahn addressed a  
conference on aging, 75-year-old Anthony LaCapra was completing his 
1 1/2-hour workout on a stationary bike and treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn explained that much of what Americans believe about aging  
is either myth or half-truth. LaCapra, who is retired, was 
following a fitness regimen that would make many youthful weekend 
warriors weep. 
</P>
<P>
	After his workout on the bike and treadmill, he uses resistance  
weights for about an hour before turning to the pool for an hour of 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
	And LaCapra does this three times each week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better today than I did at 30,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He began going to the gym at the suggestion of his doctor about  
a decade ago. He suffered a massive tear in his rotator cuff while 
working as a warehouseman. His physician said he could recover more 
quickly if he built up his strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my ups and downs in earlier years,'' LaCapra said. ``But  
it dawned on me after I retired. Instead of being a couch potato, I 
could keep active and live longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what Kahn, co-author of the book ``Successful  
Aging,'' was telling an audience April 9 at the 14th Annual 
Regional Geriatric Conference. Upstairs, in the Downtown Athletic 
Club, LaCapra was working out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to you, genes are not your destiny,'' said Kahn, a  
psychology and public health professor at the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn, 81, says, while many people blame ``getting old'' on fate  
and genetics, staying young is mostly a lifestyle choice. 
</P>
<P>
	While your cellular blueprint does have some influence on how  
well you age, much of that can be counteracted with a lifestyle 
that includes regular exercise and healthy eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying mentally active and maintaining connections to other  
people through family, volunteer work or hobbies is also important. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, studies show that only about one in every five  
elderly people get any regular exercise, Kahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is sad, because muscle atrophy is not only reversible,  
but avoidable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news is that years of inactivity and unhealthy living  
can be reversed with consistent exercise in later years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kahn gives himself as an example. At age 35 he was diagnosed  
with cancer. He recovered but, at age 50, doctors told him he had 
high blood pressure and needed to make some serious lifestyle 
changes. Now, he goes to the gym regularly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a little embarrassing at first,'' Kahn said. ``I see  
those beautiful young bodies and they see mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He now goes with a group of friends, and they support and cajole  
each other to keep it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, I'm still around to see my grandkids,'' Kahn  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the second-highest population of elderly people in the  
country living in Allegheny County, Jerry Duch of the county 
Department of Aging said he sees the daily effects of inactivity in 
older people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are isolated and alone, they don't want to get out in  
western Pennsylvania's hilly terrain and often foul weather. Money 
can also be an issue -- many don't have the extra funds to join a 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
	Younger generations can help reverse that trend, he said, by  
doing simple things like visiting with elderly neighbors or 
volunteering to stretch or walk with an inactive older person.

<HEADLINE> Report: Miller May Be With Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Two years ago quarterback Chris Miller thought he  
might never play football again, but a newspaper reported today 
that he could be back next season -- with the Denver Broncos, who 
will be without John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years after retiring from football, Miller has agreed in  
principle to sign with the Broncos, the Denver Rocky Mountain News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano declined to comment on the  
report, saying only that the Broncos have not signed Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is expected to announce his retirement this week. Bubby  
Brister, who is set to take over the starting job, praised Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a great guy. It's a great addition to have him  
with me and Brian (Griese),'' Brister told the News. ``If something 
happens, he has a lot of experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 33, had a Pro Bowl season with the Atlanta Falcons in  
1991. He quarterbacked the St. Louis Rams to a 4-0 start in 1995 
before he was sidelined by several concussions and an eye injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Oregon player began plotting his comeback this past  
winter, working out at his alma mater. He still lives in Eugene, 
Ore.

<HEADLINE> Dubai Derby Horses Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Worldly Manner and Aljabr, the two  
Kentucky Derby hopefuls from Dubai, worked at Churchill Downs on 
Sunday for the first time since their arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither workout excited onlookers, but assistant trainer Tom  
Albertrani appeared upbeat after Worldly Manner went seven-eighths 
of a mile in 1:29 4-5 and Aljabr went five-eighths in 1:04. 
</P>
<P>
	The Derby will be the first start of the year for the two colts,  
who arrived in Kentucky on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are owned by Godolphin Racing, the Dubai arm of sheiks  
Maktoum al Maktoum and Mohammed al Maktouom, members of the ruling 
family of the United Arab Emirates, who race internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldly Manner looked like he finished strong and galloped out  
well,'' Albertrani said. ``We were pleased with the workout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also liked the way Aljabr finished.  
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Bailey will ride Worldly Manner in the Derby on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bailey thought the track was a bit on the slow side, perhaps a  
little deep,'' Albertrani said. ``So the time was not really 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was bought for $5 million by Godolphin from John  
and Betty Mabee after he won the Del Mar Futurity on Sept. 9 for 
his third win in four starts in the United States. The Mabees own 
Derby contender General Challenge, winner of the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner won 1 1-8-mile trial in Dubai in March. Aljabr  
has run in two trials, finishing second to Worldly Manner and 
winning the other one. Aljabr won twice in Britain and once in 
France in his only races as a 2-year-old.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Global Crisis Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said Sunday it  
had given final approval to a major change in procedures that will 
allow it to make available billions of dollars in resources to 
countries in hopes of averting future global financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF endorsement represented a major victory for President  
Clinton. He had put the idea forward last fall, at the height of 
the economic crisis which has pushed one-third of the globe into 
recession and sent America's trade deficit to record levels. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hastily called news conference, IMF Managing Director  
Michel Camdessus and Italian Finance Minister Carlo Ciampi 
announced that the agency's executive board had given final 
approval to creation of new ``contingent credit lines'' to make IMF 
loans available to countries before a crisis strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciampi, who is chairman of the IMF's policy-setting interim  
committee, called the approval by the agency's executive board, a 
``good start for the spring meetings'' of the 182-nation lending 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	The new pre-approved credit lines represented the biggest  
initiative being pursued by the Clinton administration, although 
U.S. officials are also hoping to win endorsement for an array of 
smaller proposals to remodel the global financial architecture to 
prevent or at least better handle future crises. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton welcomed the IMF decision and said he hoped it  
would set the stage for further action when he and other leaders of 
the world's seven richest countries plus Russia get together for 
their annual economic summit in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we will ratify a number of changes to the global  
financial system that ... will avoid having another financial 
crisis like the one we saw in Asia and that we have worked so hard 
to keep from spreading to Latin America and elsewhere,'' Clinton 
said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Federal  
Reserve Vice Chairman Alice Rivlin were hosts Sunday to key finance 
officials from 32 other nations at a day-long seminar designed to 
build support for further U.S. reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Those discussions will be carried forward at meetings Monday of  
finance officials from the wealthy countries and then at the spring 
meetings of the IMF and its sister lending institution, the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said a major agenda item for the United States will be  
spurring Japan and Europe to do more to boost their own flagging 
economies and to help relieve pressure on the United States, 
currently the one engine of growth for the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Summers pledged that the United States will do  
``everything we can to preserve solid growth in our own economy and 
keep our markets open to the emerging economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the new credit lines, Camdessus said, ``I am  
confident this will be an important contribution for the world to 
be better prepared for future crises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hope is that by announcing the pre-approved credit, the IMF  
will signal to investors that a particular nation is pursuing sound 
policies and has the foreign reserve resources to support its 
currency against speculative attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mexican peso crisis in 1994 and the subsequent Asian  
currency crisis in 1997 and 1998, the IMF mobilized more than $100 
billion in loans but only after the crisis countries had depleted 
their own reserves in vain efforts to prevent devaluation of their 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea behind the contingent credit lines is to prevent a  
sudden rush to the exits by foreign investors by convincing them 
that the nation has sufficient resources of its own, combined with 
IMF backing, to support its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that Mexico might be the first to  
qualify for the pre-approved IMF credit, but Camdessus gave no hint 
as to which country will be first, saying only that nations will 
have to meet stringent IMF standards on economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank are occurring at a  
time when the outlook for the global economy is brighter than 
during last October's fall meetings. At that time, Russia's default 
had sent Wall Street and many global markets into tailspins and 
raised the specter of global recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve was able to restore investor confidence by  
cutting U.S. interest rates. Now U.S. stocks have soared to 
records, and even many of the countries forced to seek billions of 
dollars in IMF rescue packages have seen rebounds in their 
financial markets and currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement announcing approval of the contingent credit  
lines, the IMF said it will not grant approval to countries unless 
they also have received such pre-approved credit lines from private 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the loans are activated, the IMF said they will carry  
interest rates that will be 3 percentage points to 5 percentage 
points higher than normal IMF loans, which currently have an 
interest charge of around 4.75 percent. The higher cost is to 
discourage countries from drawing on the credit unless absolutely 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's executive board approved the new credit lines for two  
years with a review of the operations scheduled after the first 
year.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Could Affect Penguins' Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Former Pittsburgh Penguins star Mario Lemieux  
hopes a closed-door meeting with the landlord of the team's arena 
will lead to concessions on the team's lease that should help keep 
the franchise from moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is scheduled to meet Wednesday with Wes Westley Jr.,  
president of Philadelphia-based SMG Inc. A new lease with the 
landlord of the Civic Arena is key to saving the Penguins, 
according to Lemieux's rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very interested in what Mario has to say,'' Westley said  
in Sunday's edition of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. ``I want to 
get a better feel for his plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux attorney Douglas Campbell would say only that the talks  
are ``critical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SMG was hired by the nonprofit, city-county Pittsburgh Public  
Auditorium Authority to be the arena landlord. 
</P>
<P>
	Team and league officials also say there are problems with the  
lease, which binds the Penguins to the arena until 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owners Roger Marino and Howard Baldwin blame the lease for  
forcing them to file for bankruptcy last October. 
</P>
<P>
	National Hockey League officials have said substantial changes  
are needed in the lease for any franchise to survive in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins pay between $6 million and $7 million annually to  
rent the Civic Arena, built in 1961. The Steelers and Pirates will 
pay combined rent of $350,000 per year to rent two new stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux wants to reduce the Penguins' rent to $500,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's plan calls for the arena lease to be assumed by  
eminent domain if SMG does not make the concessions. The legal 
procedure would require SMG to be compensated for losing the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins' bankruptcy attorney Robert Sable declined to speculate  
on the value of the lease, but said eminent domain was often used. 
He wrote Friday in favor of Lemieux's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen G. Leeper, executive director of the Public Auditorium  
Authority, has ruled out eminent domain. He said the city wants 
potential buyers to negotiate directly with SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge's ruling last month strengthened SMG's position. U.S.  
Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz issued a permanent injunction 
prohibiting the Penguins from leaving the arena until the lease 
expires.

<HEADLINE> Auction of Woody Allen Props Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It looked like a typical Saturday flea market,  
strewn with everything from junk to treasure. But this was 
something different: An auction of hundreds of props and costumes 
from a decade of Woody Allen films. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all Americana,'' said Murray Schnitzer, a Manhattan  
concierge who bought 47 pairs of women's shoes from 
``Deconstructing Harry'' at the sale in a shabby Queens warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	With the elevated train rumbling by, the neon-lighted basement  
in the red brick building felt like a scene straight out of Woody 
Allen. This was his New York -- filled with angst and kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 432 lots were part of movie history. There were huge  
hotel, shop and dance hall signs from old Coney Island, and 
children's pinwheels and plastic beach balls -- half deflated -- from 
a lost world of stardust memories. 
</P>
<P>
	For $25, Stacey Neeman bought a pair of 1930s mahogany radio  
consoles used in ``Radio Days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no room, and I have no idea where I'll put  
these,'' said the graphic artist. ``But this is Woody Allen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It sure wasn't Christie's or Sotheby's.  
</P>
<P>
	Perched atop a yellow ladder just under the exposed pipes, the  
auctioneer didn't have to rehearse his New York accent as he 
whizzed through the items, which had no estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	For a lamp: ``One dollar, anyone? Two? ... No. Alright, I'll  
GIVE you a dollar!'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were other bargains from Allen's movie warehouse, which is  
nearby in Queens' Long Island City. A stack of white chairs went 
for $10 each, wooden rocking chairs for $15, and various tables, 
chest drawers and sofas for under $100. Trash cans, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't have the space to keep everything,'' said  
Richard Brick, a co-producer of several Allen films, including 
``Deconstructing Harry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said auction organizers publicized the sale to attract as  
many bidders as possible for the charity event, but did not plan to 
announce the final results. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds will go to the National Alliance for Breast Cancer, the  
American Foundation for AIDS Research and Elton John's AIDS 
Foundation.

	Colorado Shooting Victims Mourned  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Thirteen white doves fluttered into the  
slate gray sky today, over the heads of 70,000 people who filled a 
parking lot to mourn the 12 students and one teacher massacred at 
Columbine High School. Mourners clutched flowers, blue and silver 
balloons and Bibles as they wept at a ceremony held a few blocks 
from where two teen-agers went on a shooting rampage and then 
killed themselves Tuesday. As Gov. Bill Owens read the name of each 
of the 13 victims, a dove was released. The symbol of peace had a 
special meaning: Columbine, Colorado's state flower, derives from a 
Latin word meaning ``like a dove.'' ``God grant them eternal 
peace,'' Owens said of the victims.

	Russia Offers NATO Ultimatum  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said today Russia  
may beef up its defense budget and will review its relations with 
NATO countries if the alliance commits ground troops to Yugoslavia. 
Russia has strongly denounced the NATO airstrikes against its ally 
Yugoslavia but has insisted it will not intervene militarily. 
Speaking on Russian television, Primakov did not call directly for 
more military spending -- as many Russian lawmakers and some defense 
officials have done -- but said, ``We will have to pay more 
attention to defense.'' 

</P>

	Refugees Describe Serb Tactics  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo refugees who reached  
Macedonia today told relief workers of Serb paramilitaries entering 
villages, ordering residents out of their homes and opening fire on 
them. The latest accounts depict Serb paramilitaries combing more 
northerly villages and executing residents, said Ron Redmond, a 
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 
600,000 refugees -- mostly ethnic Albanians -- have fled Kosovo since 
NATO airstrikes began, and Western aid groups say hundreds of 
thousands of others are displaced within the province, many trying 
to leave.

	Lott Says Social Security Bill Dead  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress probably won't do much this year to  
revitalize Social Security. That prediction came today from Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who charges that President 
Clinton has failed to take the lead overhauling the system. But 
White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said Lott and other 
Republicans are the ones who have failed to present a plan for 
Social Security. ``The Senate majority leader, while criticizing 
the president's plans, has offered no specific measures of his 
own,'' Sperling said. Both parties have made shoring up Social 
Security a primary goal of the 106th Congress.

	IMF Approves Global Crisis Program  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund today  
announced a measure aimed at avoiding future global financial 
crises. The agency will make available billions of dollars in 
resources to countries before a crisis strikes. The move marks a 
major victory for President Clinton, who proposed the pre-approved 
credit lines last fall, at the height of the economic crisis that 
pushed one-third of the globe into recession and sent America's 
trade deficit to record levels. In the 1994 Mexican peso and Asian 
currency crisises, the IMF mobilized more than $100 billion in 
loans but only after the countries had depleted their own reserves 
in vain efforts to prevent devaluation of their currencies.

	Diamondbacks Beat Padres 5-3  
</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jay Bell's second home run of the game, a  
two-run shot in the 11th inning, carried the Arizona Diamondbacks 
past the San Diego Padres 5-3 today for their sixth victory in 
seven games. Bell, who went 3-for-6 with three RBIs and four runs 
scored, connected on the first pitch from Dan Miceli (1-1) for his 
seventh homer of the season after Tony Womack hit a two-out single 
in the 11th. Reggie Sanders set a career-high and tied the San 
Diego record with four stolen bases. The Padres had six steals in 
all, one shy of the club record for one game.

<HEADLINE> Hurdler Adkins Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Whether he runs fast or slow, the most  
important thing for hurdler Derrick Adkins right now is that he 
runs often. 
</P>
<P>
	Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles,  
endured a succession of frustrating injuries last year and cut his 
season short after finishing last at the Goodwill Games in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has been as active as ever this year and won his second  
straight major race when he beat local favorite Joey Woody and 
Olympic bronze medalist Calvin Davis at the Drake Relays on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory came six days after he won at the Mt. SAC Relays and  
was yet another sign that Adkins is returning to form. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully so,'' he said. ``That's how I looked at this race. I  
was just trying to get my confidence back, trying to get my fitness 
back. Now I'm ready to do well in '99 and that will get me ready 
for 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adkins is giving himself plenty of chances to continue his  
comeback. He plans to run in Japan in two weeks and again in late 
May. Then he's thinking about going to Europe for a couple of races 
before returning for the U.S. championships in Eugene, Ore., in 
late June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a lot of races,'' he allowed. ``But I'd like to run a  
lot this year to make up for last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was torture for Adkins. The 1995 world champion didn't  
even make the finals of the U.S. championships, then got smoked at 
the Goodwill Games by Woody, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tendon attached to my hamstring was giving me problems and  
I hurt my Achilles' tendon,'' Adkins said. ``I was taking weeks off 
of my training at a time. That is not conducive to running fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adkins finished Saturday's race in 48.99 seconds after running  
48.71 at Mt. SAC. He pulled away in the backstretch and Woody, the 
1997 NCAA champion at Northern Iowa, couldn't catch him in the 
sprint for the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody ran 49.26 and Davis 49.78.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's always one of my goals, to get a good start in the  
first 200 meters,'' Adkins said. ``Especially this early in the 
season I want to establish the start of my race. I was a little 
weak coming home. I was just trying to hold on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Hauser, who finished his eligibility at UCLA during the  
indoor season, beat defending champion Paul McMullen in the mile to 
win the meet's other featured event. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they were on a sub-4-minute pace at the halfway point,  
they couldn't maintain it and Hauser finished in 4:00.59 after 
passing McMullen on the second turn of the last lap. McMullen was 
second at 4:04.60. 
</P>
<P>
	The race also featured the return of Steve Scott, who ran the  
meet's first sub-4-minute mile in 1979. Scott, who'll turn 43 on 
May 5, hoped to become the oldest runner to break the 4-minute 
barrier, but he missed 10 days of training because of a strained 
calf and ran 4:21.54. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't miss 10 days and stay where you are,'' Scott said.  
``I tried to pump out something here, coming back to a place where 
I had such success. But you can't miss anything. You miss one week 
and you go back two. So I just didn't get in the miles I needed.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T To Take Japan Telecom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and British  
Telecommunications PLC have agreed to take a combined 30 percent 
stake in Japan Telecom Co. woth $1.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and BT will each hold a 15 percent stake in  
Japan Telecom, the companies said in a statement on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are planning a broad alliance in which AT&AMP;T and  
BT will integrate most of their Japanese operations with Japan 
Telecom's units. In addition, the two companies will dispatch 
executives to the Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom had reportedly been looking for a partner to  
survive tough competition, with many Japanese telecom companies 
cutting rates for domestic and international calls. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first joint investment by AT&AMP;T and BT since the two  
companies announced plans last summer their intention to form a 
global venture to serve international business customers and 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has one of the largest concentrations of multinational  
companies in the world,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and 
chief executive of AT&AMP;T. ``It's an essential growth opportunity for 
all three companies and it is essential that the global venture 
have a strong distributor in this key market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom is Japan's third-largest long-distance and  
international carrier, serving more than 17 million customers. It 
also has stakes in digital mobile companies that serve 6 million 
customers. Its biggest shareholder is East Japan Railway Co. being 
the biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long-distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while BT is Britain's biggest telecom company. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is the latest in a wave of recent telecom deals.  
Last week, Deutsche Telekom AG and Telecom Italia SpA announced 
plans to merge in an $82 billion deal, while AT&AMP;T launched a 
surprise $58 billion bid for cable company MediaOne Group.

<HEADLINE> ANSA: Telecom Italia Signs Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia will sign a preliminary agreement  
tomorrow to sell 65 percent of its pay-TV unit Stream, according to 
the Italian news agency ANSA. 
</P>
<P>
	ANSA said that it appeared that a final accord, however, was  
still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom, the former Italian telecommunications monopoly, is  
currently fighting a takeover bid by Olivetti, and last week 
announced it is trying to work out a megamerger with Deutsche 
Telekom worth more than $80 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to ANSA, Telecom Italia would keep 35 percent of  
Stream, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Europe would acquire 30 
percent, the Italian communications group Checchi Gori would buy a 
20 percent stake, and the remaining 15 percent would go to SDS, a 
company formed by four Italian soccer clubs, Roma, Lazio, 
Fiorentina and Parma. 
</P>
<P>
	Televising major league soccer games is seen in Italy as the big  
moneymaker for pay-TV. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gore Speaks at Detroit NAACP Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore on Sunday told the  
nation's largest branch of the NAACP that America's future depends 
on its ability to improve civil rights, including fighting 
challenges to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin Luther King died to give us civil rights,'' he told  
about 9,000 people at the NAACP Freedom Fund dinner. ``The least we 
can do is enforce those laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made his comments hours after attending a memorial service  
for victims of the Colorado massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stressed the importance of enhancing education for young  
Americans by hiring more teachers and reducing class sizes. He also 
urged more federal emphasis on improving economic climates in inner 
cities through loans and other funding. 
</P>
<P>
	And he asked for pressure on Congress to act on the Hate Crime  
Prevention Act of 1999, which would make racially motivated crime a 
federal offense. He called on lawmakers stymieing the legislation 
to ``stop hiding behind procedure and technicalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was delayed for Gore's visit to a memorial service  
for victims of the Littleton, Colo., shootings. Gore thanked the 
attendees for waiting until 9:30 p.m. to hear his comments, saying 
his remarks in Colorado were ``a mission I undertook on behalf of 
our country'' and in remembrance of ``each of the young people cut 
down at such an early age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore talked to reporters by phone on the flight from Colorado to  
Detroit, including several publications targeted to black readers. 
He spoke out against a ``right-wing coordinated effort to try to 
end affirmative action'' and racial profiling by law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also asked if he is considering a black running mate in  
the 2000 presidential race. He said he hasn't ``earned the right 
yet'' to make a long or short list of potential vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'd be getting ahead of myself if I did that.''  
</P>
<P>
	The annual Freedom Fund Dinner of the National Association for  
the Advancement of Colored People seeks to raise $1 million for the 
90-year-old civil rights group.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Demonstrations End Quietly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Operation Save America drew to a quiet  
close, ending a weeklong campaign against abortions that may have 
been most notable for what did not happen. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstrations did not draw large numbers. No one challenged  
a court-imposed no-protest zone outside clinics. No protesters were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said Operation Save America accomplished its goal of  
trying to steer people back toward their moral roots by attacking 
not just abortion, but child pornography, teen sex, homosexuality 
and the absence of God from the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	And they said they were so encouraged that on Saturday, during  
the final rally, the name of Operation Rescue National, one of the 
campaign's organizers, was changed to Operation Save America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do want to save this country, not just the unborn,'' said  
spokeswoman Eileen Schopf. ``We want to show our love for this 
country and our desire to return to the moral grounds this country 
was founded on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 200 to 250 abortion opponents were estimated to have taken  
part in events through the week, far fewer than the thousands who 
came to Buffalo during the 1992 Spring of Life abortion protests. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication how many people may have shied away from  
the week's events because of its timing. Operation Save America was 
announced a week after the last October's unsolved sniper killing 
of an abortion provider, Dr. Barnett Slepian, at his suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Murray, an attorney for the Slepian family, said the  
doctor's widow ``thinks it's despicable that in the aftermath of 
her husband's murder they would plan a rally trying to exploit his 
death and eliminate access to abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said a  
temporary restraining order, which kept protesters from 15 to 60 
feet from clinics that provide abortions, did its job.

bikes, treadmills and stair-climbing machines, Bruce Coolidge is 
looking for a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not his body he's worried about. It's his business.  
</P>
<P>
	Coolidge, general manager of a fitness club in Elk Grove,  
Calif., was in San Diego recently for one of the nation's largest 
specialty fitness trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Among stationary bikes with Internet access and treadmills with  
entertainment systems, he was looking for something that would keep 
his 5,000 members from fleeing to newer clubs, or quitting their 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're seeing a higher level of competition every year,'' he  
said. ``You're always trying to keep one step ahead of everybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This challenge isn't confined to Coolidge's club in the suburbs  
south of Sacramento. The International Health, Racquet &AMP; Sportsclub 
Association, the industry's largest trade group and host of the 
conference, estimates 35 percent of the nation's 29 million fitness 
club members quit each year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why there were 10,000 fitness club owners, managers and  
employees at the trade show and 300 companies displaying their 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibitors offered such new toys as a $13,000 electronic  
rock-climbing wall, a $5,000 device that simulates cross-country 
skiing, and a $32,000 fiberglass, egg-shaped pod that measures 
body-fat composition. 
</P>
<P>
	The items seem pricey, but Kyle Sexton, marketing director of  
the Gold's Gym in Salem, Ore., notes that the right piece of 
equipment can pay for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this would sell a lot of memberships,'' he  
said, gasping for air, as he stepped off a test of the climbing 
wall -- a constantly shifting, vertical treadmill that can simulate 
some of the world's famous peaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the more aggressive pitches came from San  
Francisco-based Netpulse, which sells a $3,000 computer terminal 
with high-speed Internet access for stationary bikes. The device is 
already in 300 clubs nationwide, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason almost 50 percent of people leave their health club  
is because they're bored,'' Netpulse spokesman Adam Handelsman 
said. ``It's the equipment. This gets them on the machine, and 
you'd be surprised at how fast a half-hour goes by.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Knight, owner of an 18,000-member club in Bellevue, Wash.,  
says his fitness center may soon install the Netpulse system or 
something similar. His membership includes some 12,000 employees of 
nearby Microsoft Corp., who may be more likely to need the 
high-tech stimulation or constant access to their Internet e-mail 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the service to give them something that's fun and  
new,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is so sure. Eric Yallen, who sells nutritional food  
at health clubs in Milwaukee, doubts that high-tech gadgetry will 
do much to spur fitness center memberships and that every year the 
convention attracts a new batch of far-fetched ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more than enough to entertain people. You don't need  
the Internet and being able to get your e-mail,'' Yallen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the equipment is so advanced. The trade show floor  
included demonstrations of $3 elastic bands for stretching classes 
and paraphernalia for aerobics, step and boxing classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Cotton, an exercise physiologist for the nonprofit  
watchdog group American Council on Exercise, said all anyone really 
needs to keep in shape is a simple weight set and a pair of running 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to join a club,'' he said. ``In fact, it's more  
convenient for many people just to exercise from home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton, who has helped the council expose dubious or fraudulent  
exercise devices, mainly available through television infomercials, 
generally liked most of what he saw on the convention floor. 
</P>
<P>
	At its best, he said, high-end workout gear and group classes  
can help motivate people and can provide a real physical challenge.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raises Bar for New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The door to NATO remains open to new members,  
but they may find getting over the threshold more difficult than 
the alliance's three newest members did. 
</P>
<P>
	The Membership Action Plan approved by participants at the  
weekend NATO summit provides no timetable for accession of new 
candidates nor any guarantee they will get in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, it establishes a program of activities designed ``to  
assist aspiring countries in their preparations for possible future 
membership.'' These include commitments to strengthen democracy, 
human rights, democratic control of the armed forces and programs 
to improve military cooperation with the 19 NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, what NATO appears to have done in the 10-page plan is  
to raise the bar for alliance membership. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slovenia's Foreign Minister Boris Frlec does not agree that  
starting accession negotiations now will become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the plan as a paved road leading to membership and we  
feel we already have fulfilled a number of the criteria it 
contains,'' Frlec said. ``It is meant to provide concrete help to 
countries that have ambitions to join.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vygaudas Usackas, the political director of Lithuania's Foreign  
Ministry, said the plan commits NATO members to helping countries 
that want to join through mutual engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the guidelines we have been waiting for,'' Usackas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summit communique, the prospective new members are named  
in groups. 
</P>
<P>
	They are Romania and Slovenia, which almost made it in at the  
last NATO summit, in Madrid, Spain, in 1997, when the alliance 
decided to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Then come the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and  
Lithuania. Bulgaria and Slovakia get separate mention for 
``positive developments'' since Madrid, meaning they have become 
more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the list are Macedonia and Albania, which are  
bearing the brunt of the refugee exodus from Kosovo but have no 
serious chance of joining for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia and Lithuania are most often cited as being at the top  
of the list under a plan that would take in one southern European 
country and one northern one. 
</P>
<P>
	But admitting Lithuania, which like its two Baltic neighbors  
were part of the former Soviet Union, could provoke a crisis with 
Russia. It has threatened to sever relations with NATO if any of 
the Baltic states join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever their chances of membership now, none of the  
prospective new members are likely to be admitted until early in 
the next century, officials in these countries have acknowledged. 
NATO members and officials have said the alliance needs time to get 
used to working with its three newest members. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the summit, countries that want to be in the next wave of  
expansion said they expected NATO members to provide them with a 
road map setting out what requirements they had to meet to join. 
</P>
<P>
	They were not disappointed. The Membership Action Plan outlines  
what aspiring countries have to do to strengthen their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The MAP, is a ``practical manifestation of the Open Door and has  
five chapters ... that highlight mechanisms through which 
preparation for possible eventual membership can be carried 
forward,'' the document says.

<HEADLINE> Two more Shooting Victims Buried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- He was a cross country runner who had  
recently returned from a two-week trip to Paris with the French 
club. She was an aspiring songwriter and author who was eager to 
get her driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered to  
remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16 -- just two of the 
13 lives cut short in a fusillade of bullets fired by two students 
at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners filed by the open caskets at St. Frances Cabrini  
Catholic Church before family members approached to give their 
final good-byes to the two sophomores. Mauser's father ran his 
fingers through his son's blond hair and kissed his face before 
lowering the casket lid. 
</P>
<P>
	The caskets were then pushed on carts to the center of the  
church and draped in white cloth. The victims' families, who held 
the dual funeral because they belong to neighboring churches of the 
same archdiocese, sat on either side of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Mass, Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput directed  
his remarks to the parents when he said: ``Tuesday was your descent 
into hell. I don't know any way we can describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass was held after 70,000 people attended an outdoor  
memorial service for all 13 victims attended by Vice President Al 
Gore and Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	The families grieved for Mauser, a thin, bespectacled sophomore  
who excelled in math and science, and earned straight A's on his 
last report card. He joined the debate team to overcome his 
shyness. 
</P>
<P>
	And they grieved for Fleming who moved to Littleton 18 months  
ago from Phoenix. She turned to writing song lyrics and fiction to 
express her feelings. She died while trying to help others. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting from a biblical passage, Chaput talked about a ``corrupt  
generation'' that could be saved by taking responsibility and 
repenting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our culture is a culture that is permeated by violence, and  
somehow we have allowed that to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``we are not powerless. We can repent ... We can  
change the structures of our society.''

<HEADLINE> Woody Allen Is a New Dad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Woody Allen is a new papa.  
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old filmmaker was seen -- and photographed -- pushing  
the new addition in a stroller with his 28-year-old wife, Soon-Yi 
Previn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just very pleased,'' Allen said in Sunday's Daily News.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple wouldn't say whether the 5-month-old girl named  
Bechet (Bih-SHAY) Dumaine Allen was adopted. Previn hasn't looked 
pregnant in recent photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby is named after the swing-era jazz clarinetist Sidney  
Bechet, according to the Daily News and Sunday's New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen and Previn married on Dec. 23, 1997, after Allen's falling  
out with Mia Farrow, his longtime lover and Previn's adoptive 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	During a court battle over custody of his children with Farrow,  
a judge slammed Allen as lacking ``any parenting skills.'' Farrow 
won custody and Allen is allowed only supervised visits.

<HEADLINE> NATO Supports Yugoslavia Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a summit-ending show of solidarity, NATO  
leaders promised military protection and economic aid to 
Yugoslavia's neighbors for standing with the West against Slobodan 
Milosevic. President Clinton, in a telephone call with Boris 
Yeltsin, urged Russia to press the Yugoslav president to accept a 
peaceful solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and fellow NATO leaders sat down Sunday with officials  
from the seven ``frontline states'' bordering Yugoslavia to hear 
firsthand reports. ``The nations of the region have risked, and 
even faced, armed confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and 
supporting our campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albania and Macedonia have been particularly hard hit, taking in  
nearly 500,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees fleeing from Yugoslav 
military action. The other neighboring countries are Bosnia, 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need help and we are giving it to them,'' NATO spokesman  
Jamie Shea said. ``We will not tolerate threats against them or 
attacks on them by Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up the three-day meeting, NATO Secretary-General Javier  
Solana said, ``The most important message that you are going to get 
from this summit is the determination of all the allies and all the 
partners to reverse the situation in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees are going to be back in their place, in their  
country, and ethnic cleansing will not be victorious in our 
continent as we approach the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Yeltsin talked for nearly an hour by phone. Russia  
has expressed outrage about NATO's airstrikes in Yugoslavia and has 
threatened to ignore a Western oil embargo. Yeltsin briefed Clinton 
on former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's mediation efforts in 
Belgrade, which NATO officials say have failed to produce results 
warranting a halt to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the call, arrangements were being made for a meeting  
in Europe between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and 
Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton believes Russia is very serious about trying to resolve  
the Kosovo crisis, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said. 
Clinton urged Yeltsin to continue peacemaking efforts and said the 
two leaders would stay in touch. They did not discuss NATO's 
threatened blockade of oil shipments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Russia would not be exempt from the embargo.  
``Obviously, any regime that we establish has to apply to 
everybody,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I would expect 
that the Russians would comply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 NATO allies met in a summit finale with leaders of two  
dozen other Central and Eastern European countries that have banded 
in partnership with the alliance. Russia boycotted in protest of 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious about inflaming tensions with Moscow further, the allies  
said they were trying to avoid a confrontation at sea over 
blockading oil supplies to Serbia. The summit authorized NATO 
military commanders to draw up plans to inspect ships suspected of 
carrying oil to Milosevic. Russia and Libya are Yugoslavia's main 
oil suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said commanders were  
``looking at options'' to avoid trouble with Russia. ``We have all 
avoided getting into a confrontation with the Russians,'' Albright 
said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. television. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers of the European Union will gather Monday in  
Luxembourg to ratify their oil embargo against Yugoslavia. Alastair 
Campbell, spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, played 
down the risk of confrontation if a Russian tanker refuses to abide 
by the embargo. ``The Russians have been helpful in this conflict 
and we are confident they will continue to be helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting here to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, summit  
leaders sent a message of unity and resolve demanding that 
Milosevic to back down. Over and over, Clinton and other Western 
leaders pledged that NATO would prevail, putting the alliance's 
prestige at stake. ``A just end to the conflict is essential to 
putting the entire region on the path to stability,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit concluded on day 33 of NATO airstrikes. The allies  
attacked south of the Yugoslav capital, bombing a communication 
tower at Mt. Avala, 10 miles south of Belgrade, and striking Mt. 
Gucevo, 60 miles southwest of Belgrade, where another radio and TV 
tower is located.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Olympics President Killanin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Lord Killanin, president of the  
International Olympic Committee during one of its most turbulent 
periods, died today. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin, who had been ill for some time, died at his home in  
Dublin, his family said. The cause of death was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	He became president of the IOC in 1972, taking over from  
American Avery Brundage just after the massacre of Israeli athletes 
and coaches at the Munich Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year as president, women became eligible for IOC  
membership. And unlike Brundage, Killanin accepted that change in 
the amateur status of Olympic athletes was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich massacre was followed in 1976 by the African boycott  
of the Montreal Olympics, and in 1980 the United States led a 
boycott of the Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left in 1980, the IOC was on the verge of bankruptcy and  
the Olympics were threatened with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then his successor, Spain's Juan Antonio Samaranch, has  
turned the Olympics into a multibillion-dollar industry, which is 
now going through its worst corruption scandal, a scheme to but IOC 
members' votes in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Killanin was born Michael Morris in London on July 30, 1914. His  
mother was Australian and his father was an officer in the Irish 
Guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Killanin always  
represented Ireland at home and abroad with style, distinction and 
integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a charismatic and dynamic individual who was passionate  
about every task he took on,'' Ahern said. ``We are deeply indebted 
to him and his family for his long years of public service to Irish 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was educated at Eton College, the Sorbonne in Paris and at  
Cambridge University, before embarking on a career in journalism in 
1935. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked as a war correspondent in China in 1937 and after the  
war wrote a political column. He later became a film producer, 
making such movies as ``The Playboy of the Western World'' and 
``The Quiet Man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.  
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

	NATO Concludes Anniversary Gathering  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 19-member North Atlantic Treaty  
Organization concludes a three-day meeting today marking the 50th 
anniversary of the powerful military alliance. Leaders of the 
alliance nations originally envisioned the summit as a gala 
celebration, but NATO's continuing air war against Yugoslavia and 
the crisis in Kosovo have dominated the gathering. Still, NATO 
promised a larger and more flexible military force ready for the 
first time to engage in conflicts in problems areas beyond the 
boundaries of the alliance's members.

	Yugoslavians Protest NATO Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO launched attacks south of the  
Yugoslav capital earlier today, after thousands of Belgrade 
residents protested an attack on Serb TV headquarters that local 
officials say killed 15 people and wounded 30. Belgrade residents 
carried candles and flowers during yesterday's march. From the 
march route, search crews could be seen digging through debris from 
the TV station, which was struck early Friday.

	Red Cross Wants Access to US POWs  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The head of the International  
Committee of the Red Cross arrived in Belgrade yesterday to appeal 
for immediate access to three captured U.S. servicemen. Cornelio 
Sommaruga was expected to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic on Monday before leaving Yugoslavia. He confirmed that he 
will ask why Yugoslav authorities have not responded to ICRC 
appeals for access to the three U.S. servicemen held by Belgrade 
since March 31.

	Diary of Suspected Shooter Released  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A handwritten diary written by one of  
the gunmen in the Columbine High School shooting spree shows the 
pair had been planning the attack for a year. Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone said the diary uses German phrases and that the 
assailants' reasoning behind the rampage was: ``We want to be 
different, we want to be strange and we don't want jocks or other 
people putting (us) down. ... We're going to punish you.'' Twelve 
students, one teacher and the two gunmen were killed in the 
murder-suicide massacre.

	PC Users Brace for 'Chernobyl' Virus  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive  
and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on 
Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can 
prevent infection. The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its 
most common version was programmed to activate on computers using 
Windows 95 and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the 
nuclear disaster in Ukraine. But warnings from many experts lacked 
any sense of panic or impending doom because the virus was 
discovered last summer, giving antivirus companies time to develop 
free software updates to identify and destroy it.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Feels Colo. Shooting Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNBLANE, Scotland (AP) -- In Dunblane, there is sympathy, anger  
and a sense of certainty that Littleton, Colo., will for years be 
tarnished with the memory of school murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in this close-knit town on the edge of the Scottish  
Highlands who still struggle with the impact of their own school 
massacre also offer empathy for a town thousands of miles away 
devastated by a murder-suicide rampage of two teen-age gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this early stage, words would be meaningless. One has to  
love them and hug them. It won't be the same again,'' said Basil 
O'Sullivan, a clergyman who comforted parents after the events that 
made Dunblane a synonym for grief. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 13, 1996, a local man armed with four handguns walked  
into Dunblane Primary School gymnasium where Gwenne Mayor's 
kindergarten class was gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Hamilton, 43, shot and killed Mrs. Mayor and 16 children.  
Ten pupils and two other teachers were also wounded before Hamilton 
killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The grief that emanated from Scotland spread out through much of  
the world, in part because the victims were so young -- mostly 
5-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Money, toys and letters flooded in. Funerals went on for days.  
Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and Princess Anne came to lay 
flowers among the thousands of bouquets at the school. The nation 
observed a minute of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst mass murder in modern British history, scarring  
Dunblane and forever branding it as a site of terror. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what happens in the world, if some connection can be  
made with Dunblane, we are news again,'' said Ann Dickson, a member 
of the region's Stirling Council and a 30-year resident of 
Dunblane. ``This is one of the most awful things that our bereaved 
families have to face. Normally, if you lose a member of your 
family, you are not reminded of it in such a brutal, violent way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ages of the children are different in Littleton, where  
teen-age gunmen killed their fellow students, a teacher and 
themselves. But for a parent that would make little difference, 
said Mick North, whose only daughter, Sophie, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	He had some advice for the bereaved families of Littleton: Don't  
let anyone tell you how to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Learn what is going to be supportive. Take care of yourself  
and your family first,'' said North, 51, a retired university 
lecturer. ``Don't worry about peoples' preconceived ideas about 
what you should be doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Littleton killers -- Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,  
17 -- Dunblane's gunman was considered an outsider. Like Littleton's 
killers, Hamilton was obsessed with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	North said he finally had to learn the background of his child's  
killer and see his photograph, recalling the confrontation with a 
deep sigh signaling he was uncomfortable with the very thought. 
Littleton's parents will have to make similar confrontations, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time I didn't want to know very much about him. It  
was a week and a half before I knew his name. I let him remain 
unknown for as long as I could,'' North said. 
</P>
<P>
	For communities as well as individuals, the impact of an event  
which casts such a blight is complex and difficult to handle 
without pain. Bereaved families try to cope with the misery of 
their loss, other townspeople wonder if their town will ever revert 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dunblane, the tourism industry -- and its jobs -- disappeared  
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists were quickly resented after arriving in large  
numbers. Three years later, they are still shunned by people angry 
about Dunblane's continuing association with violence, and by 
families who neither want nor need reminding that their children 
could have been Hamilton's victims too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Dunblane are irritated when the town is thrust back  
into the spotlight when something like this happens somewhere 
else,'' said Tim Bugler, a local journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Community workers and local government officials say it takes a  
long time to rebuild a community's reputation after ``seismic'' 
incidents like school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no textbook on how to cope, only the learning by  
experience,'' said Keith Yates, chief executive of Stirling 
Council, in a speech in Dunblane earlier this month to social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	First, there were immediate demands such as coordinating social  
workers, health professionals and voluntary organizations. Then 
there were the delicate long-term tasks of establishing when public 
grieving should come to an end -- something that could have caused 
tension between bereaved parents and the rest of Dunblane's 9,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, there were arguments about what to do with more $8  
million sent from people throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing the authorities have got to get right is to  
involve the community,'' said Mrs. Dickson. ``We kept people busy 
doing things, not sitting back. From that point of view, the 
gripes, the bitterness, was kept to a minimum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Britain, the longest-lasting effect of the Dunblane shooting  
was the tightening of Britain's gun laws. Handguns are now all but 
illegal, and the power of the U.S. National Rifle Association is 
greeted with incredulity by North. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason we campaigned so strongly was to stop the drift  
into any kind of gun culture on this side of the Atlantic,'' North 
said. ``I despair of what is going on in the states.''

<HEADLINE> No Move to Hollywood for Nichols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In all his years as a director, Mike Nichols has  
never been tempted to move to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't. There's a virus I have no protection against if I'm  
there: How am I perceived?'' Nichols said in Sunday's New York 
Times. ``And you can do whatever you like, put towels at the bottom 
of the door, not read the trades, which I have not done for 35 
years, if you're there long enough you will think, `But how am I 
perceived?' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're vulnerable to the virus, you've got to stay away  
from the matrix.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consummate New Yorker's many credits include ``The  
Graduate,'' for which he won an Academy Award, ``Catch-22'' and 
``Primary Colors'' and ``Silkwood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's being honored May 3 by the Film Society of Lincoln Center  
with a lifetime achievement award that first went to Charlie 
Chaplin in 1972 and last year went to Martin Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 67, humbly suggests his age was a factor.  
</P>
<P>
	``You run out of geezers very fast if you do these honor  
things,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Patient Honored at Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A boy who received multiple-organ transplants  
three times threw out the first pitch at Saturday's game between 
the Baltimore Orioles and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Canal, 14, of Wheaton smiled broadly as he bounced the  
ceremonial pitch on one hop to the team mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the age of 8, Canal has suffered from a condition in which  
the intestine twists spontaneously, cutting off blood flow and 
causing it to die. As a result, he developed short bowel syndrome 
and could only get his nutrition intravenously. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years of waiting, Daniel received his first multiple  
transplant last May, but his body rejected the organs. He received 
a second quadruple transplant in early June but those organs also 
failed and doctors operated again, this time June 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel received a new stomach, liver, pancreas and small  
intestine, and is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
	Some medical ethicists questioned the wisdom of allotting 12  
organs to a single patient when nearly 12,000 people are waiting 
for livers alone.

<HEADLINE> Comcast, MediaOne Deal in Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As Comcast Corp. watches a profitable bid  
for cable company MediaOne Group Inc. slip away, analysts expect it 
to target other companies as it seeks to develop a media 
supermarket of TV, telephone service and high-speed Internet 
connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast officials have declined to comment about their next move  
since AT&AMP;T made an unexpected bid for Englewood, Colo.-based 
MediaOne, the nation's fourth largest cable company with 5 million 
subscribers. MediaOne said it is reviewing the offer, but analysts 
say the proposal is a definite setback for No. 3 Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T on Thursday delivered a $58 billion offer of cash and stock  
to MediaOne in a deal that would make it the nation's largest cable 
provider with 17.5 million subscribers. Time Warner Inc. currently 
leads the industry with 12.6 million subscribers. Comcast has 6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T probably has strategic reasons above price for acquiring  
MediaOne, so they will win if there is a bidding situation,'' said 
Richard Read, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities, who has 
been following Comcast since the 1980s. ``If that happens, look to 
see other cable deals by Comcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, the nation's largest phone company, has been seeking a  
larger role in the cable industry, hoping to break into the 
lucrative local phone business by offering service via cable TV 
lines. Most recently, it acquired Tele-Communications Inc., which 
was the biggest deal up to now. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast's $49 billion stock swap offer for MediaOne would have  
created the industry's largest merger. But the offer is about 17 
percent lower than AT&AMP;T's deal, which also guarantees a payment of 
$85 a share to MediaOne shareholders even if AT&AMP;T share prices drop 
as much as 10 percent below $57. 
</P>
<P>
	With such a generous offer, Comcast has little choice but to  
re-examine its options as it seeks to become a powerhouse in the 
cable industry, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comcast is clearly disappointed in losing out, because that  
boxes them into a position of a super-regional as opposed to a 
national player,'' said Frederick Moran, an analyst at ING Baring 
Furman Selz LLC in New York. ``But I think shareholders will favor 
not countering the offer, because there would be too much dilution 
to win this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new Comcast would have owned cable systems throughout the  
eastern half of the United States, as well as California, Nevada, 
Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast has until late May to make a counteroffer to MediaOne.  
Its proposal had been approved by the boards of Comcast and 
MediaOne and Comcast will receive a $1.5 billion breakup fee if 
AT&AMP;T's bid is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	That fee, along with Comcast's sound financial health, makes it  
viable to pursue other acquisitions, said Merrill Lynch analyst 
Jessica Reif-Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cable systems, Philadelphia-based Comcast's  
interest include a 57 percent stake in the home-shopping network 
QVC; hockey's Philadelphia Flyers; basketball's Philadelphia 76ers; 
and stakes in the E! and Golf Channel cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real heartbreak for Comcast,'' Reif-Cohen said. ``But  
it's the best managed and has the best growth rate. If they don't 
make a bid, given their balance sheet, I think they will be 
aggressive in making other acquisitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cable operators have been scrambling to merge so they will have  
the financial clout and subscriber base to offer an ever-increasing 
number of channels and new services such as high-speed Internet 
access, which is expected to become widely available over the next 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Read said other possible targets for Comcast include No. 5 cable  
company Adelphia Communications Corp., No. 6 Cox Communications 
Inc. or smaller Charter Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably MediaOne is the best, (but) ... one way or another  
we're going to see continuing consolidation in this industry,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> End of an Era in Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Boasting two recently minted Super Bowl rings as  
well as the game's MVP award, John Elway is going out on top, much 
like Michael Jordan did four months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But, unlike Jordan, Elway leaves behind a team in good hands.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Denver Broncos' offense was a one-trick pony  
consisting of Elway and 10 other guys. Gradually, the Broncos 
became less of a showcase for one dazzling quarterback and more of 
a diversified offense with multiple weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with Elway's retirement set, the two-time Super Bowl  
champions, still loaded with stars such as Terrell Davis and 
Shannon Sharpe, must ponder life without magnificent No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, the master of improvisation and the late-game comeback,  
is leaving football after 16 NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway all but announced his retirement Saturday in an interview  
with Denver TV station KCNC in Pebble Beach, Calif., where he was 
playing in a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``For so many years everything in my family has revolved around  
me. It's time for that to change,'' the 38-year-old quarterback 
said. ``I really accomplished everything I wanted to. There's no 
real upside to coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Elway told The Associated Press: ``I know  
everybody wants to know, but I'm not going to talk about it right 
now. There'll be an announcement next week. That's all I have to 
say about it for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to Elway, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
he has told friends he is leaving the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway reportedly considered announcing his decision two weeks  
ago, but owner Pat Bowlen was in Australia promoting the Broncos' 
preseason game there. Then last week the announcement was put off 
because of the school shootings in suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of respect for the victims, some of whose funerals were  
scheduled for today, the Broncos further delayed an Elway 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're shooting for a mid-week press conference, most likely  
Wednesday,'' Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to him and he told me what he's going to do,''  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``But I'm not going to comment. 
I'm going to let John make his announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, while declining to confirm Elway's plans, said at a  
charity event Saturday night, ``I've known this was coming for a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen bought the Broncos in 1984 and never has known a team  
without Elway. ``I think it's going to be odd for all of us,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Terrell Davis told the Denver Post: ``This really  
lets some air out of your system. It's going to be tough to come 
back and not see him in the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think this year we're going to face as much adversity  
as we've ever faced. We're really going to see how much resolve 
this team has now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive guard Mark Schlereth, however, took another view.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the early years, it was a one-man show with John  
here,'' Schlereth said. ``It's not like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Elway acknowledged several seasons ago that it wasn't  
his team anymore. ``It's Terrell's team now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Elway earned his second straight Super Bowl title and the  
game's MVP honor last January with a 34-19 win over Atlanta, he 
missed all or part of six games with hamstring, back and rib 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was Davis, a 2,008-yard rusher and winner of the  
league's MVP award, who carried the team. 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway gone, Bubby Brister steps in. Brister slipped  
seamlessly into the lineup last season and guided the Broncos to a 
4-0 record in the games he started in place of the injured Elway. 
He engineered another win in a relief role. But how will he hold up 
during a 16-game schedule? And will Brister at QB put more pressure 
on Davis? 
</P>
<P>
	While expressing confidence in Brister, Shanahan apparently has  
some qualms about the new quarterback alignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who turns 37 in August, hasn't started more than eight  
games in a season since 1990. The backup is Brian Griese, a 
third-round draft choice in 1998 with limited experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the Denver Rocky Mountain News reported, the Broncos sought  
backup insurance Saturday by reaching an agreement in principle to 
sign Chris Miller, who turns 34 in August and retired four years 
ago because of concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister is looking forward to taking over an offense that tight  
end Sharpe likened to a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get in there and run the best machine in the  
business,'' he said. ``I'm not stupid. I know I'm not in this 
alone. We have Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe and great receivers 
and a great line. We have so much to work with.''

<HEADLINE> Funk Musician Troutman Fatally Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Funk musician Roger Troutman, of the duo  
Roger &AMP; Zapp, was shot to death Sunday, possibly by his brother in 
a murder-suicide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Troutman, 47, was found outside his northwest Dayton recording  
studio around 7 a.m. He had been shot several times in the torso 
and died while in surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital and Health 
Center, Dayton police Sgt. Gary White said. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Larry Troutman, 54, was found dead in a car a few  
blocks away with a gunshot wound to the head, White said. A handgun 
was found inside the car, which matched the description of a car 
leaving the scene of Roger Troutman's shooting, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're investigating Roger's death as a homicide. We're  
uncertain about the suicide aspect,'' White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators could know by Tuesday whether the gun was used in  
both shootings, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Unabomber's Brother Shares Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- David Kaczynski and Bill Babbitt share  
a common agony. Both loved mentally ill brothers who became 
killers. Both went to the police hoping to save their brothers from 
execution. Both have seen their families devastated by the glare of 
the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	And both are now trying to save Manuel Babbitt from being  
executed by injection at San Quentin Prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Manny was different, all along I knew he was different,  
and I should have done something sooner to help him. But I never 
thought he would kill anyone. How could I know that? How could I?'' 
Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned him in to save him, but I guess I didn't. I'm like a  
Judas of sorts who never collected his 30 pieces of silver,'' added 
Babbitt, who on Monday will formally plead for his brother's life 
before the Board of Prison Terms. 
</P>
<P>
	For David Kaczynski, Babbitt's pain is all too familiar.  
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's brother Ted, a Harvard-trained mathematician who  
became a forest recluse, engineered a 17-year bombing spree from a 
tiny Montana cabin that killed three people and injured 29 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Kaczynski, who is serving life in Florence, Colo., was  
captured on a tip from David, who recognized his brother's writing 
style in an anti-technology treatise. Ted was spared the death 
penalty in a plea bargain but is seeking a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuel Babbitt, a Vietnam veteran who was awarded the Purple  
Heart, turns 50 on May 3 and is scheduled to be executed the 
following morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of families have a Manny or a Ted. They are sitting on  
this information right now, but they fear coming forward. We came 
forward on our own volition to stop the violence,'' said Kaczynski, 
who said he identified deeply with Babbitt's emotional ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But both men also offered a darker message, urging families to  
be cautious of police investigators eager to crack a case. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very sympathetic. They assured me, 'We're going to  
get your brother the help he needs. They urged me to try to solicit 
a confession from him so it would expedite his 'care', so we threw 
open our doors to them,'' said Babbitt, whose brother was convicted 
of the 1980 murder of 78-year-old Leah Schendel during a robbery at 
her Sacramento apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, 'You don't have to worry about your brother going  
to the gas chamber. We're going to find a hospital for him, perhaps 
a place like Vacaville,''' he added, referring to the state prison 
that has a medical and psychiatric facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski said federal agents told him a similar scenario, that  
they would seek to make sure Ted received help for mental illness. 
He said he believed them ``up until the day (Attorney General) 
Janet Reno announced she would seek the death penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Kaczynski and Bill Babbitt have appeared at Capitol  
rallies to urge Gov. Gray Davis to spare Manuel Babbitt's life. On 
Thursday, the two led a demonstration on the Capitol's north steps 
and on Friday both attended a rally at the Capitol Park monument to 
California veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their chances of success are uncertain. The governor campaigned  
as a tough-on-crime proponent of the death penalty and in February 
refused to intervene in the first execution conducted since his 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Kaczynski, meanwhile, filed a federal motion Friday asking  
that his guilty plea be overturned and his case be reopened for a 
jury trial, despite the possibility that he could receive the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is no hope that I will ever be released then my life  
is of no value to me,'' he once said, ``So I have no hesitation in 
sacrificing it.''

<HEADLINE> Highway Named for DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city honored one of its most elegant,  
beloved sports heroes Sunday by putting his name on a dilapidated 
highway known for potholes and traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Side Highway became the Joe DiMaggio Highway in a  
ceremony attended by the granddaughters of the late New York 
Yankees' star, as well as team owner George Steinbrenner and former 
teammate and broadcaster Phil Rizzuto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you come up and down here, it's going to bring back  
memories,'' said Rizzuto, a Hall of Fame shortstop who played with 
DiMaggio in the 1940s and '50s. ``I know Joe is going to be looking 
down at the Yankees and he's going to be really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who guarded his privacy, had agreed with plans to  
place his name on the highway, since it would not replace anyone 
already honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``It warmed him to know it was going to happen,'' said  
granddaughter Kathie Stein. ``It's a great honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stein flew in for the ceremony from California with another of  
DiMaggio's granddaughters, Paula Hamra. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature voted unanimously to rename the highway,  
which runs north-south in Manhattan alongside the Hudson River, 
between Battery Place and West 72nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The name change is ceremonial, meaning signs and maps will still  
identify the road as the West Side Highway, which has been under 
reconstruction for much of the last two decades and is the scene of 
daily traffic backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional signs will be erected informing motorists that the  
stretch of the road had been named in honor of DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki had suggested that the Major Deegan  
Expressway, which runs by Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, be renamed 
for DiMaggio instead. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the governor was 
invited to Sunday's event but had a conflict and could not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the city renamed the Interboro Parkway for Jackie  
Robinson, who broke the major league racial barrier with the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner and Giuliani want to build a new Yankee Stadium on  
the West Side of Manhattan close to the highway's route, but many 
New Yorkers do not want it moved from the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if renaming the highway was related to the proposal,  
Steinbrenner said: ``We're not here to answer that. ... You're 
reading something into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really no connection between the two things,'' said  
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	A passerby wasn't so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very skeptical. It sounds more like a ploy to move the  
Yankees,'' said Frank Schafer, who was walking along the road as 
workers pulled down the prototype of a green-and-white Joe DiMaggio 
Highway sign that had been unveiled for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The renaming was one of several events this weekend to honor  
DiMaggio, who died March 8 at 84. On Friday, a memorial service was 
held at St. Patrick's Cathedral. On Sunday, a monument of the Hall 
of Famer was unveiled at Yankee Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Fans Flocked to 105th Penn Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Penn Relays had been run 104 times prior  
to this year. Never before had so many track fans filled the seats 
at Franklin Field. 
</P>
<P>
	A record crowd of 96,358 -- including 44,639 on Saturday for the  
final day of competition -- packed the stadium during the 105th 
running of the three-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Penn Relays always has a lively crowd. They make our job  
easy,'' said Maurice Greene, the world's No. 1 runner at 100 
meters. ``The more we hear their cheers, the more the fans get into 
the race, the more we get into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, one of the meet's top attractions along with Michael  
Johnson and Marion Jones, split in his two Saturday relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion and 200 world  
record-holder, ran an unofficial 19.2 seconds for 200 meters in 
anchoring Nike International to a 9-meter victory in the open 800 
relay. Johnson only had a 2-meter lead when he got the baton from 
Greene, but easily ran the final 200 unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also competed in the open 400 relay, but his swift anchor  
leg only earned Nike HSI a third-place finish at 39.50, behind Nike 
Elite (39.20) and Nike International (39.35). 
</P>
<P>
	It's just one of those things,'' Greene said of his non-winning  
effort. ``When you're on this level, there are just so many things 
that separate you from the next person. When you're running a 
relay, everything has to be almost perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, top-ranked in the world in the women's 100 and 200, also  
ran on two open relays and, like Greene, won one. Jones ran the 
second leg of the 400 relay team for Nike International that 
finished second, .01 seconds behind an Adidas team anchored by Toya 
Brown. Adidas was timed in 43.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, running anchor, overcame a deficit of two meters and  
raced to a 7-meter victory in the 800 relay. The team finished at 
1:30.23, nearly a second ahead of Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adidas men's team also turned in a tremendous effort in the  
1,600 relay. Michael McDonald, Antonio Pettigrew, Milton Campbell 
and Jerome Young became the first quartet to break 3 minutes at 
Penn, with a time of 2:58.52, the best in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the frustration that American track athletes feel over  
the lack of interest in their sport at home, the Penn Relays elicit 
opposite emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the greatest meet in America,'' said senior  
Seneca Lassiter who anchored Arkansas to relay championships in the 
4-mile race and 3,200-meter event, after having anchored the 
Razorbacks to the distance medley relay title Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those victories earned Lassiter the award as the outstanding  
track athlete in the meet for the second time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to running at Penn every year because I used to  
run here in high school, too,'' he said. ``To come back and win at 
college as a Razorback, that's one of the greatest feelings in the 
world. You have to be excited, you have thousands of people 
screaming and cheering for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach John McDonnell echoed the statements of his star  
runner and was completely satisfied with his squad's weekend 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you can win three relays here, in fact, anytime you  
can win one at Penn, it makes it a good year,'' he said. ``This is 
a heck of a meet, great competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter's efforts on Saturday included a mile of 3 minutes,  
55.6 seconds in the 4-mile relay, leading Arkansas to a collegiate 
record of 16:07.96, breaking the mark of 16.08.9. It was Arkansas' 
sixth straight title in the event and 14th in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very blessed that we were able to win all the relays,''  
Lassiter said. ``I was really looking forward, along with my other 
teammates, to breaking 16 (minutes) but we ended up getting the 
collegiate record so I'm happy with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the other men's college relays, the winners were Clemson in  
the 400 (39.48) and sprint medley (3:18.23), Florida in the 800 
(1:21.50) and Mississippi in the 1,600 (3:05.19). 
</P>
<P>
	The women's collegiate relay champions were LSU in the 800  
(1:32.46), Texas in the 1,600 (3:31.46), Seton Hall in the sprint 
medley (3:49.52) and Tulane in the distance medley (10:55.71).

<HEADLINE> Lott Says Social Security Bill Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress will not act this year to revitalize  
the Social Security system because President Clinton has failed to 
lead the way, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., also predicted Congress will add as much as $6  
billion to Clinton's $6.05 billion emergency request to finance the 
conflict in Yugoslavia. The money will come from Social Security's 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders spread word last week among GOP members  
in the House that trying to overhaul Social Security before the 
2000 election campaign could involve too much political risk 
without strong Democratic involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, we need some leadership from the president,'' Lott  
said. ``He backed away from real reform of Medicare. He's really 
proposed nothing on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically on ABC's ``This Week'' if Social Security is  
dead, Lott said: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it happening this year, because I don't believe  
the president will really honestly address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said Lott and other  
Republicans are the ones who have failed to present a plan for 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate majority leader, while criticizing the president's  
plans, has offered no specific measures of his own,'' Sperling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have made shoring up Social Security a primary goal  
of the 106th Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech in January, Clinton proposed  
setting aside most of the Social Security surplus to keep the 
system solvent when baby boomers begin retiring in a few years. The 
plan would invest some of the money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expected federal surplus is $110 billion, all from  
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the president complained in a statement about GOP  
reluctance to take up legislation to change Social Security. 
``Republican leaders have yet to consider my proposals or advance 
any of their own,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Sunday it is clear Social Security surpluses should be  
held in safekeeping for the nation's retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it in a lock-box. Have a procedure where it can't be just  
used for every spending program -- or for that matter tax cuts -- 
that comes along,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said dipping into the surplus for the campaign in Yugoslavia  
is required because Clinton requested the money on an emergency 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an emergency, if it is approved, that means it doesn't have  
to be offset by cutting other programs or other spending. It comes 
out of the surplus net,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only surplus we have is Social Security. But that's what  
the president has asked for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans understand that a military emergency would  
require using the surplus, ``but I think we need to understand: ... 
It's really coming from Social Security, which we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request was solely for money to cover the cost of the  
Kosovo conflict. Republicans have demanded add-ons to alleviate 
what they consider Clinton administration slights to the military. 
Some lawmakers have suggested raising the amount to $18 billion to 
$20 billion, or even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should take this opportunity to look at  
adding every military need might have been aware of,'' Lott said on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``I personally think it should include a pay  
raise'' and other things that would push the cost ``probably 
somewhere in the range of'' $10 billion to $12 billion. Lott 
previously advocated a bill of less than $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Elway All But Announces Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- For years, the Denver Broncos' offense consisted  
of John Elway and 10 other guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, the Broncos became more than a showcase for one  
dazzling quarterback. But now, with Elway's retirement set, the 
Super Bowl champions enter uncharted terrain. 
</P>
<P>
	After 16 seasons, the unparalleled master of the two-minute  
drill is leaving football. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway all but announced his retirement Saturday in an interview  
with Denver TV station KCNC in Pebble Beach, Calif., where he was 
playing in a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``For so many years everything in my family has revolved around  
me. It's time for that to change,'' the 38-year-old quarterback 
said. ``I really accomplished everything I wanted to. There's no 
real upside to coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Elway told The Associated Press: ``I know  
everybody wants to know, but I'm not going to talk about it right 
now. There'll be an announcement next week. That's all I have to 
say about it for now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to Elway, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
he has told friends he is leaving the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway reportedly considered announcing his decision two weeks  
ago, but owner Pat Bowlen was in Australia promoting the Broncos' 
preseason game there. Then last week, the announcement was put off 
because of the school shootings in suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of respect for the victims, some of whose funerals were  
scheduled for Monday, the Broncos further delayed an Elway 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're shooting for a mid-week press conference, most likely  
Wednesday,'' Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to him and he told me what he's going to do,''  
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said. ``But I'm not going to comment. 
I'm going to let John make his announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen, while declining to confirm Elway's plans, said at a  
charity event Saturday night: ``I've known this was coming for a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowlen bought the Broncos in 1984 and never has known a team  
without Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be odd for all of us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Running back Terrell Davis told the Denver Post: ``This really  
lets some air out of your system. It's going to be tough to come 
back and not see him in the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think this year we're going to face as much adversity  
as we've ever faced. We're really going to see how much resolve 
this team has now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But offensive guard Mark Schlereth took another view.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think in the early years, it was a one-man show with John  
here,'' Schlereth said. ``It's not like that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Elway acknowledged several seasons ago that it wasn't  
his team anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Terrell's team now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While Elway earned his second straight Super Bowl title and the  
game's MVP honor last January with a 34-19 win over Atlanta, he 
missed all or part of six games with hamstring, back and rib 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was Davis, a 2,008-yard rusher and winner of the  
league's MVP award, who carried the team. 
</P>
<P>
	With Elway gone, Bubby Brister steps in. Brister slipped  
seamlessly into the lineup last season and guided the Broncos to a 
4-0 record while Elway was out. But how will he hold up during a 
16-game schedule? And will Brister at QB put more pressure on 
Davis? 
</P>
<P>
	Even Shanahan has some qualms about his new quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	Brister, who turns 37 in August, hasn't started more than eight  
games in a season since 1990. The backup is Brian Griese, a 
third-round draft choice in 1998 with limited experience. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the Denver Rocky Mountain News reported, the Broncos agreed  
to sign Chris Miller, who turns 34 in August and retired four years 
ago because of concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great addition,'' Brister said. ``If something happens,  
he has a lot of experience. You can't have enough good 
quarterbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brister is looking forward to taking over an offense that tight  
end Shannon Sharpe likened to a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to get in there and run the best machine in the  
business,'' he said. ``I'm not stupid. I know I'm not in this 
alone. We have Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe and great receivers 
and a great line. We have so much to work with.''

<HEADLINE> A Less Than `Fascinating Rhythm' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What were they thinking when they thought of  
doing ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm''? 
</P>
<P>
	Not that you can't play around with the classic songs of George  
and Ira Gershwin, dousing them in a modern sensibility that makes 
audiences sit up and listen. Look what Ella Fitzgerald did with her 
jazz-tinged ``Gershwin Songbook,'' one of the definitive recordings 
of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	But this new musical revue at Broadway's Longacre Theater is  
something else entirely. Instead of celebrating the Gershwin 
brothers, ``Fascinating Rhythm'' diminishes them. It distorts 
George's music with glossy yet uninviting arrangements and 
obliterates Ira's lyrics with overdone, often frantic renditions by 
performers who have been instructed well in the hard-sell approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Lamos and Mel Marvin, who came up with the idea for this  
misguided show, can't leave the songs, most of them written in the 
1920s and '30s, alone. They impose an extra level of activity on 
more than one well-known melody. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Fascinating Rhythm'' certainly is filled with standards --  
starting with the title tune and working its way through ``The Man 
I Love,'' ``Love Is Here to Stay,'' ``I Got Rhythm,'' ``Someone to 
Watch Over Me,'' ``Embraceable You'' and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider what Lamos, who also directed the revue, has done to  
tart up some numbers. ``But Not for Me'' has been jacked up -- from 
a plaintive rueful refrain to a wail of self-absorption that 
wouldn't pass muster on most easy-listening radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'' transforms Ira Gershwin's  
witty banter into a screaming match, while ``Isn't It a Pity?'' 
becomes a love duet for two women, a gender-bending moment that 
seems to be thrown in solely for novelty's sake. 
</P>
<P>
	And the evening's finale, ``Hang on to Me,'' once a sweet little  
ditty for the young dance team of Fred and Adele Astaire, has been 
inflated into an all-encompassing friendship anthem that rivals 
``Seasons of Love'' from ``Rent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is some nice juxtaposition of songs -- pairing two femme  
fatale comedy numbers -- ``My Cousin from Milwaukee'' and ``The 
Lorelei,'' for example. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, the cast appears mechanically programmed,  
unable to let their considerable musical-theater talents shine 
through. One exception is Sara Ramirez, whose flair for comedy in 
``Just Another Rhumba,'' one of the Gershwins' lesser known 
efforts, is welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
	David Marques' choreography is hard-driving yet aimless, more  
distracting than discerning in its attempt to complement individual 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The backdrops by designer Michael Yeargan are variations on the  
expanding and contracting lens of a camera, stylish apertures that 
at least frame the performers well. 
</P>

	You can't say ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm'' doesn't have  
a concept. Too bad it is such a wrong-headed idea, one that in the 
end smothers rather than showcases the songs.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Want To Forget Game 2 Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers want to come down  
with a case of amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
	They remember the first 58 minutes of Game 2 against Toronto,  
when their tight-checking defense rendered the Maple Leafs' 
high-powered offense scoreless. What they want to forget before the 
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series resumes Monday is the last 
two minutes, when Toronto scored two goals in a 2-1 win to even the 
series at one game apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Desjardins said the Flyers have to put the third-period  
collapse out of their mind as quickly as a Maple Leafs odd-man 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen quick in the playoffs,'' Desjardins said after  
practice Sunday. ``You think about what happens in the past and the 
first thing you know it's over, and you're golfing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while the thought of Saturday's stunning loss still lingered,  
the Flyers tried to concentrate on the good things. Take away Game 
2's last two minutes and the ``Broad Street Bullies'' certainly 
lived up to their nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie John Vanbiesbrouck had been superb in goal in Game 1,  
holding the highest-scoring team in the league without a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Flyers led 1-0 going into the third behind  
Keith Jones' acrobatic goal, good forechecking and outstanding 
penalty killing. In one stretch of three Toronto power plays, the 
Flyers had three scoring chances while allowing one relatively 
harmless shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto coach Pat Quinn took notice, and expects to see the  
Flyers use the same recipe on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been slow to move the puck and a lot of it is because  
they've been very aggressive. And their checking has been 
excellent.'' Quinn said. ``We bought ourselves a breather evening 
the series up and hopefully we can go into Philly and take a step 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mats Sundin, whose goal with 52.4 seconds left clinched  
Toronto's dramatic win, said the Maple Leafs must do a better job 
in transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems we can't get any chances to get 2-on-1s or get our  
momentum going or our transition game,'' said Sundin, who led 
Toronto in the regular season with 83 points. ``We played pretty 
well defensively, too. If we have to win this way, it's nice to see 
we can do it, that we can play strong defensively, and be patient 
and wait for our chances to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may be a little tougher on Philadelphia's home ice, even  
without star center Eric Lindros, who is still recovering from a 
collapsed right lung. The Flyers' 21-9-11 record tied the Boston 
Bruins for the best home mark in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Games 3 and 4 are in Philadelphia on Monday and Wednesday, and  
Game 5 will be back at the Air Canada Centre on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played a really solid game but now it's back to our barn,''  
said defenseman Chris Therien, who allowed Steve Thomas to cut 
around him late in the third period Saturday and score on 
backhander past John Vanbiesbrouck. ``We wanted the two wins but 
everybody is pretty positive about how we're playing and know how 
we have to play to be successful.''

<HEADLINE> Littleton Churchgoers Seek Answers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In houses of worship around the country, religious leaders and  
congregants struggled to comprehend the rampage at Columbine High 
School and how mankind may ``find our way more easily through this 
dark valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Churchgoers turned to their ministers and priests Sunday for  
answers. They clasped hands and whispered prayers, searching for 
the unfathomable: why two outcast students thought guns, bombs and 
suicide were the solution to their adolescent problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before thousands of mourners attended a memorial service  
in Littleton, Colo., the Rev. Richard R. Wolschlaeger asked his 
congregation in Swarthmore, Pa.: ``What are we to do with the 
horror of Littleton?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How will adolescents who have witnessed first hand such wanton  
human evil ever be able to hear the shepherd's voice again to lead 
them from despair to the promise of abundant life?'' he asked. 
``Frankly, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preaching to several hundred people at Swarthmore Presbyterian  
Church, Wolschlaeger faulted society for providing children ``the 
know-how to be effective, if not sophisticated, mass killers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The role of parents in bringing up children was a recurrent  
theme. 
</P>
<P>
	With a youth choir seated behind him, the Rev. Jim Holley at  
Detroit's Historic Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church asked the 
congregation to take a moment and pray for all parents, not just 
those in Littleton, who are burying their children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just goes to show you that we need to know what our  
children are doing,'' Holley said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, Roman Catholic Cardinal Bernard Law said the nation  
has made guns ``too accessible and too acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the public's growing questions about why the parents  
of the gunmen couldn't -- or didn't -- prevent the tragedy, Law 
cautioned against laying too much blame. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an effort to supply some solace, he spoke of shooting  
victim Cassie Bernall, a 17-year-old born-again Christian who was 
active in church youth programs and Bible study groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knew that no fatal gunshot could ever rob her of that  
abundant life,'' Law said. ``May we find our way more easily 
through this dark valley.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clergy in Chicago said the young attackers were lost to evil  
influences. Surrounded by children at the altar, the Rev. Susan 
Swanson of Luther Memorial Church asked: ``How do we respond? How 
do we protect our children?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she offered an answer: ``Take off the earphones, turn off  
the TV, turn down the radio,'' she said. ``Start speaking words of 
love and kindness in our families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle-class suburb of Plano, Texas, north of Dallas, the  
interdenominational Metro Family Church called on its youth group 
members to honor the Colorado victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The town of about 200,000 has lost at least a dozen of its own  
teen-agers to heroin overdoses in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor Randy Bailey asked the congregation to pray not only for  
the victims in Colorado, but also for the families of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Lord would have us do nothing less,'' Bailey said. ``We  
are Americans. These are our kids. Fifteen of our kids were taken 
from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Bailey read the names of each victim, a youth group member  
walked to the front of the sanctuary and lighted a candle. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people cried.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard,'' said Ashleigh Jones, 18. ``I kept thinking  
if it happened to me, what impact would my life have had?''

<HEADLINE> BYU Athletes Take Gymnastics Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Guard Young and Cortney Bramwell are doing  
all they can to make sure Brigham Young's gymnastics program goes 
out with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	Young won the vault and Bramwell won the rings Saturday night as  
the NCAA men's gymnastics championships concluded with individual 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Bramwell were BYU's first individual champions since  
1975, and their titles came just three weeks after they learned the 
school will discontinue its program after next season. Both will be 
seniors next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty frustrating,'' Bramwell said. ``BYU is doing  
better as a program than it has ever done, and now we're being 
dropped. It's tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bramwell scored a 9.925 to finish the season unbeaten in rings.  
Young, whose father Wayne won the 1974 NCAA all-around title, 
scored 9.8125 in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's Todd Bishop, the 1999 Nissen Award winner as the  
nation's top senior gymnast, won his second straight high bar title 
with a 9.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have been disappointed if I hadn't won again,'' Bishop  
said. ``It comes with the territory, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan sophomore Justin Toman, who on Friday night led the  
Wolverines to their first team title since 1970, won the parallel 
bars with a 9.8375. Toman also finished fifth on the pommel horse 
and third on the high bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska sophomore Jason Hardabura, the winner of Thursday's  
all-around championship, took the floor exercise with a 9.8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ecstatic I won on the floor because the floor is not my  
forte,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State junior Brandon Stefaniak was the pommel horse  
champion, scoring a 9.775.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Look Forward To Home Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Home-ice advantage may diminish in the  
playoffs when both teams play with intensity. It doesn't disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Good for the Boston Bruins.  
</P>
<P>
	After splitting their first two playoff games on the road  
against the Carolina Hurricanes, they're home for the next two 
games of the best-of-7 series, Monday night and Wednesday night. 
And that means more than just having supportive fans. 
</P>
<P>
	It means Boston coach Pat Burns has the last chance to send his  
players on the ice after Carolina coach Paul Maurice has sent out 
his. And that can mean better matchups for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``One good thing is the shift changes,'' Bruins goalie Byron  
Dafoe said after the team's light workout Sunday. ``We can match 
lines and match defensemen, which is important in a seven-game 
series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot has to do with mixing and matching lines,'' forward  
Shawn Bates said. ``If we throw out our fourth line (on the road), 
they can throw out their first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins have just a 1-4 playoff record at the FleetCenter  
since they began playing there in the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But they've been much better at home this season (22-10-9) than  
on the road (17-20-4). Carolina was four games over .500 overall 
but four games under .500 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a big deal,'' Boston forward Jason Allison  
said of playing at home. ``Last year, both our (playoff) wins were 
on the road. We didn't win one at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins need to play more aggressively at the start of the  
games. They think increased fan support will help them do that. The 
Hurricanes may have started Game 1 with too much excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost that 2-0 before rebounding from a 2-1 deficit Saturday  
night for a 3-2 overtime win. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Game 2, we came out in a more consistent pace,'' Carolina  
coach Paul Maurice said. ``We were still strong and we had a good 
start, but nothing like the first game. There were a lot of guys 
just dying to get out there that first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins said they need to be more patient in setting up plays  
even when they're being pressured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not making plays. We're throwing the puck away when we  
get it,'' Allison said. ``It's hard to get in the flow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina also was able to score three times Saturday night  
against Dafoe, who led the NHL with 10 regular-season shutouts, 
then added another in the playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure he was rattled,'' Maurice said, ``but when you  
have speed and are driving the net it is hard for a goaltender to 
get comfortable. When in doubt, put it at the net and I think it 
helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's how the Hurricanes scored the winning goal Saturday night  
at 17:05 of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Steve Chiasson took a slap shot that Dafoe stopped  
but couldn't control. Martin Gelinas then shot the puck off the 
left post. It went to Ray Sheppard, who got his second goal of the 
game for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime, ``is a lot more pressure, but it's fun,'' Dafoe said.  
``Obviously, if you can win it in regulation, I'll take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins get another chance to do that Monday night in front  
of their home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home ice only means something if you win your games,'' Boston  
defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``If you're going to get anywhere (in 
the playoffs), you've got to be able to win anywhere.''

 *Roman Hruska    	
</P>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Former U.S. Sen. Roman Hruska, whose lengthy  
career as a conservative Republican was largely overshadowed by a 
remark about mediocrity, died Sunday from complications stemming 
from a fall that broke his hip. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was the ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary  
Committee when he retired in 1976. He was credited with wielding 
substantial influence in helping develop much of the nation's 
criminal justice policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to serve as an  
associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court that brought national 
notoriety to Hruska. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech before the Senate in March of 1970, Hruska responded  
to critics who said Carswell had at best been a mediocre federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges  
and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little 
representation, aren't they, and a little chance?'' Hruska said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quote was quickly shortened, in the vernacular and street  
talk of the time, to ``What's wrong with a little mediocrity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the  
Omaha-dominated 2nd District in 1952. He resigned in 1954 to serve 
the unexpired four years remaining in the term of the late U.S. 
Sen. Hugh Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was then re-elected for a full six-year term in 1958. He  
won re-election in 1958, 1964 and 1970.

 *Lord Killanin    	
</P>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Lord Killanin, who presided over the  
International Olympic Committee during one of its most turbulent 
periods, died Sunday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Killanin became president of the IOC in 1972, just after  
the massacre of Israeli athletes and coaches at the Munich Olympics 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first year as president, women became eligible for IOC  
membership. Lord Killanin also accepted that infringements of the 
amateur status requirement by Olympic athletes was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Killanin's eight-year tenure was one of the most turbulent  
times in the Olympic movement's 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1972 Munich massacre was followed in 1976 by the African  
boycott of the Montreal Olympics, and in 1980 the Americans led a 
boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	When he left in 1980, the IOC was on the verge of bankruptcy and  
the Olympics were threatened with extinction.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Facing Airfare Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Competition already heating up between Sun Country and Northwest    	
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Air travelers who had been waiting for Sun  
Country Airlines to begin low-fare competition against Northwest 
Airlines out of the Twin Cities are seeing summer travel bargains 
already. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, Sun Country's challenge to Northwest's dominance on  
14 popular Twin Cities routes won't start until June 1. But the 
contest, which promises to be costly for the competitors, already 
has opened on a limited front. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen Northwest do anything like this before,'' said  
George Wozniak, president of Minneapolis-based Hobbit Travel. 
``They're pulling out all the stops. They're acting like American 
Airlines is coming in to challenge them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest carrier, has 410  
aircraft. Sun Country has 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The clearest evidence of an emerging price war is on routes to  
Milwaukee and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are definitely cutting fares,'' said Jodi Villarreal, a  
travel manager for St. Paul-based Midwest Sign &AMP; Screen Printing 
Supply Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Villarreal said a recent $75 one-way fare to Milwaukee on  
Northwest was one-fourth the price her company usually pays. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt in my mind it's a reaction to Sun Country,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said the airline on Monday began  
offering $69 one-way fares on certain flights to Milwaukee with a 
three-day advance purchase restriction. Northwest also has rolled 
out a $138 round-trip fare available on all its flights from the 
Twin Cities to Milwaukee with a Saturday night stay and seven-day 
advance purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest is not yet offering the same low fares as Sun Country  
on every Northwest flight to every city Sun Country flies. But 
starting June 1, Sun Country expects Northwest to match it 
fare-for-fare on most flights, said Paul Miller, Sun Country's vice 
president of marketing and planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Estep, president of Topaz International Ltd., an airfare  
auditing and travel management consulting firm, said ``the 
consumers will make out like bandits, but I don't think either 
company will do very well.''

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Leader on Familiar Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a remarkable achievement by any  
measure: After a half-century in America, Valdas Adamkus returned 
to Lithuania and at 71 was elected president of the homeland he 
fled during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he also published an underground newspaper as a youth in  
Lithuania and fought with countrymen against the Soviet army. In 
the United States, he rose from penniless immigrant to a federal 
environmental regulator who stood down the Reagan administration 
over its coziness with corporate polluters. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not done.  
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Adamkus came back to the country he called home  
for two-thirds of his life to participate in NATO's 50th 
anniversary summit. His new mission: membership in the military 
alliance for Lithuania, the biggest of the Baltic states but the 
slowest at recovering economically from decades of communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamkus, elected 14 months ago, has been back many times, to New  
York, to Washington and to the Chicago suburb where he just sold 
his house this weekend. And the former American -- he relinquished 
his U.S. citizenship to be Lithuania's president -- is ecstatic to 
be leading his beloved homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, something about this visit -- the meetings on Capitol Hill  
and with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, even Washington's 
just-blooming dogwoods -- brought pangs of homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked around and suddenly it struck me: I am coming home?  
Or am I coming here as a guest?'' the bearlike Adamkus said in his 
Lithuanian-accented English during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart, my thinking, my philosophy, definitely I never  
questioned where are my roots, where is my home, where I came from, 
where my dedication is. But physically when you live outside for 50 
years ... this was part of your life and you simply cannot wipe 
this out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also disconcerting has been the transition from regular Valdas  
to President Adamkus, from modest Midwest home to residence in a 
14th-century palace. Constant bodyguard protection means few 
opportunities for him and his wife, Alma, to dine with friends, or 
even go to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still uncomfortable when I am being driven with the  
lights and sirens,'' he said. ``I almost say, `Cut it out, don't 
make those people nervous.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He even donates his $35,000 presidential salary to charity,  
relying on the $60,000 pension he earned when he retired in 1996 
from the Environmental Protection Agency, where he was the agency's 
top official in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lithuania, the presidency is a largely ceremonial,  
foreign-policy oriented job. Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas 
said that at first he doubted Adamkus could handle the job. But 
Adamkus' efficiency and ability to compromise proved Saudargas 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``His abilities and his experience living in a country of so  
great a democratic tradition -- that is a specific asset,'' 
Saudargas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamkus' pals joke about their old friend's new status.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what to say, `Your Excellency' or `Valdas.' I do  
have that crisis,'' said Algimantus Kezelis, a Chicago lawyer and 
friend since college. ``But I'll survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friends are proud of Adamkus' latest achievement and say his  
single-mindedness, ambition, love for Lithuania made it not so 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had every reason in the world to kick back and put his feet  
up'' after retiring, said Frank Corrado, an EPA colleague. ``But he 
heard the call. ... I guess it's his destiny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adamkus' destiny, though, took a circuitous route.  
</P>
<P>
	Now 72, he fled to Germany with his family in 1944, only to  
return to Lithuania months later briefly to fight the Soviet 
invaders. Back in German refugee camps, Adamkus attended school for 
a few years before the family left for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Adamkus joined the U.S. Army and went to Fort Riley in Kansas.  
By 1949, he was working in an auto parts factory in Chicago. Years 
later, he earned an engineering degree and started a long career 
with the EPA. He also remained active in the strong local 
Lithuanian-American community and in Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, he began rebuilding ties with his homeland through  
frequent EPA trips to the Soviet Union. When Lithuania gained 
independence in 1990, Adamkus became even more involved, taking 
vacations there and renting an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Running for the presidency at others' urging, he won only after  
a long court battle to remain on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Kezelis said he and Adamkus both feel a little ``'twixt and  
'tween'' two countries. ``But he chose to jump over the fence and 
say, `Forget my 30 years in exile. I'm one of you.'''

<HEADLINE> GOP Group Ponders 2000 Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, Calif. (AP) -- When the California Republican Assembly  
gathered over the weekend to scrutinize five White House hopefuls, 
it faced a dilemma: Should it endorse a soul mate or a winner? 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, the influential CRA -- a wing of the state GOP --  
backs candidates who best embody its conservative philosophy on 
such issues as lowering taxes, banning abortion and fighting 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate's prospects for winning theoretically come second.  
But after six years of Democratic White House control, the CRA is 
hungry for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The word ``win'' kept popping up as Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes,  
Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire made 
their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what qualities he sought in a presidential nominee, CRA  
member Jesse Ring didn't hesitate: ``Somebody who can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the CRA, which calls itself ``the conscience  
of the GOP,'' made it clear it would not tolerate soft-pedaling on 
core conservatives issues. 
</P>
<P>
	When CRA President John Courtney mockingly reported in a speech  
that some critics and even fellow Republicans believe the party 
should moderate its stances, his audience cried, ``Never! No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Courtney bristled on Saturday when asked whether CRA members  
were more inclined to back a winner or someone who mirrors its 
principles. Two-thirds of Californians, after all, back a woman's 
right to obtain an abortion, according to a recent Field Poll, and 
some GOP candidates oppose abortion less fervently than others. 
</P>
<P>
	``That question is often asked about conservatives, that somehow  
we just like to jump off cliffs and we don't care about winning in 
politics,'' he said. ``We take winning very, very seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stakes are high for White House hopefuls angling for the  
CRA's endorsement, to be issued in November. The California primary 
is four months later, and it is being held earlier than ever to 
force candidates to pay attention to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The five who came over the weekend all live on the East Coast.  
Several came solely for the CRA's annual convention here on the 
fringe of Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The CRA has thousands of members known for their activism, and  
once the group issues its endorsement, they will hit the streets to 
support the candidate of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an important group,'' Forbes said at a poolside  
reception. ``They do provide energy, they do provide principle, 
they do provide a sense of purpose, and that's what the Republican 
Party needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he had come across the country for the group's  
endorsement, Bauer said, ``I'd like that very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I come because these are my people,'' Keyes said Sunday. Keyes  
won the rank-and-file vote for CRA endorsement in 1996, but the 
group failed to reach its required two-thirds threshold, so it did 
not endorse anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``This group has a lot of people in it who believe in the  
priorities that I represent, who think that the moral crisis and 
condition of the country ought to be our top priority, and who see 
how that relates to all the other areas -- foreign policy, domestic 
policy, etcetera,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the presidential hopefuls gave speeches tailored to  
strike conservative chords. 
</P>
<P>
	They denounced the decline of moral values and pledged to outlaw  
abortions, lower taxes and expand the military. They also were 
critical of the NATO action in Yugoslavia, saying President Clinton 
had botched the bombing campaign. Equally important, some burnished 
their ``winner'' images. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer acknowledged he was an underdog, but distributed a poll  
showing him at No. 2 when those surveyed were only told of the 
candidates' credentials and not their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, long a darling of the CRA, exuded confidence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can win this battle, not only to take over this party  
nationally, but to take over America in the year 2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only candidate missing who is styling himself as very  
conservative was former Vice President Dan Quayle, who had a prior 
commitment, according to Courtney. 
</P>
<P>
	The two candidates leading in most polls -- Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush and Bob Dole's wife, Elizabeth Dole -- did not come. Both are 
generally more moderate than most CRA members. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has said he will not leave his state until his Legislature  
completes its session later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The invitation to Mrs. Dole went out late because she only  
formed her presidential exploratory committee a few weeks ago, 
Courtney said. In addition, her staff indicated she preferred to 
make appearances where she could also raise money. The CRA 
convention is not such an event. 
</P>
<P>
	``These candidates come here at their own expense. We're not  
paying them to come here,'' Courtney said.

<HEADLINE> NRA Says Prosecution Is the Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Justice Department official said Sunday  
the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., demonstrate the need to 
restrict youngsters' access to guns, while the National Rifle 
Association believes more prosecutions of gun offenses could 
prevent such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and NRA executive vice  
president Wayne LaPierre did agree that juveniles convicted of a 
violent crime should be barred from ever owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder, Justice's second-ranking official, said on CBS' ``Face  
the Nation'' that stricter gun laws ``would certainly help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Congress to act quickly on an administration proposal  
extending the Brady Law, which imposes background checks on 
gun-buyers, to cover juveniles. The administration also is pushing 
a bill that would require trigger locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying ``we need to deal with adults who make guns  
available to kids,'' Holder described as ``very dangerous 
concepts'' some proposals to hold parents accountable if they 
``should have known'' their children had guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said  
it was important to find out how the two students suspected in the 
shootings got their weapons, as well as ``what the parents knew or 
should have known and take appropriate steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Holder said the NRA and other gun groups should support  
``reasonable regulations'' on the use and possession of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre, also on CBS, agreed that violent juveniles ``should  
forever be prohibited from owning a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said stepping up prosecutions of gun law offenses was the  
best way to prevent shootings such as last week's at Columbine High 
School, in one teacher and 14 students, including the two suspects, 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of lax prosecutions of gun offenses, LaPierre said  
in the past two years there have been 6,000 incidents of guns 
showing up in schools, but only 13 prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NRA support for state laws allowing people with permits  
to carry concealed weapons was ``simply off the point'' from the 
school shootings. People who apply for permits are not the type to 
commit crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his Saturday radio address, said he would  
push for legislation that would crack down on gun shows and illegal 
gun trafficking, prohibit violent juveniles from buying guns and 
close loopholes that let juveniles own assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	There are dozens of gun-control bills pending in Congress, but  
chances of passage are uncertain under a Republican majority that 
generally has opposed new restrictions on gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a united effort on the part of our people  
to determine that we just have got to reduce the access to these 
kinds of weapons that again have no sporting purpose,'' said Sen. 
Carl Levin, D-Mich., on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press''  
that it was time to form a national commission, with 
representatives from the entertainment and gun industries, to study 
the causes and prevention of youth violence.

<HEADLINE> 2 McCaughey Septuplets May Be Sick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLISLE, Iowa (AP) -- Two of the 17-month-old McCaughey  
septuplets are growing so slowly that there's concern they may have 
cerebral palsy, their mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nathan and Alexis are being monitored for the disorder,  
their pediatrician is not ready to make a diagnosis, Bobbi 
McCaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there are some signs of something that could be  
long-term, they don't have to mean that,'' she said in Sunday's Des 
Moines Register. ``They could just be muscle issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Alexis can't yet sit up by herself, Mrs. McCaughey said,  
she can stay upright once someone puts her in a sitting position. 
Dr. Peter Hetherington, the children's doctor, has said that 
Alexis' lack of strength could stem from her difficulty in getting 
enough food to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexis weighs just over 15 pounds -- up from 12 in January -- and  
is still fed through a tube in her stomach. She has severe reflux 
and vomits frequently. She became dehydrated and lost weight while 
hospitalized for nine days in January with flu and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan weighs 20 pounds. The newspaper did not say what the  
other children weigh and there was no additional comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the firm that handles all of the McCaughey's public  
relations, the Ambassador Agency of Nashville, were not answered 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors frequently monitor developmentally delayed children  
between the ages of 18 and 30 months for cerebral palsy, said 
Dennis C. Harper, a University of Iowa pediatrics professor and 
president of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and 
Developmental Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hard call at a very young age,'' Harper said. ``You  
need to look at growth over time. ... Children's nervous systems 
are amazingly plastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerebral palsy is a motor nerve disorder caused by a permanent  
brain defect or injury shortly after birth. Those who suffer milder 
cases may have spastic paralysis, while more severe cases can 
include seizures, numbness and mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
	Physical therapists have been visiting the McCaughey home twice  
a month since October to work with Nathan and Alexis. Even with 
their medical challenges, Mrs. McCaughey said, she and her husband, 
Kenny, are generally optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said I never, ever,  
worried,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Vie for Livingston's Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The crowded field of candidates running for  
Bob Livingston's old congressional seat includes former Ku Klux 
Klan grand wizard David Duke and a political newcomer whose name 
sounds like an echo: Monica Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	The perceived front-runner, former Gov. Dave Treen, supports  
public executions for drug dealers on street corners. A longshot 
hopeful brags that he is a 33-year-old virgin. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also a taste of spicy Louisiana politicking, but it's  
hard to tell the seven Republican and two Democratic contenders 
apart when it comes to the big issues. They're for lower taxes and 
increased military spending. Most oppose abortion and more 
restrictions on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a gumbo, but not a very good one,'' said Jim Carvin, a  
political consultant from New Orleans. ``The gumbo is all 
conservatives, and it's getting to be like, `Who's the most 
conservative?''' 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time residents of Louisiana's 1st District have  
faced such a race in decades. Livingston had the job for 22 years 
and rarely faced a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	But after reaching the pinnacle of power by being named  
Speaker-Elect of the House, Livingston in December admitted marital 
infidelities and announced his resignation as the House voted to 
impeach the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston endorsed Treen earlier this month, saying he stands  
the best chance of landing key committee assignments that could 
keep federal funding flowing to southeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen spent 7 1/2 years in Congress in the 1970s before leaving to  
become Louisiana's first Republican governor since Reconstruction. 
But he hasn't run for office since he was walloped by Edwin Edwards 
in the 1983 gubernatorial election, when Edwards quipped that it 
took Treen 1 1/2 hours to watch ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All nine candidates run against each other in the May 1 special  
election. If no one receives a majority vote, the top two finishers 
will go head to head in a May 29 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen got a boost last week, when House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., pledged to count Treen's former congressional experience as 
seniority toward committee assignments if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he isn't expected to get an outright victory, so talk is  
centered on who he'll run against in the runoff. All the candidates 
are doing what they can to make themselves stand out. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why Treen declared that he favors public executions for  
repeat drug dealers on the streets where they sell crack and 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	It's why Monica, an ophthalmologist, runs television ads calling  
former state Rep. David Vitter ``Bitter Vitter.'' And it's why 
electrician Patrick Landry uses his virginity to promote his 
platform of sexual abstinence before marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Bill Strain is unique because he's the only Democrat  
considered to have a chance to make it to the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, the former Klan leader, doesn't have to worry about name  
recognition. And his views remain extreme. His campaign promises to 
eliminate affirmative action and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	And he denied last week's Colorado school shootings were  
committed by neo-Nazi sympathizers, blaming the school shooting on 
diversity and calling the suspects ``radical homosexuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Rob Couhig, owner of New Orleans' minor league soccer  
and baseball teams, is the only candidate so far to publicly 
criticize Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's a racist looking only to the past,'' Couhig said.  
``He's destructive for the state and destructive for the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Livingston endorsed Treen earlier this month, he said Duke  
was unlikely to make the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Billy Tauzin, the senior member of Louisiana's  
delegation in the House, said last week that a poll conducted by 
Treen's campaign showed Duke's support increasing to 10 percent 
several days after a Republican Party poll showed it at 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase came after Duke started running television ads  
criticizing the African-American holiday Kwanzaa and creation of a 
stamp honoring Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could well be in the running,'' Tauzin said. ``I don't  
think the second spot belongs to anyone yet.''

<HEADLINE> Moon Agrees to Pact With Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Veteran quarterback Warren Moon has  
agreed to a two-year deal with Kansas City, Chiefs general manager 
Carl Peterson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Moon, a 15-year veteran with Houston, Minnesota  
and Seattle, was released by the Seahawks during the off-season. He 
will serve as a backup to Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``He understands that,'' Peterson said of the backup role, ``and  
he'll give us a lot of great veteran experience and leadership. I 
know Elvis is pleased about it, and more important, I'm pleased, 
and Gunther (head coach Gunther Cunningham) is pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson did not say when Moon would sign.  
</P>
<P>
	The team has also reached an agreement for a three-year contract  
with Redskins linebacker Marvcus Patton, Peterson told The Kansas 
City Star. He was expected to sign Monday in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, who will be 32 on Saturday, was a member of Buffalo's  
four Super Bowl teams during 1990-93. He was the Redskins' leading 
tackler in three of his four seasons with Washington and has never 
missed an NFL game in nine seasons with Buffalo and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Uncle Davey's Civil War Obsession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Standing under the tallest tree at the  
birthplace of the Confederacy's top general, a young David Nelson 
picked up a leaf that fell to the Virginia earth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got chill bumps all over me, thinking that Robert E.  
Lee most likely stood under the same tree,'' Nelson recalls. ``I 
got a leaf from that tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson's boyhood fascination with history led to collecting  
coins and antiques and, eventually, Civil War artifacts and 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 47, Nelson owns Uncle Davey's Americana, a store packed with  
hundreds of musty books, thousands of photographs, newspapers and 
Civil War shells, sabers, rifles. With displays in glass cases, the 
shop resembles a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at these bullets from the battlefield,'' he says. ``The  
men that fired them were doing that because they were believing in 
their cause. They were soldiers of duty and honor and courage. ... 
It was the highest calling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson hopes to preserve this legacy, of Lee and Ulysses S.  
Grant larger than life, soldiering on battlefields at Bull Run, 
Shiloh, Olustee. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Richmond, Va., he aligns with the Sons of  
Confederate Veterans, descendants of those who fought for the 
South. He even named his 2 1/2-year-old son Richmond. But his 
artifacts, sold in a shop where Union Gen. Joseph Hooker stares 
from one wall, Lee from another, represent both armies and, in some 
cases, invoke black history. Each item, acquired piece by piece, 
comes with a story -- and some controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, there is the Confederate battle flag that Nelson  
sells and defends. 
</P>
<P>
	``That flag never stood for racism. That flag never stood for  
slavery,'' insists Nelson, who wears a ring bearing a Confederate 
battle flag. ``There is nothing wrong with that flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But controversy comes, inevitably, when groups such as the Ku  
Klux Klan move in and wave the flag at their rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``A divisive symbol and hateful symbol,'' says Susan Glisson,  
assistant director of the Center for Southern Studies at the 
University of Mississippi in Oxford. ``It is a symbol that has 
caused a lot of hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who has degrees in English and sociology, defends his  
shop's purpose. ``This is not some redneck shop,'' he says. ``It is 
truly a memorial to the War between the States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artifacts surface at construction sites throughout the South.  
Families clean out attics. Longtime owners -- who knows how or why?-- 
decide to sell. Nelson is thrilled. ``We can learn from them,'' he 
says of the thousands of items that jam his shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, selling artifacts is in itself controversial. ``There  
are those who believe that all historical artifacts belong in 
museums. They should not be for sale. You should not sell 
history,'' Nelson says. ``But I feel you will have a greater 
appreciation for our past if it is part of your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Va., claims the  
largest collection of Confederate items, all built on donations, 
says Malinda Collier, who directs the collection. Though she 
trumpets the museum as serving the public -- ``It is nicer when it 
is public, where it can be seen'' -- Collier is no purist: She 
believes people have a right to buy and sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Uncle Davey's also sells on the Internet. For Christmas  
shoppers, Nelson shipped coast to coast, and beyond, to 30 
locations outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am living my dream,'' Nelson says. ``There are not too many  
people who can do what they love and make money at the same time, 
and I for one minute do not take it for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is doubling the size of his shop to display his  
collection, and he continues to buy and sell artifacts and books, 
believing the past will remain popular.. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, as he notes: ``They are still writing books about  
Robert E. Lee.''

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Back in Win Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt, sporting a big grin  
beneath his bushy mustache, finished the winner's interview 
following the DieHard 500 by saying, ``It's nice to be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time Winston Cup champion then walked out of the quiet  
pressbox and was greeted by the happy noise from a sea of fans who 
had waited 90 minutes after the race for a glimpse of Earnhardt and 
to let him know he's still their favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that Earnhardt hadn't won since the 1998  
season-opening Daytona 500 -- a span of 40 races -- nor that he had 
only that one win in his last 100 starts before Sunday's 188-lap 
race at Talladega Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Intimidator was back with a vengeance, dominating the race,  
leading the most laps and holding off a determined late-race bid by 
Dale Jarrett to earn his 72nd career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big game of chess out here,'' Earnhardt explained.  
``It's knowing when to move and where to move to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of those strategic moves by the grand master of restrictor  
plate tracks came on lap 134 when Earnhardt pitted along with the 
other leaders during a caution period. 
</P>
<P>
	A vibration late in the race caused Earnhardt and his Richard  
Childress Racing crew some worry. To make sure everything was all 
right, crew chief Kevin Hamlin decided to change four tires while 
most of the other teams were changing only two. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt came into the pits leading and came out 16th. But it  
didn't take him long to get back up front after the green flag on 
lap 140. In fact, he was back in the lead on lap 148. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out a little further back than we wanted to, but we  
had the race car to come back,'' Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some more shuffling, but Earnhardt took the lead for  
the last time on lap 175, making a strong outside pass on Jarrett, 
who slid from first to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Jarrett's Ford until lap 185 to work his way back to  
second. The winner of the fall race here in 1998 then went after 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the big lead pack racing two and three wide behind  
him, Jarrett didn't get much help until Mark Martin tucked in 
behind two laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	But, with NASCAR requiring restrictor plates at Talladega, none  
of the cars has enough horsepower to make a pass alone, and even 
two cars can't get the job done in a handful of laps. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Fords managed to get up to the rear bumper of  
Earnhardt's Chevy several times, but never were able to pull 
alongside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark just didn't get there in time,'' Jarrett lamented. ``I  
think we could have worked to try and get by Earnhardt, but trying 
to pass Dale Earnhardt at one of these places with a lap or two to 
go is a pretty tall order. He makes the (No.) 3 car pretty wide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin bemoaned his fate.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have anybody to push me, so I couldn't get it  
going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That was fine with Earnhardt, who said he drove the final laps  
with his eyes mostly in his rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was there to help Jarrett but Mark when it came time to  
go,'' Earnhardt said. ``I kept thinking, 'Keep racing like that you 
guys.' That was what really won us the race when they got to racing 
side-by-side back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt, who will turn 48 Thursday, led 70 laps, including the  
final 14. It was his eighth Winston Cup win here. Earnhardt has 
also won one Busch event and three IROC races at Talladega, 
including a 38-lapper on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd estimated at 150,000 stood throughout much of the  
typically competitive race, but the roar as Earnhardt crossed the 
finish line was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0.137-seconds -- about two car-lengths -- ahead of Jarrett  
at the finish. Earnhardt, who averaged 163.395 mph in the race 
slowed by just three caution flags for 18 laps, won $147,795. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Bobby Labonte finished fourth in a Pontiac,  
followed by rookie and teammate Tony Stewart. Polesitter Ken 
Schrader was fifth in a Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton, who wound up starting from the back of the 43-car  
field after his car developed a mysterious smoking problem before 
the race began, came back to finish 11th and holds a 40-point lead 
over Jarrett in the season standings. Martin is third, another 44 
points behind, while Earnhardt moved into a tie for ninth with 
teammate Mike Skinner, 315 points behind Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500-mile race had all the elements of a typical Talladega  
restrictor-plate race, with 28 lead changes among 14 drivers and 
one big wreck that took out, among others two-time defending series 
champion Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash that everybody anticipated came on lap 49. It was  
ignited by Skinner and Stewart, both among the leaders up to that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared Stewart tapped Skinner in the rear. Then Skinner  
blocked the rookie, forcing both cars into the infield grass on the 
long back straightaway. Skinner got sideways and slid back up the 
track banking in front of a huge pack of cars traveling at close to 
200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon appeared to duck safely under Skinner, but bounced off  
Stewart and slid up the banking into the wall before being hit 
squarely on the passenger side by Rusty Wallace. Before it was 
over, Chad Little, Brett Bodine, Ernie Irvan, Wally Dallenbach and 
Kenny Irwin also were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably should have backed down, but I was afraid there was  
a whole line of cars behind me that would get by both of us,'' 
Stewart said. ``That's part of being a rookie. I'm going to make 
mistakes, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner, who wound up 36th, said he wasn't angry at Stewart,  
noting, ``I know he didn't do it on purpose. It ain't no big 
deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon came back late in the race but finished 38th and fell  
from fourth, 129 points behind Burton, to fifth, 210 behind the 
series leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other caution periods were caused by Terry Labonte's  
harmless spin on lap 133 and a crash involving Bobby Hamilton and 
Robert Pressley on lap 169 that set up the dash to the finish.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Trauma Workers Trying To Cope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The usually chatty paramedic spoke to no  
one as he entered St. Anthony's Central Hospital, still dazed and 
white-faced two days after the Columbine High School massacre. He 
hadn't slept more than two hours at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for me to make a career change,'' the veteran crisis  
worker, hands in his pockets, told emergency room nurse Jane Cole. 
He's already got a lead on a new career. 
</P>
<P>
	Death comes with the job, but the police, surgeons and other  
emergency workers who tended the dead and wounded are enduring 
trauma unlike anything they've ever experienced. For many, it was 
the sheer numbers -- 15 dead, 23 wounded -- and the tender ages of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the hardest thing that I've had to deal with since  
being a nurse,'' said Cheryl English, a charge nurse at University 
of Colorado Health Sciences Center who has tended hundreds of 
patients disfigured by burns and gunfights over seven years. 
``These kids were helpless. They were innocent. They were not 
involved in any gang. They weren't in a shootout. They were in a 
library.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many Jefferson County sheriff's deputies, Sunday was their  
first day off since the rampage. Most hadn't had time to seek the 
crisis counseling the department offers. They were tired and still 
shaken by the scene of a library and cafeteria littered with slain 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so difficult for me, walking into the library,''  
Sheriff John Stone said. ``It was devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One officer from a county juvenile diversion program bears an  
especially heavy burden, District Attorney Dave Thomas said. When 
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold finished a program for 
troubled teens in February after being caught breaking into a van, 
the unidentified officer said their trouble appeared over. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report recommending early release from the program, the  
officer wrote that Klebold was a ``bright young man who has a great 
deal of potential'' and Harris was ``likely to succeed in life.'' 
Those words have haunted him since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned about him,'' Thomas said of the officer.  
``He did the best he could, I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For health care workers, the trauma often came after the  
patients were stabilized or declared lost. Surgeon William Pfeifer 
didn't have time when the patients started coming in. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 years of surgery, the stress was still with him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that never goes away,'' he said. ``I don't want to get  
casual about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unpleasant duties add to the stress of surgery. After the March  
1998 school shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., doctors anguished over a 
somber task: asking desperate parents in the waiting room for 
photos of their children so they could tell them if their children 
were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the most cruel forms of Russian roulette I could  
have ever conceived,'' Dr. Warren Skaug later told a conference of 
fellow pediatricians. ``There were tortured faces and churning 
stomachs, including mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grief counselors call the experience ``compassion fatigue.'' It  
can be made worse when the victims are children, said Dr. Mark 
Stebnicki, an Arkansas State University psychologist who counseled 
workers and victims in Jonesboro. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we experience loss in children there's the feeling of  
injustice: How could this happen? Who's responsible?'' he said. ``A 
lot of times that's anger coming out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year and several school shootings later, St. Anthony's Cole  
took Wednesday off. She thought about the 15-year-old boy whose 
bullet-scarred face and leg will always bear witness to the 
shootings. The flowers and faxes sent by Oklahoma City and Arkansas 
nurses marked the kinship of grief that workers feel. But they are 
also a constant reminder, as is the talk amid the din of clinking 
plates and coffee cups in the staff lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that anyone's ever been involved with anything  
like this before,'' said Ms. Cole, an ER nurse for 19 years. ``It's 
just been such a sensory overload.''

<HEADLINE> Lassiter Can Go the Distance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- At last, the United States might have a  
consistent miler. 
</P>
<P>
	Seneca Lassiter, the Arkansas senior from Williamsburg, Va.,  
showed tremendous durability at the Penn Relays, anchoring the 
Razorbacks to three relay victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' said Lassiter, chosen the most valuable male  
track athlete of the meet for the second time in three years. ``It 
shows me that I'm starting to come around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I want to take it to the next level and run  
professionally, keep going and going and improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter has the fastest time at 1,500 meters -- the metric mile  
-- by an American, a career-best 3 minutes, 37.23 seconds on April 
17 at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, his closing 1,600-meter leg of 4:02.5 gave Arkansas  
its 13th victory in 17 years in the distance medley relay at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Lassiter doubled his pleasure. He ran a brilliant  
3:55.6 mile in powering Arkansas to a college record of 16:07.96 in 
the 4-mile relay as the Razorbacks won for the sixth consecutive 
year and 14th time in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he completed his weekend trifecta by running a 1:48.9 800  
as Arkansas won the 3,200 relay for the first time at Penn at 
7:13.87, the fastest at the relays since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time since Villanova in 1980 that any school  
swept the three distance relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter joined three other men who won the outstanding athlete  
award twice each, all of them distance runners: Villanova's Eamonn 
Coghlan (1975-76), Mark Belger (1977-78) and Arkansas' Joe Falcon 
(1988-89). 
</P>
<P>
	``Seneca is a young man who has come along slowly,'' Arkansas  
coach John McDonnell said. ``He was a low-mileage high school kid. 
... Now he's exactly where he wants to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is, among the best in the United States and heading for the  
world stage. In recent years, Steve Holman has been considered the 
best American miler and 1,500-meter runner, but his inconsistency, 
especially in big meets, has been troubling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter will complete his college eligibility in June, when he  
goes for his third straight NCAA 1,500-meter title. Then comes 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I have a lot riding on my shoulders,'' he said.  
``Not just for me. I need to do something for my mom. I want to 
make some money at this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before this season, Lassiter was confident this would be his  
breakthrough year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done any training like this before,'' he said.  
``I'm going to turn a lot of heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he has, especially at boisterous Franklin Field, before a  
record Friday crowd of 31,904 and a Saturday throng of 44,639, 
bringing the three-day attendance to a meet-record 96,358. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans Saturday saw some of track's biggest names -- Michael  
Johnson, Marion Jones and Maurice Greene -- overshadowed by 
Lassiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson anchored a Nike International team to victory in the  
invitational 800-meter relay at 1:19.47, turning a 2-meter lead 
from Greene into a 9-meter triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene also finished third on a Nike team in the invitational  
400 relay at 39.50, behind two other Nike teams, the winner running 
39.20 and anchored by Danny McCray. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones ran on Nike teams in the women's invitational 400 and 800  
relays. She ran the second leg in the 400 that finished second at 
43.42, .01 behind an Adidas team anchored by Toya Brown, and 
anchored the 800 to victory at 1:30.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding performance, however, was by an Adidas team in  
the 1,600 relay. Michael McDonald, Antonio Pettigrew, Milton 
Campbell and Jerome Young became the first team to break 3 minutes 
at Penn, clocking 2:58.52, the best in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's college relays, the other winners were Clemson in  
the 400 (39.48) and sprint medley (3:18.23), Florida in the 800 
(1:21.50) and Mississippi in the 1,600 (3:05.19). 
</P>
<P>
	The women's relay champions were LSU in the 800 (1:32.46), Texas  
in the 1,600 (3:31.46), Seton Hall in the sprint medley (3:49.52) 
and Tulane in the distance medley (10:55.71). 
</P>
<P>
	Notable performances included Olympian Tom Pukstys' javelin  
throw of 266 feet, 4 inches, best by an American this year; 
Auburn's Coby Miller winning the college 100 at 10.22; Abilene 
Christian's Delloreen Ennis-London taking the women's college 100 
hurdles at 12.60; Olympian Shana Williams winning the women's 
invitational long jump at 22-1; and Tim Seaman setting an American 
record for the 10K walk of 39:43.85.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raises Bar for New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The door to NATO remains open to new members,  
but they may find getting over the threshold more difficult than 
the alliance's three newest members did. 
</P>
<P>
	The Membership Action Plan approved by participants at the  
weekend NATO summit provides no timetable for accession of new 
candidates nor any guarantee they will get in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, it establishes a program of activities designed ``to  
assist aspiring countries in their preparations for possible future 
membership.'' These include commitments to strengthen democracy, 
human rights, democratic control of the armed forces and programs 
to improve military cooperation with the 19 NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In effect, what NATO appears to have done in the 10-page plan is  
to raise the bar for alliance membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provides a reality check on these nations' idea that NATO  
is their Father Christmas,'' said Daniel Plesch, director of the 
British-American Security Information Council, a liberal research 
group that specializes in European defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu said he was not satisfied  
with the plan because it does not include a precise schedule for 
admitting new members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time horizon is there but this is not going to satisfy our  
wish for an exact deadline,'' Plesu told the Romanian private news 
agency Mediafax. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slovenia's Foreign Minister Boris Frlec does not agree that  
starting accession negotiations now will become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the plan as a paved road leading to membership and we  
feel we already have fulfilled a number of the criteria it 
contains,'' Frlec said. ``It is meant to provide concrete help to 
countries that have ambitions to join.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vygaudas Usackas, the political director of Lithuania's Foreign  
Ministry, said the plan commits NATO members to helping countries 
that want to join through mutual engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the guidelines we have been waiting for,'' Usackas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summit communique, the prospective new members are named  
in groups. 
</P>
<P>
	They are Romania and Slovenia, which almost made it in at the  
last NATO summit, in Madrid, Spain, in 1997, when the alliance 
decided to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Then come the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and  
Lithuania. Bulgaria and Slovakia get separate mention for 
``positive developments'' since Madrid, meaning they have become 
more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the list are Macedonia and Albania, which are  
bearing the brunt of the refugee exodus from Kosovo but have no 
serious chance of joining for at least a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's President Kiro Gligorov sharply criticized NATO for  
not inviting his country to join NATO, saying the alliance had 
shown no appreciation for Macedonia's efforts to qualify for 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Macedonia has been circumvented and has again been put in last  
place,'' Gligorov told reporters Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia and Lithuania are most often cited as being at the top  
of the list under a plan that would take in one southern European 
country and one northern one. 
</P>
<P>
	But admitting Lithuania, which like its two Baltic neighbors  
were part of the former Soviet Union, could provoke a crisis with 
Russia. It has threatened to sever relations with NATO if any of 
the Baltic states join NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever their chances of membership now, none of the  
prospective new members are likely to be admitted until early in 
the next century, officials in these countries have acknowledged. 
NATO members and officials have said the alliance needs time to get 
used to working with its three newest members. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the summit, countries that want to be in the next wave of  
expansion said they expected NATO members to provide them with a 
road map setting out what requirements they had to meet to join. 
</P>
<P>
	They were not disappointed. The Membership Action Plan outlines  
what aspiring countries have to do to strengthen their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
	The MAP, is a ``practical manifestation of the Open Door and has  
five chapters ... that highlight mechanisms through which 
preparation for possible eventual membership can be carried 
forward,'' the document says.

<HEADLINE> NATO Supports Yugoslavia Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaking for NATO, President Clinton warned  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Sunday that if he threatened 
any of his neighbors as a result of the allied bombing campaign, 
``we will respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and fellow NATO leaders gathered with the heads of seven  
countries neighboring Yugoslavia to assure them of the alliance's 
support and to reaffirm NATO's pledge to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Belgrade challenges its neighbors as a result of the  
presence of NATO, we will respond,'' Clinton said in opening 
remarks to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his 18 NATO counterparts began the final day of  
their three-day 50th anniversary summit by meeting with the leaders 
of Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania and 
Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Those leaders' speeches had the same theme: support for NATO's  
airstrikes, autonomy for Kosovo and the return of ethnic Albanian 
refugees to their homes, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They share our determination to prevail and to see this  
through,'' he said. ``NATO equally recognizes an obligation to 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Milosevic ``a pariah in his own backyard,'' Shea echoed  
Clinton's warning: ``We will not tolerate threats against them or 
attacks on them by Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia and Albania have been particularly hard-hit by the  
effects of the bombing campaign, receiving hundreds of thousands of 
Kosovo Albanian refugees as they flee from Yugoslav military 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very grateful for what you have done,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said the work of these  
countries ``has required efforts nothing short of heroic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the allies were to join in a huge gathering of 42 nations  
in the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, NATO leaders promised a larger and more flexible  
military force ready for the first time to engage in conflicts in 
problem areas beyond the boundaries of the alliance's members. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's strategic concept, or basic statement of purpose last  
updated in 1991, will prepare the organization ``to deal with the 
security challenges of the new century,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reaffirmed our readiness ... to address regional and  
ethnic conflicts beyond the territory of NATO members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the alliance nations originally envisioned the summit  
as a gala celebration, but NATO's continuing air war against 
Yugoslavia and the crisis in Kosovo have dominated the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO faced defiant objections from Russia and questions from its  
own ranks on Saturday about enforcing an oil embargo against 
Yugoslavia by searching ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance leaders said military commanders were laying plans for  
sea searches to ``switch off the oil tap'' fueling Milosevic's war 
machine. But Russia, angry about 32 days of airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, indicated it would ignore an embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue delivering oil in keeping with our  
international commitments,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
said on a trip to Egypt. Yugoslavia gets most of its oil from 
Russia and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about stopping oil tankers was also voiced at the  
summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to international rules, it is an act of war'' to  
stop and forcibly search ships on the seas, French President 
Jacques Chirac said. ``So we must be very cautious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Chirac said France supports NATO's determination to stop  
any material useful to Yugoslav military forces from reaching 
Milosevic's troops and he urged all democratic nations to support 
the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended the idea of searches, saying it was  
unreasonable to ask pilots to risk their lives attacking oil depots 
when Milosevic could get fuel from ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also urged Americans to be patient with the pace  
of the military campaign and the NATO strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that this air campaign has been going on for a  
particularly long time,'' the president said. The allies must be 
willing to prosecute the war with determination and ``pay the price 
of time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Miler Lassiter Stars at Penn Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Forget Michael Johnson, Marion Jones and  
Maurice Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas senior Seneca Lassiter did just that Saturday in the  
Penn Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter wasn't awed or intimidated by the presence of three of  
the world's greatest sprinters before a Franklin Field crowd of 
44,639 that brought the three-day attendance to a meet-record 
96,358. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, rapidly becoming the nation's best miler, anchored  
Arkansas to relay championships in the 4-mile race and 3,200-meter 
event, after having anchored the Razorbacks to the distance medley 
relay title Friday. Those victories earned Lassiter the award as 
the outstanding track athlete in the meet for the second time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His sensational performance Saturday included a scintillating  
mile of 3 minutes, 55.6 seconds in the 4-mile relay, helping 
Arkansas set a collegiate record of 16:07.96, breaking the mark of 
16.08.9 by the 1962 Oregon team that featured world-class miler 
Dyrol Burleson on anchor. It was Arkansas' sixth straight title in 
the event and 14th in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was really into it,'' Lassiter said after his  
brilliant effort in the 4-mile race. ``The crowd got me through the 
last 800. The fans at Penn always want to see a record broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking at the clock as I was coming down (the final  
straightaway). I wanted to break the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weary Lassiter came back less than 3 1/2 hours later and ran  
1:48.9 for 800 meters, helping Arkansas win the 3,200 relay for the 
first time in the Penn Relays at 7:13.87, the fastest in the meet 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif Karie also ran both relays, and he broke open the 3,200  
race. His second leg of 1:48.7 gave Arkansas an 8-meter lead, after 
trailing SMU by 25 meters after the first 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion and 200 world  
record-holder, ran an unofficial 19.2 for 200 meters in anchoring 
Nike International to a 9-meter victory in the open 800 relay. When 
Johnson got the baton from Greene, his advantage was only two 
meters. He then breezed over the final 200 without pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked 100-meter runner and the 1997  
world champion, also competed in the open 400 relay, but his swift 
anchor leg was only good for a third-place finish for Nike HSI at 
39.50, behind Nike Elite (39.20) and Nike International (39.35). 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, top-ranked in the world in the women's 100 and 200, also  
ran on two open relays and, like Greene, won one. Jones ran the 
second leg of the 400 relay team for Nike International that 
finished second, .01 seconds behind an Adidas team anchored by Toya 
Brown. Adidas was timed in 43.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, running anchor, overcame a 2-meter deficit and sped to a  
7-meter victory in the 800 relay. The team finished at 1:30.23, 
nearly a second ahead of Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
	An Adidas team of Michael McDonald, Antonio Pettigrew, Milton  
Campbell and Jerome Young ran the fastest 1,600-meter relay in the 
world this year, 2:58.53, while also becoming the first team to 
break the 3-minute barrier in the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, led by Shawn Crawford, won two men's college relay  
titles. The Tigers, with Crawford running anchor, took the 400 
relay in 39.48 and, with Crawford leading off, won the sprint 
medley in 3:18.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's sprint medley relays were scheduled to be  
run Friday, but were postponed a day because of lightning and rain. 
That apparently played havoc with the runners, because the men's 
time was the slowest in 12 years in the relays, and women's 
champion Seton Hall's clocking of 3:49.52 was the slowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida thwarted Clemson's bid for a third relay title, winning  
the men's 800 in 1:21.50, as the Tigers, who had the fastest 
qualifying time, slipped to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, spurred by Peta Gaye-Dowdie's swift anchor leg, raced to  
its fifth consecutiver victory in the women's 800 relay in 1:32.46. 
Collegiate record-holder Texas dropped the baton on the first 
handoff from LeKeesha White to Suziann Reid and didn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane registered its first-ever victory in the relays, taking  
the women's distance medley championship in 10:55.71, with Hanne 
Lyngstad outkicking BYU's Lindsay Jones. It was the first Penn 
title for Tulane coach Ron Bazilsince since 1971, when his Adelphi 
team won two championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two relays on the program, Mississippi edged East  
Carolina in the men's 1,600 in 3:05.19 and Texas took the women's 
1,600 for the fifth consecutive year at 3:31.48, helped by Suziann 
Reid's come-from-behind 50.8 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Coby Miller, the fastest American this year in the 100,  
won the event at 10.22, much shower than his best of 10.03. 
Tennessee's Kelli White took the women's 100 in 11.32. 
</P>
<P>
	In the invitational miles, Karl Paranya was the men's winner in  
4:00.59 and Cheri Goddard Kenah was the women's champion in 
4:38.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was broken by Tim Seaman, winner of the men's  
10-kilometer race walk in 39:43.85. In becoming the first Americn 
to crack 40 minutes, he smashed the American record of 40:20.57 by 
Tim Lewis in 1985.

race. His second leg of 1:48.7 gave Arkansas an 8-meter lead, after 
trailing SMU by 25 meters after the first 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 1996 Olympic 200 and 400 champion and 200 world  
record-holder, ran an unofficial 19.2 for 200 meters in anchoring 
Nike International to a 9-meter victory in the open 800 relay. When 
Johnson got the baton from Greene, his advantage was only two 
meters. He then breezed over the final 200 without pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the world's top-ranked 100-meter runner and the 1997  
world champion, also competed in the open 400 relay, but his swift 
anchor leg was only good for a third-place finish for Nike HSI at 
39.50, behind Nike Elite (39.20) and Nike International (39.35). 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, top-ranked in the world in the women's 100 and 200, also  
ran on two open relays and, like Greene, won one. Jones ran the 
second leg of the 400 relay team for Nike International that 
finished second, .01 seconds behind an Adidas team anchored by Toya 
Brown. Adidas was timed in 43.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, running anchor, overcame a 2-meter deficit and sped to a  
7-meter victory in the 800 relay. The team finished at 1:30.23, 
nearly a second ahead of Adidas. 
</P>
<P>
	An Adidas team of Michael McDonald, Antonio Pettigrew, Milton  
Campbell and Jerome Young ran the fastest 1,600-meter relay in the 
world this year, 2:58.53, while also becoming the first team to 
break the 3-minute barrier in the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, led by Shawn Crawford, won two men's college relay  
titles. The Tigers, with Crawford running anchor, took the 400 
relay in 39.48 and, with Crawford leading off, won the sprint 
medley in 3:18.23. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's sprint medley relays were scheduled to be  
run Friday, but were postponed a day because of lightning and rain. 
That apparently played havoc with the runners, because the men's 
time was the slowest in 12 years in the relays, and women's 
champion Seton Hall's clocking of 3:49.52 was the slowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida thwarted Clemson's bid for a third relay title, winning  
the men's 800 in 1:21.50, as the Tigers, who had the fastest 
qualifying time, slipped to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU, spurred by Peta Gaye-Dowdie's swift anchor leg, raced to  
its fifth consecutiver victory in the women's 800 relay in 1:32.46. 
Collegiate record-holder Texas dropped the baton on the first 
handoff from LeKeesha White to Suziann Reid and didn't finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane registered its first-ever victory in the relays, taking  
the women's distance medley championship in 10:55.71, with Hanne 
Lyngstad outkicking BYU's Lindsay Jones. It was the first Penn 
title for Tulane coach Ron Bazilsince since 1971, when his Adelphi 
team won two championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final two relays on the program, Mississippi edged East  
Carolina in the men's 1,600 in 3:05.19 and Texas took the women's 
1,600 for the fifth consecutive year at 3:31.48, helped by Suziann 
Reid's come-from-behind 50.8 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn's Coby Miller, the fastest American this year in the 100,  
won the event at 10.22, much shower than his best of 10.03. 
Tennessee's Kelli White took the women's 100 in 11.32. 
</P>
<P>
	In the invitational miles, Karl Paranya was the men's winner in  
4:00.59 and Cheri Goddard Kenah was the women's champion in 
4:38.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was broken by Tim Seaman, winner of the men's  
10-kilometer race walk in 39:43.85. In becoming the first Americn 
to crack 40 minutes, he smashed the American record of 40:20.57 by 
Tim Lewis in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Lott Says Social Security Bill Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says the  
White House has failed to get serious about Social Security, 
preventing Congress from acting on reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House fired back that it's Lott and other Republicans  
who haven't gotten serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have made shoring up Social  
Security a primary goal of the 106th Congress, mindful that the 
national pension system is expected to hit financial turmoil once 
baby boomers begin retiring in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again,'' Lott said Sunday, ``we need some leadership from  
the president. He backed away from real reform of Medicare. He's 
really proposed nothing on Social Security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked specifically on ABC's ``This Week'' if Social Security is  
dead, the Mississippi Republican said: ``I don't see it happening 
this year, because I don't believe the president will really 
honestly address it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said it's the  
Republicans who are stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	``If instead of looking for the opportunity to declare Social  
Security (reform) dead, the Republican leadership were putting 
forth some of their own specific ideas for finding common ground, 
the prospects could still be good for this year,'' Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate majority leader, while criticizing the president's  
plans, has offered no specific measures of his own,'' he added, 
echoing President Clinton's comments last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Lott also predicted Congress will tap Social  
Security's surplus for as much as $6 billion more than the $6.05 
billion Clinton requested to pay for the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
The additional money will be for other military needs, which Lott 
says are direly needed. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders spread word last week among GOP members  
in the House that trying to overhaul Social Security before the 
2000 election campaign could involve too much political risk 
without strong Democratic involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech in January, Clinton proposed  
setting aside most of the Social Security surplus to keep the 
system solvent when baby boomers begin retiring in a few years. The 
plan would invest some of the money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's expected federal surplus is $110 billion, all from  
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said it is clear Social Security surpluses should be held  
in safekeeping for the nation's retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put it in a lock-box. Have a procedure where it can't be just  
used for every spending program -- or for that matter tax cuts -- 
that comes along,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said dipping into the surplus for the campaign in Yugoslavia  
is required because Clinton requested the money on an emergency 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an emergency, if it is approved, that means it doesn't have  
to be offset by cutting other programs or other spending. It comes 
out of the surplus net,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only surplus we have is Social Security. But that's what  
the president has asked for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans understand that a military emergency would  
require using the surplus, ``but I think we need to understand ... 
it's really coming from Social Security, which we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's request was solely for money to cover the cost of the  
Kosovo conflict. Republicans have demanded add-ons to alleviate 
what they consider Clinton administration slights to the military. 
Some lawmakers have suggested raising the total to $18 billion to 
$20 billion, or even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should take this opportunity to look at  
adding every military need might have been aware of,'' Lott said on 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``I personally think it should include a pay  
raise'' and other things that would push the cost ``probably 
somewhere in the range of'' $10 billion to $12 billion. Lott 
previously advocated a bill of less than $10 billion.

<HEADLINE> Phillips Was 'Credit Card' Addict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wild child Bijou Phillips says she checked into  
a rehab clinic to avoid her famous father's wrath over abuse of his 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never a drug addict,'' the 19-year-old model and singer  
told Details magazine. ``When I got into so much trouble with the 
(money), I knew my only option was the drug option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Father John Phillips' reaction? ``It's funny she would say that  
because the rehab was, like, $40,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Arizona clinic were puzzled because Ms.  
Phillips ``didn't need to detox,'' said her father, a former drug 
addict and founder of the Mamas and the Papas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Phillips hopes to follow her father into rock 'n' roll -- if  
she doesn't get arrested first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single day there's some horrible drama that happens to  
me,'' she said in the magazine's May issue. ``Like car accidents. I 
have no license or insurance and I have two cars and I get into car 
accidents and I get into so much trouble it's unbelievable. I'm, 
like, probably going to jail.''

<HEADLINE> Fishery Plan Aims To Rebuild Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some restaurants are taking shark off the menu  
to save the species. Swordfish, also vanishing from menus, have 
declined in Atlantic waters to where the fish may one day 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of overfishing have caused such a decline in the number of  
Atlantic migratory fish, including shark, swordfish, marline and 
tuna, that the government is imposing tougher fishing quotas and 
other actions in an attempt to rebuild stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Marine Fisheries Service was announcing measures  
today aimed at rebuilding Atlantic swordfish stocks over the next 
10 years. The service also planned new fishing restrictions for 
shark, Atlantic tuna and so-called ``billfish'' including blue and 
white marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fish management plans apply to federal Atlantic waters  
and the Gulf of Mexico from Maine to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was expected to include a call for a 27 percent  
reduction in Atlantic swordfish catches as well as putting some 
``nursery'' fishing areas off limits during certain months to 
protect juvenile swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, environmentalists have focused on the threat  
to swordfish, persuading some restaurants to ban the fish from 
their menus. Last year, in a largely symbolic move, chefs from 27 
of the country's finest restaurants said they would keep the fish 
off the menu for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The swordfish is emblematic of a lot of the problems that face  
fisheries,'' said Lisa Speer of the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental advocacy group. ``The population is down 
to the lowest level ever recorded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While details were not available Sunday, the agency also was  
expected to: 
</P>
<P>
	--Establish new limits on commercial and recreation shark  
fishing, including a sharp reduction in the number of large coastal 
sharks that may be caught commercially, and new size limits on some 
shark species. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adopt restrictions on fishing for Atlantic bluefin tuna, along  
the lines of an international agreement reached last November, with 
a 20-year recovery goal. 
</P>
<P>
	--Further restrict recreational catches of shark. Reductions two  
years ago from a maximum of four to two fish per vessel have had 
little impact. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add restrictions on landings of blue and white marlin and other  
so-called ``billfish'' by recreational fishermen. Marlin stocks 
have declined to about a quarter of the numbers needed for 
long-term survival, leading to a ban on commercial catches a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of some species of shark has declined by as much as  
85 percent, according to marine biologists. ``Hardest hit have been 
the large coastal sharks,'' said Sonja Fordham of the Center for 
Marine Conservation. ``They are especially vulnerable to 
overfishing because they grow slowly, mature late and have a small 
number of young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swordfish populations have declined dramatically because too  
many young fish are being caught, biologists say. The average size 
of a swordfish today is one-third of what it was 30 years ago, and 
as many as a third of the roughly 110,000 swordfish caught each 
year are juveniles killed as bycatch -- caught incidentally in the 
process of fishing for something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a serious bycatch problem'' with swordfish that the  
new management plan is not expected to adequately address, said 
Kenneth Hinman, president of the National Coalition for Marine 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft plan unveiled last fall calls for closing an area in the  
Florida straits -- a so-called ``nursing area'' -- for three months 
each year to swordfish to protect juvenile fish. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``falls way short in both size and duration'' to protect  
the juveniles, said Russell Dunn of the Ocean Wildlife Campaign, an 
environmental advocacy group.

<HEADLINE> Britain Racist Bomb Campaign Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Associatd Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Police said Sunday they fear Britain's ethnic  
minorities face a campaign of racially motivated bombings after the 
second bomb in eight days exploded in a high-immigrant London 
district, injuring seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We retain very serious fears that this could be a continuing  
series of vicious attacks, and we cannot in any way rule out the 
fact that those attacks might be taken to locations outside the 
London area,'' David Vaness, assistant commissioner for crime in 
the Metropolitan police force, said. 
</P>
<P>
	A neo-Nazi organization, Combat 18, claimed responsibility for  
Saturday afternoon's car bomb explosion on a busy street in Brick 
Lane, home to a large Bangladeshi community. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was also among four self-styled far-right  
organizations which each said they planted a nail bomb April 17 
which injured 39 people in Brixton, a racially mixed south London 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, several black lawmakers reported receiving  
threatening letters signed by ``White Wolves,'' a name that has 
cropped up before under racist threats. 
</P>
<P>
	London's Sunday Telegraph reported that a 15-page document  
signed ``White Wolves'' and giving instructions on orchestrating a 
bombing campaign was faxed to a radio station a week before the 
Brixton bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The document also said all ``non-whites and Jews'' still in  
Britain by the end of the year would be exterminated, and was 
signed off ``Hail Britannia.'' The newspaper, quoting unidentified 
sources, said police dismissed it as the work of a crank. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeating last weekend, police scoured tapes from closed circuit  
TV cameras in the Brick Lane street market, hoping to spot the 
perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon said the Brixton and Brick  
Lane attacks -- both with crude nail bombs placed in carryalls -- 
appeared linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a vicious crime and , regardless of its motivation, it  
is terrorist in its impact ... Clearly this is a racial crime,'' 
Condon told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The people injured Saturday -- all but one of them Bangladeshis --  
received slight wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic minorities, mostly descendants of immigrants from former  
colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, comprise only 7 percent 
of Britain's population -- but are mostly concentrated in inner city 
districts.

<HEADLINE> Government Urged To Warn on Radium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Culpepper had endured blinding  
headaches, double vision, brain surgery and the violent nausea of 
chemotherapy. Then a doctor connected his cancer to nasal radium 
treatments he received as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper remembered that small amounts had been inserted  
through his nose to treat chronic ear infections, but he never 
worried about it as he grew older. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, who rarely got so much as a cold, had not had a  
physical in years, much less a consultation about an obscure Cold 
War-era medical procedure no longer used. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone had said anyone having these treatments in the '50s  
or '60s ought to immediately go see an ENT (ear, nose and throat) 
doctor, he would have gone,'' said Culpepper's widow, Patti, of 
Newport Beach, Calif. ``I know he would have gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, 55, died in January after 16 months of treatment for  
nasopharyngeal cancer, which affects the nose and upper throat 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The government sees no need to warn former radium patients, a  
stand that enrages public health advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing a great disservice to the population at risk and  
not meeting any of their responsibilities,'' says Stewart Farber, a 
Rhode Island public health scientist who has spent years 
researching the medical use of radium. 
</P>
<P>
	From the 1940s to the mid-1960s, it was common practice in  
civilian and military medicine to use nasal applicators containing 
50 milligrams of radium to shrink tissues at the entrance of the 
eustachian tubes. Those tubes help drain and balance pressure on 
the inner and outer ear. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical regimen involved three to four treatments, of six to  
12 minutes each, a few weeks apart. Over that course, the tissues 
closest to the radium capsules would have received a radiation dose 
about 100 times greater than that received by survivors of the 
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasal radium was given mostly to military pilots and submariners  
troubled by drastic changes in atmospheric pressure and to children 
who suffered from colds, tonsillitis, ear infections and sinus or 
adenoid problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice gradually was abandoned when the military started  
using pressurized aircraft cabins, effective new treatments such as 
antibiotics were developed, and questions were raised about 
radiation's health effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Years later, radium patients are complaining of tumors, thyroid  
and immune disorders, brittle teeth and reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Public health advocates say the government should warn former  
radium patients that they could be at risk of contracting cancer or 
other diseases. They say notification could save lives by prompting 
people to get checkups or at least to discuss the matter with 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said  
diagnostic tests are unnecessary for anyone who does not show 
symptoms of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current studies do not indicate substantial increases in risks  
for ... disease among those who received NP (nasopharyngeal) radium 
treatments,'' the agency said in the March 29, 1996, edition of its 
weekly morbidity and mortality report. 
</P>
<P>
	Farber contends CDC specialists are ignoring important evidence  
of radium's health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's severely impeachable science,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	By the CDC's own estimate, as many as 2 million people were  
treated with nasal radium. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has taken some steps to help.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Congress required the Department of Veterans Affairs  
to provide health care to veterans who had radium treatments and 
were suffering head or neck cancer. But little has been done for 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC has cited various studies, two of which dealt  
specifically with nasal radium. 
</P>
<P>
	One 1982 study in Maryland of hundreds of people who had nasal  
radium from 1943-60 found four cancer deaths -- three of the brain 
and one of the soft palate -- in the treated group, compared with 
none in people who were untreated as children. A follow-up study is 
awaiting agency review. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anne Mellinger-Birdsong of CDC's National Center for  
Environmental Health said the findings were too small to draw broad 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, she said, ``If necessary, we're going to revise  
our recommendations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CDC's approach has not been completely hands-off. The CDC once  
urged patients who had nasal radium to tell their doctors and 
posted information about the treatment on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about those who do not remember?  
</P>
<P>
	Mellinger-Birdsong said most people probably will recall such an  
uncomfortable treatment and can get a physical if they are worried. 
</P>
<P>
	If they do not remember, ``we don't feel it would be that  
harmful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Culpeppers would disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	Before Steve Culpepper died in January, he told his family he  
was glad his mother was not around to see him suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Thank God my mother died,' so she wouldn't have felt  
the guilt for taking him for those radium treatments,'' Mrs. 
Culpepper said.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Parents Ponder Warning Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Their friends portray them as the people  
next door: parents who attended Little League games, took their 
sons swimming and fishing, planned family trips and enjoyed the 
quiet of suburbia -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, whose murderous  
rampage Tuesday at Columbine High School left 15 dead, have dropped 
from sight, leaving friends to answer a haunting question that 
looms in this tragedy: 
</P>
<P>
	Did the parents turn a blind eye to warning signs their sons  
were deeply troubled? 
</P>
<P>
	Friends say what is extraordinary about the two families is how  
very ordinary they are: quiet people who celebrated Easters with 
neighbors, mowed their lawns, played hoops with their sons, sat on 
bleachers on long summer nights watching Little League. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric's parents are what we would call dream parents,'' said  
Terry Condo, who coached Eric in Little League in Plattsburgh, 
N.Y., where his father, Wayne, an Air Force transport pilot, was 
stationed in the mid-1990s. ``They were supportive, not critical. 
They didn't put undue pressure on their son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They raised their boys just like the rest of us,'' said Vicki  
Dehoff, a former neighbor of the Klebolds, who has known the family 
for 15 years. ``The parents are not monsters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others have wondered how the parents missed so many red  
flags: The boys' admiration for Hitler. Their obsession with 
violent video games. Harris' venomous messages on the Internet, 
prompting one classmate's father to contact police last year after 
Eric allegedly urged others to kill his son. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the boys' stockpiling of an arsenal, including  
semi-automatic guns, grenades and materials to make some 30 bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would be a little concerned about my son's room if I  
went in there and I found a sawed-off shotgun barrel ... sitting 
out there,'' on the dresser, Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone 
said Saturday, referring to what police found in one boy's home. 
Bomb-making materials, he added, also were in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this stuff was clearly visible. The parents should  
have known,'' Stone added. ``I think parents should be accountable 
for their kid's actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, on ``Fox News Sunday,'' said if  
evidence of an impending massacre had been sitting in the open in a 
gunman's home, ``perhaps charges will be filed and certainly should 
be filed'' against the parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if parents should be liable if their children have guns,  
Attorney General Janet Reno said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that 
it's important to ``identify who is responsible for them having 
guns -- what they knew or should have known and take appropriate 
steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the parents did know and when they knew it remains a  
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	They have said nothing beyond written statements, including one  
Saturday from the Klebolds, saying they held a service for their 
17-year-old son ``who we loved as much as we knew how to love a 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dylan's father, Thomas, had volunteered to help authorities  
during Tuesday's siege after hearing his son was a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we should go to the school and try and effect his  
surrender, to play a role in trying to defuse what was going on,'' 
said Gary Lozow, a Klebold attorney, who contacted authorities on 
the father's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was too late.  
</P>
<P>
	Friends of the Klebolds describe them as caring, attentive  
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a conscientious, normal family that's done everything  
right,'' said Michael Briand, an associate of Mrs. Klebold. ``This 
came as a bolt out of the blue because Dylan had apparently been 
making some progress. Apparently he was loosening his immersion in 
this Gothic culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Klebolds are professionals: Thomas, 52, a former  
geophysicist, runs a mortgage management business from his sleek 
$400,000 cedar-and-glass home at the foot of the Rockies. He has 
been described as a liberal who favors gun control. Susan, 50, 
works for the Colorado community college system, helping train 
disabled students for the work world. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Klebold was raised Jewish and her grandfather, Leo, was a  
prominent real estate developer and philanthropist in Columbus, 
Ohio, where a Jewish community center is named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Before her son's funeral, Mrs. Klebold had her hair done and  
told her hairdresser that prejudice was never taught in their home 
and it pained her to see her son depicted as a monster. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no hint of family trouble years ago in the Klebold  
household, said Mrs. Dehoff, the former neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just remember laughing a lot when I was over at her house,''  
she said, recalling how she and her children regularly joined Mrs. 
Klebold and her two sons at a neighborhood swimming pool. ``She has 
a big heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dehoff, whose daughter, Krysti, was near the school library  
where many of the dead were found, also is not surprised Dylan and 
Eric could conceal a yearlong plot to commit mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many kids whose goal in life is to hide their  
plans,'' she said. ``Most of us are the last ones to see our kids 
in trouble. You're just blinded by ... love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both boys apparently not only deceived their parents, but the  
probation officer who placed the two in an intensive probation 
program last year after they broke into a car and stole electronic 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klebolds have lived in Colorado for many years. The Harrises  
moved to Littleton in 1996. Wayne Harris works for a flight-safety 
business. His wife, Katherine, 49, works for a catering company. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Harris retired from the military, the family was often on  
the move, living in Ohio, Michigan and New York since the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor in Oscoda, Mich., the Rev. William Stone, remembers  
Harris put up a basketball backboard in their driveway and played 
hoops with his two boys, including Kevin, who is two years older 
than 18-year-old Eric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some families you can almost predict something tragic would  
happen,'' he said. ``Not this family. They cared for each other. 
They seemed to enjoy their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton, both families have received words and tokens of  
support, including flowers at their doorsteps. A sign planted in 
the Klebold yard reads: 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom and Sue, We (a heart symbol for love) you. We're here for  
you. Call us,'' followed by several names. 
</P>
<P>
	John Horan, a funeral director who has buried some of the slain  
teens, said people should think twice before pointing fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started out feeling angry toward the parents until I  
realized I know one of the parents,'' said Horan, who knows Mrs. 
Klebold. ``It was kind of a wake-up call about being careful not to 
judge someone too quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And coach Condo said the parents of the two boys should not be  
forgotten in the grieving. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the rest of their lives going to be like?'' he asked.  
``Obviously, this is not something that's going to go away.''

	Colorado Shooting Victims Mourned  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Families, friends and strangers today  
clung to each other during a 75-minute memorial service for the 12 
students and one teacher massacred at Columbine High School. More 
than 70,000 attended the ceremony, held in a movie theater parking 
lot a few blocks from where two teen-agers went on a rampage and 
then killed themselves Tuesday. Vice President Al Gore and Gen. 
Colin Powell were among the dignitaries who surrounded a makeshift 
stage. Mourners -- twice as many as had been expected -- stood in 
rapt attention as Gore described how children must be raised. He 
never mentioned by name Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who went on 
the shooting spree and tried to blow up the school apparently 
because they felt like rejected misfits.

	Refugees Describe Serb Tactics  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo refugees who reached  
Macedonia today told relief workers of Serb paramilitaries entering 
villages, ordering residents out of their homes and opening fire on 
them. The latest accounts depict Serb paramilitaries combing more 
northerly villages and executing residents, said Ron Redmond, a 
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. More than 
600,000 refugees -- mostly ethnic Albanians -- have fled Kosovo since 
NATO airstrikes began, and Western aid groups say hundreds of 
thousands of others are displaced within the province, many trying 
to leave. 

</P>
<P>
	NATO Supports Yugoslavia Neighbors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders today promised military  
protection and economic aid to Yugoslavia's neighbors for standing 
with the West against Slobodan Milosevic. ``If Mr. Milosevic 
threatens them for helping us, we will respond,'' President Clinton 
said. In one of their final acts in the three-day summit marking 
the alliance's 50th anniversary, NATO's leaders sat down with the 
representatives of the ``frontline states'' -- Yugoslavia's seven 
neighbors, all feeling the fallout from the combat in Kosovo -- and 
promised to stand by them. ``The nations of the region have risked, 
and even faced, armed confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and 
supporting our campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' Clinton 
said. 

</P>
<P>
	Social Security Fix Languishes  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said today  
Congress will do nothing this year to overhaul the Social Security 
system since President Clinton has failed to take the lead. ``He's 
really proposed nothing on Social Security,'' the Mississippi 
Republican told ABC. But on Friday, the president blamed the GOP 
for inaction on Social Security. ``Republican leaders have yet to 
consider my proposals or advance any of their own,'' he said. Both 
Democrats and Republicans have made shoring up Social Security a 
primary goal of the 106th Congress.

	IMF Approves Global Crisis Program

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said today it  
had given final approval to a major change in procedures that will 
allow it to make available billions of dollars in resources to 
countries in hopes of averting future global financial crises. IMF 
Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Italian Finance Minister 
Carlo Ciampi announced that the agency's executive board had given 
final approval to creation of new ``contingent credit lines.'' The 
IMF endorsement represented a major victory for President Clinton. 
He had put forward the idea in October.

Toronto 4-3 for a sweep of their three-game series. Ricky Ledee 
singled home Williams in the sixth inning to put the Yanks ahead.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Simon's haunting lyrics to ``Mrs.  
Robinson'' echoed through Yankee Stadium today, celebrating the 
memory of Joe DiMaggio as the team dedicated a monument to one of 
baseball's greatest players. A sellout Stadium crowd watched 
DiMaggio's former teammates -- Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Phil 
Rizzuto, Hank Bauer, Jerry Coleman and Gil McDougald -- gather for 
the unveiling of the granite and bronze monument, only the fifth to 
be dedicated in the team's 97-year history. The others honor Babe 
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. Simon, standing 
in center field, sang the song that was written for the movie ``The 
Graduate'' and paid tribute to DiMaggio.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Device Helps Trace Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) -- Dave Smith stares at a computer screen as  
a satellite map of North America telescopes down to a grid of a 
major city and, finally, to a single neighborhood with green space 
and railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	He clicks a mouse. A dial tone sounds, followed by the screech  
of a modem. Suddenly a little panda icon with a red bow tie appears 
at the intersection of Linwood Drive and Warren Road. A few seconds 
later, amid more tones and screeches, the panda lurches to another 
spot on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's out on the highway now,'' says Smith, a former Defense  
Department computer programmer. ``We're within 100 yards of that 
right now -- well within visual range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, now a private computer consultant, has just accessed a  
global positioning satellite unit, or GPS, in Canada. But he's not 
tracking a stolen car. He's hunting down a kidnapped child -- or, 
rather, a software engineer in Toronto posing as one for this test. 
</P>
<P>
	All from a tiny office in South Carolina peach country. All  
because a pair of businessmen-grandfathers decided that if you can 
track a stolen car, you should be able to track a stolen child. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can replace an automobile,'' says Bill Brown, who along  
with Dan Booker founded Protect Me Toys last year. ``You can't 
replace a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their plan is to eventually give away the devices.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not Bill Gates, but we live comfortably,'' says Booker,  
50, who with Brown struck it rich selling prepaid telephone calling 
cards and drives a gleaming white Rolls-Royce to his Anderson 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair have spent about $250,000 of their own money to develop  
a system that can be hidden in the bottom of a backpack or in an 
unobtrusive fanny pack. Now they're looking for investors to help 
bring their plan to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea developed a few years ago when Brown's son was divorced  
and Brown became concerned for the safety of his 3-year-old 
granddaughter. He says he went shopping for something that could 
help him keep track of her, but found nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology was focused on recovering cars. Brown, 48, says  
he was told that kids could be tracked only ``when a child was 
capable of wearing a 40-pound battery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are more than 600,000 abduction attempts on children each  
year, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children. Each day, 2,300 children are reported missing and entered 
into the FBI's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
	The two friends kept searching and eventually found Canadian  
Marconi Co., which was selling GPS units to do everything from 
tracking bulls on the loose to telling golfers how far they hit a 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable ... the different calls that you would get  
for weird applications,'' says Hubert Pellerin, product manager for 
Marconi's GPS group. ``But this one was a really nice one. Because 
I have three kids, also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marconi took a GPS card that it developed for Boeing 777s and  
made it more sensitive. It's about the size of a business card and 
weighs less than an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	Pellerin combined the card with a cellular phone receiver and  
antenna. He added a layer of aluminum shielding to keep the 
components from interfering with each other. The entire package 
weighs around 1 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The SatCel unit basically ``sleeps'' until it is called by the  
tracking center, so the 870-hour standby battery doesn't run down 
unnecessarily. There's no ringing when it is contacted, so as not 
to tip off a kidnapper. 
</P>
<P>
	The signal can be reached anywhere that has cell phone coverage,  
and is strong enough to be detected from the trunk of a car. The 
GPS cannot be reached from inside a building, but its memory can 
play back its last 100 locations. 
</P>
<P>
	Booker and Brown expect the unit to cost about $200, with a  
monthly activation fee of as little as $5. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they tested the device with a juvenile justice agency  
and the Anderson Police, using Booker's 5-year-old granddaughter as 
the abductee and her father as the kidnapper. Officials say it 
worked splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The first five units have been sent to Child Search, a  
Houston-based nonprofit group that hunts missing children, to be 
given to five children considered most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Brandon Ward, operations officer of Child Search, says the  
concept has been discussed for years. ``These are the first guys 
who've put their money where their mouth is,'' says Ward, whose 
group helped find more than 500 missing children last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a consultant on the project, says its possibilities are  
numerous. People could use the device to track a grandparent with 
Alzheimer's disease, hikers, wayward teen-agers -- even the school 
bus your child is riding. 
</P>
<P>
	The device now is about the size of a box of animal crackers,  
but work is under way to make it smaller, stronger and more 
accurate. Fugawi Software, the Toronto firm that did the mapping, 
is developing a tracking system that can be run on a home computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown envisions the day when a GPS unit can be sewn into a  
child's jacket or tucked into a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``The predators,'' he says, ``are going to watch TV and say, `It  
ain't like it used to be. We can't just snatch anybody we want 
to.'''

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A small explosion Sunday at the  
Central American University campus, where student demonstrators 
have used homemade bombs, left four children with head and hand 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	A doctor at Managua's La Mascota Children's Hospital said the  
four, whose ages and names were not released, were given emergency 
treatment. No information was available on their condition.

	Students backed by the leftist Sandinista party have been  
demonstrating for three weeks, demanding that the center-right

	Protesters have used bombs made from sulfur, potassium and small  
glass or metal projectiles in confrontations with police.

	SAN VICENTE DE CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- A Catholic priest,  
fearing bloodshed between leftist rebels and their right-wing foes,

<P>
	The Rev. Rufino Perez appealed to President Andres Pastrana to  
redeploy the soldiers he withdrew six months ago, saying: ``Please 
don't let us die at the hands of the guerrillas and the 
paramilitaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the November pullout of 2,500 police and soldiers from  
this and four other area towns, rebel intimidation has driven many 
people from their homes and commerce has collapsed, Perez said.

<HEADLINE> Daley Apologizes to False Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mayor Richard Daley says he will apologize to two  
young boys who were falsely accused of killing an 11-year-old girl 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll apologize to them personally -- to the family, to all of  
them,'' Daley said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cook County prosecutors charged convicted sex  
offender Floyd Durr, 30, with murder, kidnapping, unlawful 
restraint and predatory criminal sexual assault in the slaying of 
Ryan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	Durr, who remains jailed without bond, also is charged with  
aggravated criminal sexual abuse for an unrelated case involving a 
14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ages 7 and 8, were arrested 12 days after Harris' body  
was found in a vacant lot in the Englewood neighborhood last July. 
She had been savagely beaten and sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests came after six hours of questioning by detectives,  
who said the two confessed to killing Harris because they wanted 
her new bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges were dropped against them in September after tests  
revealed semen on Ryan's underwear. The boys were too young to have 
produced semen. 
</P>
<P>
	One attorney for the 8-year-old boy has filed a $100 million  
lawsuit against the city and police department. Both Police Supt. 
Terry Hillard and Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine have 
told the boys and their families that they regret how the case was 
handled.

	Reflections of former students at American Indian boarding  
schools: 

</P>
<P>
 *ABUSE   	

</P>
<P>
	``There was one fella (a dorm attendant) that was having mental  
health problems, and they sent him to the school to get him out of 
the way. Anyway, he would have these psychotic episodes and hear 
voices, and he would just come out of his room in the middle of the 
night and randomly pick people out and whip them severely for no 
reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Peter Campbell, Colville/Coeur d'Alene, who attended two Roman  
Catholic boarding schools in Washington and Idaho in the 1950s. 

</P>
<P>
	``Our (dorm) matron, she would spank us real hard on the rear,  
put us over this old-fashioned laundry tub, and just spank the hell 
out of us. It got to the point where it didn't bother us, so she 
would use her high heels. She would start slapping your face, 
hitting us until we cried. We learned to start crying so she would 
stop. Someday I'd like to confront her and talk to her about what 
she did to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ethel Sales, Navajo, who attended a Christian Reformed mission  
school in Rehobeth, N.M. 

</P>
<P>
	``I loved it. I would cry when I had to go home. They were very  
good to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Leola Johnston, Choctaw, who attended St. Agnes Academy, a  
Roman Catholic boarding school in Oklahoma. 

</P>
<P>
 *LANGUAGE   	

</P>
<P>
	``There's an expression in Ojibwe, pronounced hai'. It's like  
`too bad,' showing sympathy. As I was getting off the bus for the 
first time, I said that to someone who tripped. I got slapped by 
the matron, who said, `You don't use that language here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jim Northrup, Fond du Lac Chippewa, who attended the Pipestone  
Indian Training School in Pipestone, Minn., in the 1940s and '50s. 

</P>
<P>
	``They used to take this brown soap, and if they caught us  
talking Indian, they made us eat the brown soap. She (a friend) and 
I used to hide in this steel closet talking Indian. We got caught 
once, and this lady closed the door on us and almost smothered us 
... She told us never to talk Indian again, but we did, whenever 
anyone was out of earshot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jo Anna Meninick, Yakama, who attended the Chemawa Indian  
School in Salem, Ore., in the 1950s. 

</P>
<P>
	``I had a few friends whose family spoke the same language that  
I did, but the language had been discouraged for so many years that 
truly nobody was speaking it. When we were speaking about something 
confidential, then we'd go in a corner and talk the language to one 
another and be shush-shush about it, and know we were breaking the 
rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Vi Hilbert, Upper Skagit, who attended boarding schools in  
Washington and Oregon in the 1920s and '30s and is now a tribal 
language-preservation activist. 

</P>
<P>
 *RELIGION   	

</P>
<P>
	``I used religion as a way to ask God to help me. They said if  
you ask God for anything, he'll help you, so I'd want to talk to 
God. I made sure I was the first one in line on Sunday, so when I 
went into the church I would be in the front row, so if Jesus came, 
I could tell him I want to come home. I believed Jesus was coming 
and he would help us out of that dilemma. But God never came. The 
government won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Meninick.  

</P>
<P>
	``My mother and father explained to me that I was going into a  
strange world. They prepared me very well for the occasion with 
religion. As I left home, my mother gave me a pouch of corn pollen. 
She said, 'Keep this. This is like your Bible. Someone is going to 
try to take it away from you, but this is yours. You keep it, this 
is your church, your belief.' I kept it. No one ever took it away 
from me.''

<HEADLINE> NRA Says Prosecution Is the Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Justice Department official said Sunday  
the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., demonstrate the need to 
restrict youngsters' access to guns, while the National Rifle 
Association believes more prosecutions of gun offenses could 
prevent such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and NRA executive vice  
president Wayne LaPierre did agree that juveniles convicted of a 
violent crime should be barred from ever owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder, Justice's second-ranking official, said on CBS' ``Face  
the Nation'' that stricter gun laws ``would certainly help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Congress to act quickly on an administration proposal  
extending the Brady Law, which imposes background checks on 
gun-buyers, to cover juveniles. The administration also is pushing 
a bill that would require trigger locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying ``we need to deal with adults who make guns  
available to kids,'' Holder described as ``very dangerous 
concepts'' some proposals to hold parents accountable if they 
``should have known'' their children had guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said  
it was important to find out how the two students suspected in the 
shootings got their weapons, as well as ``what the parents knew or 
should have known and take appropriate steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Holder said the NRA and other gun groups should support  
``reasonable regulations'' on the use and possession of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre, also on CBS, agreed that violent juveniles ``should  
forever be prohibited from owning a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said stepping up prosecutions of gun law offenses was the  
best way to prevent shootings such as last week's at Columbine High 
School, in one teacher and 14 students, including the two suspects, 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of lax prosecutions of gun offenses, LaPierre said  
in the past two years there have been 6,000 incidents of guns 
showing up in schools, but only 13 prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NRA support for state laws allowing people with permits  
to carry concealed weapons was ``simply off the point'' from the 
school shootings. People who apply for permits are not the type to 
commit crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his Saturday radio address, said he would  
push for legislation that would crack down on gun shows and illegal 
gun trafficking, prohibit violent juveniles from buying guns and 
close loopholes that let juveniles own assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	There are dozens of gun-control bills pending in Congress, but  
chances of passage are uncertain under a Republican majority that 
generally has opposed new restrictions on gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a united effort on the part of our people  
to determine that we just have got to reduce the access to these 
kinds of weapons that again have no sporting purpose,'' said Sen. 
Carl Levin, D-Mich., on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press''  
that it was time to form a national commission, with 
representatives from the entertainment and gun industries, to study 
the causes and prevention of youth violence.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Columbine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Comforting each other with ceremony and  
song, Columbine High School's mourners turned a strip-mall parking 
lot into an arena of grief and promised each other they would reach 
past their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore brought the 70,000 heartbroken people a  
message Sunday: ``You are not alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, spending the day at the memorial service, were to  
resume their work this morning, conducting more interviews and 
eyeing the possibility of additional suspects in Tuesday's 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 students slain, three were to be laid to rest today. A  
funeral also was scheduled for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher 
hailed as a hero for shepherding students to safety during the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's outdoor ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of  
the snow-capped Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of 
students, singers and public officials tried to make sense of the 
week's events. Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- 
even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High  
School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This 
community will not be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian singer Amy Grant began a tribute song to the victims  
with a gentle lament: ``So much pain and no reason why.'' Bagpipe 
players played ``Amazing Grace'' and four F-16 jets flew over in a 
``missing-man'' formation after 13 doves were released -- one for 
each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen sang a tribute they wrote.  
Jonathan Cohen, a junior, was trapped in the Columbine choir room 
when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria where 
many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious  
ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain 
will take our pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis called the gathering ``the  
end of a nightmare.'' Religious leaders urged trust in God. And 
Gore, thundering like a preacher at a revival, underscored that 
bloodshed like that allegedly caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris must remain an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for  
the spirit of America,'' Gore said. ``America is a good and decent 
place, and our goodness is a light to all the nations of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, enraged by what they considered taunts and insults  
from classmates, allegedly rampaged through their school with guns 
and bombs before turning their weapons on themselves. 
Investigators, amazed at the sheer firepower, are trying to 
determine if others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have found a diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail,  
as well as bomb-making materials and weapons in one of the pair's 
bedroom. More interviews were set for this week; more than 500 have 
already been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for  
the day, concentrating on directing traffic for the shopping-center 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the service took on the flavor of a somber pep rally.  
Senior Amber Burgess, after eulogizing Sanders, urged the crowd to 
persevere and invoked school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are!'' she yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Columbine!'' thousands replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the proceedings moved en masse to Clement Park, adjacent to  
Columbine and -- as long as the school remains cordoned off -- the 
mourning place of choice and site of a vast makeshift memorial. 
Hundreds lined the procession route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good  
community, and all the kids love each other. But to see the kids 
and the community come together was just amazing,'' said Scott 
Rathbun, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss, 18, grazed by a bullet while helping teachers and  
students hide in a closet and overhead air ducts, limped behind 
Gore and was supported by DeAngelis. Mourners applauded as they 
passed, and Littleton firefighters walked beside Foss, patting him 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``God Bless you guys!'' a man shouted. ``You've got a reason to  
live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a  
church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a cross-country runner who had recently returned from a  
two-week trip to Paris with the French club; she was an aspiring 
songwriter and author eager to get her driver's license. The 
victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong to 
neighboring churches of the same Roman Catholic archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at 
Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate 
Columbine's overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at Fiddler's  
Green, a suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts -- 
one baby step toward normalcy -- and in defiance of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come  
together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends 
Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the 
hope.''

<HEADLINE> Researcher Seeks Sickle Cell Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Elizabeth Martin laments the childhood  
holidays and birthdays robbed by a silent stalker that struck 
without warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The same disease sometimes turned Sonja Walker's college nights  
into torture and briefly drove Hertz Nazaire onto the streets. He 
now channels his suffering into artwork that starkly portrays his 
torment. 
</P>
<P>
	All three suffer from sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder  
afflicting more than 70,000 Americans, reducing life expectancy to 
about 40 years. The disease predominantly strikes blacks, but 
affects other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to end the cycle of suffering and death, University of  
Louisville researcher Dr. Suzanne Ildstad expects to begin soon 
experimental treatments seeking a safe cure. Sickle cell patients 
deemed at high risk of dying will receive low doses of radiation 
and bone marrow transplants at University of Louisville and Kosair 
Children's hospitals in Louisville and at St. Jude Hospital in 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The radiation will destroy some but not all of the patients'  
bone marrow, Ildstad said. Donor marrow, specially treated to avoid 
rejection by the body, will be transplanted to mix with the 
patients' own remaining marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal we have is to make it more safe,'' Ildstad said. ``So  
rather than doing a transplant like you would for leukemia, where 
you completely wipe out the patient's own bone marrow and replace 
it, in this case we want a mixture of the patient's own bone marrow 
plus the donor marrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ildstad, who says her treatment should be far safer than past  
experiments, has FDA approval to begin the treatments on about two 
dozen patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In a previous sickle cell study based in Seattle, researchers  
destroyed all the patients' bone marrow and transplanted marrow 
from matching donors. Most patients were cured, but four of the 43 
eventually died of complications -- too high a percentage to suit 
researchers, Ildstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Collins, a bone marrow specialist in Texas, said he  
would be interested in using Ildstad's procedure to treat sickle 
cell disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to be able to do it less toxically to where it's the  
sort of procedure that didn't carry any risks,'' said Collins, 
director of the bone marrow transplant program at The University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. ``And I think the sort 
of study that Dr. Ildstad is doing is really right along those 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the first steps of getting there. The idea is to  
get the donor cells to take hold, but in a much less toxic manner. 
Her approach is something which I think holds a lot of promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish Hospital and Ildstad declined to grant interviews with  
any actual study subjects. Martin, Walker and Nazaire said they 
would be hesitant to undergo such experimental treatments for fear 
of side effects. They closely monitor the latest research, though, 
with hopes for a breakthrough that will rid them of the sickle cell 
scourge. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day they are going to come up with something, they are  
going to cry `Eureka' and we're all going to be OK,'' said Walker, 
44, of Pine Bluff, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	In sickle cell sufferers, hemoglobin forms a gel or crystals in  
the cells, giving the red blood cells a distinctive sickle shape 
and making them brittle. They often block blood vessels, 
restricting oxygen supply. 
</P>
<P>
	What results can be a sickle-cell crisis, which can cause severe  
pain, kill body tissue and lead to strokes. The attacks can include 
fever, chest pain, pneumonia, blood infections, kidney failure and 
breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sickle cell crisis is what the word says,'' Walker said.  
``Most people could go all their lives without feeling that kind of 
pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the new study, researchers should know within weeks whether  
each patient's treatment is working, Ildstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the bone marrow transplant is a success, they should be  
making donor red blood cells pretty early, within a month to two 
months after the transplant,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Red blood cells produced by the transplanted marrow should have  
an advantage over sickle cells produced by a patient's own marrow, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ildstad said her search for a cure was motivated by the  
devastating suffering caused by sickle cell. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other sickle cell sufferers, Martin, 27, of West Natick,  
Mass., has spent weeks at a time in the hospital when the pain 
became unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that can happen so spur of the moment that it's  
just so unpredictable,'' she said. ``It's like dealing with evil 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has spent birthdays, Christmases and New Year's Days  
tethered to hospital IVs to relieve the pain. It was a Mother's Day 
from her childhood, however, that underscored the disease's 
unpredictable cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration began without hint of trouble. One moment she  
cheerfully greeted her mother. The next, she was immobilized by 
shooting pain while retrieving a present she had forgotten in her 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reached down to get the present and, boom, I just felt this  
sharpness,'' Martin said. ``I just dropped on the bed and couldn't 
move. It's stuck in my mind because it happened so fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the pain to curious childhood friends, she likened it  
to breaking the same leg bone three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're in so much pain it dehumanizes you,'' she said. ``It  
comes through the bone and just completely affects your body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who lives with her mother, is between jobs as a  
counselor. She has been near death twice, and two members of her 
sickle cell support group, both in their 30s, recently died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very sad because they were so young,'' she said. ``In my  
heart, I have accepted the fact that I may not live to see my 45th 
birthday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has overcome the disease to operate a real estate  
business. She endures almost-constant pain and has been 
hospitalized four times since December. When she was discharged 
Feb. 19, her older brother was admitted hours later suffering his 
own attack of sickle cell-related pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling with the disease, Nazaire dropped out of an art  
institute in Florida and a college in Connecticut. Unable to land a 
steady job, the 25-year-old Nazaire was homeless for a time last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now on disability, Nazaire has an apartment in Bridgeport,  
Conn., and designs Web sites to educate people about sickle cell. 
He created a series of paintings, done while in the throes of pain, 
to give others a glimpse into the world of sickle cell victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really describes the pain visually so people can see what  
the pain feels like because it's hard to put into words,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All three believe more money should go into sickle cell  
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, in her mid-40s, said time is especially crucial for her  
as researchers try to conquer the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm counting on it,'' she said. ``I love life, and I'm  
counting on holding onto it for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Hancock May Honor Next Derby Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Every now and then, Arthur Hancock III,  
who once recorded an album of country songs, will get out the 
guitar and sing one of his compositions -- ``The Sunday Silence 
Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tune honors the winner of the 1989 Kentucky Derby and  
Preakness, who was co-owned by Hancock. Maybe, in tribute to the 
125th Derby on Saturday, Hancock will be moved to compose ``The 
Menifee March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, bred by Hancock, who also co-owns the colt, is a  
leading Derby contender off his victory in the Blue Grass Stakes on 
April 11 at Keeneland. That was his fourth win in five career 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt, also owned by James Stone, won his only two starts as  
a 2-year-old in July and August. He then chipped a bone in a knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you're dealing with a chip, the longer it stays in the  
joint, the more cartilage it tears up,'' trainer Elliott Walden 
said Sunday. ``He was a colt with a future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So surgery was performed.  
</P>
<P>
	Menifee opened his 3-year-old campaign with a win in a  
seven-furlong allowance race Feb. 27 at Gulfstream Park, but then 
he finished second in the Tampa Bay Derby on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Pat Day, the winningest jockey in Churchill Downs  
history, elected to ride Menifee instead of Cat Thief in the Blue 
Grass or Answer Lively in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got our confidence back in the Blue Grass,'' Walden said.  
``Everything is going pretty much to plan. He's had three or four 
weeks between races, and my goal was to get three races into him 
before the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, sixth in the eight-horse Blue Grass field, stormed past  
three horses on the outside in the stretch and won by 1 1/4 lengths 
over Cat Thief, with Florida Derby winner Vicar another half length 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was second by a length to Pineaff in the Tampa Bay  
Derby, but Walden does not regard it as a bad race by the colt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was five wide on the first turn and three wide on the  
second turn,'' Walden recalled. ``He got beat by circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee worked five-eighths of a mile in 1 minute flat Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He worked super,'' Walden said. ``He had running on his  
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move was similar to Victory Gallop's final work before last  
year's Derby, according to Walden, who added, ``That worked out 
well, but not quite well enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, second by 1 1/2 lengths to Real Quiet in 1998, was  
the first Derby starter for the 36-year-old Walden, whose father 
was a respected Kentucky owner and breeder and whose older brother, 
Ben Jr., operates the Vinery, a breeding farm near Midway. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible Walden will get two shots at winning in his second  
Derby. He also trains Mark Stanley's Ecton Park, fourth in the 
Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	That colt, however, might not get into the field if the  
20-starter rule is involved. The Derby is limited to 20 starters 
based on money earned in graded stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Ecton Park is in the Derby, that's fine,'' Walden said.  
``If not, we'll go to Illinois with him.'' The Illinois Derby will 
be run May 8 at Sportsman's Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden bought Menifee for $35,000 at a Keeneland September  
yearling sale in 1997. Hancock bought back a half interest, and 
Stone bought the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock, whose brother Seth is president of Claiborne Farm, also  
bred and co-owned Gato Del Sol, the 1982 Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first Derby for Stone, the 74-year-old owner of  
Stone Energy Corporation, based in New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Ballpark Turns Its Eyes to DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul Simon's haunting lyrics echoed through  
Yankee Stadium on Sunday, celebrating the memory of Joe DiMaggio as 
the team dedicated a monument to one of baseball's greatest 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	A nation turns its lonely eyes to you  
</P>
<P>
	What's that you say Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	On a sun-splashed afternoon, a sellout Stadium crowd watched  
DiMaggio's former teammates -- Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford, Phil 
Rizzuto, Hank Bauer, Jerry Coleman and Gil McDougald -- gather for 
the unveiling of the granite and bronze monument, only the fifth to 
be dedicated in the team's 97-year history. The others honor Babe 
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	All the players except Ford were in the starting lineup for Game  
6 of the 1951 World Series -- DiMaggio's final game. Public address 
announcer Bob Sheppard recited the lineup on Sunday, just as he did 
on that day -- Oct. 10, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	After an invocation by Cardinal John O'Connor, Rizzuto addressed  
the crowd. Then Simon, standing in center field, sang the song that 
was written for the movie ``The Graduate'' and became an anthem for 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	When he sang the line, ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?''  
the crowd responded with one more cheer for the Yankee Clipper, who 
died March 8 at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of DiMaggio's career were shown on the scoreboard,  
including clips of his final visit to Yankee Stadium, Sept. 27, 
1998, when he was honored before the final game of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the ex-Yankees for the ceremony were DiMaggio's  
granddaughters, Paula and Kathy, and longtime friend and lawyer 
Morris Engelberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman remembered DiMaggio as a solitary man and recalled being  
in awe of him when they became teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was raised in San Francisco. I knew more about him than any  
player that lived,'' he said. ``He was the god, the icon. He was 
it. He was baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first spring training was '48. He was there. It was  
thrilling, the magnitude of the man. I didn't go up to him and say, 
`Hi, Joe, I'm so-and-so.' Billy Martin tried to cozy up to him. 
That lasted about a week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, Coleman said, DiMaggio was the ultimate teammate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once, against Boston (Johnny) Pesky took Rizzuto out with a  
tough slide,'' he said. ``The next inning, Joe led off with a hit 
and never stopped. He took out (Bobby) Doerr at second base. You'd 
see that and you'd say, `Hey, he's our guy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said he saw DiMaggio make only one mistake.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once, he caught the second out of an inning and thought it was  
the third,'' he said. ``He took two steps and then reacted. It was 
the only time I saw him do something wrong. He threw to the right 
base, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer recalled playing center field in one game when Casey  
Stengel wanted to rest DiMaggio by playing him at first base. After 
a dozen or so putouts, DiMaggio told the manager to forget the rest 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	The monument salutes DiMaggio's accomplishments, including his  
recognition in 1969 -- a year after the Simon song was published -- 
as baseball's greatest living player. 
</P>
<P>
	It concludes with the words, ``An American icon. He has passed  
but will never be forgotten.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Pulled Both Ways / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the new era that has apparently dawned on  
Wall Street, it seems that bull markets never die -- they just 
experience ``group rotation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That bit of financial jargon is on the lips of many stock  
traders these days, as money has jumped out of some formerly 
popular blue-chip issues and into smaller stocks and basic 
industrials known on the Street as cyclicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which carries  
quite a few cyclical chemical and metals and forest products 
companies on its roster, is outgaining the previously unbeatable 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Russell 2,000, a small-stock index that looked as though  
it had been hardwired with a minus sign, actually moved into 
positive territory for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cyclical stocks and small- and mid-cap stocks have been  
outperforming the bigger caps, even technology and Internet 
stocks,'' observed Jeffrey Applegate at the investment firm of 
Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Is this the beginning of the long-awaited 
broadening out of the market alongside a period of sustained 
outperformance by small caps? Perhaps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the debate over this question, the markets have had some  
tumultuous days. In the past week, for instance, the Nasdaq 
composite index took a precipitous drop last Monday and then 
rallied back almost as fast as it had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say two powerful forces have combined to create this  
commotion. One is increasing evidence of strength in the economy, 
bolstered by signs of recovery in Asia, which suggests a possible 
revival of demand for commodities and manufactured goods closely 
tied to the business cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The other is the perception that blue-chip growth stocks and  
technology leaders had grown dangerously overpriced, even as many 
laggard cyclicals and small stocks started looking cheaper and 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just when we all figured out why the rally has been so narrow,  
the rally may be broadening,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist 
at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market leadership has been due for a change, and sector  
rotation appears to have begun,'' noted David Tillson, senior 
portfolio manager at U.S. Trust Corp. ``Value and mid-cap stocks 
may outperform large-cap growth stocks during the remainder of 
1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this is indeed happening, and isn't just the financial  
version of an athlete's head fake, it would hardly be the first 
``rotation'' during the great bull market of the '80s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	To the delight of bull-market enthusiasts, it has become  
customary among many professional investors never to pull out of 
stocks entirely. When you get worried about the stocks you own, or 
those stocks climb about as far as you think they can go, you 
simply sell those holdings and buy something else. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, modern equity managers recognize that the clients  
expect them to pick stocks, not to try to time the market. Most 
stock mutual funds make it a practice to stay ``fully invested'' at 
all times. 
</P>
<P>
	And why not? It has paid off big to operate this way for more  
than 15 years now. Most of the time, investors who pulled money out 
of the market got left behind or, in the case of professionals, 
lost their jobs. Only the bulls survived, and thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But veterans of the market wars say they don't ever want to fall  
into the trap of assuming that things will always stay this way. If 
circumstances change at some unpredictable moment, they assert, 
legions of ``equities-all-the-way'' investors and Internet day 
traders might suddenly find themselves caught in a rush to cash 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market has cooperated magnificently, providing a  
trader's dream come true,'' says Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., an analyst 
at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. ``But what if....? It could become 
quite painful. I don't think anyone doing this now is aware what 
happens to a market under stress.''

	NATO Destroys Last Novi Sad Bridge  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes destroyed the last  
remaining bridge in Yugoslavia's second-largest city early Monday. 
Meanwhile, Kosovo refugees reaching Macedonia on Sunday told relief 
workers of Serb paramilitaries entering villages, ordering 
residents out of their homes and opening fire on them. NATO struck 
targets in northern and central Serbia early Monday, knocking down 
the third of Novi Sad's bridges spanning the Danube River, Serbian 
media reported. Tanjug also said a fuel depot was targeted near the 
central Serbian town of Valjevo early Monday.

	NATO Backs Yugoslavia Neighbors  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO leaders today promised military  
protection and economic aid to Yugoslavia's neighbors for standing 
with the West against Slobodan Milosevic. ``If Mr. Milosevic 
threatens them for helping us, we will respond,'' President Clinton 
promised. As they brought their 50th anniversary summit to a close, 
the 19 NATO leaders agreed push ahead with an oil embargo to hinder 
Milosevic despite Russian objections and French misgivings. They 
also decided to intensify air attacks against Yugoslavia. But there 
was no agreement on the possibility of introducing ground forces.

	70,000 Mourn Columbine Victims  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Thirteen white doves fluttered into the  
slate gray sky today, over the heads of 70,000 people who filled a 
parking lot to mourn the 12 students and one teacher massacred at 
Columbine High School. Families, friends and strangers clung to 
each other during a 75-minute memorial service. They clutched 
flowers, blue and silver balloons and Bibles as they wept and 
wondered why it happened. ``All of us must change our lives to 
honor these children,'' Vice President Al Gore told the overflow 
crowd a few blocks from where two teen-agers went on a rampage and 
then killed themselves Tuesday.

	Anti-Drug Message Seems to Work  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Teens who received strong anti-drug messages at  
home were 42 percent less likely to use drugs than teens whose 
parents ignored the issue, according to a study released today by 
the Partnership for a Drug Free America. Although 98 percent of 
parents said they had spoken with their children about drugs, only 
27 percent of teens said they learned a lot about drug risks at 
home, the survey found. Among teens who learned a lot at home, 
marijuana use was 26 percent. Among those who said they learned 
nothing at home, 45 percent said they had used marijuana.

	Crash Message Played by Accident  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A recorded message inadvertently played aboard a  
London-bound British Airways jet from San Francisco told passengers 
that the plane was about to crash into the sea. The airline has yet 
to determine why the 15-second message was played, but it was 
likely a human error said British Airways spokeswoman Laura Devere. 
An investigation is under way. Passenger Lloyd Pople, from Reading, 
England, said passengers were ``in a state of shock.''

	Venezuela Endorses Chavez Plan  
</P>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans today approved in a  
referendum President Hugo Chavez' proposal for a new constitution. 
The measure's passage means Venezuelans will vote again in July to 
elect assembly members. Chavez's opponents fear he will use a new 
constitution to install an authoritarian regime. But the president 
contends the change is needed to overhaul a corrupt political 
system that has impoverished most Venezuelans.

	Chinese Stand in Silent Protest  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Some 10,000 people today jammed the sidewalks  
outside China's central government to demand the right to practice 
a system of meditation. The silent demonstration was the country's 
largest since Tiananmen Square in 1989. Demonstrators want legal 
protection for practicing Falun Gong, a system of controlled 
breathing, martial arts, meditation and healing that has been 
popular in China since bans on cultural traditions were lifted in 
the late 1970s. Protesters said Chinese officials in some areas 
were ``meddling'' and preventing people from practicing Falun.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks were little changed in early  
trading Monday, as the Nikkei average declined slightly in 
lackluster trading before a meeting of finance officials. The 
Nikkei drifted 6.98 points lower to 16,916.27 in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average gained 257.37 points.

</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson had 38 points to lead the  
Philadelphia 76ers to their fourth straight win, a 103-86 victory 
over the Orlando Magic today. The Magic, who lost for the fifth 
straight time and seventh time in their last eight, got 18 points 
from Darrell Armstrong, Horace Grant and Nick Anderson. Orlando's 
leading scorer Anfernee Hardaway was just 2-for-13 for six points 
in the loss.

<HEADLINE> Ex.-Nebraska Senator Hruska Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Former U.S. Sen. Roman Hruska, whose lengthy  
career as a conservative Republican lawmaker was largely 
overshadowed by a remark about mediocrity, died Sunday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska died at Clarkson Hospital from complications stemming  
from a fall that broke his hip on April 10, said his son, Roman 
Hruska Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska, born in David City, Neb., on Aug. 16, 1904, was the  
ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he 
retired in 1976. He was credited with wielding substantial 
influence in helping develop much of the nation's criminal justice 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to serve as an  
associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court that brought national 
notoriety to Hruska. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech before the Senate in March of 1970, Hruska responded  
to critics who said Carswell had at best been a mediocre federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges  
and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little 
representation, aren't they, and a little chance?'' Hruska said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quote was quickly shortened, in the vernacular and street  
talk of the time, to ``What's wrong with a little mediocrity?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was proud of his Czech heritage, traditional values and  
conservative political philosophy. He was what could legitimately 
be called an old-style politician. He liked to campaign, shake 
hands, and have a cold beer with a constituent on the appropriate 
occasion. His rhetorical style also harkened to a bygone day. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his retirement in 1977 the Los Angeles Times said  
of Hruska: 
</P>
<P>
	``Hruska's conservatism, which can be seen in most of his public  
policy stances, is also apparent in his personal style. He is an 
old-fashioned, righteously indignant, July 4 brand political orator 
and not just on the stump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the  
Omaha-dominated 2nd District in 1952. He resigned in 1954 to serve 
the unexpired four years remaining in the term of the late U.S. 
Sen. Hugh Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	Hruska was then re-elected for a full six-year term in 1958. He  
won re-election in 1958, 1964 and 1970.

<HEADLINE> NATO Summit Coming To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Down come the 44 flags at the Ronald Reagan  
Building -- one for each NATO member and partnership country. Out 
goes the plush blue and gray carpet with the NATO star insignias. 
And the blue placards along building walls. 
</P>
<P>
	What goes up, must come down.  
</P>
<P>
	Crews spent about a week putting up decorations for NATO's 50th  
anniversary summit, working from designs the NATO Host Committee 
spent two months preparing. 
</P>
<P>
	William Warner, a contracted special events designer with  
Hargrove Inc., said he expects his staff will be able to take 
everything down in less than two days. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The wait staff at a White House extravaganza for visiting  
leaders had a lot to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
	No earrings. No chewing gum. Ponytails must be tucked into shirt  
collars. Don't drip water onto the namecards. Don't leave 
thumbprints on the plates. Don't walk in front of the main table. 
Stick with your serving partner. Don't leave the floor -- even to 
use the restrooms. And, folks, try to look glamorous! 
</P>
<P>
	As the legion of servers prepared to receive nearly 900 guests  
under a South Lawn tent, they received a long list of instructions 
hollered from the podium microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	Server Henry Murrell had a particularly tough job. He was  
assigned to a back table on a decidedly sloping patch of ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to it,'' said Murrell, after setting a wine  
glass back to its correct spot after it tipped over and fell into 
the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Murrell, who came up from his Richmond, Va. home to work at the  
dinner, said he wasn't lured by the promise of a payday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did it for the experience,'' he smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Even Secret Service agents busy with keeping up security for the  
summit managed to squeeze in some shopping time for NATO 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Low, retail director for Guests Services, which had a  
booth of T-shirts and other goodies in the Ronald Reagan building, 
said an ``amazing number'' of her patrons were agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot items: $18 khaki or black baseball caps with the NATO  
anniversary emblem. 
</P>
<P>
	More upscale shoppers could head to a booth selling jewelry from  
The Ann Hand Collection. A $50 pin featured a gold-plated NATO 
emblem studded with Austrian crystals. A portion of the proceeds 
will benefit Kosovo refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service set up its own mini post office in the  
center, selling favorites like Tweety Bird stamps along with 
providing services such as two-day overseas mail. The biggest 
seller there? ``Calling cards ... and for some reason, the Marilyn 
Monroe tie,'' said supervisor Mary Wood. 
</P>
<P>
	A special NATO anniversary stamp will be issued later this year,  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Stadium Turns Its Eyes to DiMaggio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing alone in center field at Yankee  
Stadium, the way Joe DiMaggio did for 13 majestic seasons, 
songwriter Paul Simon sang his anthem of the '60s that closes with 
a poignant lament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?  
</P>
<P>
	``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you  
</P>
<P>
	``What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?  
</P>
<P>
	``Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.''  
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died March 8, is gone but will never be forgotten  
by the Yankees, who dedicated a monument to his memory Sunday 
before a sellout crowd of 51,903 that included a half-dozen of his 
old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	As Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, Whitey Ford, Jerry Coleman, Gil  
McDougald and Hank Bauer participated in the ceremonies, the 
poignancy of the event was not lost on present-day Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``These sorts of days can only happen in Yankee Stadium,'' said  
David Cone, New York's starting pitcher Sunday against Toronto. ``I 
was star struck with Paul Simon singing in center field. I had to 
stop my warmup. I felt proud just to be out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Yankees bench, Bernie Williams, who finished the day with  
three hits, including the game-winner, was touched by the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great treat,'' said the team's present-day center  
fielder. ``It was almost surreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto manager Jim Fregosi, a native of San Francisco,  
DiMaggio's hometown, felt privileged to witness the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was wonderful,'' he said. ``I'm pleased I had the  
opportunity to be here in the stadium. It was a nice feeling to be 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute was handled tastefully, understandable because the  
Yankees have so much experience with such events. 
</P>
<P>
	All the old players except Ford were in the Yankees starting  
lineup for Game 6 of the 1951 World Series -- DiMaggio's final game. 
Public address announcer Bob Sheppard recited that game's lineup on 
Sunday, just as he did on that day -- Oct. 10, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the old teammates for the unveiling ceremony were  
DiMaggio's granddaughters, Paula Hamra and Kathie Stein, and his 
longtime attorney, Morris Engelberg. Cardinal John O'Connor 
delivered the invocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Simon sang the song that was written for the movie ``The  
Graduate'' and became an anthem for the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	When he sang the line, ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?''  
the crowd responded with one more cheer for the Yankee Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-pound monument was the fifth erected in the fenced-in  
area in left-center field. The others honor Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, 
Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	The inscription remembers DiMaggio's accomplishments in a  
13-year career that produced nine World Series championships. 
Included is his designation in 1969 as baseball's greatest living 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the monument DiMaggio is lauded as ``a baseball  
legend and an American icon. He has passed but he will never leave 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman remembered DiMaggio as a larger-than-life hero for a  
young infielder who, like Fregosi, grew up in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled March 1949, when the Yankees were in Fort Worth,  
Texas, part of a two-week spring training barnstorming trip. ``He 
didn't show up and we asked, `Where's Joe.' Somebody said, `We've 
got a problem.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the year he had the heel problem. He was out until  
June, never picked up a baseball, never picked up a bat. He walked 
into Fenway Park and hit four home runs in three games. We won all 
three and that was the difference that year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, New York City honored the player known as  
the Yankee Clipper by putting his name on a dilapidated highway 
known for potholes and traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Side Highway became the Joe DiMaggio Highway in a  
ceremony attended by DiMaggio's granddaughters, Yankees owner 
George Steinbrenner and Rizzuto. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you come up and down here, it's going to bring back  
memories,'' said Rizzuto, a Hall of Fame shortstop who played with 
DiMaggio in the 1940s and '50s. ``I know Joe is going to be looking 
down at the Yankees and he's going to be really proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who guarded his privacy, had agreed with plans to  
place his name on the highway since it would not replace anyone 
already honored. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature voted unanimously to rename the highway,  
which runs north-south in Manhattan alongside the Hudson River, 
between Battery Place and West 72nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The name change is ceremonial, meaning signs and maps will still  
identify the road as the West Side Highway, which has been under 
reconstruction for much of the last two decades and is the scene of 
daily traffic backups. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional signs will be erected informing motorists that the  
stretch of the road had been named in honor of DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	The renaming was one of several events this weekend to honor  
DiMaggio. On Friday, a memorial service was held at St. Patrick's 
Cathedral.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks were little changed Monday, with  
the benchmark index declining slightly in lackluster trading before 
a meeting of finance officials. The U.S. dollar fell against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average drifted 6.98  
points, or 0.04 percent, lower to 16,916.27 in the first 30 minutes 
of trading. On Friday, the average gained 257.37 points, or 1.54 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.97 yen in early trading, down 0.61 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 
119.41 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors refrained from taking big  
positions ahead of a meeting scheduled for later Monday of finance 
ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven 
industrialized nations, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 3.60 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,339.07. The 
TOPIX closed up 21.03 points, or 1.60 percent Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar lost ground against the yen in  
thin trading as dealers awaited the opening of the G-7 meeting in 
Washington, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 126.29 yen, down from 127.28  
yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the newly selected benchmark No. 212 10-year  
Japanese government bond fell to 1.515 percent from Friday's finish 
of 1.535 percent, driving up its price to 102.49 yen from 102.31 
yen.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton's Speech at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of statement by President Clinton at close of NATO 50th  
Anniversary Summit, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing 
House: 
</P>
<P>
	Hello. I am going to read a statement and I have to go  
unfortunately to another appointment, but Secretary Albright and 
Secretary Cohen and Mr. Berger, General Shelton are going to be 
available to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	We came to this summit committed to chart a course for the NATO  
alliance for the 21st century, one that embraces new members, new 
partners and new missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Here we committed NATO first to fulfill it's mission of  
collective defense with the ability to meet new security threats. 
Second, to remain open to new allies, and to seek stronger 
partnerships with nations all across Europe, Central Asia, and 
obviously including Ukraine and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	We've also reaffirmed our determination repeatedly to intensify  
our actions, military and economic, until we achieve our objectives 
in Kosovo. On this, the alliance leaves Washington more united even 
than it was when we came here. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile we will stand by the neighboring countries that have  
accepted risks and hardship in support of this effort. If Mr. 
Milosevic threatens them for helping us, we will respond. 
</P>
<P>
	And we will work to support democracy and development in the  
region so that the forces pulling people together will be stronger 
than those pulling them apart, and all nations, including someday a 
democratic Serbia, can join the European mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	What NATO did here his weekend was to reaffirm our commitment to  
a common future, rooted in common humanity. Standing against ethnic 
cleansing is both a moral imperative, and a practical necessity, as 
the leaders of the front-line states who have so much at stake in 
the outcome, made so clear to us. 
</P>
<P>
	Our vision of a Europe undivided, democratic, free and at peace  
depends upon our constructive commitment to the hundreds of 
thousands of poor refugees, so many men, women and children with no 
place else to turn, who have been made pawns in a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	It depends upon our ability and our collective commitment after  
this crisis has passed to help all the people of southeastern 
Europe build a better future. 
</P>
<P>
	In our last luncheon, just a few moments ago, when we had all  
the members of our partnership council there, someone made a joke 
and said, look around this room. We have several members of the 
last Politburo here, that the Soviet Union had. And then they were 
counting up. And then others said, well, we weren't on the 
Politburo, but we should have been. And they were laughing. But 
they made an important point. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been this breathtaking explosion of freedom. But the  
old order has not yet been replaced by a new one that answers all 
the legitimate needs of people. Not just for freedom, but also for 
security and prosperity. We must be committed to building that kind 
of future for the people of Central Europe, for the people of 
southeastern Europe, and for our other partners, going all the way 
to the central Asian states. 
</P>
<P>
	We cannot expect for people to stop being drawn back to old ways  
of organizing themselves, even profoundly destructive ways resting 
on ethnic and religious divisions, unless there is a far more 
powerful magnet out there before them. And so we committed 
ourselves to building that kind of future, for all of our allies in 
the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	When all is said and done, I think people will look back on this  
summit, perhaps many years from now, and say that was its lasting 
value. We looked to the future with a clear vision and made a 
commitment to build it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In the gym and classrooms at Columbine  
High School, William ``Dave'' Sanders sandwiched life's lessons 
between pointers on jump shots and tips on reading a stock table. 
</P>
<P>
	When gunfire and explosions echoed through Columbine's cafeteria  
Tuesday, Sanders was there for his kids. He leapt onto tables, 
frantically waving and shouting for them to get out. He raced 
through the halls, herding students to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sanders was shot twice in the chest and staggered into a  
classroom, the students he loved so much were there for him. They 
tore off their T-shirts and pressed them to his wounds. They 
covered him with blankets and told him how much he meant to them. 
They tenderly showed him the pictures from his wallet, of his wife 
and daughters. They tried to give him hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to make it,'' Sanders told them. ``Tell my girls  
I love them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sanders' students will be there again for him --  
mourning him at his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids were a lot of why he did what he did,'' said his nephew  
Rich Jarman. ``He really made it a point to know all of his 
students on a first-name basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 47, was an unassuming guy with an easy smile, a  
teacher-coach who taught old-fashioned values. He urged students to 
look for the best in every situation, to strive to do their best 
and be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would spend time with kids and talk with, stuff like  
that,'' said Adam Oliver, a 17-year-old junior. ``There was little 
that upset him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Oct. 22, 1951, in Eldorado, Ill., Sanders was raised in  
Veedersburg, about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis. In high 
school, the 6-foot-1 Sanders played basketball and baseball and ran 
cross country. He got his college degree from Chadron State in 
Nebraska in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of a former coach, Sanders landed his first -- and  
only -- teaching job at Columbine, where he taught business and 
substituted in the science department. He also coached girls' 
basketball, girls' softball and track for nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned the respect and praise of co-workers and competitors.  
His main asset, they said, was that he lacked an ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't out for glory,'' said Arvada girls' basketball coach  
Joe Poisson. ``His team played really tough defense, and you'd have 
to play your best to win against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudy Martin, who coached with Sanders at Columbine for 22 years,  
said Sanders ``was more concerned with the student athlete and what 
they got out of games than he was with winning and losing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Sanders coached his girls' basketball team through  
its first winning season in several years. Even-tempered as always, 
Sanders sat on the bench for most of what turned out to be his 
final game. ``He was making all the right moves,'' Martin said, but 
the team lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' first love was his family: wife Linda, daughters,  
Angela, Cindy and Coni, and 10 grandchildren. He organized an 
annual reunion and frequent gatherings, which typically included a 
softball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Easter, he hid brightly decorated eggs.  
</P>
<P>
	``He always had a separate egg hunt and things set aside for the  
grandchildren, basically centering the whole day around them,'' 
nephew Jarman said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Mortally wounded, Sanders stumbled into a second-floor classroom  
where Eagle Scourt Aaron Hancey and two dozen other students were 
hiding. They barricaded the door and heard the gunmen running down 
the hall, still firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancey and another student used their T-shirts to try to stop  
the blood gushing from Sanders' chest. In the background, a 
classroom television broadcast the unfolding events. 
</P>
<P>
	They stayed with him for 3 1/2 hours, until about 3 p.m., when SWAT  
team members forced them to evacuate and leave Sanders behind. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time help arrived, Sanders was dead, said Dr. Christopher  
Colwell, who supervised the paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if paramedics had reached Sanders earlier, Colwell said, it  
likely would not have made a difference because of the severity of 
the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of miscommunication, Sanders' family didn't learn with  
certainty for another 24 hours that he had died, Jarman said. 
</P>
<P>
	His family had little doubt about what Sanders would have done  
had he and the gunmen survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably would be the first down there, offering assistance  
to turn their lives around,'' Jarman said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Looks To Be More Aggressive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins coach Pat Burns had a simple  
explanation for the overtime loss that tied his team's playoff 
series with the Carolina Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their forwards skated. Our forwards didn't,'' he said.  
``That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, his forwards get a chance to change that when the  
best-of-7 series resumes in Boston with Game 3. And one forward 
said they must be aggressive from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to match their emotion right from the  
get-go,'' Anson Carter said after the Bruins' light workout Sunday. 
``They took the play to us at the beginning of both games. You can 
attribute some of that to being at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're at home. We've got to take it to them at the  
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Hurricanes' early aggressiveness, they lost the  
opener 2-0 and trailed the second game 2-1 before tying it with 
5:32 left in the third period and winning it on Ray Sheppard's goal 
at 17:05 of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the third period, we didn't open our game up as much as we  
did the night before,'' Carolina coach Paul Maurice said. ``We 
learned something in the first game that you have to continue to 
have that patience and confidence in your game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins could have used more of that in Game 2. When they  
were pressured by the Hurricanes, they sometimes dumped the puck in 
hastily rather than try to make a pass, forward Jason Allison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They came out hard and we kind of panicked,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Having the crowd rooting for the Bruins could change that. The  
Bruins were 22-10-9 at home this season and 17-20-4 on the road. 
Carolina was four games over .500 overall but four games under .500 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	But in their only playoff series last year, against Washington,  
the Bruins were 2-1 on the road but 0-3 at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home ice only means something if you win your games,'' Boston  
defenseman Ray Bourque said. ``If you're going to get anywhere (in 
the playoffs), you've got to be able to win anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins will have one undeniable advantage tonight. The coach  
of the home team gets to make the last line change so he can match 
up players to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot has to do with mixing and matching lines,'' forward  
Shawn Bates said. ``If we throw out our fourth line (on the road), 
they can throw out their first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's advantage in matchups could make things easier for  
Byron Dafoe, who led the NHL with 10 regular-season shutouts. He 
added another in the playoff opener, then gave up three goals in 
Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure he was rattled,'' Maurice said, ``but when you  
have speed and are driving the net it is hard for a goaltender to 
get comfortable. When in doubt, put it at the net and I think it 
helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Steve Chiasson took a slap shot that Dafoe stopped  
but couldn't control. Martin Gelinas then shot the puck off the 
left post. It went to Sheppard, who got his second goal of the game 
for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Overtime, ``is a lot more pressure, but it's fun,'' Dafoe said.  
``Obviously, if you can win it in regulation, I'll take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Bruins did gain a split on the road and can win the  
series if they win their three remaining home games. 
</P>
<P>
	And Burns can't be too upset with that.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we'd come back with a two-game sweep, I would have been  
doing handstands,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Supports Yugoslavia Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a summit-ending show of solidarity, NATO  
leaders promised military protection and economic aid to 
Yugoslavia's neighbors for standing with the West against Slobodan 
Milosevic. ``If Mr. Milosevic threatens them for helping us, we 
will respond,'' President Clinton promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Before winding up the three-day meeting with his allies in the  
military operation against the Serbs in Yugoslavia, Clinton 
telephoned Boris Yeltsin on Sunday and urged the Russian leader to 
press Milosevic to accept a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	On the central issue of forcing Milosevic's forces to withdraw  
from Kosovo and allow hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian 
refugees back to their homes, Clinton said, ``The alliance leaves 
Washington more united even than it was when we came here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 NATO leaders agreed in their 50th anniversary summit to  
move toward an oil embargo to hinder Milosevic despite Russian 
objections and French misgivings over forcibly searching ships at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said the allies agreed it was  
important to cut down the supply of fuel going to Yugoslavia's 
``war machine.'' He said the NATO leaders expected recommendations 
from their military officials ``in a very short period of time'' on 
the exact steps that might be taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO leaders agreed to intensify air attacks against  
Yugoslavia. But there was no agreement -- and scant public 
discussion -- of the possibility of introducing ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Russia -- one of NATO's nonmember ``partners'' -- Prime  
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said, ``We will have to pay more 
attention to defense'' if a ground war is launched. He also 
suggested there would be a review of Russian relations with the 
NATO nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the world one day would see as historic a summit  
during which the leaders agreed to expand NATO's shield. ``We have 
reaffirmed our readiness ... to address regional and ethnic 
conflicts beyond the territory of NATO members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their final acts, NATO's leaders sat down with the  
representatives of the ``frontline states'' -- Yugoslavia's seven 
neighbors, all feeling the fallout from the combat in Kosovo -- and 
promised to stand by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The nations of the region have risked, and even faced, armed  
confrontation with Serbia by facilitating and supporting our 
campaign to end the bloodshed in Kosovo,'' Clinton said 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac, a sometimes reluctant ally,  
took the opportunity to issue his own warning to Milosevic, telling 
him not to use force against Montenegro, which along Serbia 
constitutes Yugoslavia. Chirac said Milosevic ``must know he will 
suffer all the consequences of using force in this small 
republic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albania and Macedonia have been particularly hard hit, taking in  
nearly 500,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees fleeing from Yugoslav 
military action. The other neighboring countries are Bosnia, 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need help and we are giving it to them,'' NATO spokesman  
Jamie Shea said. ``We will not tolerate threats against them or 
attacks on them by Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up the three-day meeting, NATO Secretary-General Javier  
Solana said, ``The most important message that you are going to get 
from this summit is the determination of all the allies and all the 
partners to reverse the situation in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The refugees are going to be back in their place, in their  
country, and ethnic cleansing will not be victorious in our 
continent as we approach the 21st century,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Yeltsin talked for nearly an hour by phone. Russia  
has expressed outrage about NATO's airstrikes in Yugoslavia and has 
threatened to ignore a Western oil embargo. Yeltsin briefed Clinton 
on former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's mediation efforts in 
Belgrade, which NATO officials say have failed to produce results 
warranting a halt to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was leaving for a  
meeting in Moscow with Russian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton believes Russia is very serious about trying to resolve  
the Kosovo crisis, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said. 
Clinton urged Yeltsin to continue peacemaking efforts and said the 
two leaders would stay in touch. They did not discuss NATO's 
threatened blockade of oil shipments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said Russia would not be exempt from the embargo.  
``Obviously, any regime that we establish has to apply to 
everybody,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I would expect 
that the Russians would comply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19 allies met in a summit finale with leaders of two dozen  
other Central and Eastern European countries that have banded in 
partnership with the alliance. Russia stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Anxious about inflaming tensions with Moscow further, the allies  
said they were trying to avoid a confrontation at sea over 
blockading oil supplies to Serbia. The summit authorized NATO 
military commanders to draw up plans to inspect ships suspected of 
carrying oil to Milosevic. Russia and Libya are Yugoslavia's main 
oil suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign ministers of the European Union will gather Monday in  
Luxembourg to ratify their oil embargo against Yugoslavia. Alastair 
Campbell, spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, played 
down the risk of confrontation if a Russian tanker refuses to abide 
by the embargo. ``The Russians have been helpful in this conflict 
and we are confident they will continue to be helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting here to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, summit  
leaders sent a message of unity and resolve demanding that 
Milosevic to back down. Over and over, Clinton and other Western 
leaders pledged that NATO would prevail, putting the alliance's 
prestige at stake. ``A just end to the conflict is essential to 
putting the entire region on the path to stability,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit concluded on day 33 of NATO airstrikes. The allies  
attacked south of the Yugoslav capital, bombing a communication 
tower at Mt. Avala, 10 miles south of Belgrade, and striking Mt. 
Gucevo, 60 miles southwest of Belgrade, where another radio and TV 
tower is located.

<HEADLINE> China 2, U.S. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Zhang Ouying's goal in the third  
minute of overtime lifted China to a 2-1 victory over the U.S. in 
an international soccer match played at Giants Stadium today. 
</P>
<P>
	The result snapped a 50-game U.S. domestic unbeaten streak and  
gave the U.S. a 1-2 record in recent matches against China as both 
teams prepare for the Women's World Cup which will begin June 19 in 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. is now 8-3-1 in matches this year. China was playing  
the last match in a seven-week international trip. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning goal came on a counter attack when midfielder Bai  
Jie played a long ball to Zhang, who had come on as a substitute in 
the 82nd minute. Zhang carried the ball before putting a low shot 
past U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	China's first goal came in the 14th minute when U.S. defender  
Carla Overbeck misplayed a long pass from Liu Ailing leaving Sun 
Wen all alone of the left flank. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun carried the ball into the box and hit a crisp left-footed  
chip over Scurry just under the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tied it at 1-1 when Cindy Parlow passed it to Julie  
Foudy, who dribbled past a defender and chipped a short shot over 
the head of Chinese goalie Gao Hong. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S., which last lost a home match to Norway in February of  
1996 in Jacksonville, Fl., faces Japan on April 29 at Ericsson 
Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. in its next match.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T To Take Japan Telecom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and British  
Telecommunications PLC have agreed to take a combined 30 percent 
stake in Japan Telecom Co. worth $1.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and BT will each hold a 15 percent stake in  
Japan Telecom, the companies said in a statement on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are planning a broad alliance in which AT&AMP;T and  
BT will integrate most of their Japanese operations with Japan 
Telecom's units. In addition, the two companies will dispatch 
executives to the Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported that BT is paying $1 billion and  
its Japanese assets, worth $257 million, will be folded into Japan 
Telecom. AT&AMP;T is reportedly paying $209 million in cash and 
contributing assets worth $435 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A holding company will be established in which BT will have a 20  
percent interest and AT&AMP;T 10 percent. The stake will be jointly 
managed by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom had reportedly been looking for a partner to  
survive tough competition, with many Japanese telecom companies 
cutting rates for domestic and international calls. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first joint investment by AT&AMP;T and BT since the two  
companies announced plans last summer their intention to form a 
global venture to serve international business customers and 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan has one of the largest concentrations of multinational  
companies in the world,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and 
chief executive of AT&AMP;T. ``It's an essential growth opportunity for 
all three companies and it is essential that the global venture 
have a strong distributor in this key market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom is Japan's third-largest long-distance and  
international carrier, serving more than 17 million customers. It 
also has stakes in digital mobile companies that serve 6 million 
customers. Its biggest shareholder is East Japan Railway Co. being 
the biggest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long-distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while BT is Britain's biggest telecom company. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance is the latest in a wave of recent telecom deals.  
Last week, Deutsche Telekom AG and Telecom Italia SpA announced 
plans to merge in an $82 billion deal, while AT&AMP;T launched a 
surprise $58 billion bid for cable company MediaOne Group.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ivan McKinley scored two first-half goals as  
the New England Revolution edged D.C. United 3-2 on Saturday night, 
halting a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Giovanni Savarese had a goal and an assist for New England  
(2-3), which beat the United for the fourth time in 11 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter and A.J. Wood scored for D.C. (3-2), which lost its  
second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. played without goalkeeper Tom Presthus, who was been  
sidelined with a virus that has caused him to lose 15 pounds. 
Presthus' replacement, Mark Simpson, was undone by poor defensive 
play that led to a 3-1 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Rich Grady issued seven yellow cards, four to New  
England, and the United played the final 14 minutes a man down 
after Carlos Llamosa was ejected for tackling New England's Johnny 
Torres from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter gave D.C. a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute, taking a lead  
pass from Marco Etcheverry at the top of the penalty area. Lassiter 
evaded a tackle at the top of the crease and forced Revolution 
goalie Walter Zegna down before sliding the ball into an empty net 
for his team-high fifth goal 
</P>
<P>
	New England tied the game five minutes later on McKinley's first  
goal, which began a barrage that saw the Revolution convert three 
consecutive shots in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley knotted the score from the left side of the penalty  
area, where he got a step on defender Eddie Pope and looped a long 
shot past Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive miscue by Pope led to Savarese's goal in the  
37th minute. Pope didn't stay close enough to Savarese on a run 
down the middle and Savarese was able to punch the ball past 
Simpson despite falling flat on his back 15 feet in front of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley made it 3-1 in the 45th minute. Moving through the far  
left side of the penalty area, he knocked a header off Brian 
Dunseth's free kick from just inside the midfield line. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood notched his first goal of the season in the 87th minute.

(2-3), which beat the United for the fourth time in 11 matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Lassiter and A.J. Wood scored for D.C. (3-2), which lost its  
second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. played without goalkeeper Tom Presthus, who was been  
sidelined with a virus that has caused him to lose 15 pounds. 
Presthus' replacement, Mark Simpson, was undone by poor defensive 
play that led to a 3-1 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Rich Grady issued seven yellow cards, four to New  
England, and the United played the final 14 minutes a man down 
after Carlos Llamosa was ejected for tackling New England's Johnny 
Torres from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter gave D.C. a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute, taking a lead  
pass from Marco Etcheverry at the top of the penalty area. Lassiter 
evaded a tackle at the top of the crease and forced Revolution 
goalie Walter Zegna down before sliding the ball into an empty net 
for his team-high fifth goal 
</P>
<P>
	New England tied the game five minutes later on McKinley's first  
goal, which began a barrage that saw the Revolution convert three 
consecutive shots in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley knotted the score from the left side of the penalty  
area, where he got a step on defender Eddie Pope and looped a long 
shot past Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive miscue by Pope led to Savarese's goal in the  
37th minute. Pope didn't stay close enough to Savarese on a run 
down the middle and Savarese was able to punch the ball past 
Simpson despite falling flat on his back 15 feet in front of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley made it 3-1 in the 45th minute. Moving through the far  
left side of the penalty area, he knocked a header off Brian 
Dunseth's free kick from just inside the midfield line. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood notched his first goal of the season in the 87th minute.

<HEADLINE> 70,000 Mourn Columbine Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Thirteen white doves fluttered into the  
slate gray sky Sunday, over the heads of 70,000 people who filled a 
parking lot to mourn the 12 students and one teacher massacred at 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Families, friends and strangers clung to each other during a  
75-minute memorial service. They clutched flowers, blue and silver 
balloons and Bibles as they wept and wondered why it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,''  
Vice President Al Gore told the overflow crowd a few blocks from 
where two teen-agers went on a rampage and then killed themselves 
Tuesday. ``More than ever, I realize every one of us is responsible 
for all of the children. 
</P>
<P>
	``No society can be perfect, but we know the way things should  
be,'' Gore said, his voice thundering like a preacher's. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gov. Bill Owens read the name of each of the 13 victims, a  
dove was released. The symbol of peace had a special meaning: 
Columbine, Colorado's state flower, derives from a Latin word 
meaning ``like a dove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God grant them eternal peace,'' Owens said of the victims.  
</P>
<P>
	Mourners -- twice as many as had been expected -- stood in rapt  
attention as Gore described how children must be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	He never mentioned by name the two classmates, seniors Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold, who went on the rampage and tried to blow 
up the high school apparently because they felt like rejected 
misfits. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have found a diary plotting the mayhem in precise  
detail for more than a year, as well as bomb-making materials and 
weapons in one of the pair's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must have the courage not to look away from those who feel  
despised and rejected,'' Gore said. ``If you are a parent, they 
need your attention. If you are a grandparent, they need your 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and retired Gen. Colin Powell led an array of dignitaries  
on the makeshift stage in the movie theater parking lot. Afterward, 
they walked slowly to nearby Clement Park to place more flowers at 
an impromptu memorial that has been growing daily since the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss, 18, who was grazed by a bullet and injured while  
helping teachers and students hide in a closet and overhead air 
ducts, limped in the processional behind Gore and Owens. He was 
supported by Columbine High School Principal Frank DeAngelis, and 
mourners applauded as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``God Bless you guys!'' a man shouted. ``You've got a reason to  
live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service was punctuated by songs performed by a variety of  
Christian entertainers, including Amy Grant, and student musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1:30 p.m., brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen opened the  
service with a simple ``Hi,'' and sang a song they wrote in tribute 
to the massacre's victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Cohen, a junior at Columbine, was trapped in the choir  
room when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria 
where many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious  
ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain 
will take our pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput of Denver opened the  
services with a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surely the past week is about as much suffering as any  
community can bear,'' Chaput said. ``Love is stronger than death. I 
believe that. Perhaps beyond all this suffering, something good can 
be achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other dignitaries included U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard and most of  
the state's congressional delegation, and state officials, and the 
Rev. Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of an unimaginable evil, this community has drawn  
closer,'' the governor said. ``The community has found in itself a 
tremendous healing power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners of all ages began arriving four hours before the  
service. For some, it was the second or third vigil they had 
attended since Tuesday's rampage. Many were Columbine High School 
alumni. One student painted a heart over his face in Columbine 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Four F-16 fighter jets from the Colorado National Guard zoomed  
overhead, led by Columbine graduate Capt. Scott VanBek. A private 
plane trailed a banner overhead reading: ``Our love and prayers are 
with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The growing crowd was a swarm of dark winter parkas splotched  
with bright floral bouquets. Florists donated 25,000 bouquets of 
white and orange lilies, yellow sunflowers and daisies, pink 
carnations and roses of all hues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could do more,'' said Margaret Stark, 19, who  
graduated from high school in nearby Aurora last year. ``You can 
only give so many flowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for  
the day, concentrating instead on directing traffic for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a  
church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a cross country runner who had recently returned from a  
two-week trip to Paris with the French club. She was an aspiring 
songwriter and author who was eager to get her driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong  
to neighboring churches of the same Catholic archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, life in Littleton is returning to normal, even as  
memorials and investigations continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday at Chatfield High School, 
a few miles south. They said Columbine's graduation ceremony will 
be held May 22 at Fiddler's Green, a large suburban amphitheater 
normally used for rock concerts and dance performances.

<HEADLINE> Some Bills Just Won't Be Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They are legislative perennials: the attempts  
to curb taxes, outlaw abortions, punish China, make English as the 
nation's official language. 
</P>
<P>
	All these causes have fervent backers, but not enough to make  
them law or amend them into the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, symbolically on the April 15 deadline for  
Americans to file their income tax returns, the House debated a 
proposed constitutional amendment to require a two-thirds majority 
to raise taxes. The proposal had no chance of approval, but the 
debate gave Republicans the chance to affirm their position as the 
anti-tax party. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, persistence pays off.  
</P>
<P>
	For 19 years, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., spoke at every  
Senate session -- more than 3,000 in all -- urging his colleagues to 
ratify a treaty outlawing genocide. Finally, on Feb. 11, 1986, the 
Senate voted with him. 
</P>
<P>
	More often, the perennials come up, are debated, and fall short.  
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees now are hard at work on a proposed  
constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag. This issue 
commands much time and attention every year, then falls a few votes 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress considers dozens of bills that either are tantalizingly  
close to passage or, more often, lost causes given temporary 
reprieves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you try, try again, it is for a noble effort,'' House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who failed again to require 
two-thirds majorities to approve new taxes. It fell 57 votes short 
of passage this year, slightly worse than in the three previous 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is politics,'' said opponent Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C.,  
who asked ``the statistical probability that a single measure which 
has failed in the House consistently'' for four straight years 
would show up again on tax-filing day. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the odds are not that bad.  
</P>
<P>
	Every June since China's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown  
Congress has held a heated debate on clamping trade restrictions on 
China before. And every time, lawmakers pretty much stick with the 
status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	In other annual rituals, Republicans propose bills to kill the  
Legal Services Corp. and AmeriCorps, eliminate the death tax, make 
English the official language and repeal the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act 
guaranteeing high wages for federal construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, in the minority since 1995 with even less chance of  
getting bills through, try to raise the minimum wage, expand gun 
control and limit campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the extreme difficulty of getting constitutional  
amendments through Congress, intrepid lawmakers continue to bring 
forth legislation to ban abortion, allow voluntary prayers in 
schools and, even in this age of surpluses, require balanced 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some keep trying because they are so close.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're within striking distance,'' Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,  
said about the flag-desecration amendment that twice has passed the 
House and was only four votes short in the Senate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't make sense to keep bringing up measures when you  
are not building momentum, but when you are that close you keep 
trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., an opponent, had a different  
perspective: ``If it's spring, it's time to make everybody get up 
to salute the flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are likely to try for the fifth consecutive  
year to ban the late-term abortion procedure known as ``partial 
birth'' abortion. Last year the House succeeded in overriding 
President Clinton's veto of the legislation, and the Senate came 
within three votes of an override. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the unsuccessful bid for congressional action  
gets results. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., has tried for years to kill the space  
station program. Roemer says the effort has not been in vain 
because NASA, in response to his criticisms, has instituted reforms 
saving billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continue to try to do what is right despite the odds,''  
Roemer said. This year too, he promised, ``I'll be out there again 
tilting at windmills.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Dies After Being Hit by Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOMSON, Ga. (AP) -- A teen-ager died when a baseball hit him in  
the chest as he tried to steal a base during a recreation league 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam McCorkle, 14, died Friday night of a bruised heart,  
McDuffie County Coroner Robert Aldred said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCorkle was pronounced dead at McDuffie County Hospital and his  
body was sent to the state crime lab in Atlanta for an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said McCorkle was on second base when he was given a  
sign to steal third. The catcher's throw hit him the chest as he 
slid into the base. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to stand up, but wobbled and was told to lie back down,  
said Donald Cap, the league's tournament director. Seconds later, 
he stopped breathing and two women attempted CPR. Two ambulances 
arrived and emergency medical technicians tried unsuccessfully to 
revive him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just in shock that he died,'' said Dillie Hollimon,  
whose business sponsors McCorkle's team. ``He was a good kid, 
well-mannered, polite, friendly, courteous. You couldn't ask for a 
nicer kid.''

<HEADLINE> Bacteria, Viruses Lurk in Washer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- More news from the guy who warned about  
dangerous germs lurking in your kitchen sponges and dishrags and 
the muck in your office coffee cup: Your washing machine may not be 
as safe as you think either. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmental microbiologist Charles Gerba spends most of his  
time researching water quality. But he also enjoys hanging around 
in other people's homes, mostly in their bathrooms and kitchens -- 
professionally, of course -- searching for environmental hazards. 
And boy, has he found them in abundance. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Gerba, a microbiology professor in the University  
of Arizona's soil, water and environmental sciences department, 
warned that bacteria such as E-coli and salmonella can be rampant 
in kitchen sinks, on counters and on cutting boards, often spread 
by sponges and dishrags contaminated by meat or poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Or as he puts it, ``There are a hundred times more bacteria on a  
cutting board than a toilet seat, so lick a toilet seat rather than 
a cutting board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's found similar dangers in the home laundry.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hadn't been studied in the home very much,'' Gerba says.  
Most laundry studies for the presence of pathogens -- 
disease-causing microorganisms -- have been done in hospitals, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	His most recent study, of 50 homes in Tucson and 50 others in  
the Tampa Bay, Fla., area, has found that coliform bacteria, an 
indicator of unsanitary conditions, including the presence of 
diarrhea-causing E-coli, abound in many washing machines. Some 
linger even a load after you've washed your underwear, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``They originate in feces, and we found that 60 percent of the  
washing machines had coliform bacteria. We just went in and swabbed 
your washing machine,'' Gerba said. ``And about 10 percent had 
E-coli in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next, Gerba and his researchers found that 40 percent of sterile  
cloths washed in non-bleach laundry contained fecal bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that when you did clothes with underwear in it, it  
contaminated all the laundry. In fact, there was enough left over 
to contaminate the next wash load,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacteria such as salmonella, which causes food poisoning, and  
viruses including hepatitis A and those most commonly causing 
childhood diarrhea, rotavirus and adenovirus, also were targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	While E-coli was killed in the permanent press drying cycle,  
some salmonella survived on clothes that registered 131 degrees 
Fahrenheit. So did hepatitis A, adenovirus and some rotavirus. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Gerba painting too foul a picture?  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think it's the problem Mr. Gerba does,'' said Linda  
Eggerss, a spokeswoman for the Maytag Corp. of Newton, Iowa, which 
makes washers and dryers. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we might consider it a bit alarmist, because  
there are so many things so much more dangerous about bacteria 
around us. We think that washers and dryers are very, very safe and 
very, very clean, and if you're using bleach, you can't get much 
cleaner than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Procter &AMP; Gamble announced a reformulated version  
of Tide, its top-selling laundry soap, as a sanitizing detergent 
with bleach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked to meet the criteria of the EPA to say that it could  
sanitize laundry,'' spokeswoman Molly Humbert said in Cincinnati. 
``We've heard that consumers are already concerned about bacteria 
in the laundry. We have data that shows that bacteria can survive 
the current washing process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key problem is how people launder their clothes today. Most  
use cold water, or at most, warm. In fact, industry experts suggest 
that only 5 percent of Americans still use hot water any more for 
their laundry. 
</P>
<P>
	And use of bleach is much less routine today than a generation  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A national study commissioned for the Oakland, Calif.-based  
Clorox Co., which makes bleach and financed Gerba's laundry study, 
shows that only 15 percent of all washloads -- though half of those 
with whites -- use bleach, spokeswoman Sandy Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, wash cycles now average about 12 minutes, and dryer  
cycles average only 28 minutes, Gerba said. That means that some 
harmful bacteria, and especially viruses, are able to survive the 
rigors of normal washing and drying. And under the proper 
conditions, they regrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingesting from 100 to 1,000 pathogenic bacteria can infect  
someone; it takes only one to 10 viruses to accomplish the same 
job, Gerba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the contamination, and greatest risk, occurs when a  
person gets bacteria on his hands in transferring the wet laundry 
to the dryer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If laundry facilities are next to the kitchen, there's a good  
chance that after putting washed laundry in the dryer, the person 
will prepare food or bring his fingers to nose or mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``You contaminate yourself and get the illness from those  
organisms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerba will present his findings in June at the American Society  
for Microbiology's annual meeting in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his team usually approaches a major industry player to  
finance home health hazard studies and accepts criticism for his 
reliance upon such companies to provide grants. Realistically, he 
added, the federal government can't be expected to finance such 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings are published in peer-review journals -- he's  
written more than 400 papers -- and he's highly regarded within the 
scientific community, and Gerba said it's important to have studies 
repeated by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Clorox's Sullivan said there's an easy solution to the laundry  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of your wash, run an empty cycle and put bleach in.  
You don't even need hot water. It's much like you disinfect your 
countertops,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Gerba calls it, ``kind of giving your machine a mouthwash  
at the end.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA Agree on One Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Finding a rare point of agreement, the Clinton  
administration and the National Rifle Association both would 
prohibit juveniles who commit violent crimes from ever owning a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, they have major differences on how to prevent a  
recurrence of last week's school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
President Clinton is backing several gun control measures while the 
NRA says the answer is to more strenuously prosecute those who 
violate existing laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA and other pro-gun organizations need to support the  
administration's efforts ... to put reasonable regulations on the 
use and the possession of guns,'' said Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder, Justice's No. 2 official. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those initiatives, he said, are extending the Brady Law,  
which requires background checks for gun buyers, to bar juveniles 
who have committed violent crimes from owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' he also said there is a  
``need to deal with adults who make guns available to kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in his Saturday radio address, said he would  
push for legislation that would crack down on gun shows and illegal 
gun trafficking, prohibit violent juveniles from buying guns and 
close loopholes that let juveniles own assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, as with  
similar school killings in the past, have spurred the demand for 
tougher gun-control laws. Dozens of gun-control bills are now 
pending in Congress, including a trigger lock bill actively 
supported by the administration, but the Republican majority has 
been reluctant to impose new restrictions on gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, also appearing on  
CBS, said the best approach was to fully prosecute people, 
including juveniles, who break existing gun laws. ``When you let 
bad people go home they do bad things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre agreed that ``violent juveniles that commit violent  
crimes with guns should forever be prohibited from owning a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But officials first need to get serious about prosecuting and  
expelling kids who show up at schools with guns, he said. Of 6,000 
such incidents in the past two years, there have been only 13 
prosecutions, LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NRA support for state laws allowing people with permits  
to carry concealed weapons was ``simply off the point'' from the 
school shootings. People who apply for permits are not the type to 
commit crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Littleton case, Colorado Gov. Bill Owens repeated Sunday  
that adults who supplied the weapons to the two suspects or knew 
they had guns could be charged as accomplices, but Justice 
Department officials urged caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' would  
say only that it was important to identify those responsible for 
the student suspects having guns and what the parents knew before 
taking ``appropriate steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holder added that the charging adults because they ``should have  
known'' that children had guns was a ``dangerous thing.''
